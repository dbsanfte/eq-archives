<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Howee_C</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok. I've been gone for over a year. Decided to renew for a month to see what's up.<br />
<br />
New maze of a bazaar. Interesting.  Bit of a PITA but I might get used to it.<br />
<br />
Anyway. Took off to Crypt of Nadox to poke around a bit.  Get buffed up, then go to Canni down and nada. Zip.  Nuttin'.  The spell WILL NOT go off.  !@#$ me.  I try Cann III. Same thing.  Zone out, can cast Cann IV 'til the cows come home.  Zone back into Nadox - nada.  Log out, log back in.  Nada.<br />
<br />
***?<br />
<br />
Is this a glitch or did SOE do something as stupid as disable cannibalize in a zone? (not that I'd put it past them)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not specifically with Crypt of Nadox.  I have had that exact thing happen in PoI, Nadox, and Natimbi.  It only affects the canni spells.  Canni AA still works and all other spells work just fine.<br />
<br />
I haven't been able to figure out the cause but it does come and go randomly.  Re-entering the zone sometimes helps and sometimes doesn't.<br />
<br />
I beleive it's a problem on Sony's end since a couple of times it has happened to me it also affected another shaman who was with me in the same zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Happens to me with FD AA, and spell. It was broke in NC for a damn month. Happened tonite in Natimib. I have had it happen in numerous zones. Sometimes my best dot, Dark Nightmare won't cast. That is an easy fix, change spell slots, but when an activated AA that also has a spell, like deathpeace for me, Canni for you. It will sometimes not work regardless of rezone, camp, log out, anything. I /bug it, send a feedback, then cuss in various chat channels.<br />
<br />
It has also happened with activated AA w/ no spell twin, such as suspend minion, replenish minion, pet hold, etc. Tonite when it happened it Natimbi, the chanter in group AA was messed up, and Nec couldn't cast DN either. He has not got FD AA, but his actual spell deathpeace worked fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The same thing happens in Qvic on a frequen basis... It is very annoying and as far as i know it is the zones lag issues.. It's been a while since i have been to nadox, so i have not experienced it first hand there, however i do know what you are talking about.</div></div><hr />
