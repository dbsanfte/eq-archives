<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What I am really curious about, is what GoD has to offer in content beyond the current high dps, furiously quick paced and unstable environment. <br />
<br />
Will there only be more of the same, but strung even tighter, creating even more disparity between wanted and un-wanted group members.<br />
<br />
Or were all these insane trials just a bottle-neck to separate players (separating between what I don't know, as obviously you do not need much more than a competent chanter and a cleric to finish most of it), and the content on the horizon will show a totally different approach where other classes come into their forte? <br />
<br />
My guess is on much of the same as we've seen so far, but scaled up to a raid environment. <br />
<br />
&quot;What, we don't have X of class Y online. Ok guys, back to PoP to exp for tonight. Be online tomorrow!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So far, everying in GoD really seems to be about short fights against mobs with massive DPS.  <br />
<br />
Sony, to their credit, did a good job in the trials of making different classes useful at different times (not us of course -- classes that matter I mean).  <br />
<br />
For example, rogues can make trial 3 easier and mages can make trial 2 easier.  Enchanters make everything easier (except when they kill you by accident) and even paladins are getting a workout with their rezzing.  Even rangers are using weaponshield alot more (in vxed -- why tank the mob when you can kill it in 15 seconds without having to heal anyone at all?) and in the mountain trials rangers can go back to being pullers (because harmony works outdoors).  Any class that can track, even bards, is suddenly very desirable as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line, though -- there doesnt seem to be a change on the horizon in terms of encounter style.  I'm seeing (both at the raid and the grouping level) speed, speed, speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought it looked like GoD was simply put out there to give the Time and EP guilds something else to do so they wouldn't cancel their subscriptions.  I don't think SoE sees the need for anything past that.</div></div><hr />
