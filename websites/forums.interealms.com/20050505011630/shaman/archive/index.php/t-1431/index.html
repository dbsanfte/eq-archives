<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering about the higher end game with Shaman.  I know we are a must have at most raids.  But how about if you are raiding SSra, THO, Burrower, NToV, AoW, Tormax, etc with say 40 to 50 people.  There are 3 other level 60 Shaman and you a 4th 60 shaman how useful are we?  I know our secondary jobs are keeping clerics and others in group and in our general area alive.  No, I haven't played a Shaman at level 60 yet and haven' done high end raids as one.  Although my retired monk has already done everything I listed.  <br />
<br />
Figuring we also sit back and JBB the mobs as well.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is interesting, we're actually having a bit of guild trauma at the moment over shaman recruitment.  We currently have 7 shaman and the shaman are like, &quot;enough!&quot;  A good friend of many guildmates is applying for membership, so there is some definite friction.<br />
<br />
Although I think that torpor is an amazingly powerful healing tool (especially for casters/priests) and shaman are amazing for generating mana for long fights via mod rod production, I agree with my fellow shaman guildmates that 4 is a pretty good number for a typical raid.<br />
<br />
I'm really interested in hearing other shaman thoughts on this matter since it's a current guild issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree. You definately don't want to be the only Shaman on a raid but being 1 of 7 would be boring as heck. Depends on how much they all play I guess. We have 5 I think and that seems to be a decent number. I don't think all 5 have ever shown up for a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">7 shaman? wowza.  I rarely see more then 2-3 shaman on raids I go on, which seems to be a decent number.  Get a fair amount of tells for things, and kept fairly busy.<br />
<br />
If we had 7 shamans on raid, I can guarantee we wouldn't be recruiting more though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have 4 Shamans in my guild, including myself. 3 are 60, 1 is almost 60. I think thats a pretty good number of shamans, we have Shamans set at a low priority with the 4 we got. Most of the time we have 2 Shaman at a raid, which works well, when we get 3 or 4, its still a benifit for back up healing and just getting X mob slowed as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine 7 Shaman on a raid, but we still can do alot, even with a bunch of us. Backup healing forsure with AE mobs and such. I would imagine a guild would close recruiting to Shamans at 7, just seems alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The problem is that there STILL isn't enough high end content.  Stuff pops and is dead within hours, sometimes minutes!  <br />
Which leaves a lot of time to be sitting around wishing you had something to do as a guild.  Quite the bore I tell ya.  <br />
<br />
Then again my guild is very understocked on VP keys.  That would give us something to do I think.  I quested mine a while back, and now I have no guild to go with! waaaaaaaaaa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Seems to be for the most part, I think it's just a matter of what guild has what for classes. My guild is severely lacking enchanters, friendly guild is severely lacking shamans. Together I've always got something to do hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guild is pretty casual, we have 5 active post 50 shaman with a couple more who play on spurts.  We also regularly raid with 2-3 other shaman who are not in the guild, but who are decent guys and have friends among us.  Still, we only get 2-3 shaman, sometimes 4 on any given raid as many of us wil be exping, or doing something offline.  No one has to show up for a raid unless you signed yourself up for it.  I kinda like it this way.<br />
<br />
I always find a role in HoT although primarly I heal AE damage and support buff with 4 shamans there and me being the lowest level among them.</div></div><hr />

7 Shaman present at a raid?!?! ack! Were they all Level 60?<br />
<br />
7 Shaman on a raid is going to cause 4 of the Shaman to be /yawning most of the time.<br />
<br />
2 Level 60 Shaman will be good for any encounter that I have participated in so far, 3 level 60's is great (allows a shaman to take a break and have a back up), anything more is probably overkill, unless the 4th is willing to be the buff vendor for the raids.</div></div><hr />

BUT... heh... try to motivate your guildies to get their keys.... nearly impossible!<br />

Well, actually, we haven't had all 7 show up at the same time yet.  However, yesterday in NToV we had six until one of them left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Being the only shaman on a decent sized raid is very painful.<br />
<br />
I love having 4 shamans around, although my opinion is biased since I am normally the highest level shaman there.  Being the 3rd 4th shaman probably gets a little boring, but it sure makes a raid run smoothly.  Speaking from the raid leader point of view, nothing is worse than waiting on people to buff up.  At the same time, nothing is better than seeing someone who recently died be buffed and ready to go within seconds of being ressed.  <br />
<br />
3 is the magic number i think, and sometimes 4 if you have a huge raid force, but 6 and 7 is a little overboard.  Adding another is really pushing it, especially when you have to consider looting issues, ect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I went from a guild in which I was the only non-bot main 60 shaman to one where we have like seven 60 shamans, and although I miss being central a bit, it's also kind of cool in its way.<br />
<br />
I'm under much less pressure while I'm at a raid, and I don't have to go to every raid now, either.  Very nice!<br />
<br />
However, there's a huge line of shamans for any shaman loot that drops, which there isn't all that much of anyway.  That's okay though; the guild I'm in now kills more stuff faster, so it evens out, or is even better.<br />
<br />
Generally, I like having plenty of shamans.  In a guild with way too few shamans, I get to be central and always doing stuff, and am appreciated.  In a guild with plenty of shamans, I know I won't get killed as much slowing, and that on a raid we have a LOT of healing power.  We frequently have four or more shamans on raids, and that's a lotta torpor going 'round.  So I like it either way, really.<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, though, sometimes everybody takes the same day off, and then I'm the only shaman online.  It can never hurt to have extras of vital characters.  They may seem extra one day, but the next day you'll be wishing you had them.</div></div><hr />
