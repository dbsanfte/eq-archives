<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krikaloo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Basically, I'm looking for a dark-blue solo spot where I can sic dogdog on a monster, dot it once or twice, and not have a lot of stress.  It doesn't need to be high-yield xp (such as a POP solo zone), but it needs to be a step above Chardok (which is still 1/2 light blue to me).  I have horse, no jbb, no epic.  Any recommendations for a slow-but-steady solo spot where I won't run into tons of competition?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I believe Katta would be a small improvement over Chardok but I could be wrong.  I usually group in PoP (it blows solo xp away) but when I feel like having some quiet time, I catch a port to Twilight Sea, run to Katta and either solo the zone in or solo the bank.</div></div><hr />

veskar has been nice.  the goblins are all DB at 58, and the undead should be DB thru 60-ish or so.  undead are easy to slow, and their cold/fire resist are low, but PR (bane) is rather high.  only landed once in about 20 tries, even after malosini<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wiggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I fight shrooms in Fungus Grove when I need something other than PoP, never anybody there and pretty easy to handle even when you pull multiples.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nadox has been good to me, try to get a spot in the lava Bridge room, on east side of bridge, to your right as you face the bridge is a spot that has no spawn, and nothing wanders into aggro range of it. just Pull a Troll to here, Dot, put your dog on and sit back and watch. AA xp is 1% per troll, at 59 I am getting 1% reg every 3 Trolls or so. Loot is not bad, 3 to 6pp each, some Gems, Fine Steel class weapons (4 to 5pp). Best of all, the Trolls in Nadox do not run away, so no need to root/snare (some of the shaman mobs in other spots will Gate though)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The dandolak's run in dulak is a good spot for that level from my experience. If ya learn the boat you'll discover theres a spot near the gangplank where ya can sit and med and get no agro if ya wanna go afk for a few or just slow down and catch your breath. Ya can invis and ignore all the dock lb mobs and set up and buff up and even camp out ehre if ya want to, I did for 2-3 weeks straight. Made about 20kpp while leveling my ranger/shammy 2 levels each, not great loot but better than I'm used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In addition while killing mobs in veksar they drop Steel XX'XXX weapons.  There are about 6 types I believe.  If you turn four of the same named weapon into the Iskar just West of the Entrance to Veksar in Loio you will get a bit of exp, Cash (1-40pp), and positive Faction hits in Cabilist for all but the necro guild.  At 59 I've not seen a light blue yet.  Blood gills at entrance are not bad once slowed.  I back my self in corner so they dont push me around much and just Disease Dot them ( Affliction, Scourge, Plauge)  About the time those disease dots wear off is when those Bloods will drop dead.  The disease dots are slower for the kill but I end up having to use 1 1/2 Poison dots to kill them other wise for alot more mana.  By time I am done with the gob going the disease route I find I am just about full mana.  I even have time to JBB them a bit.</div></div><hr />
