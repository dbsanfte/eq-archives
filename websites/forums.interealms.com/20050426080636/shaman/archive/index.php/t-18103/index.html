Soloing in the planes tier 1 - BoT and PoFire?<br />
<br />
Whats everyone opinions?  Our feign death scary pet weilder with snare and DoTs or our friendly neighborhood root rotter with his faithful puppy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why does it matter who is thought to be better? They both do well in different situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With the high amount of Non-summoning high exp mobs, the necro is the better solo'er for sure. His DPS is higher, he can snare and he can FD, which means close to zero risk.<br />
PoFire is just incredibly trivial for a Necro(It's trivial for a Shaman as well, but he has to stick to non-DD DoT's and can't use a pet, the necro has no such restrictions.<br />
<br />
Hope that answers your questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i use DD dots in fire (pox and sometimes bane of nife).  getting root breaks can suck if it is just the wrong moment.  i guess we could pet kite, it would be something to see though.<br />
gonna have to agree with both giac and shinerbook.<br />
<br />
only other thing to add is that bot is prolly easier for a shaman to solo than a necro (full spells + equal gear lvl).  we tank better and in the CY there isn't a lot of room for a necro to kite /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mortenous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No offense, cause I know you are basically right, but I have been playing EQ long enough to have gotten my fair share of the, &quot;true meaning of roleplaying&quot; comments.  Such as: <br />
<br />
&quot;play what you feel&quot;, <br />
&quot;do what you love&quot;, <br />
&quot;it does not matter who is better&quot;,<br />
and my personal favorite, &quot;its all about the player what a class can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't mean to be sarcastic, because I know that is all very much TRUE, 90%.  The other 10% comes from the fact that classes have their strengths and weakensses just like everything else and that is what I was looking for, within the realm of soloing.  Thank you to all for your responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have developed a necro to 62 and a shaman to 62.  The necro is FAR FAR FAR FAR better at soloing.  I would chain pull ANYTHING in any Tier 1 zone with no mana loss or health loss when the fight was over.<br />

Shaman are very good at soloing - but its much longer per kill.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oh, and you can't punt a shaman like you can a gnome necro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As with all things its situational. Necros are, I would say, better xp soloers than us. Conversely, we can probably handle a wider range of mobs and zones though, and are probably better against the tougher mobs.<br />
<br />
Shaman don't have to worry so much about pathing or summoning issues or rootable/unrootable mobs (EP mobs excepted)<br />
<br />
But necros have greater dps, snare, good continuous mana regen and hp taps, and the ability to FD if things go bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Necros win.  They have a wide range of mobs/areas to solo in, and necros shine at doing it.  <br />
<br />
The only exception, where shaman might be equal to a necro, or maybe surpass them, is soloing that *one big mob* over a long period of time that is not undead, e.g. WW dragons.  Shaman pack a huge punch - it just takes a long time to deliver it.<br />
<br />
Other than those limited situations, however, solo necro &gt; solo shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">most of the time I would say necro unless the mob summons, then probably a shaman.</div></div><hr />

Can a Shaman solo Talendor (sp? the Skyfire Dragon). yes we sure can. Can a necro... he can try... but no, no he can't.<br />
<br />
Can a Shaman Agro kite in PoV efficantly with little risk... no we can't. Can a Necro... yes they can. (ensare is invaluable)<br />
<br />
It's just the tools we have to work with. Necros are awesome and mana efficant. Shaman Dots eat alot of mana really really fast. Don't have Canni 5 yet so i can't say how it goes with it but they are still way more efficant then us. But we can take down the big mobs =) We are rather good at dungeon crawls too =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are minsinformed.<br />
<br />
If anyone has a hard time soloing Talendor(the only Kunark dragon we could probably solo reliably) then it's the Shaman. A Necro can solo all outdoor Kunark dragons and probably Trakanon as well.</div></div><hr />

The second that necro is summoned he will go splat... Maybe the top end necros in elemental and time can do it... but not ur normal necro.<br />

I seriously doubt anyone can solo trak for the pure fact that he'd port u to the fungus...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gobblok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Whats the point on this discussion ??<br />
<br />
Shamans and necro are 2 different types of gameplay like all other soloclasses are too.<br />
<br />
A shaman surly can be as efficent as a necro in making simple AA.<br />
Example: I sometimes solo golems in pov for 5 to 6% each mob. While the necro is running arround, we shamans do the root dot combo. I think both costs about the same time and i doubt a necro has that mana after a kill like i do. If everything works good, i have about 80% mana left and canni 5 up.<br />
<br />
The only thing that makes a necros life easier is FD. Not more, not less.<br />
<br />
In my opinion a wizzi or druid could make a bit more exp due to there ability to quadkite, but i am not sure whats there manapool after a quad, so it could be the same amount.<br />
<br />
And for killing nameds: We shamans have SLOW, wich is the most overpowered spell in the game. We outbalance every single class in our soloability just by slowing mobs wich makes soloing pretty easy for us.<br />
<br />
Anyone ever made his thoughts why many mobs are nearly fully resistant to our disease and poison dots? --- SOE had to change this or make slow much less efficent to balance our class and they chose our dots, because change slowing would change gameplay to much.<br />
<br />
So dont compare on necros or any other class and do what we can do. Slow the mob and laugh about the gimp. ;=)</div></div><hr />

Well said! Though i think 2 things make Necro's life easier. FD and Darkness line (ensare)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Necro going splat ?<br />
<br />
You haven't heard of Mujaki tanking yet, i guess. Their lifetaps actually do damage and heal them at the same time, while a Shaman can't touch a Kunark dragon(except for Talendor, where he can land cold nukes).<br />
<br />
Slow is a 1 in a milion chance.<br />
<br />
Thinking that the Shaman has any advantage or that a Shaman can take an unslowable mob down that a Necro can't, just shows how much people on this board know about other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gobblok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">First off...this thread opened with the question wich is better in making AA and/or normal exp. And there is no big difference in both classes.<br />
<br />
Second, who cares about Kunark Dragon or Mujaki ???<br />
<br />
There are 1 million Mobs in EQ and not just a few named Dragon with crap loot.<br />
<br />
At the point where mobs summon a necro is out of the game. As i said in my post, necro and shaman are two different types of gameplay and thats good !<br />
<br />
So think first, post after my friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The point is that a Necro is NOT out of the game when mobs summon. Especially not when the mob is unslowable anyways.</div></div><hr />

Mujaki is a spell, not a mob.<br />

<br />
It is how necromancers can tank summoning mobs.  And anyway, since you seem to think that cloaks of flames are &quot;crap loot&quot; why would anyone bother with pre-pop loot at all?  And most PoP mobs don't summon.<br />
<br />
Read -&gt; Comprehend -&gt; Post.  <br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
As for xp, to say that shamans get it as quickly or efficiently as necros do it a complete and utter joke.  Aggro kiting with a rogue pet backstabbing away at a mob is much, much, much, much, much, much more efficient than any way a shaman can solo.  Note that necros can root dot (with better dots than we have), but if there is room they will aggro kite instead because it is just plain better.<br />
<br />
There is also the small fact that there are mobs a necro can solo that a shaman cannot even get to, becuase of the combination of FD/REZ/insta-invis/insta-itu/harmshield/etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gobblok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">1) Thx Ugguk, didnt know Mujaki was a spell<br />
<br />
2) i doubt a necro with at least eleplanes loot and lots of AA can stand long before a mob tanking it (but i may be wrong again).<br />
<br />
3) i know that a necros solocareer is much more efficent and easier than a shamans. And his ability to aggro kite with a pet backstab pet makes him xp faster (a bit).<br />
<br />
But the necro needs place for aggro kiting, so for this strategie he needs a perfect place like hoh gy. And as i said in point 2, i doubt a necro who hasnt at least ele planes loot and lots of AA is able solo tank pop mobs (i might be wrong, but a &quot;normal&quot; necro hasnt 4k+ hp  especially when virue and/or other hp buffs wear off).<br />
<br />
I said it in my posts before, necros are better, but we shamans can grind AA very fast too...the difference isnt that big as most people say, its just a harder job in my eyes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you've got room to RE-root a good necro's got room to agro kite.<br />
<br />
you just get dizzy faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">ToM tanking for the win!!!<br />
<br />
Necros win in the efficiency dept.  I'd say Shaman can take down a much wider range of mobs though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>cephos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">well in my opinion guys and gals, i think necros have the upper hand for obvious reasons, dont get me wrong, i have a 65 shaman on povar (Elder Cephos Smeephos) and im not big on soloing, i cant stand of it, im more of a group and interactive type of person, i have all my spells and 120+ AA POINTS, shamans definately can solo pretty easily if you just dont be dumb and use a lil common sense which may be hard for some of you idiots, but if soloing is what you like, go make a necro, shamans are mainly a grouping class, whether it be for there buffs, there dots or the ever so famous Turgurs Insecets (75% slow) that makes them very in demand as it is, play your shaman the way it was msuppose to be played, and for you solo'rs you know the gig, necro all the way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, quite frankly, a 65 necro is far superior at soloing than a shaman.  They can, and frequently do, solo summoning mobs that they cannot slow (ie live mobs).  They can take hits pretty well thanks to their PoP self only rune Forceshield, and can usually channel an FD or lifetap through even when getting beat on if the situation calls for it.<br />
<br />
The soloing game is all about dps and survivability.  Necro has both in good measure.  Shaman's can survive soloing about as well as necro's, but we fall short of the dps numbers and mana efficiency the necro has.<br />
<br />
And I still wouldn't trade my 65 shaman for a 65 necro in this lifetime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>cephos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">i agree, and wouldnt trade either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Lotrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I play both a 65 necro 40aa, 3k self buffed hp, and a 65 shaman 164aa, 4.2k self buffed hp. For soloing mobs that summon, here's an example. <br />
<br />
With my necro, I solo PoInnovation factory when I'm bored. For those of you not familiar with it, the golems summon. Solo, I keep 10 of them down before repops. I've yet to try this with my shaman, as I'm not sure of how to single them. Granted, I could keep one rooted, but I'd rather not have 2 mobs to worry about when the option of only having one mob is there.</div></div><hr />
