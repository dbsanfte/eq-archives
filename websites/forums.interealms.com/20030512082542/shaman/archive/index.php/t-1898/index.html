<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">High Scale Kirn has been changed and VI failed to post anywhere that they modified our epic quest.  I talked to a GM for about an hour because Kirn ate my Icon last night and she told me that I needed to wait for him to attack.  He is supposedly no longer an instant attack mob.  We are supposed to think back to the Test of Patientce part of our quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Froosty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm did you have the right faction? and where you in bear from? If you was in bear form he will not attack :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like the GM was shoveling you some crapoloa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Let me guess, you skipped a part in the Quest and raised faction instead eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i am soooo glad i havent re-done any steps yet...<br />
i had actually though about doing gihosks books more than once.<br />
not anymore! im glad veriant is finally adressing this issure tho.<br />
the ability to &quot;cheat&quot; to get one's epic seems cheesy to me.<br />
should have to earn it like everyone else!<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What exactly did the GM mean I wonder by &quot;waiting for him to attack&quot;. There's no quest in the game (to my knowledge) where you have to hand an item to a mob that is attacking you. In fact, doing this usually results in quests not working.<br />
<br />
High Scale Kirn has never been an &quot;instant attack mob&quot; (again to my knowledge). If you have done the quest up to that point, you will be (something like) warmly considered by Kirn, everyone else (unless their truespirit faction is low for some reason - maybe SK epic) will be indifferent to him.<br />
<br />
What should happen is that you hand the icon to Kirn, and he says &quot;how dare you yadda yadda&quot; and harm touches you.<br />
<br />
The bear form issue has been disputed many time on this forum, and although I have no personal experience of it, everyone says bear form has NO faction modifications.<br />
<br />
If you handed the icon to Kirn, and he told you to stick it, I can only think of 2 reasons:<br />
<br />
1 - you skipped some part of the quest and haven't got enough faction<br />
<br />
2 - it's a bug.<br />
<br />
If it's number 2, then petition again, although I'm not sure what help a GM will be in this case. All they normally do is return the lost item to you, and you can probably get another icon quicker just by visiting CoM and picking one up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Myfistow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I turned in the Icon to Kirn just this past Monday.  Worked just fine.  I have done the quest step by step (and slowly too, I've been doing it for a good year now).  Kirn was Kindly to me as I turned it in.<br />
<br />
I took NO damage from Kirn (thanks good Rune spell on me because he did take a few swings at me) and DIDN'T HT me for some reason.  I tried to run him out of his room to our awaiting group (Revenant room opposite the Kindle room) and he didn't follow.<br />
<br />
I went back to his room and there he was RUNNING INTO THE BACK WALL!!!  No matter what I did, he wouldn't chase me out.<br />
<br />
Eventually I went to our pull-to room and waited for him to get sick of running at the wall, and sure enough, he eventually &quot;popped&quot; into our room.  Funny thing was, he HT'd the SK we had.  I took not 1 point of damage from him the whole fight.  Even got slow to stick on him the first time.<br />
<br />
Boy, that fight was a letdown ;)<br />
<br />
p.s. - We were just a single group, and we made it alone to Kirn, so I guess we were UBER ;)  Lets see, who did we have:<br />
<br />
53 SK<br />
55 Shammy (me)<br />
57 Warrior<br />
60 Chanter<br />
60 Cleric<br />
60 Monk<br />
<br />
Seriously, we owned the Hole.  No problems.  Great XP.  And I have my ring for Neh now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The way I read it, the GM was saying that Kirn doesn't immediately respawn as an aggro (ring-dropping) version.  If this is the case, it is theoretically possible I'm guessing to hand in the icon then nuke Kirn into floating ash before he respawns with the Promise Ring.<br />
<br />
Sounds a bit iffy, but who can fathom the mysteries of Verant's code that controls such things?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did not skip any steps in the quest.  Although I did go back and redo the whole thing because a GM told me the two RM mobs were triggered and I had to retrigger them.  I also messed up accidently put my Shield of Falsehood in a trade window with my little dog and hit cancel.  The shield poofed because I didn't have a giant slot open in my inventory.  The lead GM on the server told me to redo that part and not to worry about faction because it doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
After over a year I moved on to killing Lord Ghiosk.  I turned in his books without  problem and by then my faction was WAY over what it should be.<br />
<br />
Two nights ago I went to The Hole and we finally made it to Kirn after many wipe outs due to lack of people and us thinking we could get all the way there with 8 people.<br />
<br />
I was not in bear form, I checked three times to make sure I had Kirn in the trade window and not his pet, and even after the trade I made sure that it was Kirn himself.  I also held the puller back from aggroing him for a couple minutes after the trade to make sure there was no server lag.  After the wait he did not attack me so we pulled and killed him hoping there was some sort of bug and he'd drop the ring anyways, but luck wasn't in my favor and he didn't.<br />
<br />
I am now waiting for the head GM to get back from his days off.  There is the possibility that he is at E3 and it could take longer than usual for him to be back online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">when you talk to the GM, you have to beat it into their heads what you just said.  They will try to pass you off with soem complete BS like that &quot;doesn't immediately spawn as the aggro version&quot;.  Tell them what you did, how careful you were and everything.  Otherwise, when he starts to talk to you he (she maybe, sorry) will try to tell you how YOU screwed up and theirs nothing they can do.  This has been my xp in the past and doing the above has gotten me what was rightfully owed to me, so maybe it'll work for you too.  Whatever you do, don't let them brush you off.  It's not your fault the quest guy screwed up, you had done everything you needed to, remind him that it was the lead GM that told you to re-quest the shield, you turned in and he didn't spawn correctly.  That is NOT your fault, you killed the one that was there and he didn't drop the ring, therefore try to convince him that it is rightfully yours (which it is) and get them to summon you one.  Like I said before, make sure they don't brush you off, because they will try to tell you that you screwed up, just be persistent.  GL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have been as persistent as possible.  I've petitioned countless times and got 3 guides to talk to me.  The latest one did everything they have power to do and he checked their records and found everything that was needed to prove that I am right.  Right now it's a waiting game that I don't like playing.  I've waited long enough when I petitioned to get ahold of anybody.<br />
<br />
I'm just hoping the server GM is cool.  I've never dealt with him and I'm not about to let him brush me off since I should've had my Spear of Fate yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Myfistow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I guess I should have said that when I turned in my Icon to Kirn (opened the trade window, then hit TRADE)  I IMMEDIATELY got the XP music and faction, and Kirn IMMEDIATELY respawned and attacked me (minus the HT ;) ).<br />
