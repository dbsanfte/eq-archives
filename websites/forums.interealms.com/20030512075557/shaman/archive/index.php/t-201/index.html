<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just lev and invis. wait for the boat to arrive while floating over the water off the docks ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I went through catacombs first time, was a pain in the ass.  I just ran through anytim after that, if you know the way to the docks, it's really easy and takes about a minute to get there.  You can sit down near the water on the beach area while waiting on the boat, only 1 green npc down there and he never bothered me.  Invis'd and ran up to the boat when it came.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am gettiing mixed messages about weather these Killer Sharks can see through Invis to Animals.   Has anyone first hand Knowledge if this is true or not?  I am sitting on the island now trying to get the guts up to do this.  I am 44th level.  And questioning my sanity for considering doing this now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Souldreamer Bearspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did it at like 40th with invis to animals and no sharks or killer sharks attacked me even though they swam by.<br />
<br />
I might have been lucky, but it does freak you out.<br />
<br />
Also, when they say be patient, be patient.  It seems like forever, but they will eventually spawn.<br />
<br />
The hardest part for me was actually getting to the spawn point.  Its hard to tell you are there because its all black down there.  Use the locations and don't worry about the blackness and not seeing the bottom of the ocean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It seems the killer sharks are like certain other mobs elsewhere - some of them occasionally spawn with the ability to see through invis.  Best insurance policy is put some throw-away buffs up first, then SoW and Lev, just in case you need to make a quick getaway.<br />
<br />
Getting to the boat as an 'misunderstood' race is half the fun - sneaking through enemy territory and all that.  Don't worry if you find yourself humming the Mission Impossible theme, that's a common side effect ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wodaman Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Odd, except for some nasty monks and everyone seems to like me ok (don't ask how many bandits I whacked getting High Hold Pass faction tho).  Heck the bards are even ally which I attribute to too much time in Mistmoore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did this part of quest last nite.  Ran to dock invis got on boat went to island found lady went to water and waited used invis animals had no problems but worried a lot!  Fun Fun<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ah did this part at lvl 39, had lev, EB, and invis to animals up, had no problems whatsoever. (did almost die of fright when a very red killer shark swam right thru me from behind, but he was indiff, whew!)<br />
worst part was tha waiting, oh and going LD in tha middle of it =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't really know what to say about the Invis to Animals question. I kept it up the whole time when I first did the test and got aggroed on by a killer shark. I guess I could've refreshed it at a bad time, but I'm not really sure. I got lucky and was able to gate back to my bind-point on the island, but I got aggroed on again when I went back to the /loc of the spirits. I got lucky yet again (thank you channeling skill) and gated back to the island totally bewildered. I got in touch with a friend who is higher level and she said if I waited 'til the next evening, she's wait with me, so I called it an evening. The next night things went smoothly. We only had one shark aggro us, but between us, we had the firepower to take it out. I spoke to Abe, got my gem and we gated out. I don't think I answered your question, so, hmmm.... I don't know for sure if Invis to Animals will work. It should, as killer sharks are now considered animals (as of some patch a while ago), and many, many players have testified that it does, indeed, work. However, from my own experience, be careful and have an escape plan ready. Good luck to you! <br />
<br />
The good news is, the shadowknight and paladin are push-overs (if you haven't already taken them out). I whacked 'em when I was 44 and they were cake!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i look for a bunch of different ways to do it.<br />
<br />
Finnally the best one i found was..<br />
<br />
Take the portal system in timorous deep<br />
<br />
Take it to the eurudite city.  Just inviz up first.  nothing see's inviz so your safe just walk to the barge and get taken the island Probably safest way =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just run invis through Qeynos or Erudin. Get to the island. Say the thing to the ogre. Run with lev and sow to the lock. Slap on invis vs animals and hover just a bit under the water so you can see if anything spawns. The mobs that spawn will wander off after a while. Just stay put. I talked to every npc that spawned and got abes arrow, but thats not nescecary. I waited till most sharks would be away even though I had invis vs animals up (just beeing catious heh) and then dive down. <br />
I got my shield at lvl 34, no sweat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This question actually brings back a very funny memory. As an Iksar, I got to Erud's crossing the painful way. An Erudite friend told me he would lead me through Erudin. Halfway through, I lost invis, and being the lizard that I am, ended up under attack. I ran for the dock portal, but didn't know which one it was....and so there I am in the palace getting beat on by the paladins. I didn't make it.  My friends were able to rez me in an unused room in the palace. I invised, ran to the docks and stayed as far away from the guards as I could.  If you choose to go this route, know Erudin and know the path. If I had, I probably would have made it.  After you get to the dock, you should be fairly safe. A guard does come out onto the docks, but my invis held.</div></div><hr />
