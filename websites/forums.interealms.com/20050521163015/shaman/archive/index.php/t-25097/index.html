<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started a thread awhile back about which duo I should 2 box with, a Shaman/Necro or Shaman/Mage. Well I decided to go with the Mage due to my laziness in 2 boxing and also I think it'd be easier to clear out lower level trash with this combo. Before I ever rolled my characters I was given a Shaman from a long time EQ friend before he quit so I get to start off with a level 60 Froglok shaman. He is decently equipped but no epic yet. I'm going to work on building up my mage before I worry too much more about my Shaman. <br />
<br />
At any rate I'm looking for some ideas on the best way to power level the mage. Right now I'm almost level 20 and have just been buffing the mage and pet and letting them melee down everything. I've been using the fire pet only because it's so buffed it doesn't matter if it's weaker than the others and the innate damage shield just helps that much more. It seems like the best way for me to power level beyond level 20 will be to simply cast a pet, buff it to all hell with the shaman and then let it beat down mobs. I figure I'll let the shaman have a pet to help with DPS and then the mage can just burn a few times to get the kill.<br />
<br />
Is this about the best tactic I can hope for or are there other options? Also I'd like to hunt in spots when I get towards my 40's that might also give me a option to make money with some named drops. I've heard the LoY zones are good for drops because not many people hang out there. I know exp modifiers may not be the best but the chance for loot will be worth the slightly slower leveling.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any ideas you guys can give me with the situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get best DS potion you can make/buy - any extra clickies like 10th ring or Kunark BP useful also.<br />
<br />
Go to an undead area (hint Kurns tower up to about 20) and get shaman to run around and aggro every undead on first floor. Stand and heal with torpor - use mage PBAE to tag every mob aggro'd on shaman. DS damage is not counted so your mage will be doing the only damage to all mobs and collect all xp.<br />
<br />
Make sure you pick zones with a high ZEM - at later levels you will want to buff mage pet, heal it and send in doggy at around 50%. Worked well with a melee, my SK (sadly account cancelled now) could outdamage lvl 61 doggie around mid to high 30's. :(</div></div><hr />
