<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">New nasty boss mob spells most likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would assume, given that they are PB AOEs that they either belong to some boss, some trap or the like. They aint gonna give us a spell that cool :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saar_Tribunal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I agree way to powerful for shm spells.<br />
<br />
Hmmmm maybe something nasty to add to mobs if they reverse some of the slow mitigation on mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OH NOS, TEH HOSHKAR PET!! :p<br />
<br />
Just looks like a bunch of the usual stuff that is already in-game really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guess would be a VP revamp is coming. But thats a pretty blind stab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Probably new enchanter spells :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Probably new enchanter spells :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Or it is for the clerics  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Be afraid.  Be very afraid.<br />
<br />
It looks like they're working up some new &quot;AoE&quot; boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Or maybe just adding them to some old bosses.   You know, spice up those old boring PoP flagging encounters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My bets on Veeshan's Peak ... it's a keyed zone and been rumored to be under review for a while ... <br />
<br />
And just when Trakanon was finally getting over his fear of rampaging dentist wanna-bes ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hope they dont remove the snare spear, its my only shot at a snare weapon. Tunare is safe from me as no one wants to kill her no more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">VP has been modified and testing on gasp...the TEST server. They took away the roaming dragons to the ZI and upped the EXP rates to about elemental levels. Hopefully some decent loot will be added in or no one will still hunt there.</div></div><hr />

News flash.  It's been like that for oh, about 6 months now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">But can you solo there now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You could solo there before, don't see why not now..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They said something somewhere about a new adventure zone going to legends, and the midlevel one currently there going live in a few weeks. Perhaps some more LDoN raid content?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I liked the 20,000 HP self heal and the 1500 dmg/tick dot.  Sounds like a fun encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">News flash. It's been like that for oh, about 6 months now. <br />
No it's not. The test devs have been specifically summoning players to the zone to test it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Those are pretty nice what ever they are.</div></div><hr />

Remember, DoT's are all or nothing, and there is no resist modifier.  If these were for a player they would go bouncy bouncy bouncy.  Expect a resist modifier added.</div></div><hr />

Have they done anything new, or just upped the xp?  Be nice if it was a complete revamp, loot and all.  We've stopped going recently just because once you've crawled it end to end a few times, it gets very old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'd like to be able to summon hoshkar as a pet...</div></div><hr />

They has a listed -300 resist mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I like how the hoshkar pet states as summon wolf (so one would instantly assume it is a shaman if it has a wolfie pet right?) but the spell activation emote shows it as a cut/paste of the mage pets.  Guess ours are too crassy for even NPCs to use em :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Kinda looks like the usual is being pulled. People are approaching the end zones for GoD, so it's time to finish the content and eventually finish the methods to actually get into them, before folks realize the same stunt being pulled and raise a stink.<br />
