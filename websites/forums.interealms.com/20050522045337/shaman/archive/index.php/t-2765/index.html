Ok....I so want to meet whoever just put that they give fungi tunics to newbies! Notice my wussy level :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">was offered 60k for the fungi my twink was wearing the other day, call me dumb but i said sure =P got a nice new chain horse now to show for it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So, let's see.  You're a level 9 newbie who wants people to give you stuff for much less than their market value.<br />
<br />
That's one step away from just begging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Quick, Morbad, start a &quot;who hates beggars&quot; poll!<br />
<br />
:p<br />
<br />
I rarely buy and sell in game, I typically just go get the gear I need. If that means I didn't get a fungi until 57 when I went down and camped one, so be it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just think the market value of a lot of items is retarded is all. 15-30k is something I would expect to pay or sell for a fungi. I don't see many people on here from Prexus anyway. Not really a newbie either. I just restarted a shaman. I have given sow potions away just because. People in this game are just a little to greedy for my taste is all. I gladly sell cheap or give stuff to people if they need it. For instance. A POA crown for the mage. I understand that it takes a lot to get that, but 50k per crown is a little more than I would sell it for.<br />
<br />
*edit* clarification...that was 10 dose sow potions :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It was pretty obvious this was not an unbiased poll to begin with. But how can you claim someone is greedy if people come up to them and offer them some amount of money for an item? If multiple people daily are offering 60k for an item, then that items worth is 60k at that time. It might not be worth that much to you, but the market price is set by what people are willing to pay. Sad but true. I mean if i have two people i don't know wanting to buy an item from me, one of them offers 60k while the other offers 30k, I would be stupid to sell for less. It is the way the world of buying and selling works. sorry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree and understand your point Aktunka. I would sell to the 60k bidder too. But I just don't see why the price is up there to begin with except for greedy druids....ummm, I mean greedy people making it that way. I have a friend that gets all worked up about prices if one of my other friends sells to cheaply. He has conned more plat out of more players than should be allowed. He then turns around to me and brags to no end. I have decent gear on my mage and he is only 27. I stripped the other characters for friends. The fact is, greed sucks! Prices will come down on the gear I want or I will farm them with my 59 necro. Either way, it is no big deal. It just gets under my skin because a lot of people play the buy/sell game and rejoice when they take a player for some plat!<br />
<br />
Grrr...I just wanted to put up a poll. I had never done one!<br />
 <br />
 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A clear cut example of greed.<br />
<br />
Iron Oxide, what was once a fairly common ground spawn/drop from elementals, and was vendor fodder at 2cp ea, is now well over 1k ea.<br />
<br />
I can almost understand the need to cut the spawn rates on it, if such was even done, but in the interim, has messed up a lot of tradeskills people, especially those doing pottery, to the point where they are stuck with a dead end skill because they can no longer afford to attempt a combine.<br />
<br />
Another example, and more in the range of the people in the upper levels of the game  - Blue Diamonds.  A little less than a month ago, they sold for between 500 and 700pp... you could get a bd combine on resist gear for about 1.5k... now the prices have jumped to 2k on the BD's, and resist jewelry is almost impossible to get.  And the high end smith, that wants to GM, but is on a budget, is now screwed.  And don't bother saying acrylia as an alternative.  Nobody here is that naive, nor that stupid.<br />
<br />
It is true that the market will pay what the market will bear, but some things are just totally out of line.  I, for one, am glad I got my JBB when the market was relatively cheap (13k)... have seen them in the auction channels now for as much as 25-30k... usually off the bd farmers in Seb that make it impossible to loot one yourself.<br />
<br />
Ah well, /rant off<br />
<br />
If anything, the protection of cabbage spell has brought the mosquito earing into a realistic price range... the quest earing is in many ways superior, and on Zeb, you can buy the quest items for 25k for all 9 parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Listen closely now...<br />
<br />
The only reason that a Fungi goes for 50k on your server is because people are paying that much. If no one was paying 50k, they wouldn't be selling for 50k.<br />
<br />
Prices are set by buyers, not sellers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">here we have at work one of the basic rules of society.<br />
<br />
SUPPLY and DEMAND.<br />
<br />
the demand is high enough and the supply is low enough that people will pay 50k for a fungi tunic.<br />
<br />
this is how it should be. this is how the world works. if you have  a beef, take that up with verant for nerfing the drop rate (see- SUPPLY) dont' take it up on a message board randomly flaming anyone who sells things for market value, just because you have 10k and you wanted a fungi.<br />
<br />
not to try to be rude, but this is how life works, this is how the game works. if you want the price lower, do one of 2 things.<br />
<br />
1. Increase supply: Farm the living hell outa fungis and sell em cheaper<br />
<br />
2. Lower demand: see above.<br />
<br />
there is no way to lower the price unless you can get more into your server economy. and if you can't do that (not high enough to camp it) you probably shouldn't be able just to buy one anyways. the system works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well said Jentriken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's not necessarily greed, it's common sense.  If you can get 60k for an item why the hell would you sell it for 15?  The person your selling it to would probably think of you as an idiot instead of a nice person anyway lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, I would have to agree with the supply and demand scenario.  There's a saying, business is business, and with items, such as fungi, the seller is capable of perfect price discrimination.<br />
<br />
Some people are nice and sell fair/low, but selling something way below the equilibrium price does not really constitute an efficient allocation of ressources.  People wanna pay 50k, let em, there's really nothing you can do about it till they up the drop rate or decrease the number of twinks looking for one.  <br />
<br />
There's one thing I don't like too much though.  Everyone is looking for the best out there.  I'm generalizing of course, but it does affect prices.  The top-notch items are worth a (_|_)load and the next best thing is worth crap.  Fungi tunic on my server I'd guess is worth around 40-45 while iksar bp trails behind at like 3k.  I know there's a certain difference in level of difficulty between obtaining the 2, but looking at those figures alone, it implies that fungi is like 14 times better than iksar bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;WTS fungi&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;hiya, illl give 50k for it&quot;<br />
&quot;Deal&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you sell fungi to me for 5k?&quot;<br />
&quot;Already sold for 50k, unless your offer is better&quot;<br />
&quot;But im a newbie, you're greedy&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the person who's complaining about greedy people is the greedy one.  (Uhhh.. did I just do that?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>zimgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">wish i was that shaman;)<br />
I know this becuase that shaman in my friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If there is something sitting in my bank, collecting dust for ages, I'll probaby give it to a n00b.  I mean, yeah, they may be begging, but if it's a chance to get rid of something and help someone else out, why not?  I don't give away plat, tho.  I'm usually broke enough as it is, hehe.<br />
<br />
Also, I usually only sell things if I know none of my friends/guildmates can use.  And even then I tend to sell low or right at the market value.  I despise playing the wheeling and dealing game.<br />
And, honestly, for me there is little difference between 30k and 60k -- they are both a huge chunk of change!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fungi is 14 times better than the Iksar chestplate.  Mystery solved. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">technicall, the fungi is 3 times as good, 3x the regen rate.<br />
<br />
adding stats, it's prolly 5x as good. so the iksar chestplate should cost 9k, and fungi should be 45k<br />
<br />
whoops, you screwed yerself over :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Prices doesn't go up linearly with the increase in utility.<br />
<br />
A giant wolf fang has a ratio of 6 dmg, 24 delay.<br />
<br />
An engraved velium warsword has a ratio of 12 dmg, 24 delay.  Neither has any other stats, and the warsword has exactly twice the damage with the same delay.<br />
<br />
If you think value stacks lineraly, I'd be happy to trade you my two wolf fangs for your engraved velium warsword.  Or my four rusty longswords for your wolf-fang.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I give a standard 10pp to casters who beg for money for spells.  It sux not having money for spells or the means to get it cause you dont have the spells.  <br />
Most of the other beggars I just tell them no and then ignore their continued begging efforts.  They get the idea and bugger off . . or I move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I love giving stuff away- but only if I'm convinced it's going to really be appreciated and used... and since I'm pretty cynical, I have to go to some lengths before I'm comfortable.<br />
<br />
The basic rules are:  <br />
<br />
If you ask, you get nothing.  <br />
<br />
Nothing to anyone level one to three- you have to have played your character for at least a FEW minutes!  <br />
<br />
Nothing to anyone too twinked (this one is subjective- but if I see a Centi longsword, forget it.)  <br />
<br />
Usually nothing in cities- this one depends... if someone zones into the city at 1/4 health, that's different.  I'm just always thinking &quot;Is this just a mule or begger character?&quot;  Blackburrow is great, Everfrost is great, etc.<br />
<br />
I usually start by buffing them up (HoS + Haste + Ultravision + Regen = huge on a true newbie!) - then I inspect to see what they need - then give them a minute to spoil the deal by begging... hehe - then load them up with two or three items they can use, and a little plat if they're a caster... wish them well... then on to the next person.  :)<br />
<br />
Just gave away a couple packs of stuff two nights ago... I think it all found good homes.  :)<br />
<br />
Oh, one other thing:  Newbie chicks dig horses.  I was mobbed in Everfrost- hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">i normally give newbs the pieces of crust in my bank that isnt' worth my time selling. if they are plate classes. if not i spend 10pp to smith them a few pieces of banded usually. casting classes i give 10pp for spells. that buys all first and 2nd circle spells.<br />
<br />
a fungi, i'd sell for whatever the market would get me. helping newbs is different than supply and demand.</div></div><hr />

Greed for cash, power, prestige...  drives lots of people to enourmous efforts that commonly benifit society in general.<br />

<br />
Now Envy is a truly evil emotion.<br />

*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Paid 50k for my fungi (sold my vox's eyepatch and emerald ds bp) to a guildie who bought it to resell it and lost patience.  Very simply my arguement to this is the drop rate is insanely low, ultimate in melee twinking items, extremely potent to shaman and very useful to other classes.<br />
<br />
In short it's price is relative to it's value.  Sucks but true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">A lot of time the price on items is set by the dealers and that is all. Someone does a PC and a dealer says 50K because he has the item and wants to sell it for that price. They force the prices up. I was on auction the other day and some guy had like 5 Fungi Tunics and was selling them for 10K above the market price -- guess what he sold them all in one day and there is a new price for the fungi -- that is just pure greed. When I am looking for an item and I see it auctioned for a fair price I have to jump on the person as fast as possible because 6 dealers will be on him as well trying to buy it so they can just up the price to the MAX and then resell it making a profit. The problem is I have to sit there for a week looking for another one or pay the dealer (that can type faster than me or is paying more attention to the auction because they are not fighting) an inflated price. The dealers are the ones I get upset with not the average person trying to market an item at a fair market price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">But how can you dictate what it's worth to them as well?  An item is only worth what someone will pay for it and all.   I can say &quot;Fungi Tunic 60K&quot; all day long and doesn't mean I'm going to get it.</div></div><hr />

Pickpocketing spells and gems and not sharing with the group is greed.<br />

<br />
Selling an item you have because you know you can get another by claiming need-before-greed is greed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">LOL - I'll chime in, the place I see rampant greed (pointless drooling over platz) is on high end spell drops.  (I will add here that I have NEVER sold a spell for more than 1k and generally give any spell I find to a friend/guildmate who can use rather than sell it)<br />
<br />
It drives me berserk to see all the farmers out there on the auction channel who want 60k for Torpor, 30k for Malo, 15k for BoN etc -- lol I've even seen one psycho trying to get 15k for Regrowth of Da'Khura! (Mind you when looking at these spells that the accepted price atm for Group Aego is only 10k)<br />

I know it'll take me longer to fill my spell book - but I'll be damned if I ever pay those prices for spells.</div></div><hr />

If no one had bought the 5 fungis  at above market the seller would have lowered his price.  the point is people are willing and able to pay the asking price (more sometimes) how can u blame it on the seller?<br />

1. i am a druid. will someone tell me the trick to soloing the king spawn in seb? cuz it seems a bit difficult at this stage of my life, with only 60 and 20 aa points...<br />

2. anyone &quot;upping the price&quot; wont' sell anything unless someone is willing to pay it. fact of life. deal with it or just stop crying about it.<br />
<br />
3. There are lots of nice people in the shaman community. they are trying to EDUCATE you. i suggest you take a seat, listen, and learn things, so you stop calling normal economics greed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I think alot of people look at it as this:<br />
<br />
5 loaves of bread exist on my server and is the only food left.  We would all die without them and we neeeeed them.  Dude sells 5 loaves at 50k.  5 people buy each one loaf. The rest of the 1500 peeps scream GREED!<br />
<br />
What makes this scenerio different then just supply/demand is the concept of need.  The more people that feel that they need a fungi to be a shaman will feel that higher prices = greed.  But if you look at it as if it were a Mercedes then it changes the whole perspective although the price may not have changed at all.<br />
<br />
That thing is such an awesome addition just to carry around for regen purposes, I'm surprised its even sold at all.</div></div><hr />
