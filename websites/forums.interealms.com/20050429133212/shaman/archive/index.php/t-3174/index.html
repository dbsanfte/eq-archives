<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jedafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When one dings 40 you gain an amazing ability. You can group with level 60s and earn exp. However if you try this with say, someone quad kiting Othmirs (blue to 60) you notice the exp is horrendous. However, if the mobs that the 60 kills are green you will get a fair chunk of the exp. Now fast forward -<br />
<br />
Being a troll, I always look for places with either a) city status or b) nice exp bonus. Dungeons or cities are really the only places I like to fight to help make up for the racial penalties. <br />
<br />
I have been able to race from 40-42 (working on 43 quickly) and perhaps even 44 in droga. Why droga, that goblin infested harm touch laden one way death trap? Simple - chardok faction. Sure we all will end up in here some day but you know what - there are already a lot of level 60s who come in here and mow down the mobs. Rogues and monks are really good for this but any class can handle themselves in droga. Droga has nice faction (40-42 and im dubious to dok) and nice nice nice nice exp. Faster than powerleveling in my opinion. When you zone in ask someone in zone if you could group with them - i have never had someone say no. Just follow them around dropping the random heal, buff whatever they need and let them kill. The exp goes to waste otherwise so no one seems to mind. Plus a greater heal after a harmtouch keeps people going more consistently :) Also, I had a nice monk who turned on autosplit and let me have the cash loots that dropped and I have made a pretty penny in here. Nothing to buy a JBB but enough to pay for my level 44 spells. The faction is nice, the exp is nice, and meeting some of the upper level crowd is nice. Good luck to everyone and please dont flame me - im sensitive :)<br />
<br />
p.s. If you happen to be a troll you get around 2 yellows per hour in here so barbs/ogres/kittys will probably get a level per ~2hours. Snare/root is very nice way to help the 60s as well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OMG, lol, thank you! This explains sooooooo much now. The other day, i saw my friend in my guild, one day he was 41, later 42, then next day 43, next day 44 and 45, i was like ***? how id you level like that? He says, &quot;60 Wiz&quot; i go what? (he is a druid and thoguht he was talking about his wis&quot; so i said um, ok.... Few hours later someone else asks, he says, &quot;60 wiz&quot;. I do /who all 60 wiz finally and see [Sorceror] Wolfram (60) &lt;Lost Souls of Glaznor&gt; And now i understand! I'm going to go try this once i ding 40, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow- talk about having right there in front of you and not seeing it.<br />
<br />
Thanks - btw any idea when the mobs start greening out?  I'm 47 and wondering if I'm too high a level to take advantage of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kerran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Found this to work quite nice too:<br />
<br />
40-43 Have a 60 wipe out the Dreadlands or Overthere. Or, if you are level 38, have a level 56 wipe out the same spots. You'll level very fast with a war/ monk/ sk / any melee type pulling everything in sight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jedafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dark blues at 40/41 - occasional light blue at 42 so id say around 45 they would not be worth it - howerever this is only on the top loop of the dungeon , i know there are some higher levels ones in there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hahaha i tried this in ToD last night, found a group with a monk, 2 rogues, cleric, and wizard, who were more than happy to let me soak up the exp they were spilling all over the floor :). had just dinged 42, got a yellow into 43 in about 4.5 hours! also once i got over the panic and let myself drop invis once in a while, i would drop Tumultuous Strength whenever a really big train came in, so i got a good share of Chardok faction hits too (still KoS of course... it takes like 3 full days of goblin whacking to get to ally).<br />
<br />
Thanks Jedafix! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Jedafix. That explains a few things. Never quite understood why sometimes I would get less exp from higher mobs when I am the &quot;young one&quot; in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thsi place is FAB<br />
<br />
gone up 4 lvls in droga<br />
<br />
Started there at 40, grping with a 55 monk who let me keep all the pp too LOL<br />
<br />
half way thro 44 now, dunno if ill stay here for 45 tho&quot;!   expis great but 5 lvls in one zone is starting to wear thin.  stuff near ent is now lb  but further in they still db, inner sanctum is best are, but u get alot of adds even with a lvl 60 pulling, i managed to get a lvl 60 rogue killed here; he was saving my sorry nuub ass while i gated to safety awwww blesss....<br />
<br />
<br />
hehe we gotta think more places like this!!<br />
<br />
erm welli have one&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at lvl 35 i found lvl 45 folk in CC  doing spiders for silk, i offered to grp and heal ther pets etc.  again i got all the exp  muhahhaha<br />
<br />
lets get oir thinking aps on try make up some more spots<br />
<br />
WOOT!  47 and still getting exp here, and now amiable with chadok, so can bank there )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">folk farming the grimling caves in Tmtns for acrylis blaocs  thers another!!<br />
<br />
i guess same aplies to folk farming the veliumn blocs in CC ?<br />
<br />
/ponder   <br />
<br />
only problem is that this cant be done after mobs hit lvl 44<br />
<br />
cos then the lvl 60s start geting exp of the light blue mobs  ie they suk the % of the exp<br />
<br />
mez thunk some more&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
folk doing facton work is a great one!   say folk kiling giants in kael purely for SS faction, although giants die a bit slower than goblsins  hehehe<br />
<br />
people farming coldain heads in the dorf mines!  maybe good to be careful about not geting the faction hits too tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Clawsor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok i was in infected paw with this 60war and 60 chanty chanty wanted whips for pet well when we went in deeper thing starte dbecomeingblue and i got KICK BUT EXP so ya 60 hting is right</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">just finished off lvl 48 in droga at the chief camp, every mob was light blue, and exp was pretty slow (was with 2 lvl 60)  but hey i am now WARMLY in chadok!  next ding and i get the first ring !<br />
<br />
I expected all the mobs to turn green at 49 but nope  they are still all L blue.  However now i have the pet i will move to COm, and try a bit of soloing there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Resurecting an old thread here:<br />
<br />
Does this still work (Not in Droga of course) with a lvl 65 shaman? Or does it take a high DPS class? If it still does work, what would be a good spot to do it to get a lvl 43 SK a few lvls using a lvl 65 shaman.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I believe lvl44 is needed to grp w/ a lvl 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, I tested this myself yesterday. I can confirm that at lvl 43 you get xp grouped with a 65. <br />
Did this test in DL outside the entrance to KC. Pretty sure that it is not a viable methode for a shaman. We just don't kill the lvl 35 - 40 mobs quick enough. <br />
A mage friend poped over to hand me some items and volountered to swap with me. He grouped with SK, I pulled and he used AE spells and pet. Got through almost all of lvl 43 in about an hour. So, yes a very viable methode if you have someone that can kill the mobs fast enough. The place was not ideal as we were lacking mobs. Lots of downtime with me running around trying to find new mobs to kill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Greeznok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This still works but it is not like it used to be.  I can remember getting almost a full blue per kill in the way back.  I tried this last week with my 65 mage friend killing greenies in Dulak, and it took 2 kills to get 1% exp at lvl 44.  It is still a great way to exp if you can group with one of the high level pharmers in zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting a lvl in one hour, which I did in DL with the lvl 63 mage, is good in my book. Regardless of amount of kills :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ueauvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">my shaman and bst when they hit 43 did it this way<br />
farming plat with my 65 ranger for twink items for the two of them.  alt or pleee groups with rng, goes afk, alt tab and farm dulak, exps for alt and money/items flow ranger hardly loses 5% health<br />
<br />
with shaman can use haste/slows/jbb if you can be bothered, pet can always be rear gunner covereding adds on shaman<br />
<br />
beastlord does kittycrack and can have pet help or just stay tail gunner<br />
<br />
when i was helping in games wife's ogre warrior get to 45, afk behind me and i kill stuff all d blue to her</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">last few nights i have been farming guards for plat in hhk, been having a few friends come over and group their alts with me for the experience.  i think in the 4 hours they were with me, they went from 28ish to roughly 34ish.  worked out well, they'd cut down on time, i'd get loot, their lvls soared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fyrol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Seems kinda boring to do it this way, isn't it?<br />
<br />
I mean if you can get a yellow per hour solo while working on your skills, (like getting pounded on helps raise defense skill)... why go this route?<br />
<br />
Won't this hurt you later when AC becomes so important?<br />
<br />
Not a criticism at all just trying to get an understanding...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">great method, which i use all the time! make sure mobs are green to the higher lvl toon, lightblues make this method too slow.<br />
<br />
lvl 20 grp with&gt;  lvl 30<br />
lvl 30 grp with&gt;  lvl 45<br />
lvl 40 grp with&gt;  lvl 60<br />
lvl 43 grp with&gt;  lvl 65<br />
<br />
lvl 44 grp with&gt;  lvl 66<br />
etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Still works well enough. A friend of mine (65SK) PL'ed 3 toons from mid-40's 50's to 60+. His bot shaman has passed me in level and AA. The only difficulty was in getting the shaman to a level to reliably slow mobs, after that he was golden. If you did the same thing with an AE grp the exp would fly.<br />
<br />
His method was to use Dulak then Droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">for those who think they are beyond ToD, try Lavaspinner's Lair with the same tactics...check the post on it. still wiping the drool of my chin from the insane exp.</div></div><hr />
