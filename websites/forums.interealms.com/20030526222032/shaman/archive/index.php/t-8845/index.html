<br />
my guild decided to do some Fear bashing to get some Shaman Tears and other Epic parts for the younger players.   And soo we bashed around the mobs, took down all the named ones, except CT .. our first attempt at him didnt go that well .. ohwell. :)<br />
<br />
A few times I had the following happen to me.<br />
<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:16 2002] You begin casting Malo.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:16 2002] Cappi begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:17 2002] Vorrhees tells the raid,  'Assisting  Petty'<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:18 2002] a frightfinger begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:18 2002] Ixcor begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:18 2002] Trexeis begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:19 2002] Wazz begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:19 2002] Stooky begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:20 2002] a gorgon begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:21 2002] Your spell did not take hold.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:21 2002] Your Obulus Death Shroud flickers with a pale light.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:22 2002] Obsin begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:23 2002] Tamenrasett begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:24 2002] Cilina begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Fri Dec 13 02:34:24 2002] a frightfinger begins to cast a spell.<br />
<br />
Anyone noticed this (and posted it in a different thread that I overlooked) .. or did this happen before the patch too ?  (I just dinged 60 last week and havent played with Malo that much on raids :))<br />
<br />
If this didnt happen, I guess we need to find out who or what is giving us this stacking issue.  All info about this would be nice to know.  <br />
<br />
Thank you for your attention. :)<br />
<br />
Be safe!</div></div><hr />

We had a big multi-mob-in-camp party .. mobs left and right .. I guess the other two shammies and magi's beat me to it and didnt call their debuffs in the channel .. ohwell. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
