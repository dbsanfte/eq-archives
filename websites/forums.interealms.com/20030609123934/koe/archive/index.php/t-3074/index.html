<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You know the deal by now..<br />
<br />
25 to 35. Meet at Dalnir at 7 pm cst or at WW/OT zone at 645 PM CST.<br />
<br />
Please bring a bit for the clerics (Blood stones).<br />
<br />
Going to try the second level if we get a good mix.. <br />
<br />
Look for Calon/Klydon or Griss/Bearan..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tempeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am planning to make this with Tempin (30 cleric now). However, I am confused about the planned server downtimes, it looks like after the normal downtime for the patch, that Veeshan (as always) and some others will be down for an ADDITIONAL 9 hours. Am I not reading it right?<br />
<br />
Tempeus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will plan on being there with Faroon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Due to an on going event, I will be unable to attend tonight. I have talked to Bearan/Griss and unless something else happens to him at work, he will be running this event. <br />
<br />
Contact for tonight is Griss. I am hopeful that another chanter can make it, but while it is nice, it is not totally needed there. (We were doing the second floor with 4 of us, no chanter, no cleric when we were 29). <br />
<br />
Hopefully, everyone will have a good time and I can get back in the swing of things next week.. :)</div></div><hr />
