<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I remember correctly and I think I do Iksar and Troll 20%, Ogre 10%, Barb 5%, kitty cat is 0%.  And if I may restate what is often said on this board, play whichever one you like, they are well balanced for the most part.  If you have tons of loot to twink and like to solo, a Troll is a good idea because of equipment and regen.  I have a lizzy 60 and I have been happy. My only other 2c is that evil characters have big issues banking and buying spells unless you play in certain zones.  Also, watch out for those darn guards, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, everytime I level I get a muuhahahaha and my experience bar goes down 20% and I de-level immediately. Can't get out of this loop.<br />
<br />
Only kidding I've only played Trolls above newbie level so I don't know how easy experience comes to others. It seems normal to me.<br />
<br />
As for banking, I don't see a problem, you have Grobb of course, Ogguk, Neriak, The Overthere, Nexus and Thuragin and  maybe Runny-eye is still usable, never went there. With OT gate hammer and now Troll Swamp portstone and bind in Nexus what need of anyplace else.<br />
<br />
Spells are easy, Grobb spells, merchant on Swamp hand for poison and disease, vision spells from gypsy in Oasis, pets spells from Barb in W. Karana, Chloroblast on Erudite merchant in EC tunnel, Troll merchant at Outpost for Kunark buy spells, Ogre near Troll for turn-ins, Shadowhaven for SoL spells, all easy to get to and non-KOS. Had to get a friend to grab spells from the gnome in Iceclad I couldn't fit into the igloo and wasn't up to shrink potions yet. It is also nice to kiss the 'goons' in OT when the little children scatter at their sight. Har!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You betcha, Trolls and Leezards still have 20% exp penalty, I know, I've been 42 for about 3 weeks now. Getting rather annoying, but oh well, all I've ever played are Trolls and Iksar anyway, so the exp penalty is no big deal, I don't even notice too often.<br />
<br />
Banking isn't a issue for me anymore, as I can bank in Thurg, Cabilis, Runnyeye, SH, and Bazaar. I'm bound at the Nexus, so banking, buying/selling aren't moot point now. <br />
And all the spells I need I can buy in Cabilis...........if you ask me Iksars have GREAT faction. As I can pretty much kill whatever I want and not worry about who I killed my faction with. I always have Cabilis if all else fails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't really see the point of it being 20%, so what, we have regen, doesn't A) Bad faction, B) Large race, C) Crappy Chr/Int/Wis account for anything? I think it should be barb=0%, kitty=0%, Ogre=5% troll/iksar=10% or 15%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">troll/iksar 20%<br />
ogre 15%<br />
barb 5%<br />
cat 0%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is worthwhile to note, if still true which it prolly is, there is no xp penalty on AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As a Troll Shaman, I have been aware of the xp penalty. It's a running joke in my Guild as the rest level past me. NP, I enjoy playing a Troll. As far as banking, most of the possible banking sites have been stated already except North Freeport. All you have to do is help Guild Pallies kill Sir Lucan a couple of times, and the North Freeport Pallies will love ya. Then you can do the run from the west gates to North FP zone, with all the guards chasing you, what a rush. Or take the tunnel to North FP and go bank, NP</div></div><hr />
