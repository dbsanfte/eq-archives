<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've gotten fairly good exp by killing flies, rats, and goos.  The spiders might be possible, but they're casters, so it might be best to stay away from them.<br />
<br />
Has anyone soloed the lightcrawlers or underbulks?  They hit for 350, but I here they're unbelievable exp(a full percent of 61 per kill)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xelnag Ashenpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shhh....Underbulks are terrible exp. ;)<br />
<br />
Seriously though, the underbulks are very doable using root/dot'ing. I wouldn't try to tank them as they do have a tendency to nail you for 300's.<br />
<br />
If you can drag a high AC warrior along to duo with there, you'll rake in the exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Orionson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Underbulks?  Where are those?<br />
<br />
The Defiler Spiders give between 1/2 and 1% 61 exp per kill and there is a good nest of them without the clerics just north of Rallius' cave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Underbulks are around both sides of the castle, near the lightcrawlers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you want FUN, try soloing one of the mosquitoes... I found one hanging near the river, he doubled for 436 and cast some nuke for 600+.. Fight of my life, I barely won. Gave me 1% exp in 61, didn't kill another to see if it was a full 1% or half a % or what :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried the underbulks, and I killed a couple, but I got some adds on my fourth one and got a free TL to my bind point.<br />
<br />
Is there a good spot to pull them to that anyone would care to share?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xelnag Ashenpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Facing the castle, if you go to the left side and move all the way along the castle wall until you get to where it meets with the zone wall. That spot is safe from all wanderers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bah why solo in PoP?  It takes us forever to kill the mobs solo and it's not that hard to grab a group in PoT.  Just OOC &quot;shaman LFG&quot; and you'll get spammed with tells trust me.  Group exp in PoP is great and you'll have more fun and less deaths.  (unless you're in PoI, then you can expect to die OFTEN because some moron is trying to solo and trains)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Orionson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Is it so unbelievable that some of us prefer to solo, or that we only have an hour to play at a time and dont want to hassle groups?<br />
<br />
And how stupid do you take us for?<br />
<br />
&quot;Just OOC &quot;shaman LFG&quot; and you'll get spammed with tells trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
NO **** SHERLOCK.  I learned that 59 levels ago.  <br />
<br />
Is this thread a debate about soloing vs grouping? NO so stay on topic and quit trying to tell the soloers how they should play.<br />
<br />
And if you are going to give advice, make sure it is valuable.  The stuff you wrote is completely worthless, who the hell doesn't know how to LFG?  <br />
<br />
P.S.  I know a great secret place to get alot of phat lewts, just go to the bazaar and type /bazaar, theres more loots than you can imagine!!!<br />
<br />
P.P.S. Do you think that was sarcastic?<br />
<br />
P.P.P.S. You would be right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no flames please, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">man, lay off the caffiene a bit.  You flamed the hell out of that guy for not posting valuable info.  There's no valuable info in your last post either.  <br />
<br />
Underbulks and Lightcrawlers are doable.  I would recommend root dot (/cry), some can triple hit for around 400.  They have lots of HPs.  I went there last night and I did pox, plague, epic, bane, eb, bane, eb, epic, bane.   If I recall correctly...when spiritcall was up more hoarde of doggies replaces a bane+eb or so.  I have extended affliction 3, mana pres3, and affliction haste3.<br />
<br />
I had a horse, selfbuffs, KEI and virtue and still needed a min or so to med up between.   (4600hps/4100mana)<br />
<br />
<br />
Spiders suck, lots of them are clerics.  They were nuking me to death with judgement for full with 150mr and with the new NPC mana regen rates you can kill them forever with shaman kill speed.  <br />
<br />
I tried for a while to single pull the malarian galls which are like level 58 or something but I would always pull like 4 at a time.  I could single the tsetse fly things though.   <br />
<br />
There are some nice high plateaus up on the walls in this zone that are safe from both trains and wanderers.<br />
<br />
I'm not a big soloer, I'd much rather group.  I just do this stuff to get a feel for my new limits. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">be warned!!! On at least 1 lightcrawler in a group turgur's was resisted 3 times after malo/malosini. No tash was available. I barely made it through that one. <br />
<br />
I've soloed a coupla underbulks. Make sure you have high MR on you. underbulk defilers are SK's. They will HT and ignite blood and fear, as well as hitting for 360's. They will also enrage, so make sure dogdog doesn't get pummeled. Did I also mention they will run when low?<br />
<br />
It takes 2 Curse of the Spirits, 4 or so Bane, and 1 Pox + dogdog and JBB to kill one of these things. However, they gave me 3% AAXP per kill solo (1% grouped, you do the math. /shrug), though it may be more with higher level ones, I may have gotten some lowbies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Laylana Angelhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Has anyone soloed the lightcrawlers or underbulks? <br />
<br />
I am a level 60 shaman w/some FT items and 1AA put towards  FT, average HP's/AC for level, all of my pre PoP spells and i'd say average gear all around.. <br />
<br />
I can solo these guys but i have to tell ya it isn't a mindless battle, you really have to be on the ball. Soloing WW dragons is easier.. :p <br />
<br />
I do it for the challenge more then the exp.. the exp grind is gone for me, i just can't do it any more. They do give REALLY nice experience tho, but solo your battle can be anywhere up to 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
Solo = 5 lightcrawlers to 1 yellow bubble AA at 90% - if you are equiped like me, be prepared to not win every battle. <br />
<br />
Duo = 2% AA at 90% per kill (me and a druid or necro) things are still interesting...but you move at a quicker pace.<br />
<br />
Trio = about the same as above.. i'd say 3 kills would make a full blue bubble AA at 90%. Did this with a druid and a necro.. it wasn't nearly as fun but wasn't your snoreville experience grind either. <br />
<br />
Personally, i prefer the centapeedies (lightcrawlers) over the bugs (underbulks). (yes i do have nicknames for them)<br />
<br />
Reason being, i've noticed that the underbelks hit harder and faster, cast more often and give me just a world more of trouble then the light crawlers. <br />
<br />
Root will break for both, and it will break alot. <br />
<br />
The bitch about the lightcrawlers is that they run equal to SoW it seems.. so if you try to run off so you can get off a gate ya best cross your fingers. :)<br />
<br />
The drop rate for parchments is absolutely horrible...... <br />
<br />
Lightcrawlers i pull through the gates to the castle wall and i pull him out far. There is a pathing bug there and they will just pop on you if you don't go out far enough. <br />
<br />
If you go inside and to the right there is a little cubby by a rock. You can pull them there but i only recommend it if you are more then 1 person. <br />
<br />
If you want to do the underbulks the spots i am familiar with are on the left side. There is a little cubby in the castle wall that gives you a good pathing route to avoid being hit. (similiar to the katta/bank pathing).<br />
<br />
There are also a couple different spots along the walls there that you can set up for camp. The one where the castle wall meets the terrain wall is a good spot as well. <br />
<br />
Bards seem to have the best time soloing there by charm kiting..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both the beatles and centipedes are soloable.<br />
<br />
level 61 shaman with new pet<br />
no malo/topor<br />
have a horse<br />
no pox even<br />
<br />
took 3 banes, 2 epics, 1 plague, and let pet tank.. then heal pet and sometimes I would tank... alternating back and forth.<br />
<br />
Took approximately 60-70 percent mana per kill, unfortunately, but over 1 blue aa per kill (was doing 90% aa)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i find PoD better xp than PoN for those of u without tier 2 flags.  I usually get a 60 druid to partner with.  the druid can charm rats which can tank slowed mobs np.  it is safer with the druid, but can still be fun do to the zone's wanderering adds.  Partnering=great xp for me in lvl 61.<br />
<br />
i am averagly equiped, have horse but no epic or torpor.  druid has epic and most of his pre60 spells.<br />
<br />
i never thought i would say this, but i actually look for a druid partner in pod...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gegen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">yeah yeah gal go on bashing druids all you want, but you know I'm GOD in PoD when you want XP and don't have access to higher tier planes.  Don't even try to act like you feel sorry for looking to partner with me all the time.  <br />
<br />
But umm anyway.. go partner with your local druid friend or family member *cough* they're awesome in PoD and it'll be a lot more fun to partner with them if they're good.. trustme ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">what lvl of druid would u say was the min for this ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gegen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well.. as long as the druid has Call of Karana (level 53 spell) you could techinically do it.  I wouldn't recommend until the druid is at least 58, maybe even higher...</div></div><hr />
