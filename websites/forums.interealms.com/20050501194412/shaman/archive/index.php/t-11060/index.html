<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well back when i was 58 or something like that i dueled a cleric and was pretty much owned ( first duel ever ) Basicly he blinded me and it was all down him from there.<br />
<br />
Well at 65 i find the challanges to be less and less as far as mobs are concerned. Find myself pushing areas and seeing what i can solo. Well ofcourse this has led me to PvP as of late. Now i always heard shaman arent to hot in PvP , but as a 65 shaman with almost all my toys and &quot;fair&quot; AA and most my spells im finding im pretty hard to kill ;)  Seems to me the absolute power of the shaman is not out DPSing , its not out nuking , its simply out living , which is something im mastering as of late ;)<br />
<br />
 I think the only thing i fear so far is those damn rangers with high AA. they can make a mess of you from far away , i havent had the chance to malo/root and tank one after he is slowed , but im thinking thats where my chances lay.<br />
<br />
So anyway , how you guyz doing ? Especialy you reds. Ive actualy been considering transfering to a red server cause im so bored  in blue anymore heh.</div></div><hr />

Well said and totally agreed with you. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman can't solo pvp worth crap anymore.  SK with decent AA's will autokill you, as will wizards and necros.  <br />
<br />
Rangers can disc if you don't get the jump on them and also basically autokill you.  Only way I ever beat 'em is by sneaking up and having at least 8 seconds or so to debuff them before they start blasting me a new one with their bows. <br />
<br />
Most other melee can be killed by us if they don't have too high of resists (most of my pvp is lvl 65, well geared chars so I have a rough time), but if you can't get them rooted/slowed/etc... you're pretty much SOL.  With as long as it takes us to chew down 5-9k hps, if you can't keep them parked most of that time, you're gone.  Pally's are almost impossible to outlast.  Bards... I don't even bother with these clowns - almost impossible for us to kill. <br />
<br />
Basically, clerics, chanters (a well played chanter can tool us too), monks, rogues, warriors, mages, BLs are about the only classes that I can feel pretty confident in almost any situation pvp'ing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im scard of mages there new pets are wicked i saw one flurry and rampage the other day in HOH the mage him self critting for 4k+ how do you deal with some one who can do so much DMG so fast? maybe go full offencive kill him befor he can kill you at least you can heal your self?<br />
<br />
my genaral stradagy with any mele class is get pet out dispell them a few times to make sure thay have no buff's malo and ID  flash of light to check there rests it FOL lands i slow then just tank them if i get more then 3 rests on FOL then des dot and them and pet kite with the 1300 and 2k heal thay genaraly find out thay cant kill pet and come back on me pritty sone thay die<br />
<br />
Druid are easy torpor can keep up with any DD thay can throw at you and you can disspel all there dot's havent met a duild that can kill me met a few that i could not kill do to resists though<br />
<br />
Rangers with lots of AA kill me fast, rangers with not so many AA are like any other mele<br />
<br />
SK are tuff but once slowed are easy to tank if you cant slow them just try and save you mana and run them OOM so thay cant heal them selfs <br />
<br />
wizzy kill me fast cant keep up with the DMG<br />
<br />
pallise are hard but the trick is to dispell there HOT spells alwas seem's to piss of a pally when he spend's hes mana for a heal just to have it dispelld ) and keep ID on him at all times befor you slow that way he cant dispell slow i just chain cast it some times wall thay try and get read of slow<br />
<br />
Necros are hard most of the time it eands in a Draw dispell is your friend in this battle and make sure you have lots of junk buffs and a few spaces at the top takes them 400 mana to dot you and you only 50m to get read of it play the numbers game on this battle or thay will win<br />
<br />
Bards well i just try and stay away from them there to resitstant to fast and to anoying to spend your time trying to kill them.<br />
<br />
i found that AA pets are great for turning the tide on your side <br />
there verry good for interupting some one right when thay need to get that last dot off or heal i alwas save them just for just that purpose<br />
<br />
most my fight's are with lvl 60-65 guildies so were all about even in the armor depatment<br />

Me vs 60 Ranger.....Very interesting fight, the second she pulled out her bow I freaked.....she took me down to 30% mana before I finally knocked her out.  The fight was relatively easy, thank god she didnt have mass AA cause it was low DPS from the bow.<br />
<br />

Me vs 61 Wizard ---- Scary ----- Send pet in, he roots it for the whole fight.......malosini, bane, epic, and then spam heal till bane off, bane again, spam heal till he dead.......he took me to 5% mana thank god for partial resists.   Was very fun, everyone needs to duel more =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PvP never really becomes ridiculous, as long as both sides have access to the same resources (classes, gear, skills). Mass pvp is always fun. Then it's more about communication, practice and strategy than anything else.<br />
<br />
But I will give you that 1on1 pvp probably went down the $hitter between Velious and Luclin.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a shaman the following are rough to pvp against:<br />
<br />
Bard: too high resist, cant catch and control them, too fast, unresistable manadrain and annoying dots to wear you down. Unresistable disease debuff followed by Virulent paralysis (VP) is perhaps our strongest card here.  NonEbayed bard who isnt afk should be unkillable.<br />
<br />
Ranger: outranges and outguns us... all of it while running faster than us. Archery means pretty much a definite loss versus a ranger in terrain which is flat and free of mobs. For me the best chances have always been to stay close to the ranger, as most rangers melee dps is only about half of their archery dps. Dmg shield potion helps then as well. Smart rangers switch to 2handers. Rangers have insane atk as well so most of our sturdiness from high ac is more or less useless.<br />
<br />
Paladin: forget it. They can cure anything we toss at them. Their manapools are almost as big as ours and they have massive hps.<br />
Holy steed, invuln, efficient and fast heals, insane 2handers perfect for pvp and lay on hands.  Hate em. Landing a tash proc followed by a quick malo and blind/root can work sometimes, but is usually not worth the time.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights: just like paladins, but on the plus side the fight wont last longer than 10 seconds so you aren't wasting your entire evening killing them. 3k+ pvp dmg harmtouches at the least with full PoP abilities. Stat drains to mess up your bufflist and ac/resists. Hp drains to keep them alive and you running. Snare counters any usage of pets and kill you too if it lands. Unholy steed, invuln, insane 2handers and shadowstep. <br />
<br />
Wizard: almost unresistable nukes (yes friend resisted 3 lure of thunder in a row yesterday) and strong root + MB. Runes means our pet(s) cant get in there and interupt. Shadowstep and nexus insta gate means you cant really die in pvp as a wizard. People often whine about MB needing to be nerfed on pvp servers. I'd say it's the insta nexus gate that needs nerfing.  No risk no reward please.<br />
<br />
Necro: only applies if the necro has lots of AA's in crits. In that case he can simply chaindrain you to death. He has invulns and shadowstep to keep him alive. All his dots are dispellable or curable. Add LB for the surprise gank. His pet you can nullify with flash of light etc.<br />
<br />
Druids, clerics and shaman are not so much 'tough' as tedious. It usually boils down to who has the more instaclickies, potions, nifty AA's like radiant cure. Theft of thought mace is a good tideturner as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogues, monks and warriors are easy when you have space to move around. Their lack of channeling make it almost too easy sometimes. Then again, pure melees with 180+ in base resists and PoM flowers we cant do jack against.<br />
<br />
Mages are pretty easy as well. Just control their malas and keep their pet pacified with blind or root. Beastlords are more or less like mages except they lack mala but have higher maneuverability and their pets last longer.<br />
<br />
Chanters can go both ways. A chanter who knows what he is doing is capable of killing ANY other class (bar SK using gimptouch). Most chanters dont know what they are doing pvp wise. Before rapture and the upgrades in tash and their new partial resist nukes they used to suck at pvp, so not many chanters ever bothered with it. The ones who did are very dangerous. Recent bug with chanter pets have made them totally immune to spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
My list of what I can handle loosely resembles the above guideline. Variations occur and are usually caused by gear differences, terrain, who gets the jump and the opposition not having their brain properly plugged in. <br />
<br />
All in all the shaman class has lost in pvp over the last two expansions. Mostly due to the high resistability of all our spells, the insane increase in overall player resists, lack of reliable dmg output but most of all due to other classes gaining skills/spells that counters ours. Right now I would rank shaman somewhere just below average. We used to be in the top three together with bard and shadowknight.<br />
<br />
Call me insane, but I still think it's fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">think i could beat a ranger.  A well played melee of my own caliber would kill me.  Ranger tho, I just hug a wall and cast on him while he tries to arrow me.   He will come in close then.  And then I tank him with a 33 point DS on and torpor.  Fast heals now and then . . . I can do that ****.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Loid isn't 60+, and the pvp situation changes considerably there.<br />
<br />
You can kill anyone who is unprepared or stupid. Any class except for druids can give us trouble. It is hard to die as a shaman (not counting deathtouches), but it is extremely hard to get kills at lvl 65, cause it's so easy to get away from a shaman. We take so long to kill anyone that they usually have several chances to gate, zoneplug, etc.<br />
<br />
To actually get kills, you usually have to get low on life and make them think they can kill you so they'll stick around long enough for you to finish them off. <br />
<br />
PoP put us further down the pvp ladder relative to most classes, probably moreso than any previous expansion did. The new spells and aa for most classes are far more useful than ours, and the easy xp made it trivial to stockpile lots of aa.<br />
<br />
I'll assume that you'll be fighting decently geared/AA'd people. Classes to avoid are bards, sks with DT, wizzies with full spellbooks and lots of AA, rangers with class title, and necros. Bards are the most broken thing in pvp ever, and any bard with a pulse should pretty much never die in pvp. Ervaj's Lost Composition is just plain unfair. Avoid the other classes for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
Other classes require a bit more skill to pvp well with at high levels, and you will have a chance to kill them. I won't bore anyone with a pvp strat guide. And besides, dueling != pvp. Attackers always have a huge advantage in pvp because they come prepared, and their targets are generally otherwise occupied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thing that really made me wanna talk about this is a few nights ago i owned that cleric that beat me so long ago , i mean i was just toying with him . I unslowed him at a point to give him mroe of a chance. <br />
<br />
It was very satisfying , ive also had a few cocky warriors pull me into a arena latey and it was nice to put a hurting to them. Im new to this world though.  <br />
<br />
So whats our role on a PURE pvp server?  run with a pack ?  we a enchancement class ? We get picked on ? I eman , are we enough of a pain in the ass to kill that we dont get jumped on every zone in ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">In any situation involving two groups (or more) pitted against each other a shamans main strength is dropping malo on every single opponent. Starting with whoever is at the top of the hitlist. <br />
<br />
After that your mission is rooting/blinding and generally staying alive. If time permits drop some cures/heals. If you find yourself unhindered by melees breathing down your neck, you may even drop some slows on rogues and rangers. I usually opt for disease slow since people have lower dr than mr and it is harder to remove.<br />
<br />
In most mass pvp, well at least the way it works on Vallon, the absolute majority of dmg inflicited comes from melee damage and wizards nuking. To some extent also necros draining. Tash/malo/snare/root a target, sic almost everyone on that target, beat it into a pulp, choose a new target. Pets mostly serve as interuption factors against non-targeted casters to keep them busy. Paladins and SK's strafe out and keep non-targeted casters from doing anything constructive. <br />
<br />
Mass pvp hitlist, order of killing importance (my subjective opinion). + means a class pvp strength which is harmful to you, this is the reason the class needs to die fast. - is a STRONG reason why the class is hard to kill and thus goes lower on the list. You dont want to spend 15 minutes chasing a selod bard around while their wizards are tearing you up.<br />
<br />
Prio 1<br />
chanter: ++tash, +rapture<br />
shaman: ++malo, +/-heals, +cures<br />
-----<br />
Prio 2<br />
wizard: +heavy nuker <br />
cleric: ++/-the healer, -invuln<br />
mage: +mala, +pet<br />
necro: +nukes, +pet<br />
-----<br />
Prio 3<br />
bard: ++group selos/resists, -hard to catch, -massive resists<br />
rogue: +massive dps, -they usually die off on their own to dmgshields if not catered to by a healer<br />
ranger: +massive dps, +snares<br />
druid: +nukes, +snares, +heals in a low AC package<br />
beastlord: +pet (i guess)<br />
-----<br />
Prio 4<br />
monk: +massive dps<br />
paladin: +dps, -heals/cures/LoH/invuln in a high AC/hp package<br />
sk: +dps, +gimptouch, -invuln and high AC/hp. Taking out an sk before he uses gimptouch is worth two kills, at least.<br />
warrior: +dps, -massive hp/mr<br />
<br />
This is just my opinion, and it all looks too scientific, but I don't know how to convey this info in any other way without cluttering it up and making it a novel.<br />
<br />
It loosely takes into account the classes strengths/weaknesses and how they work together. Many of the class rankings depend on them having special or situational abilities or pets up. Or simply being a notorious pvper. Example: Bards indoors arent ranked very high on the kill list at all. A bard grouped with four rangers and a cleric needs tash/malo/snare asap.<br />
<br />
I'm sure i forgot some stuff so feel free to flame/ask.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: we dont do much, if any, buffing during actual pvp. Sitting down usually means you get instantly double slashed for 200+ a pop and stunned. Only people you'll ever see sitting down are invuln clerics/necros switching spells, or sometimes the chanter in minor illusion floating in the dungeon roof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Necro lifetap dots got nerfed I think, it no longer works on players or something. I out healed and beat 2 65 necros in the arena a few days ago. They spent ~10k mana all on nukes/taps... I just healed until they went OOM and forced them out.<br />
<br />
As far as pvp goes...<br />
<br />
Hybrids<br />
-Leave them alone, any hybrid worth their money will cream you. <br />
<br />
Rangers will take you down with bows unless you use terrain, and even then, there's not much you can do to them unless you get lucky with chain blind and resists (HIGHLY unlikely, since they are faster, and can STILL fire arrows at you blind).<br />
<br />
SKs will burn you down in under 10 sec if they have UT3. If not, it's just going to be extremely painful for you--trying to stay out of melee range while his dots are doing their work. Again, blind and VP are your only options, if they get resisted (and you don't die in 5-10 sec) you are screwed.<br />
<br />
Paladins are highly annoying. It's like playing quake against somebody who has God mode. Nothing you do works on them.<br />
<br />
Bards are even more annoying than paladins. Not only do they have god mode, you can't get away from them.<br />
<br />
Pure casters<br />
- You've at least got a chance.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are either gods, or the &quot;suckiest sucks that ever sucked the suck&quot; to quote Homer J. Simpson. Pray you found the latter.<br />
<br />
Wizards as long as they don't have MB, you've got a chance. Their highest nukes are difficult to resist, but they take a decent amount of time. If you can use rains to force them to move (thus not casting) and stick BoS on them, they are toast. <br />
<br />
Mages are easy. Blind = pet go bye bye. Mage spells are resistable, and like wizards, if you force them to move and kill with DoTs, there's nothing they can do.<br />
<br />
Necros aren't difficult either--as long as his gear doesn't out match you too much. The only way a similarly eqipped 65 necro can beat a 65 shaman (full spells) is by luck. All of his dots are curable/dispellable, and his nukes aren't all that. Your first focus is to keep yourself healed, use SC/pet to interrupt his casting, rains to force him to move, and keep your health up against LB. Hopefully you'll do enough damage to him so his LB doesn't hurt that much.<br />
<br />
Priests<br />
- You are in luck.<br />
<br />
Clerics are annoying. They heal a lot, summon their hammer a lot, but they are  harmless. Their nuke damage can be out healed easily, their hammer can be meleed to death. It'll take a while, but if he doesn't flee you can kill him--eventually.<br />
<br />
Druids are sucky. Dispellable dots, and resistable nukes. If he sticks around he's toast.<br />
<br />
Shaman vs shaman is nothing short of retarded. You can sit there for a year and half throwing everything you've got at eachother--and still maintain 90% mana, forever. The only way to kill another shaman is to have better gear and more toys--dark mace of thought is very effective against other shamans, and clerics too.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oops, forgot the pure melees.<br />
<br />
Pure melees--you can kill them, every single one, without any issues what so ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monks with a great staff and some aaxp will be hitting you in the 200-400's. <br />
<br />
Rogues with front backstab abilities will be nailing you the same.<br />
<br />
A warriors resists for magic will make landing most roots and blinds almost impossible. <br />
<br />
Hybrids will nail you almost everytime.<br />
<br />
SK's are pretty much a given you run from them if you cant get root to land<br />
<br />
Rangers will just kill you unless you can take the 900+ damage arrow hits log enough to get them malo'ed and rooted.<br />
<br />
Beastmaster pets at this level have a very nasty stun proc making it hard to do anything.<br />
<br />
Even after malo I have a terrible time landing ANYTHING on any level 60+ melee with good resist gear. Since most of our spells take 5+ seconds to cast you dont have time to sit there and try to land dots until after they are rooted or blind.<br />

If you are losing to pure melees...you need help.<br />
<br />
There's nothing a pure melee can do to kill you, none. Rogues may come close if you let them proc poison on you and have crappy gear, monks may come closer if they proc t-staff (which, btw, is a sucky weapon nowadays, only the proc is remotely useful), wars won't get close enough unless they are berserk and manages to crit with an arrow. <br />
<br />
200-400 is nothing to a decently geared shaman unbuffed (and you should be at least self buffed). If you cannot avoid a pure melee long enough to Q yourself (3 sec or lower cast time, depending on your AA/focus) every few minutes or so, you need to learn how.<br />
<br />
Again, if you have issues with pure melees, you need help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure I can run around for half an hour, but what's the point?<br />
<br />
Not to mention those monks with abashi staff that dispells what 5 slots? + Their purify body crap is wonderful when you've finally managed to stick something on them. <br />

Oh there is risk.  A superbly equipped pure melee with resists nearing 200 will tear a shaman up if he has a clue how to play his class.</div></div><hr />

Ever heard of insta clicks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Shamans are not losing power in PVP.  New torpor actually gives us mobility where before we didn't have it.  A new heal that's actually worth a damn gives us the ability to instant heal in situations where 300 a tick doesn't cut it.<br />
<br />
The addition of deathtouches is a problem obviously if you're lacking in the HP department but its a problem for everyone, not our class.  Get an earring of the frozen skull.<br />
<br />
Spiritcall = clerics die.  Whereas before all we could hope for really was to land a blind in solo pvp and hope that the cleric was *really ****ing stupid*, now we have an ability that pretty much kills their ability to channel.  This applies to any caster, but against clerics is especially nice.<br />
<br />
Bards are a pain but what else is new.  At least with the addition of VP we have an alternate way of rooting them.<br />
<br />

IMHO if you say *we* suck at PVP you really meant to say *you* suck, and you're just not getting creative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I loved those events where it was just an all out battle between all classes.  Occured in Arena I believe.   Its amazingly fun.  Groups are formed on the whim, alliances made and broken.  Healing a guy that was trying to kill you earlier only because you see him attacking someone that was hurting you worse or is more dangerous.  It limits those One Shot abilities dramatically.  Because sure you're a big ole SK, that can kill a person with one touch.  But once you use that you have 100+ other people to contend with.  So you have to save it for those dire times.  On Veeshan, the last one I had been to ended up. In which the last remaining people were all members of the same guild who had just basically watched each other's backs and out lived everyone else.  But in the end, THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE.  Think the number got down to 2 clerics, a shaman, and an enchanter.   All three attacked the shaman though, since he posed the most threat.  If it wasn't a collabrative effort, our class probably would have been victorious.  Ended up between the two clerics, they were taking too long to kill each other so the GMS set Tiger NPC's on em.  They should hire a few people to just set that up on a Timed weekly basis.   (sorry for lack of indentation, im in a rush, will fix later)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My question to Kylt and Boinshar is how do you kill a pure melee that has over 200+ resists at your level? I don't have malo but even that doesn't seem like it's enough to lower their resists to a suffecient level.<br />
<br />
I don't PvP much but the last time I tried was against a 61 monk with a Tstaff and it wasn't even funny. I couldn't land a single spell. He just ignored pet and beat me down so quickly, that stun on staff is ugly :(<br />
<br />
I'll admit I suck at PvP so I'm looking for hints on how you two guys are so successful against melees that can pretty much resist anything we cast.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>mediman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">On pvp servers, malo as well as other debuffs do 1.5 times normal to resists.  So Malo takes away roughly 67 to relevant resists, and malos is roughly 82 to resists.  Very few people run around with 200+ pr or dr.   If  you cant stick root on them, you can prolly channel off a BoN, and kite them around with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I like to malo/decay (debuff) stack dots, slow, and melle them to death (2hander recomended).  Blind spells are very useful if they land too.  I am not 65 but I cant see how you get weaker.  Your spells are stonger and you get huge debuffs.  Keep up a cancel magic and strip their buffs and you should have a much better chance of landing spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>mogug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Well Boinshar not everyone has the best gear, not every shaman has all thier spells, and not every shaman has 120 AAXP.<br />
<br />
I can get away from just about every class. thats not the problem, the problem is taking the damage necessary to land a 5 second cast time debuff THEN try to get your roots and blinds to land ... IF you cannot root or blind the melee then your wasting your time.  Sure I can probably channel through a Ultor ... but then I have to run around for 2.5 minutes waiting for it to do its work IF it lands.<br />
<br />
Also, some of these melees DO have insane resists ... what do you do when you run up on the melee with resists so high nothing lands but malo and ID? I would love to hear your words of wisdom Boinshar.<br />
<br />
Hell against a great deal of these melees with the great resists they are hitting so fast I cant channel Tnargs.  No I agree I do need help as do all shaman in the PvP arena. Our spells are to easily resisted and take MUCH to long to cast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Against a necro. When i was younger. I sicked my dog on him first off, not his pet.  Rooted and nuked his pet to death just ignoring whatever he was casting on me, think it was life taps.  Than i just cured and healed, chased after him a little, he'd panick and start to run.  Dog ate away his health andin the end he ran out of mana, he'd regain it from stealing it from me. And i'd just heal myself.  Difference was that no one was interrrupting my spell casts.  And if he stopped running from me I had slam ready, sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't.  Think he was OOM when i had 3/4's health and a 1/4 mana left.  So i just cold nuked the last bits out.<br />
<br />
Against a melee, I cheated. Well i guess its not cheating, i'll try to explain.  I used an insta cast Malosi stick I got out of kedge.  Easy to get they're no drop, every time I feel like popping in there to help someone kill phinny i always end up getting one, Use them on a semi regular basis (although i admit to having preserved my last one for quite some time).  I figure its not really cheating, just using your armor to your advantage, something melee's always do.  Once his resists dropped it was easy, he'd chase me around in a circle, get annoyed by my dog biting him, and as soon as he turned around. Blind spell, Slow, blind spell slow, till one sticks.  Once he was slowed he was done.  Against a melee, you're only task, your ONE and only task, is to get his Resists down, and Slowed.  After that you can go make some coffee mid fight.   Trick is using whatevers in your means to Slow down his process, or speed up yours in getting those two spells on him.   A  pure melee has up to what 5khp at most?  Thats a 3 minute fight for us when it comes to DoT's. And if you have your epic, and/or a JBB, than you're golden.  Although I've never had a JBB.<br />
<br />
I've had very limited experience with melee.  And I admit i got my Arse handed to me alot more times than I've won.  But the above is exactly what i've done in the times that i've won.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Mogug,<br />
<br />
If you don't have all your spells, not extremely well equipped, and do not have 120+ AAs... then you should be picking on people your own size, instead of trying to kill someone way out of your league. If you have 2500 hps unbuffed and 50 aas, then pick a fight with someone who's tov/early luclin geared, not somebody with 7k unbuffed hp, 240+ on all resists, 8 AoB items, and a 50 pt innate regen.<br />
<br />
Against melees in general, your best bet is several deeply stacked DS, your own melee (don't even bother if you are not *extremely* good at jousting), and lastly your pet. This is assuming the melee has a large supply of various potions.<br />
<br />
If you are going against someone with 240+ on all resists unbuffed, then you must understand a few things. 1) Don't even bother to expect anything resembling a quick fight, we are talking 20+ min if you are lucky, hours if you REALLY want to win. 2) Most of your time's going to be spent running around using lag, terrain, etc to lose him long enough to heal/summon pet/rebuff/re DS etc etc. 3) If you get impatient and try something stupid, it's just going to take you that much longer to recover. 4) you better have a collection of FT and focus items at your disposal, mainly spellcasting haste focus (haste of mithanial, something of the nightwalker (30% beneficial haste form VT pants), book of contemplation etc etc), extended range focus, and efficiency focus. 5) Pick your battlefield, preferably very hilly with lots of trees/houses.<br />
<br />
4 insta clicks' enough to counter any dispelling in a 1vs1 fight, no matter what charged items they bring. 3 will do if you don't have 4.<br />
<br />
In the end unless you do something really stupid, or if they get insainly lucky, you'd always have the upper hand--they can't catch you, that means they can't hurt you unelss you let them.</div></div><hr />

When was the last time you went up against a superbly equipped melee, one on one, with both parties fully prepared?<br />
<br />
Never?<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
The question presented was not &quot;How do I deal with the gankfests in red severs?&quot; or &quot;How do I kill a superbly equipped melee when he jump me in the middle of south karana, right after I beat off a group of 3 people, so my hp/mana's at 20%&quot; or &quot;how do I pvp on red servers.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was &quot;how do I kill superbly equipped melees.&quot; So, unless you have experience doing that, everything else is irrelevent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you 100% there.<br />
<br />
My comments were in regards to fighting these melee's on a pvp server. (that's what Mogug's comments were regarding) 99.9% of the time we have to fight these melees, they are with 1 or more groups. Usually raid buffed and ready to tank the gods. They have healers and other support classes. God forbid if they have a bard in the group. I'm just not going to kill a melee with 7k hitpoints or more if there is a healer around.<br />
<br />
But yes...I agree. If I am bored and could get a melee to meet me someplace where we could both prepare ourselves for an uninterrupted fight, the 1 on 1 fight would be in my favor for sure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">so on a red server , you dont really run around alone ? You always travel in packs ?  <br />
<br />
It really depends on where you are in the game in regards to your guild. I speak from an end game raiding guild. We raid first and exp second. <br />
<br />
In the end game of EQ, our server is really guild vs guild. We have no allies which makes everyone else our enemy and they are kos. We don't share zones with other guilds.<br />
<br />
In my opinion there are 4 top end guilds on my server. My guild is not #1 but not #4 either. <br />
<br />
We do tend to travel in packs. <br />
<br />
The strength of the wolf is the pack, the strength of the pack is the wolf <br />
<br />
We all compete for the same mobs. There is no rotation. If a mob spawns that we want, we quickly mobilize. We move to the designated zone and set the gameplan. If no other guild is there, then we can proceed to kill the mob and all is good in the world.<br />
<br />
If we arrive and find another guild getting set up to kill the mob, then we prepare for a battle. We zone in and engage our enemy. May the best guild win.<br />
<br />
We attempt to battle these other guilds with honor and we expect the same from them. For the most part this is common courtesy on our server. If we die, we stay out of the zone until the fight is over or one guild has conceded the fight. Once the fight is over, the fallen guild is usually rezzed and given a TL out if they choose. Once a zone is lost, we do not stay in the zone.<br />
<br />
These fights are usually fast and furious. If you aren't quick, you are dead.<br />
<br />
An individuals actions in pvp not only represent them as a person, but the guildtag they are flying. For the most part, the top end guilds don't tolerate any lame tactics from their members. (there are exceptions to this rule) Guilds that choose to allow these types of members find that they don't recieve the same courtesy that other guilds get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Duel a bard with psalm of veeshan, and tell me they don't need a pvp nerf.  <br />
<br />
Yes...Bards suck to fight in pvp. I hate them with a passion.<br />
<br />
he was having a hard time the other night cause level 65's would come and kill him then camp his corpse  <br />
<br />
If that were to happen to any member of our guild (or the other guilds for that matter) You would see an angry guild show up in force and rectify that situation immediately. (and it has happened)</div></div><hr />
