Normally I would agree on new expansions, but with this one I am finding more and more on my server are doing a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude with GoD.<br />
<br />
For the record, I am level 65, guilded, not retiring, and NOT buying the expansion when it is first released.  While I do know that there is much misinformation about what exactly will be released, I am also very aware that this much negativity has a foundation.  <br />
<br />
Silly idea, but ...  I wish we had nominated a couple of shaman from here to purchase GoD, test it, and report back the findings.  THAT I would have donated to.  I would rather lose $2.00 for good knowledge, than $30.00 to a corporation that is laughing at me.<br />

To actually need the slow, there would have to be situations where we need the -40 MR, or the fast cast, or both. Can you honestly see the developers tuning encouters to that, so that a shaman is almost required, rather than optional?</div></div><hr />

Sure, but you have to realize something, your in a guild, who, by your own admisson, is &quot;done with time&quot;.<br />
I take that to read as you and your guildies are in essence finding things that challange you in GoD; but what about the average non elemental shaman? believe it or not, we do make up the majority of players, that seems to be slowly changing with pick up raids, back flagging etc, but who is it that needs a bone thrown their way? People looting toys with +25 to all stats and +250 hit points or people happy with Tae Ew armor?</div></div><hr />

when i beta tested Ldon, the spell that where there , are the spells we now have. with only minor changes. hope and see is not a good idea. though the spells then where actually good. but there wasnt many spells, and most work was on the content.<br />

Not me. Some members of my guild goaded me into buying LOY. We<br />
were a few nights/week, but only for a couple of weeks. All that's<br />
left of that expantion for me, is spells and AA's. The content is<br />
worthless. <br />
<br />
I haven't seen any spells or AA's in GoD that make me want to buy it. <br />
<br />
Level 65 Shaman, about 70 AA's, flagged for most Tier3 stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've also tested this spell, and, let me tell you, it is damn good.<br />
<br />
It is one of those things you look at on paper and go &quot;hmmm ho hum whatever&quot;.  But once you start using it, you just incorporate it into your playstyle and never look back.<br />
<br />
Believe me, you *will* be converted once you use it a few times.<br />
<br />
First, it's almost never resisted (maybe once in 100 casts for me).  It's difficult to quantify just how good it is to be able to slow a mob RIGHT NOW.  It also seems to be fairly low aggro compared to Turgur's... and even if you grab aggro, the mob is probably slowed.  I didn't have any SCS or anything, and I hardly ever stole aggro with this spell (and sometimes did with Turgur's).<br />
<br />
When adds come, you can alternate Turgur's and Nihil (or just nihil) and get them slowed extremely quickly... much more quickly than with a Time's Antithesis, even, due to resists.  It's like you malos/slow the mob in 1.5 seconds.. what isn't good about that?  This spell singlehandedly makes a shaman MUCH more effective a healer by being able to handle MULTIPLE mob pulls (shaman could always slow/heal effectively on 1-mob pulls).<br />
<br />
Also, when mobs mitigate partially or more, 60% becomes 30% and isn't all that big a gap between 30 and 37.5.  There are many situations where the slow can simply be your primary slow... you just let the cleric CH a little sooner and you crank out more dps.<br />
<br />
Finally, this addresses the situation shaman have talked about with &quot;tnargs loops&quot; and needing a faster heal.  Surprise!!!  You actually don't.  What this slow allows you to do is totally annihilate the mob's dps with one quick 1.5 second cast.  You can basically think of it as a new shaman fast heal... for those situations in, say, Earth, when 2 mobs come at you, a shaman with this spell can nihil/nihil fast, thus negating the need for a larger direct heal.<br />
<br />
For raids, the spell is pretty darn useless... but it is going to be a nice addition for addressing the PRIMARY problem shamans had as main healers, and that is dealing with when 2 mobs hit camp and you need to be slowing/healing quickly at the same time.  Even if I had Time's Antithesis (I don't), I think nihil would still see lots of use.<br />
<br />
My assessment of this spell has nothing to do with being Time or Elemental geared.  It's just good, no matter who you are.<br />

<br />
Hmm, I should point out I was grouped with an enchanter friend a lot of the time I was testing, so mobs being tashed probably skewed this figure (though they weren't always tashed).  It still seems better than just a turgur's check with -40 to me (the spell is innately resisted less than turgur's or sha's, I think, but how to be sure?), but it will need more testing once it goes live to really judge it.<br />

<br />
I disagree. I dont think this is meant to be that big of a deal. This is a spell that i think was meant for the #1 slowing class in the game. We always debuff then slow, its our biggest and really only defining role at this point and this is meant to speed up the malos/turgur cycle is all.<br />
<br />
I think it was a good thought from SoE but poorly implemented. This spell should be atleast 70% slow but really 75%. With it being so low its going to bounce off other slows and be over written buy other slows and my main bitch is that at 60% on a unmitigated mob ( which now that GoD is live we know alot arent ) its going to make a significant difference in DPS your MA will take. Also its not debuffing the mob at all so it will still require us to debuff the mobs with malos, cause lets face it, if you dont the wizzies start crying.<br />
<br />
This to me looked to be a replacement slow for us in EXP groups where we are slowing often and fast. the -40 is just taking malos out of the equation. But again, by making it 60% it pretty much makes it all null and void, in my mind anyway. I dunno, i have to really try it before ic an settle on a full opinion. I mean i can see how maybe this might be ok in LDoN adventures where the mobs are not super MR resistant, but just enough to be a pain in the but if you unmem malos.<br />
<br />
Like i said, once i get it and play with it, we will see, but the above is my current feelings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I think this will be useful in LDoN hards.  <br />
<br />
I don't know if that will make me as popular as 65 Beasts for LDoN or cure the fact that I stand around with my finger in my nose on raids with more than 2 Shaman but yeah it is an extra tool for certain jobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I had to go check it - after Chifari talked about hitting multiple pulls quickly, I thot I had misread it.<br />
<br />
For Nihil:<br />
Cast time only 1.5<br />
Recast is 6<br />
<br />
For Turgur's:<br />
Cast time is 3.0  (can be hasted)<br />
recast time is 6<br />
<br />
<br />
The difference in casting/recasting speeds is 1.5 to start, subject to any spell hasted that works on detrimental spells.<br />
<br />
Okay, you probably do not need to cast malos, which helps a lot when getting off the first cast of a slow.  Malos can almost fit in to the recast on turgurs, so ... I remain unimpressed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chifari - did you test it in Hard LDoN adventures?  If your experience of almost no resists was in hard LDoN or Elemental, then I get interested.  If it was in GoD, I know too little about resist rates there to reach a conclusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">but the point is it is worse than the beast slow, poeple will want beast instead of us for speed/better slow and dps. in fast pace group we other slow and bad dps..beast wins. SoE dont want shamans anymore. or they would give us some chnages so we can survive in a fast pace environment, that or their just completely clueless.<br />
<br />
when we could heal as well as druid in kuanrk you didnt see people saying hey we got a shaman lets not get the cleric. due to fact that shaman also put out nice dps.. now we dont do either.</div></div><hr />

BST has still fast casting slow and heck, personal experience shows that BST slow lands much more then my slow, even in cases when BST slows totally unbuffed mob with the first try, and I can't slow the sucker even after Malos/Malosinia/Tash and many casts. And now we should rejoice, we got a crappy spell which slows little, lasts little and will be overwritten by BST's the moment it lands. Whopee.</div></div><hr />

Hate to point it out but on MOBs like that a second healer will be much more efficient then someone taking 8ish seconds to slow them, unless they last at least triple the amount of time it takes to kill LDoN MOBs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for resists, I was solely testing in GoD, but some mobs were resisting Turgur's but not resisting Nihil.  The spell just &quot;felt&quot; very useful, which is a hard thing to describe/quantify.  <br />
<br />
To the poster who talks about recast time on nihil being 6.... the relevance of slowing the 1st mob without casting malos is just huge.  Boom, 1.5 seconds, it's slowed (and probably on you for a sec, but we can handle it).  <br />
<br />
I have no idea how this will work in LDoN hard, but I'd at least try it/test it before we jump to conclusions.  My gut is telling me the base check is better than turgur's, and it's effectively a lot better than -40.  i'm sure we'll know in a few days.<br />

Please?<br />
<br />
Look, this isn't rocket science. -40 is just that -40. The mob will resist this spell as if his MR was 40 points lower than it actually is while Turgurs will check against its base MR.<br />
<br />
Forget your guts, -40 is -40. It will land better than Turgur's and not as good as Turgur's after Malos or even Malo.<br />
<br />
It's a handy spell as I've said, but for christ's sake stop believing it will be needed to slow GoD mobs any more than you have had troubles slowing trash mobs in LDoN or PoP.</div></div><hr />
