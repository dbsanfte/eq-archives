<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Assuming that you do not have access to spectral parchies and had to buy your 63-64 spells, which would you get in order of priority and which would you just, NOT buy and wait till you can get one through a spec trade in?<br />
<br />
And of course your reasons :)<br />
<br />
Personally I won't pay 8K for Grp regen or 12K grp sta. Not sure about grp haste though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Edited out. Screwy board sent me quick reply to wrong thread lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In ascending order of preference (bottom one would be my first buy, price being roughly equal and reasonable):<br />
<br />
<br />
11. Strength of the Diaku - worst shm spectral spell<br />
10. Talisman of the Diaku - group bad spell is not a good spell, either<br />
9. Tiny Terror - still requires being grouped, not worth spectral prices<br />
8. Malicious Decay - useful for landing some spells, rarely worth the slot<br />
7. Blessing of Replenishment - regen not as important in PoP environment<br />
6. Talisman of Alacrity - worse haste than SLTW, but time efficient<br />
5. Tears of Saryrn - lots of damage, but standard rain restrictions apply<br />
4. Velium Strike - solid and useful nuke, especially good on raids, too<br />
3. Malosinia - solid upgrade, can also partially make up for a lack of malo<br />
<br />
2. Talisman of the Boar<br />
This would be the number one spell if you raid heavily.  Also, I hesitate to put it at number 1 just because of the availability issues.<br />
<br />
1. Breath of Ultor<br />
If you solo more than you group or raid ... this spell is an excellent choice.  If you group more than you raid or solo, then bump this down to number 3, and aim for ToB and Malosinia.  If you raid more than you group or solo ... then bump this further down still, and get ToB, Malosinia, Velium Strike, and possible Tears of Saryrn before it.  Because you talk about buying your SPs, I assume that you have limited planar access, and therefore are probably more likely to solo.  If I'm wrong, I am sorry - didn't have a lot to go on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks. This is the info I am looking for.<br />
<br />
Btw, reading the info on Malosinia, it seems like the same spell as Malosini except it debuffs for 10 more but cost 100 more mana to cast. Or is there something I am missing about this spell?<br />
<br />
It was on sale for 3kpp last night but after reading the info on the spell, I was not impressed enough to pay 3kpp for a +10 debuff. is there a higher chance for this spell to not be resisted over it's lvl 57 counterpart?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No it has the same resist check.  Actually I use it very often.  The 10 extra resist debuff does make difference when using rain spells and nukes, imo.  In exp groups i rarely mem malo and all unless going aagainst something I know is very MR.  Malosinia is nice, quick, and debuffs almost twice as much as malo for about the same amount of mana.<br />
This might be different if you are lower level though since spells are always harder to land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Exactly what I was going to say, Walruss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spectrals worth buying?  0 of them.  Buy sltw from a vendor, and you've got all the really good ones.  I got talisman of the boar (2nd best IMO) my first spectral, and didn't see another until I had 3 of my level 65 spells first, never missed a spell.  I've slowly filled them in, Ultor is a pretty cool spell, but unless you're soloing, it's worthless (2.6 min duration is insane).  <br />
<br />
Malosinia is worthless if you can get malos, I've yet to find a mob I can't slow with just malos in.  Malosinia was 2nd to last spell I got, but I still have never cast it once.<br />
<br />
Velium strike is the only one I don't have yet, but I can't stand the horrid cast times on our cold nukes.  I'll stick with the 61 nuke.  <br />
<br />
Roots maybe handy if you go for those things, I always preferred level 14 root until I got ornate pants (greater immob).<br />
Group shrink, group haste, talisman of diaku, all your typical &quot;occasionally useful&quot; things.<br />
<br />
IMO, save your money for 65's.  Any 1 level 65 spell is worth more than all our spectrals combined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the replies so far.<br />
<br />
Let me clarify on the malosinia issue. I do not have Malo only malosini. Is Malosinia really much better than Malosini? If the resists checks are the same but just 10 debuffing 10 counters more, is it worth paying for? If I had the spell off a sepc drop, yes I would use it. But is it worth spending xkpp just to get it or is Malosini still good enough substitute till you finally get it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Quit reading any further, Shadura has it pinned down, gutted and filleted. Perfect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, like Cakaris said, the spectral spells for shaman arne't that great.  Group Boar rocks for raiding and suck, but just costs too much.  BoU is great for soloing, but just lasts too long otherwise.  A lot of people don't like the cast time on VS - I find it useful in PoP.  <br />
<br />
As for Malosinia - at least in my mind the 10 extra points of debuff has made a LOT of difference.  Maybe its wishful thinking.  Not really sure.  YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">These are based solely on my experiences.  Talisman of the Boar being the best and Talisman of the Diaku being the worst.  As far as which would I buy or not buy that is really dependent on how much platinum you have.  Personally I would not buy anything below Talisman of Alacrity unless it was very, very cheap.<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Boar – Very useful on raids and in groups.  Single target works for groups though it’s a pain but group is a must for raids.<br />
Tears of Saryrn – Best DPS to use in exp groups.  Since pop came on a normal pull I cast malox, slow, then rain 2-3 times.<br />
Blessing of Replenishment – Maybe not as needed in pop but still extremely useful at 25 regen a tick for the group.  If a caster grabs agro for a round or two there isn’t much of a need to heal them with replenishment.<br />
Velium Strike-Pretty great nuke (for shaman) even if the cast time is fairly long and is great to use if rains aren’t an option.<br />
Talisman of Alacrity-I usually go SLTW in exp groups just because I tend to feel guilty giving 10% less haste but if we end up with 4 melee in a group I use it.  Also fairly effective on smaller raids where there is a chance an enchanter won’t be there.<br />
Breath of Ultor-Very nice for soloing but I tend to group quite a bit more since pop so it falls in the middle to low end of the list for me as its useless in groups.<br />
Malosinia-Pretty nice but not a huge upgrade from malosini in my opinion.<br />
Malicious Decay-Alright but again, not a huge upgrade from insidious fever.<br />
Strength of the Diaku-Cast it on the pet once in a while if I’m partnering or soloing for some more procs.  Haven’t done any real tests but it seems to give dogdog a few more procs anyway.<br />
Tiny Terror-This would probably move to number 2 or 3 if it was tgb’able but until then it will be fairly useless.<br />
Talisman of the Diaku-With focus of soul/seventh and primal essence no one really needs any more str/dex.  Only time I’ve used it is power leveling or buffing newberts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In order:<br />
<br />
1) Talisman of the Boar - It is so much nicer to just MGB it or go down the list of groups in the raid window and cast it, rather than having to deal with 40 &quot;sta plz&quot; tells a nice.<br />
2) Breath of Ulthor - uber soloing dot.<br />
3) Blessing of Replenishment - You'd really be surprised how much regen helps, even in PoP.  It is a very underrated spell, but I love it.<br />
4) Tears of Saryn - really decent damage.  Good for exp groups or raids.<br />
5) Velium Strike - See above.  This is the only one I am missing so I can't really say how good it is, but I have a pretty good idea.<br />
6) Talisman of Alacrity - I hope they bump it up to 60% haste, but even at 50% it is pretty handy.  Most groups I make have 4 or 5 melees so it is a real stress-saver.  Last weekend we were killing Cursed, and both our chanters were LD 5 minutes in to the fight.  MGB VQ faded so everyone was left hasteless.  My MGB talisman of alacrity saved the day, so this spell will always have a special place in my heart :)<br />
7) Malosinia - I never cast it in exp groups or soloing.  The only time you need it really is for raids, and I usually just let one of our 8 mages do it since they get bored.  My malos gets overwritten within 10 seconds of landing so I know someone is doing it.<br />
8) Malicious Decay - Rarely used but you will want to have it eventually.<br />
<br />
The othe spells:  Tiny Terror, Strength of the Daiku, and Talisman of the Daiku all get a one-finger salute from me. Don't waste your money.  (note:  when tiny terror becomes /tgb'able, it goes to #1).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like Talisman of the Boar because it makes buffing easier, I use Malosinia when someone else is handling Malos (raiding).  I would recommend saving your money for 65 spells, I havent paid for any of my 63-64 spells and will continue to not do so until prices drop dramatically.  I have bought 3 65 spells though and all worth the insane money I paid for them (Q, FA, Fo7).<br />
<br />
I also have petrifying earth, breath of ultor, blessing of replenishment, and strength of daiku, none of which I use reguarly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1. Talisman of Boar - stamina buffs are good, and being able to buff your group (or mgb your raid) in one click is better.<br />
<br />
2. Petrifying Earth - really a good root.  It lands easily, and holds for the full 3 mins more often than not.  Crowd control, or soloing this is a good spell.<br />
<br />
3. Breath of Ultor - this plus the 65 dot Blood of Saryn means you can solo again.<br />
<br />
4. Vellium Strike - finaly a nuke that isnt a joke.  Something to do on raids when they call NUKE!<br />
<br />
5. Blessing of Replenishment - 25 per pulse regen really does a lot for a group.  It reduces your need to heal by a lot.<br />
<br />
6. Talisman of Alacrity - group haste that lasts half an hour.  If there is no chanter in your exp group having this spell will make your life much better.<br />
<br />
7. Strength of the Daiku - cast on mage pets and watch them proc... a lot.<br />
<br />
8. Malicious Decay - If you are trying to land cloud of grummus this is as important as malo before a regular slow..<br />
<br />
9. Tiny Terror - its faster to shrink a group at a time than one person at a time, but without tgb its still one of the biggest frustrations I face on a raid.<br />
<br />
10. Tears of Saryn - good spell, resisted too often to be useful.  Good for adding damage in groups on mobs that die too fast for dots -if it isnt resisted.<br />
<br />
11.  Talisman of the Daiku - you cant cast the group version on pets, and players dont need this buff.<br />
<br />
Imbues are for completing your spellbook.  Without the JC aa you arent going to be making your own jewelry and risking a 10-40k+ failure -let the chanter do it.<br />
<br />
Swift Like the wind is a good spell, but you can buy it from a vendor... and I'd rather cast talisman of alacrity for double the duration and group effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So, is boar more rare then the others, or is it just more desirable, and thus harder to get your hands on?   I've at least seen all of the other 63-64 spells for sale on my server - not always at prices I'd be willing to pay, but at least they're there - but I've never seen Talis of the Boar for sale. :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So, is boar more rare then the others, or is it just more desirable, and thus harder to get your hands on?

<br />
More desirable, all of them are random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, know they're random, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's an even distribution...  Malo and Torpor drop randomly. :\  I know for even the 61-62 spells, I see some of them with 10 copies for sale, and some with 1, so I was kind of thinking that while the turn-in yields a random spell, it might not be an even distribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Haven't got all spectrals yet, so won't comment at all spells.<br />
<br />
For grouping Talisman of Boar, followed by Talisman of Alacrity (Celerity) is top.<br />
<br />
For raiding look for Talisman of Boar first.<br />
<br />
For solo Breath of Ultor is maybe first choice (don't have it yet  :( ).<br />
<br />
Malosinia is very situational for me, but i am still testing it. Actual i tend to 'normal' malosini for yard mobs (even PoP, 1 or 2 times is usually enough). For the more difficult clients (like UW giants in BoT imo) i try Malo during incoming and then Malosinia. Costs a bit time, but is usually a 'safe' way to proceed. With normal chain casting Malosini i would end up with 3 or 4 resists often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As i look at the recommendations, I think some of them are just plan off.  Diaku is needed more then Tal/Alacrity.  Some people, even in pop, dont have there str/dex maxed and need it.  While doing Tal/Alacrity bascially cuts 10% of your DPS.  It really isnt that hard keeping 4 melees hasted in a xp grp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">10% haste != +10% DPS... not even close.  Parse it out and see, its closer to 1-2% difference.  I prefer talisman of alacrity for the duration, mana savings, and casting time (1 cast vs several).<br />
<br />
Daiku I tend to keep up on my groups, but the effect of stats post 200, and especialy post 255 is minimal.</div></div><hr />
