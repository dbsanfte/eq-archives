<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I know that title was rather sneaky but I needed to get your attention lol<br />
<br />
I heard there is an Aussie guild on Prexus with a decent size membership that includes Asians as well.<br />
<br />
I think a name, Southern Armada, or something like that was mentioned to me. Does any of you on Prexus know of this guild or an Asussie based guild? If so, could you please post the website address?<br />
<br />
Tried various permutations of the above name as well as looking up Allakhazams guild list and no luck.<br />
<br />
Hope someone can help cause I need to join a guild that plays during my prime time instead of continually keep missing out on 90% of guild activity because I live in Asia.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />
