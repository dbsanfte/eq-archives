<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have always been of the mindset (not sure if it came from this board or not) that buffing agility ONLY affects your AC.  I've seen several threads (yes I used the search function) that show relativity between amount of AC and Agility.<br />
<br />
I am wondering, however, if agility affects damage mitigation or avoidance.  I'm not talking about CA or CS, I'm just talking about that stupid buff we get called wrulan.  If I give the main tank on a raid 60 agi, and his ac increases 5, will his damage avoidance or mitigation change above and beyond the 5 ac he gets from the buff?<br />
<br />
I've made it abundantly clear that I don't buff agi on raids.  If someone says the damage reduction seen is worth 525 mana per group and constant tells for refreshes, I will change my outlook on the matter.  Until then, I will consider that the shammy in my guild that says agi actually helps is merely having delusions and that it is nothing more than a placebo.<br />
<br />
Please help me clear this up, thank you in advance for your replies.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: if you have any links you'd like to give, that would be great too.  I only searched this board so if you surf others, links to them would be great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 5ish AC he gets from the AGI buff is Avoidance AC (Avoidance AC comes only from AGI and Defense). Armor and buffs other than AGI provide Mitigation AC.<br />
<br />
It might result in one or two attacks against him being misses instead of hits during the full duration of the buff.<br />
<br />
There is no effect 'beyond' the AC effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agility does give a small amount of AC, but the main function of agility is avoidance...thus agility = agile, being more agile means that your opponent will have a lesser chance of hitting you.  <br />
<br />
The higher your agility the less likely you will be to get hit, makes sense to me /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have asked this question before and gotten the repsonse it does nothing but raise your AC a few points to oh yes it helps you avoid hits better, especially with CA/LR. Now I haven't seen any logs to prove more agility does anything other than take up another buff slot so until I do, no one gets agility at least on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Someone needs to suck it up and generate some good statistical data.  Until then, the usefulness of buffing agi is impossible to validate and Wrulans etc will remain next to Invis to Animals in my spellbook. :p<br />
<br />
I have never had any feedback from melee classes saying that they noticed a difference between having agi buffed/unbuffed in combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nominally, Wrulan is there to raise AGI, which raise damage avoidance AC by a ridiculously small amount.<br />
<br />
The *main* use of Wrulan is to boost the other players confidence. Like all placibo, it's better not to discuss it too deeply with them :) <br />
<br />
When it comes down to it, it only takes a couple minutes worth of mana to buff a raid with ToWrulan anyway, a task that can easily be delegated to one of the sub-63 shamans to boot. In exp group, it's a throwaway buff you can do during combat. A happy groupmate is a groupmate that is more likely to stick by you when things turn nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Or you could go the other way and INSIST on casting AGI on your groups.  Convince them that without the AGI buff they will take *much, much more* damage over time. <br />
<br />
It's a complete lie, but at least shaman would have that extra edge when looking for a group.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sounds like most think courage boosts the rare and elusive &quot;courage&quot; and &quot;self-esteem&quot;.  These attributes are both player side apparently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since nobody knows, if it boosts AC, Avoidance (a lot, a little, if at all) then make the choice youreself.  I personally think there is an advantage but could not lay the proof in front of you.  And since damamge is random to begin with, I dont think you could prove AGI's effet with logs.</div></div><hr />

STR: determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and average damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills <br />

INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills; affects the amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights <br />
WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT. <br />
CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular) <br />
AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit.<br />

So, we know that Agility has an effect... but we dont know how much.  I tend to throw talisman of wrulan on my exp groups, at least when we start off -if someone asks for it when it fades I will recast, if not I will likely forget.  On raids, we dont usualy use it, as it takes a buff slot and has no visible effect on success/failure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Moggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Beeing a 51 Mystic i have to say that AGI helps a lot w/ dodge, i noticed also a strong difference with the tanking abilities of my pet if it have it or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Waste of mana, waste of buff slot, waste of little square in your spellbook, waste of parchment.<br />
<br />
The only person who asks me for agility is this rogue in my guild who is convinced that having wrulan on increases his dps by 40 =p Needless to say he gets ignored heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I honestly feel people take Agi out of perspective to certain degree.<br />
There are certain levels of ac that give increased mitagation/avoidance or whatnot. Look back at the effects of AC posted by the melee classes.<br />
The reason to buff agi is to take those people that are just below these levels IE you have somebody with 1090ac bufing Agi on them takes them over 1100ac which in turn bumps them into a new bracket.<br />
<br />
There is a fairly significant difference between 1090ac and 1100ac that I have seen on many parses done by tanks over the years.<br />
There are several other points this happens and it seems to depend on what mobs your fighting how much ac matters. That however is another can of worms and gets into how AC itself works.<br />
<br />
The people in those levels really will not be your tanks so it has a lot less value for them however on other classes in the 1000-1200 ac range you could be putting those people over a break point where it would benefit them.<br />
<br />
Now for justification to buff raids?<br />
Really if you even buff 2-3 people over a cap that could potentially save that char some damage saving heal/rebuff mana (if they die) its worth doing if you have the available Shaman power that it isnt a drain on resources.<br />
<br />
Does it have to be done? No not hardly.<br />
Does Agi have a huge impact? No.<br />
<br />
Can all the little things add up? Yes.<br />
<br />
Take 5-10ac off every piece of your armor and see how much difference it makes. Would you upgrade any slot of your eq for 5ac more in that slot with all other stats staying the same? If so then buff Agi ;)<br />
<br />
Really doesnt matter though. I would just rather buff it personally then spend time trying to explain it to others or try to know the ac levels of a 72 person raid to see if it would benefit them. They dont want/need it let them click it off.<br />
<br />
Hey I still keep my JB BP in a backpack for the extra ac off the clickie too. It all adds up.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Waste of mana, waste of buff slot, waste of little square in your spellbook, waste of parchment.&quot;<br />

Issue closed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Glek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The way i understand agility is like everyone has already stated... it helps damage migation. Now if i understand correctly there are 2 things that modify your AC. That being raw ac wich comes from your gear, and damage mitagion (defense skill dodge skill etc). and if u actually play around a bit with magelo for whatever various reason it will show that actual defensive skills can give more ac then raw ac gives u. ( of course this is to a certain point). The way it was explained to me the damage mitagion factor of ac is far greater then just raw ac, so if this is in fact true (i woudl like to see some parses as well) the agi buff could possibly be better then just a normal ac buff even if u get more ac from the ac buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">AGI is a junk buff to be dispelled by dragons, nothing more, it doesnt in any way effect how often you dodge, it effects ac in such a low way you wont ever notice the difference in dmg you take, <br />
SOE screwed this one up. in EQ AGI isnt AGI, it isnt used in any dmg avoidence rolls period. <br />
junk buff, =)<br />
<br />
the stuff in casters realm is bogus,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I just did a parse of me vs a slowed cliff golem for one hour. Damage per hit: min 57, max 169, average 108.<br />
<br />
Unbuffed, 123 AGI<br />
135 misses out of 433 swings = 31.2% miss rate<br />
<br />
Buffed, 183 AGI<br />
134 misses out of 418 swings = 32.1% miss rate<br />
<br />
Mob missed me roughly 1% more with AGI buff. Margin of error: I don't know. Conclusion: wheee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nytemare by your magelo your unbuffed ac is 1056.<br />
What was your AC on your parses?<br />
<br />
People that will see a difference will usually be breaking into a new table roughly every 50-100ac or so. So if for instance Agi put you at 1100ac or 1150ac your likely to see a small but noticable difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">AGI above 75 is a waste of a buff slot.  Move along, nothing to see here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">With my guild, usually everyone that should get agi already has an avatar procing weapon.  This ends up turning my agi buff into, often times, an agility increase of 0 to 20.  Why on earth would I buff a slot just so in 10 seconds after engage, he goes WAY over agi cap with avatar.  Die you lame melee and your lame buff requests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">No AC buffs, so 1056 vs 1069 with Wrulan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I buff my own agi when the additional AC will get me over a x50 or a x100 AC bump. In a raid I will do grp agi buffs if anyone in my group has a relaistic chance of having to tank for any significant period of time. If 'chanters or clerics ask for agi, they get it too, as parsed data shows that being nice to 'chanters and clerics increases mana regeneration and total hitpoints.</div></div><hr />
