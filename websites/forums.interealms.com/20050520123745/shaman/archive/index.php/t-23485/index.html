<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know the formula that's used to reward adventure points on a completed adventure based on level? For example, at level 65 you receive 51 adventure points for winning a normal adventure. What's the reward if you were level 64, or level 54? <br />
<br />
I ask these questions because what I'm really looking for is guestimations as to what the point reward will be for adventures (both normal and hard) completed at levels above 65, specifically level 70. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
LG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It varies per level, after 60 its like 2 more points per adventure. The differnence is that a 70 normal would be a 65 hard so the existing scaling probably won't be much of an indicator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, the reward varies by average player level, normal/difficult, and then the level of the player receiving the points. When I win a hard 60 with level 58-62 guildies, they get less points, but I still get 51.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen a chart or formula anywhere, though. And I was 65 before LDoN came out, so I have no direct information to contribute.</div></div><hr />

Are you sure Sam? I could swear that everyone in the group recieves the same amount of points depending on the average raid level. The only border that I know by hard is lvl 63. At and above average level 63 you get the 51 point adventure, below something like 26?. There are lower level adventures as well of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No, everyone in the group does NOT get the same points.  I two box LDONs frequently with a 65 shammy and a 60-64 monk.<br />
<br />
Also, let me say this -- it doesn't freaking matter who zones into the adventure first.  The adventure difficulty (i.e. how hard mobs hit in relation to the normal/hard selection) is based on AVERAGE LEVEL or some other basic calculation.  It doesn't generate the dungeon based on who freaking enters first.<br />
<br />
That's one of the most idiotic &quot;urban legends&quot; in EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
normal dungeons (hard dungeons bump up to next average level range)<br />
<br />
average group level of 53-57.99 ~18-22 points<br />
average group level of 58-62.99 ~28-34 points<br />
average group level over 63  ~48-54 points<br />
                    hard over 63  ~98~104 points<br />
(these are just rough estamates on points of what i remember close but probably not exact, however level ranges are exact.)<br />
<br />
points will varry on your level (possibly in relation to the rest of the group also) and possibly the type of mission or just a random occurance.<br />
<br />
never seen any solid numbers recorded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Definitely based on average group level.<br />
<br />
Definitely does not matter who enters dungeon first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't think it is based on average group level, but payer level. I've been many times on LDoN runs with few guildies, who are, for example, below lvl 63, occasionally we had one even at lvl 58, the minimum level which can group with 65's. At the end of a normal run, lvl 65 chars got 51 points, while some lower levels got less, one for some 30+ and such. Seems to vary with the level of the char, unless it got changed lately *shrug*</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your average group level is 63+, yes, all 65's will get 51 points and the folks below 65 will get the maximum points allowed for their level.<br />
<br />
If your average group level is below 63, the L65's will get less than 51 points.<br />
<br />
Try it sometime, drag a bunch of 58's through an LDoN.  Last time I did it I got like 44 points.  I don't remember exactly, it's been quite a while.  I suppose it might have changed, but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the dungeon level is set for average lvl of 58, then you only get 34 points at 65...sux<br />
<br />
Did one the other day with two lvl 58's, rest of the group was 65...<br />
<br />
Dont you just hate it when people are anon in pickup groups?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yea, might have been 34 . . . only did it once.  For obvious reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When your average group level is under 63, do a hard. You'll get the 51, they'll get something, and it'll be the same mobs as a 65 easy.</div></div><hr />
