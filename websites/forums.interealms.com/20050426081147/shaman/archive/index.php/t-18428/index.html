<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TheWiggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A freind of mine with multiple accounts has loaned his 63 shaman to me so I can can PL my 51 warrior to 60 and get some AA so I can apply to his guild. I'm very new to the shaman class but was hoping to get some ideas of where this team can PL together. I've seen Scarlet Desert and the Grey listed as decent experience spots, but good powerlevelling spots and hunting spots aren't always the same thing. Any ideas are greatly appreciated. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think your gonna find it tough to PL a toon after 51 but a few suggestions ..<br />
<br />
Have your pet assist after your warrior has done 51% of the damage.<br />
<br />
Make the DS potions ... @51 might be 25 point DS which can add up.<br />
<br />
Make sure you back your pet off she he doesn't do any damage if you grab aggro.  Maybe do outside stuff so you can use a horse/izzy.<br />
<br />
I think by 63 you might get some decient heals so you should be ok and slow + cripple + SLtW and your other power-ups should help.  Remember at this lvl things are gonna be tough and slow ... Its very hard to PL a 51 toon because the mobs that yield good exp are gonna beat him silly reguardless what lvl your shaman is =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here are a few ideas.<br />
<br />
Jaggedpine Forest.  I still level all my toons to 52 here.  At 51 the majority of the poachers are dark blue (might get an occasional light blue).  XP per kill is decent, but most importantly there are about 20 poachers with a decent respawn time (no way I've ever cleared the entire camp) and they're rogues so they hit for crap and they have very low hp.  Grind grind grind here, and you can do 51 in about 2-3 hours.  Fast kills are the difference, and it'll let you get used to 2boxing the shaman since the chance of dying is about zero.  <br />
<br />
After 52, there are lots of spots you can try:<br />
<br />
Dulak - again, usually unlimited number of mobs, with decent xp-kill ratio.  <br />
Velks - poor xp-kill ratio, but if there aren't many folks there, you'll again have a high mob count.  Spiders are low hp and again hit for crap, so if you're still getting used to the 2box it's an easy spot do.<br />
PoJ - Good xp-kill ratio, but the problem is mob quantity.  PoJ basement is going to be the best, but it'll test your 2box ability.  If you can hold down the basement, it'll probably be the fastest xp you can get for what you're doing.  Chance of dying = high.<br />
PoN - higher xp-kill ratio, but dangerous.  Mobs really hate slow here.  I bounced a slow with my 58war/56shaman and I was toast in 4 seconds.  The main problem I have with planar xp is that mobs hp is too dang high to churn them quickly. But if you can handle it, it'll be good xp.<br />
The Grey - I found the Sun Reavants to be decent xp.  Problem with The Grey is that it reportedly has a negative ZEM (ow) and of course mobs have Luclin HP's.  Double ow.  Usually high level PL'ing and Luclin aren't used together, with good reason.<br />
Nadox - never tried this, but certainly talked about enough to be worthy of a shot. <br />
PoV - you've got the making of a great group once you hit 55.  Try getting some others to group with you and you'll see xp flying by.  I wouldn't try with your 2box setup though, unless you enjoy dying.<br />
<br />
Guess the biggest problem is that wherever you go, fast xp in this setup will be hard to find anywhere. The 50's are always a pain - there's really no fast way through other than just doing it.  My ogre warrior did 1-52 in 3 days /played.  It's taken 8 more days /played to go from 53 to 59.  While I've spent lots of that raiding and in LDoN's where I got 5% xp in 2 hours, there's just no getting around the fact that the 50's take time.</div></div><hr />
