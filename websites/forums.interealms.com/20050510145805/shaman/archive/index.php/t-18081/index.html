<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was foolin around on 1 of my twinks on Saturday  morning before raid time, and was getting extremely bored, so i logged onto Einnod and figured I would go to OS and kill some greenies there, maybe hit the crypt and try for some suck loots. On my way there, I see a friend of mine(necro) in EJ apparently trying to solo sev. So I start talkin to him in ooc and in tells after I leave the zone. When I arrive in OS, he tells me that we should camp the fungi tunic together. I hadn't even thought about that while I was on the way there. So I say alright, I'll meet ya down there, come whenever you're ready. So I head down in the sewers, summon my pet and buff him up. Clear my way in to the fungi spawn, where there are 2 priests and a reaver popped. Oh joy, long fight ahead! I ended up getting 2 adds during this fight but ended up winning without too much difficulty. I kept the wanderers cleared, and the temple starts repopping. Then I hear in raid channel, &quot;Ok everyone, head to VT now!&quot; Then, immediately after that, the king pops! Woohoo! Fungi tunic for me! I kill him real fast, loot my tunic, gate, and bank it, then head to VT.<br />
<br />
We clear our way in, kill 2 named, and the other 65 shaman has to log. So now it's just me and a 62 shaman(twink). We set up for the next named 5 minutes later, and what does he drop? Ancient:Scourge! WOOHOO! It defaults to me! /happy dance<br />
<br />
We kill another named, then people started gettin real tired. We let a few mobs gate and get trained and stuffs. So we decide to call it a night and come back the next day.<br />
<br />
So Sunday rolls around, and I got time before we raid. I log on my twink and a friend's druid and head to OS to PL myself. I get there and start PLing, then I pull up track just to see if i'm missing out on anything. Lo and behold, the king is up! Yep, that's right! I quickly shout for a camp check and no one is there. So I log off my twink and run Ein there as fast as I can, and barely beat a bard that was racing me there. I kill the king, and loot my 2nd fungi of the weekend! buahahaha! I stay at the camp for a while, then decide to evac to entrance and PL my twink some more. Then raid time rolls around, so I log off the twink and back onto einnod. Run to VT.<br />
<br />
I arrive at VT, kill our CoHer and have a rogue drag him up to a pally that had camped out at a safe spot up there. he rezzes and we start gettin CoHed up. An hour and a half later, we arrive at the first named of the night, who promptly drops a Umbracite Swarm Orb! (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12413) Woohoo! The only 2 shaman on the raid are me and the main shaman of the guild, who already has 1! Wow, I'm a lucky shaman!<br />
<br />
Oh, what a great weekend that was.</div></div><hr />
