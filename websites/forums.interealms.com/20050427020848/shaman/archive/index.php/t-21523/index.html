<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Waalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
  1) I am runnin out of places to hunt,all the normal places are so borring i can't stand it anymore.<br />
<br />
 I was so bored I even went up to PoH and soloed yard trash for awhile.<br />
<br />
 Anyone have any ideas of a good challenge? or good spot to chill (not the normal spots).<br />
<br />
Basic gear is ornate legs,bracerx2,boots 53 AA goin up &quot;normal&quot; progression. c5 vp2 SM2 etc etc.<br />
<br />
  2) I am going to be leveling my 22 necromancer. decent gear,lots of +mana items. Anyone have any good ideas on where / how to pwr lvlin this lil beast?<br />
<br />
<br />
   Thank much in advancment =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My favourite spot to solo where I find it challenging, good XP and a shot at some good loot while not being overly too tough that I'll keep getting my arse kicked is Plane of Tactics. <br />
<br />
Not sure if ya tried it yet, or if you even have your flag but there's some safe spots in there you can pull singles to and root rot. There's plenty of guides up on how to solo there. XP is around 4-6% AA a kill, how long it takes to kill a mob depends on what DoTs you have at your disposal.<br />
<br />
Loot wise, If you hunt down by the Pens (Pit) some Ornate, Tact Bullwark, ID 4 ring for Hybrids, Highly Polished Gems for Bloodmetal earring, some other nice stuff....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Waalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye I have solod in poTact.<br />
<br />
I have done the pit (piglet and mobs in pit) I have done the mobs up top.<br />
<br />
  I do find  the loot here can be nice (piglet especially) but I do not find much xp.<br />
<br />
  well xp per kill is decent but kills are not exactly fast.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that will change whe nI get Bane (like 200 points short,I dont LDoN much lol).<br />
<br />
 Thanks for the reply =) But i find PoT slightly borring as well =(</div></div><hr />
