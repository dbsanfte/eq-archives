<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I managed to do this once with cann III.... then I tried again and killed myself heh. <br />
<br />
Obviously this has no real use cept' to be funny. Whats the threshold for knocking yourself out without killing yourself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If your health falls between 0 and negative 10 HP, you will be knocked unconscious.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is easiest to do if you have an array of HP items to choose from. Canni until your health is within a certain range, take off the appropriate 100 hp or 80 hp or 65 hp item and you are now unconscious!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i got to the point i could time it very well.<br />
nothing like FDing while waiting on a res or doing after you get resed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have gotten to negitive 9. With 3 people bandaging me, and regening 42 hp a tick.<br />
<br />
I had people comment that I am blinking insane. I have also had people Beg for bandges that I was hemmroging over here!<br />
<br />
Heh I have a cleric buddy that I have grouped with for almost 3 years. He has 210 bind wound skill. (Laughs)<br />
<br />
He told me as a cleric he has to be a master of all the healing arts.<br />
<br />
I love that little dwarf, he rocks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A bit out of topic, but has anyone noticed how you tend to 'slide' on the ground if you unconcsious/die running?<br />
<br />
I was pvping in the Hole and got knocked unconcious by a warrior beating on me... so i went sliding really fast along the floor, warrior misses me twice (i dodge once!) and i get a heal. He beats me unconcious again, and i go on sliding. Then i get another heal and finally manage to kill the warrior. Too funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With canni 4 and 5, it's REALLY easy to kill yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have blatently outright killed myself twice so far with Cann 5 and had a monster get a full nuke in after cann 5 and kill me. Lucky SOB.<br />
<br />
The guild is always amused to see &quot;Litchebane has been killed by Litchebane.&quot; At least the other a day a mage modrodded to death. She blamed it on lag so I am gonna try the same thing. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One of the funniest things when I was 20ish was grouping at the sarnak fort in LOIO and we had two shamans myself and an female iksar (First femal lizzy i had seen).<br />
<br />
I told her to see if you can canni himself to death and she insisted you couldn't.  She actually did it.<br />
<br />
That was hilarious.<br />
<br />
But she didnt think so.</div></div><hr />
