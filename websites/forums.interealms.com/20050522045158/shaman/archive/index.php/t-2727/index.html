<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I typically wait a level or two to begin using a new spell in a line.  Mainly this is because spells at a new level seem to always UP the ante on mana usage, and I found it harder to manage my health/mana.  When I turned 39 I felt that eventhough Togors was only 50 more mana than Tagars, I was seemingly always out of mana.  Not so much from the added mana cost, but due to the number of resists I was getting.  I swapped Togors a few pages back in my book, and started to use Tagars again.  <br />
<br />
Then I took three months off.  and promptly leveld to 49 where I noticed that I had been casting tagars for the last 10 levels. So I switched back.  Well I am now level 50, I have my epic, and I still seem to run OOM WAY too often.  Again because togors seems to bounce on those random MOBs that have, or seem to have, a few extra points of MR.  Not just once..but two or even in rare cases three togors resists.  I noticed on the spell listing on eqcasters, that some of the comments indicated that turgur's was not resisted very often.  Anyway I am wondering if Togors has too large a resist component for a regular experience group?  I am seriously considering going back to tagars for experience groups.<br />
<br />
As an aside I have been upgrading my equipment lately..of course with a mind toward AC and HP, and my HPs are now self buffed with STA and HoS are right about 1600.  I think I am noticing that my mana recovery has suffered since, in that I am leary of canning down below 50%-60%, eventhough It still leaves me  with a considerable number of HP.  Part of it may be that It takes a lot longer than it used to for me to regen my HP back to near full.  I guess I am wondering if anyone else has noticed this phenomenon, and if the Iksar BP I am saving for should correct the problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, a regen bp would certainly help.  I had fungi from 55-60, and it proved very effective.  As for the resists you're encountering, I'd suggest you ask the chanter to tash the mobs and keep malise memmed.  Just simple malise, doesnt cost too much mana or aggro, and just cast it on mobs you feel are pretty resistant.  But there is a big difference between tagars and togors, so you should stick to togors all the time.<br />
<br />
There is not that big a difference between turgurs and togors though.  One maxes at 70% slow and the other 75%.  The only major difference is casting time.  Turgurs = 3 seconds and togors = 5 seconds.  I've used togors up until 55 I believe, and I never had a problem until the pace started picking up and I needed quicker slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm still using Tagars at 41, Togors cost too much mana for it to be effective for me. A few resists and I don't have enough mana to apply all the DoTs I need without Cannibalizing down quite a few HP's. Being Iksar I need all the HP's I can spare.  Tagars sticks more for me after I use Malisement. I will probably switch once I hit 44-45 though as it is a more effective Slow. My mana pool isn't that large either which may play a crucial part for being LoM after certain battles. 135 Wisdom...as I'm going more toward the HP/AC route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One more difference- Turgurs has a longer duration (about twice as long as Togors).<br />
<br />
I've found exactly the same thing (most current slow not always worth it) now that I have Turgurs.  I don't know if there's a hard and fast rule, but I usually try this:<br />
<br />
Try Turgurs a few times.  If it bounces a lot (or if I find myself low on mana too often), swap Togors for it.  <br />
<br />
Try Torgors a few times.  If it bounces a lot (or if I find myself low on mana too often), swap Tagars for it.  I'm a little more reticent to make this swap, as the difference in slows is a little larger than the Turgurs/Togors swap.<br />
<br />
If you're mostly outside, a get a horse !!!  Medding while standing can allow you to get tons of mana back.<br />
<br />
Just for reference (at level 49 Togors gives 59% slow, Tagars gives 44.5% slow) <br />
<br />
Walking Sleep <br />
Decrease Attack Speed for between 23% (L14) to 35% (L60) <br />
Slow % = 20 + (level / 4) <br />
<br />
Tagar's Insects <br />
Decrease Attack Speed for between 34% (L29) to 50% (L60) <br />
Slow % = 20 + (level / 2) <br />
<br />
Togor's Insects <br />
Decrease Attack Speed for between 49% (L39) to 70% (L60) <br />
Slow % = 10 + level <br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects <br />
Decrease Attack Speed for between 66% (L51) to 75% (L60) <br />
Slow % = 15 + level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, sorry, turgurs lasts substantially longer than togors.  When you have like like a train of 8 pulls, best to rely on turgurs not only for the cast time, but also for the duration as killing all 8 mobs one after the other would take a while (if not using AE).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 44 when soloing Giants I use togors, stuff like kobolds in Sol B, I use tagars as they are wusses anyways.<br />
<br />
Depends on what I'm fighting really.<br />
<br />
And sometimes in groups when I don't think we need slows (cause crap dies fast anyway) but the tanks are bitching that I'm not slowing, I use drowsy :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I found 51 a rather frustrating level, I moved a lot of the new spells back a bit because of high resists.  But since 52 turgurs became my bread and butter spell, I pull with it and rarely get resisted.  Worth every bit of mana it takes.  But it makes me happy my wis is usually around 190, because a highly resistant mob can drain you quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been using Togor's since i received it at 39 and have noticed very little if any resists on the mobs I fight.  Less resists than Tagar's even.  The only time I really noticed any consistent resists were fighting lvl 40+ mobs in my xp group when I was 44, and even then, i just threw the lowest malise on once, and it stuck the second time.  Now that I'm 45, Togor's gets resisted MAYBE once every 6 pulls or so and always sticks the second even without malising.  My regular tank (if you call a rogue a tank) noticed the huge difference between Togor's and Tagar's and will call me on it if I use Tagar's to see if he catches it.  It's that big a difference.<br />
<br />
If you're getting resisted alot, do like Nektar suggested and keep Malise memmed just in case you do get a resistant mob, makes a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When I find myself in a situation where I am running out of mana real fast because I am buffing/healing/slowing, I load up my good old level 14 slow - Walking Sleep.  From then on out if I am less than 50% mana I use WS, if I have more than 50% I use Togor's.<br />
<br />
Works great and no one can tell the difference most the time.</div></div><hr />

Your group can't tell the difference between a 35% slow and a 70% slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well he doesnt say what level he is, Togors is 49% slow at level 39.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good point, the thread started out talking about Togors versus Tagars but that may not be where he's coming from.<br />
<br />
Glad I bit back the sarcastic response that I originally had, lol... <br />
<br />
35% versus 49% may be an acceptable tradeoff if mana is low.  However, if in a full group, I'll generally just inform the group that I'm sitting one out to med and the cleric takes up my slack.  Sometimes the cleric needs to do the same and I'll heal for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm still grouping the dreadlands at 45, and I usually break out Tagar's rather than Togors, so I can keep my mana pool up.  Also, since I just recently began using the JBB, mobs drop quite a bit faster, thus in a group, in my eyes, a bit more slow % isn't worth it.<br />
<br />
I am of course referring to a two man group, usually me and a monk.<br />
<br />
But yes, swapping out slows is very viable.  If I find myself in a 5 or 6 person group, Im usually the main healer (yeeehaw, thats boring) and I have to use walking sleep to slow em down.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heh, when I went to DL at 43 I think it was.<br />
<br />
I got a group right off the bat, and boy oh boy did they suckass.<br />
<br />
So I decided I would maintank, as well as pull (train the group :D )<br />
<br />
They didn't like it much, but even at my fast pull pace of like 3 mobs per time, go get more each time 1 died, the exp sucked ass.<br />
<br />
It was fun scaring my group, but then I went back to good 'ol Sol B, spent about 1/2 an hour there and got way better exp then crap I was getting in DL for that hour to hour 1/2</div></div><hr />
