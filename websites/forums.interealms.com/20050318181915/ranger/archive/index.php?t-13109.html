<br />
I only had 1 hour today, no time to really find a group, but I soloed about 6 mobs.  First one gave me 1% xp in 62 (100% normal exp), then I switched over to AA xp.  OMG, I killed about 5 more mobs (AM3/EQ, Snare kite) and I was getting 6-7% AA PER KILL.  These were the blue mobs near the zone, skellies/larvae.  The xp is just sick here.  Hope they don't nerf it.<br />
Less than 1 hr. and I got 32% of an aa.  With KEI and any sort of Enchanter haste I bet I could get 50% an hour.  If druids can quad kite here I would guess that 4 quads would almost get you an aa.<br />
<br />
I still believe that in a good group you can get BETTER xp if you have a nice group, but for those times when you have only 1 hr. to play this may be a nice option.<br />
<br />
P.S. Don't even think about trying to melee these mobs, they hit for 400-500 and will kick your ass.  I average about 1300ish AC and 4200 hp (self-buffed) and they were kicking the crap out of me any time I let them get too close.</div></div><hr />

The exp is so good in there I would have expected them to nerf it already in the last patch but I hope they don't.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalgonar</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't seem to be nerfed and the most mobs still can't summon like it was feared the patch would give them ability to do.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing that this is why the exp is decent here. Also, most of the mobs are 61+ which VI had previously adjusted to give more exp.</div></div><hr />
