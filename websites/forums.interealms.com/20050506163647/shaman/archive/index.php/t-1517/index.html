<br />
We are unable to patch &quot;code&quot; right now because we are in the middle of making some changes to the basic structure of the game. This will delay fixes for system bugs and updates (such as Alternate Advancement Abilities and /commands). Please be patient until we can get these much-needed changes finished. Because these changes affect things such as the database that stores player characters, we're taking care to make these changes the right way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anything in this patch seem new or something that couldnt be done before? I think many were expecting this. But everything done so far seems like things they could have done all along. I wonder what &quot;basic structure&quot; was altered if anything at all. <br />
<br />
any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">same, this patch was crap.  Nothing but a ton of fixes that no one wanted but shoulda been done years ago.  More nerfs than anything really.  Didn't see one thing that couldn't have been done quite awhile ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yar, big dissapointment.  With caster balance looming about, and the 'big interface upgrade' that's supposed to go live (with SoL's release actually), this patch was a big dissapointment.  Game-fixes and nerfs  -  how weak.<br />
<br />
Also, wth is up with them nerfing items that are two years old anyhow?  Foresight was never VI's strongpoint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe the changes to the basic structure were to do with resolving the stacking issues. They said before SoL that they intended to address these problems, but that they needed to mess around with the structure because of the way spells had been coded. Or maybe i dreamed that.<br />
<br />
Still, the message they gave seemed to indicate more than the nerf fest they delivered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">EDIT:  I hit reply to a different thread and for some reason my post ended up here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think this patch was a set up patch.<br />
<br />
What I mean is they did a bunch of stuff to the code that didn't effect anything in-game now but will be used as a basis for all the cool stuff we were supossed to get when SOL came out.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think Darjeeling is likely right.  They've indicated a lot in the past that there were tons of stacking problems - some so complicated I seem to remember them saying they just couldn't fix it yet.  <br />
<br />
They added extra counters to spells a few months ago though, I thought that was the cure?<br />
<br />
There was a ton of stuff &quot;fixed&quot; though, and it's clearly good to do that at some point.  Looks like it was now.</div></div><hr />
