<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a level 33 iksar shaman, and currently am wearing Imbued Cabilis Scale Boots (AC 11 Str/Wis +2) and have obtained a pair of Kobold Hide Boots (AC 5 Agi +3 HP +10 Effect: Extended Affliction II).<br />
<br />
My armor is more than decent for my level, with a few upgrades needed here and there that I'll get in due time (I'm much more concerned with getting new spell levels on the whole).  In the Kobold Hide Boots I can still manage to buff my AC up above 750, so my question is this: Is the loss of the AC from the boots worth the effect?  Or should I play the armor switching game?<br />
<br />
Soloing in Marus Seru has kind of skewed my perceptions, as things there tend to be pretty weak after a slow anyhow, and I'm worried about what might happen when I hit 34 and try to solo elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Here's my Magelo as well, so you have an idea of what the rest of my gear is like.  I know what sort of stuff I need to round me out and keep me in good stead until I get up to some planar gear, but the question of my boots bothers me, like an itch I can't reach.<br />

Anyway, thanks for your time in reading this and any feedback (hopefully positive) you may have.<br />

I've no experience with focus items at your level, so no idea how helpful they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You won't be able to tell which boots you have on for damage taking concerns.  Your ac will be too similar to what it was before for that to happen.  But, you will do extra damage on each and every dot you cast.  You WILL notice that.  Go for the focus effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Juujuu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup, focus effect is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the feedback.  It would seem you all are correct in the focus effect being superior to the AC, as a few hours soloing in Marus confirmed.<br />
<br />
The Focus is most effective with adds there, as I root and dot them off a bit, and all my roots, slows, and dots lasting longer in this scenario are expecially helpful.<br />
<br />
Between this and my Chipped Bone Bracelet, I feel a need to find something with Affliction Haste on it to round out my abilities as a mass ermm...  Afflictor?</div></div><hr />

<br />
MAy be this is sacrilidge to some, but i have a sugestion for you:<br />
<br />
I personally think that shamans are weak at soling during the 30`s  i realise some may disagree strongly with that  :)<br />
<br />
I would recomend crystal caverns for lvls 33 to 39  thers some great exp AND fun to be had in that zone!!   One of the best ways to exp there is to keep an eue out for folk farming velium blocks or spider silks, they tend to be 40+ and the mobs they are killing are green   ergo sum   if u grp with them, you will get all the exp muhahahah!!<br />
<br />
btw velium blocks (off orcs) sell on my server for 30p each!!!  i mean the wt 18 stuff, wich granted is rare drop of CERTAIN miners, but i have noted that the same orcs drop the blocks, so u just learn where they are- a nice cash cow during yer 30`s<br />
<br />
Sell the blocks to smiths of 200+ skill&gt;&gt;&gt; those doing cultural armour.<br />
<br />
bah i should charge for this  :)<br />
<br />
LMAO  i just looked at yer gear-  was thinking hmm not tooooo bad for his lvl, then i saw the spear and the idol   BAH!  <br />
<br />
Thats a fab range item  well done!!i was not familiar with it   would that ba a drop from poF  ??  spill the beans plz  )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>zephreus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That idol is made with the pottery skill.. look at eqtraders.com under the pottery recipes if you want to know more about them.  There's one for each diety except Veeshan I believe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm a bit leery of Velious zones until such a time as I can get new spells (Level 34) and a few new pieces of gear.  Fortunately I have a few methods available to me for making money, so getting new gear shouldn't be a problem, it'll simpy take time.</div></div><hr />
