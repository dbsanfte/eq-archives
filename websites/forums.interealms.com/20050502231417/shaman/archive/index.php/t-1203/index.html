<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kronah Klump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, <br />
<br />
I have a Lvl 34 Troll Shaman and his wis is about 147. His base wis is only 83, so I think I have pretty good gear on for my lvl.<br />
<br />
I am wondering how important WIS really is? Should I keep focusing on getting high wisdom items or should I be looking for items with other stats like, mana, high ac, resists etc?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This topic comes up a lot: if you do a search you can probably find a number of posts that pose the same question. The general consensus seems to be that AC/HP is more important than Wisdom. Our spells, particularly slows, generate massive amounts of aggro and, without any kind of memblur ability, we need to be able to survive a beating from angry MOBs. Also, we are able to convert HPs to mana, so that our HP regen, plus the AC necessary to not lose too many HPs when being attacked, is really more important than the size of the mana pool.<br />
<br />
There is also another benefit, I think, to going for AC/HP over Wisdom. Many of our AC/HP items are melee-class rejects, and can therefore be had fairly cheaply, or involve uncontested camps, whereas Wisdom items are in high demand by Druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly, the higher I get, the less important WIS seems to me.  I tried to keep around 160 at level 35- but have lately just given up the pretense of caring... it's down to 130 now.  And that's only if I'm eating my +1 wis paladin pickles!<br />
<br />
For me, it's all about mana regen.<br />
<br />
By the way, I don't hear this proclaimed much... but aside from the usual mana regen tricks (hp regen through fungi/iksar bp/fungi staff, FT items, etc) getting a horse is a great mana regen tool (outside,at least).  Over the weekend, I bought the cheapest horse (8399 pp to buy, and sells back for 7619 pp), then promptly turned off the horse model.  By turning off the model you don't have to deal with a horse-head in your face, the slow acceleration, the slow running speed, etc.  Also, you keep the safe-fall benefit.  :)<br />
<br />
Now whenever I'm standing still, I'm medding.  This includes when I'm casting, JBB'ing, etc.  It's GREAT.  Huge mana regen... without having to cannibalize myself into carpal-tunnel hell!  I don't know what my meditating mana-regen is at my level, but my horse is basically a Flowing Thought (whatever my mana regen rate is) item for me, plus a nice &quot;Free safe fall&quot; item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bigguss, do you know if Verant has ever said they're going to change it so that medding on a horse does not work while standing? If not, I'm going to go buy myself one tonight, as it sounds well worth it for the reduced aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WIS directly affects the amount of total mana you have via an equation that includes your level. The same amount of WIS gives you more mana as you level.<br />
<br />
If you frequently run out of mana during routine play, you may need more WIS/mana items. 147 WIS at level 34 should be plenty.<br />
<br />
P.S. Kejek Catnip is your friend. Think of it from a RP standpoint: You are a shaman inducing a trance state of heightened awareness using an herb. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I was your level I had my wis about 180 or so.  I'd say that it helped quite a bit, since you have to rely on mana to kill things.  You can't JBB yet and your slow isn't powerful enough to turn the mob into a complete wimp.  It's nice to have the extra wis now, but if I were you I'd save myself money and hassle and start going for AC/HP gear asap.  As you get higher and higher level, your mana regenerating abilities just become ridiculous.  You don't need a large mana pool, because you regenerate it so fast.  Between my fungi and my regrowth and my natural barbarian regen, I regenerate 35hp/tick sitting.  I can cannibalize that into 18 or so mana per tick.  That's better than KEI :)  I know that I am very lucky to have a fungi tunic, but I only got it two days ago, and before that I was doing just fine.  It's nice but not a necessity.  As a troll you're in very good shape.<br />
<br />
Our guild's main tank has a low 30's shaman twink, and last night he asked me what my wisdom was.  I told him 139.  He sort of snickered at me and said &quot;lol, mine is 185.  How come your wisdom sucks so much?&quot;  I reply &quot;I don't need it.&quot;   He says &quot;How can you not need wisdom?  It determines how much mana you get.&quot;  I answer:  &quot;Ever seen me go oom?&quot;  *long pause*  &quot;good point&quot;  :D  It's a very valid point, too.  If you're smart with your mana and manage your HP/cannibalizing well, you'll almost never go oom.  The only time I go oom is when we are short on clerics and druids and they make me play healer :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">House:  No, I don't know if they have made any comments about that.  That was definitely the reason I checked the buyback value, though... only 780 plat at risk since I can always just sell it back if they change it.  One note: For horse buying, any CHA above around 110 is meaningless (8399 is the cheapest possible price on a horse, and I had only around 117 when I bought it.)<br />
<br />
Just remember to turn off the models... a horse is really annoying with them on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I never really worried about wisdom.<br />
<br />
It's not total mana pool, it's how quickly you can regen it that matters to me.<br />
<br />
High AC = less damage taken = more hitpoints = more hitpoints to convert to mana = more mana<br />
<br />
I went through a phase of high AC gear (CC gloves, for example) but now I'm a hitpoint junkie (coldain skin gloves).  My goal was 2000 unbuffed hitpoints, in order to take advantage of Can 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally, I think WIS is just as important as AC/HPs/etc.<br />
The trick is to find a balance.<br />
<br />
That being said, you will probably get to around 200+ WIS fairly easily compared to getting to 1000+ AC and tank-like HPs.<br />
If you are sitting at 200+ WIS with relatively-low AC and HPs, I would suggest shedding some of that WIS to make up what you are lacking.<br />
<br />
Again, IMO, it's all about balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On the horse issue, a friend of mine ran the numbers and here's what she got, I haven't checked the math, but sure sounds solid:<br />
<br />
&quot;I take back all the nasty horrible things I've said about horses! (although they are still a huge pain in the tail).<br />
<br />
I Spent a few hours playing around with mine yesterday running oom/canni-torporing to full etc comparing mana regen times and erm....<br />
<br />
For a shaman its an FT20 item outdoors....<br />
<br />
Pre torpor its also a bonus bit of regen whilst you are chewing away.<br />
<br />
Some numbers....<br />
<br />
Both runs were from total oom (not enough mana to cast root) and full hps to fom and full hps, only mind buff was potg (a little less than clarity 1) and I have ~3k mana / 2.9k hps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toreden_Demonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just balance it out as you like it yourself, that way is usualy the best =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There are a very few mana drain encounters (like Aaryonar) where mana pool plays a much larger role. You need to get mob slowed ASAP before it eats your mana, resisting the AE is not easy. Other than that, at 60 I got 207 WIS. More than enough for what I do. Rest is focused on HP, and keeping AC above 1070.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually I think <br />
<br />
Wisdom = mana pool<br />
AC/HP = mana regen.<br />
<br />
So I trade my mana pool 50wis, for permanent Clarity VI.  something like that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hello all<br />
<br />
I have a confession to make.<br />
<br />
Up untill i hit lvl 50 and started to hunt in Kael I was a convinced Sha-drood. Not something i am proud of today but i didnt know better then. :o <br />
<br />
I made a magelo special-profile with the gear i used then. It can be seen here:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=189701<br />
<br />
The only item I seem to be lacking to be the perfect sha-drood seems to be a pair of gebs. (got some later for my real druid. :)<br />
<br />
When i hit Kael and started to slow mobs in there (even before the slow-agro problem) i noticed that my stayingpower was not very great. I allways had a lot of mana though and it gradually came to me i should try the ac/hp thing everyone was talking so much about.<br />
<br />
I only have one thing to say today. I never looked back. I am now very convinced that AC/HP is the way to go.<br />
<br />
Thanks for letting me unburden my heart with this confession.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">AT your level don't worry about ac/hp . You don't slow at those level and anyway you don't get aggro for slowing in this range. You'll not save your group with canni1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">hmm i could philozophise at length on this, but for all our sakes ill keep it short-<br />
<br />
Your lvl determines how much mana u get per point of wis.!<br />
<br />
i believe at lvl 30 its 5 mana per wis<br />
at lvl 50 its 10 mana per wis<br />
<br />
Therefore below 50 wis is NOT so important. better to find items that add ac AND mana<br />
<br />
However a great point was raised above: in the 30s ur slow apell is not so good, and thus ur not so effective a tank.  ofcourse the mobs are easier&gt; if u pick the right ones anyhow.<br />
<br />
further, this is complicated by your race and playing style. Infact its could vary every 5 lvls as u pick different mobs to fight.<br />
<br />
eg from lvl 35 to 39 i started in dl at northside of karnors, maybe a rather slow option in retrospect,  so was mostly casting cold dd while mob beat on grp tank.<br />
<br />
37 to 39 was spent in sol a at window area-  helped with the tank duties~refused to be healer~ some buffing duty<br />
<br />
39 + soloed specs in feroot (hard but fun)  started raiding in l guk<br />
again had to act as a standin tank when things got hairy- basically trying to get the mobs off the healers and beaing on me until main tanks were free.<br />
<br />
40+ soloed gnome guards in steamfont- mega fun and hard, requires bizare  tactics using flash of light and yer pet :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As a shamn has such flexibilty as a class, then u should build up 2 sets(or more) of eqipment to reflect this- generally we have the str to carry this around anyway.<br />
<br />
To clarify  I hunted spectres for many lvls and tried diferent ways of dispatching them- root dot, dd blasting, tanking, pet kiting  etc<br />
thers so many combos available&gt; THATS the fun part of being a shaman :)<br />
<br />
i wont talk about diferent races as that a whole extra subject.</div></div><hr />

I have 185ish Wisdom and it is driving me nuts. Takes too long to get it all back. I wish I was at around 150 with an extra 200 hit points.<br />
<br />
I am one of the original tank shaman though. Up till level 57 or so I had a 121 wisdom. I was always used to not having a large pool. <br />
<br />
I have always thought about it like this. You can't cast spells once you are dead. Untill the HP bar reaches -10 you have options. So make sure it doesnt reach - 10.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">OK, there is one thing everyone seems to forget about wisdom that especially helps at the lower lvl's.<br />
<br />
More wisdom reduces fizzles!<br />
<br />
Learnin those spells is hard, but as you lvl up definatly go for more ac/hps/resists vs just straight wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Jenguran makes a good point.  All the hps in the world don't matter when you are trying to raise Alchemy (especially on a budget).</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's not :( <br />
Which it's that easy, as of now only Abjuration, Conjuration, etc. skills seriously matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">as a young barbarian I discovered at lvl 29 I really wish i had kept up with divination. Ultravision was kick butt back then. I fizzled the first 12 attempts trying to get that spell to cast.  Keep them all caught up or you will find yourself with at least one or two useful spells in a discipline that is way behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">One thing you do have to watch for is that, if you have a low Wisdom, your group members know this. Last night I told the Monk I was duoing with that I was at 50m, and she could see that I was at around 50% health. What she possibly didn't realize up to that point is that, due to my Wisdom of 121, Turgur's is 20m of that. She pulled two MOBs, and after rooting each, slowing one of them, and having slow resisted on the second, I had no mana left for trying to slow again or for healing her (we survived, thanks to cannidancing and letting the pet tank a bit while she binded). My point is that many people are used to grouping with casters with Int/Wis at 200+, for whom 50m or 60m signifies a rather large mana pool, and so you need to make sure they understand that 50m for someone with low Wisdom is about the equivalent of typical 30m.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tenoq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Let's not forget that it's just nice to have a large mana pool sometimes. Think of it as saving for a rainy day--a group may be going well and you're full mana. If something goes wrong and you have to act fast to deal with several mobs at once you'll be glad you have enough mana to take care of business without having to waste precious seconds cannibalizing. Don't get me wrong, I still think AC/HP are king at high levels, but no one's trying to mislead you by saying that wisdom is important for a shaman.<br />
<br />
Personally I go for a balance between the two, but lizards have much higher base wisdom than the big fellas, so I find myself trying to compensate for the lack of hp more often than not.<br />

  well i have always set a goal of 200 wis...as most do...what ive found now that im in the above 50 arena is that 200 wis is VERY easy to maintain.  i fancy myself a heavy buffer..and i like magic soling so the mana has been a huge help..but as i said...its easy now because itmes i get have hagher and higher wis.  now i maintain my 200 wis..and swap out wis items as i get better ones for ac hp.  it working out pretty nicely thus far.</div></div><hr />

At lower lvls WIS is everything, more wis = more mana = less downtime = more killing = quicker lvling!<br />
<br />
Ive grouped with low lvl wis shaman with my warrior twink and having to stop pulling every other pull cos they were &quot;low on mana&quot; was a complete pain in the butt.  As a shaman myself I get my wis as high as possible so I can have as BIG a mana pool as I can.  Yes its nice to be able to canni up whenever low mana, but if u can get your mana pool high enough so you dont have to canni half as much then why not do it?????<br />
<br />
Hps/ac is nice, and most items for wis on the high end game give you all 3 anyhow, but ac means nothing to me, if i get aggro off a big mob for a few failed slows im as good as dead anyhow, ac/hps isnt the be all and end all of shaman...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kazlaaz Bonedust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Basically, like others have said, don't worry about it unless you feel that you have an extremely small mana pool. I've got 80 base wisdom, when  I was 50 long ago, I had about 150 wisdom, and vastly less wis leveling up, and I never had a problem with mana.<br />
<br />
It's really easy to get tons of wisdom now anyway, so it will all come with time on it's own.</div></div><hr />

I have a level 54 (so close to 55) shaman. At the moment i have 206 wis normal and 213 wis or something like that in bear form. I just noticed that yesterday, I never even knew...i'm still wearing 6ac 65hp rings. I guess its just at higher levels all the gear you get has 13 - 20 wis on it so it doesn't matter. My adive to lowerlevel shamans is, if i could go back and do it again, I would go for AC, mana items until about level 39 - 44 then switch out to Ac HP. Now take that with a grain of salt, some parts of the body are better suited to AC and some are better suited to wis. For instance main AC parts are Chest, Legs, Boots, Helm. You wanna wear wis earings thats great, you sacrifice half a cano and 2 - 3 ac. But if you took a bp with more wis over a bp with high ac, you are prob gonna lose about 10 - 20 ac and thats a big deal.<br />

Not quite true here. Most people incorrectly assume that more mana = more mana to spend and while that is true it's a one time thing. Once you spend it it's gone and you have to spend more time than someone with a smaller mana pool medding to get your mana back up above thiers.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way. You've got 2 people bank accounts and the same job. Bob has 2000 dollars in the bank and his friend Joe has 1000 dollars in the bank. They both make the same amount of money every month at work normally. Who has more money to spend each month? Neither obviously, they both have the same amount of money incoming every month. Sure Bob has a little bit extra money if his car breaks down but once he's spent it he has to do something to build it back up past Joe again.<br />
<br />
Now lets say Joe takes half hour lunches every day and gets a little bit of overtime everyday. He's now got more money coming in every month than Bob and can spend more money every month than Bob with out having to pull out of that 1000 in his bank account.<br />
<br />
<br />
id much rather have the mana on hand than to have to sit and canni every 2mins to gain mana to heal a tank who is just about to die.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have to look at WHY you are canning. If you went from fm to oom in one single fight or pull you could probably use a larger mana pool or something easier to fight/pull. If you are oom because of a series of fights one right after another a larger mana pool is just going to make it take longer to get to the same point because it's your mana regen that isn't enough to keep up with the pace not you mana pool. <br />
Going back to my analogy if you make 2k a month and spend 2.5k a month having 2k in the bank as opposed to 1k in the bank is only going to make it take longer till your broke. What you really need to do is work some overtime so you make more money or find some way to spend less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Ultimately the Wis/AC thing comes down to how you play EQ.<br />
<br />
I'm not even close to being at the level of the game that most of the posters here are but I did/do raid enough to know that I need AC and HP when I end up tanking a PoZ for 3/4 of a fight. About four months ago I couldn't have done that, I was barely self buffing over 800AC and flat out getting smacked when trying to do bigger encounters. Which was fine, I was mostly XP grinding anyway so it didn't really matter. Once I found myself raiding it became a matter of survival. My gear needs changed as the way I played the game changed. I could not do my &quot;job&quot; in a raid with Int caster AC.<br />
<br />
Now, at 56, I can self buff to 169Wis with 950+AC (before resists) in gear that doesn't take a raid force to acquire. It is working for me and for how I play the game. Your &quot;balance&quot; will change depending on your level and what you're doing in EQ. <br />
<br />
In other words, there is no definate &quot;right&quot; answer to this particular question. The best advice, really, is to not be afraid to adjust your gear one way or the other. Pay attention to what you feel you're lacking in a fight (be that HP, regen, AC, Wis etc.) and then adjust your gear accordingly.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The gear that today's shaman has to choose from is so so so much nicer than I had to choose from when I was having wis/ac/hp issues.  I wore totemic till 50 and thought I was damn well equipped for my level.  I wore wis rings, forest loops, and my sow booties.  I had totemic boots before that u know.  My wis teetered around 150-160 most of the time.  But then again, I paid close attention to AC, as close as I could.  I think I did better than most shamans on the whole, seeing as how I was able to learn to root park adds, learn how to slow quickly and play ghetto chanter.   I rarely ran out of mana cause I was cannidancing all the time.  I dunno, I think I did just fine on my way up.  And I didn't have all these new items that shamans today have.  Was mostly totemic and a bit of rune etched from Hate.  <br />
<br />
At this point tho, high wis just happens . . . I've been dropping wis gear for hp/ac like mad and I'm still at 190 unbuffed wis.  That's with hp/ac jewelry, vindy bp, and mostly SS quest armor.  Which puts my buffed ac just over 1100 for raids, which is perfect.  Hps are 3995 raid buffed.  <br />
<br />
You do need wis tho, if you want to reduce fizzles and be able to cast more than 4 turgurs at a time without cannidancing for more mana.  But neglect your ac and refuse to take hits and your defense will lag behind sharply, causing you massive problems later on.  <br />
<br />
The single best piece of advice I could give a shaman is to max defense for each level.  That way they'd be maxed at lvl 40, which would make them a powerful shaman for levels to come.  <br />
<br />
I think Lagger still has a lot to learn tho, good thing he found this board.  He had some points, but missed the real one.  Gear should be about balance, not specialization.</div></div><hr />

CH? The only way I could even tell he was a cleric was the nukes. <br />
<br />
yes, he has a fulll CH, including the 9 sec cast time (missed twice on the stupid bash).  Luckily he runs out of mana after that, seems to go to greater heals, which you can overcome quite easily.<br />
And I wasn't kidding when I said both bars to 0, that fight included an &quot;insufficient mana&quot; for a root and going unconcious.  Luckily he was in nearly the same condition and kept missing my nearly dead body.<br />
<br />
&quot;he is only mostly dead, what is much better then completely dead&quot;:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">i'm a lvl 40 shaman and if you check my profile you can see that i'm heavily ac/hp based. i spend most of my time soloing, where i slow, dot and TANK the mob while i pound away at it. so ac and hp helps me survive. i *never* run oom. even with resists and starting at 4m i always have mana to slow and dot the mob until its dead, and often i end with more hp than i started with (because of the fungi+chloro). so i cannibalize a lot, even while fighting, and there hp helps a lot....basically hp = more mana. ac = less hp loss = more mana :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Qwantum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Just recently I made the dash from 103 alchemy skill to 163, and I did it wearing all of my available wis gear and with c3 (as often as I could get it...I don't have pocket c3).  Oddly enough my wis got to 255.  I have to say that maxing your wis is a great plan for ALCHEMY, because I saw a difference between 240 and 255 at my success rate.<br />
<br />
Whoever said it that your higher end gear just has more wis does have a valid point.  I think I really noticed the difference when I got my epic, because all of a sudden I had another 14 wis over what I had been using, and my available mana pool was noticebly larger.<br />
<br />
I'm convinced that I'm the most spell resisted shaman in Norrath, with all these other shaman of similar level talking about slowing stuff I've bounced entire bars of mana on :P  I'm not talking uber mobs, I'm talking about frogs in Seb and spiders in Velks.  The biggest difference I've discovered in lots of wis is the ability to attempt slows in an overpull/badpull situation in a high resist zone many many many more times, as a lifesaving measure for the group.<br />
<br />
Thats with me having 1051 ac full buffed, and 195 wis in bearform.<br />
<br />
I'm with all the rest of you guys that spent your 30-50's with your ac below 160.  I think mine was 146 for most of the time.  Worked fine for me.  <br />

Having the mana to spend is one thing, having to canni it back is another, it takes TIME to canni mana back up, ive been there and seen it, few adds, couple of slows and heals and im low mana and have to canni like mad so I can heal the tank before he dies.  If however I didnt have max wis id have alot less mana and wouldnt have even been able to slow and heal half the amount of times i did and we would have died.  Canniing for mana whilst being beat on by mobs is not good playing if u ask me, id rather have the mana &quot;on hand and useable&quot; so I can get them slowed asap.<br />

I can canni to full mana in no time whatsoever, canni and torpor with regen items.  The point is I have more mana in reserve to play with, when and if I need it.  If you've even been the only shaman on a BIG raid and having to buff everyone/slow all the mobs and adds/etc..etc... then having this extra mana helps ALOT...</div></div><hr />

I had tried responding earlier but ran into some problems posting. Had writen a long post but it's long gone.<br />
<br />
Yes having a large mana pool is nice but by the same token it's not worth sacrificing mana regen for. <br />
<br />
I can definitely see your point of view but you have to remember that you are in a somewhat special situation. A large percet of the shaman population out there isn't 60 or is 60 and doesn't have torpor so doesn't have that kind of mana regen.<br />
<br />

I have actually been the only shaman on way to many raids including large scale high end raids like NToV and the likes. Mana pool sure is handy when your doing these raids for debuffing things when things go bad but it really shouldn't be a major issue since you should have a fairly large mana pool either way if your raiding these places in the first place. As for buffing it doesn't matter one bit. You may have 4000 mana and I may have 3000 mana but we both have to spend the same amount of mana casting the same buffs and then regen back up to full so we both have to use and then regen the same amount of mana so mana regen rate is the major concern. But then again if you want the quickest most effective buffing just got out and get MGB and cann v and your done with a large raid in no time flat =)</div></div><hr />
