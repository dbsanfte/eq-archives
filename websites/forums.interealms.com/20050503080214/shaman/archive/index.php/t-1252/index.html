<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">BAH!<br />
<br />
I have spotted a certain amount of plate armour apearing in luclin thats DROPABLE&gt;  i say this cos most the good no drop stuff requires a 55+ raid, and is from named mobs.<br />
<br />
The list of chain luclin stuff seems to be rather small.<br />
<br />
i am refering to the 40 to 55 lvl range.<br />
<br />
id like to compile a list of what folk have found so far:  loc mob etc<br />
<br />
I am strongly inclined to email my server head gm(i happent to have his email from a time before)  and rant at hime about lack of decent ac gear in Luclin.<br />
<br />
It will make me feel better anyhow lol<br />
<br />
Start posting ur finds below )<br />
<br />
I wish to add&gt;  THERE IS plate items droping off 50 to 55 mobs in various zones&gt; aka 25 ac gloves and helm in tenebrous mtns.<br />
<br />
BUT verant seem to have forgotten the chain clases! So i want to compile a list, and then send a winge to head gm&lt; i know its useless but make me feel better lol&gt;</div></div><hr />

All armors listed on the link above are shaman usable.  Many are nodrop though, and generally all the high level good armor is nodrop.  In luclin, you really dont see any good armor until you can start killing in Umbral, ME, Griegs, SSRA, TheGrey, Akheva, Sanctus and the Deep.  Once you get to those zones the armor is REALLY nice, also very rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">suppose the shisar scaled stuff in the grey counts as chain?<br />
<br />
erm tho i think thers some parts shammy cant use??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know shamans cant wear the shissar scale gloves. I have a pair and kinda liked them better than my coldain skin gloves, but I couldnt wear them (monks could though :confused: ). So, my ranger got some nice new gloves instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lots of shaman stuff in Luclin. But quantity does not mean quality. Sure there is some awsome stuff...the vast majority of which I will never see.<br />
<br />
Here are some items I consider decent AND achievable (ie does not require membership in top tier guild to get)<br />
<br />
Deathwatcher shoulder and mask - Umbral<br />
Divine Inspiration - ME<br />
Stone Idol - ME<br />
Mushroom Veil - Fungus Grove<br />
Chitinous Belt - Fungus Grove<br />
15 stat bracers - Umbral<br />
Bone Braced Buckler - The Grey<br />
Grey flesh sleeves - The Grey<br />
Bane Warding Shield - quest<br />
Shrouded Medalion - ME<br />
Fungus Patch Vest (very rare)- FG Caller quest<br />
Fungus Hide Shield - FG Caller quest<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of these I have seen and or gotten with one group or even less. But still...most of the shaman useable stuff that most of us can get isnt worth getting. <br />
<br />
And there is a real lack of decent leg/bp upgrades for us shaman in Luclin. This was a big disapointment to me. Sure there are some great ones I will never see, and some others I could get but wouldnt want. Compare this to the armors that drop in Umbral for other classes. All the druids in my guild are out farming Ellysian armor in Umbral SOLO. Gotta love that Shojen armor.<br />
<br />
And no shaman cant wear shissar scaled gloves. Isnt that lame?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Iksars being introduced really hurt the shaman class.  We went from a plat class to a chain class, and VI seems to forget this.  How many nice pieces of armor have you seen cleric usable but not shaman usable?   A lot of people say well totemic wasn't technically plate, but I say it was.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We went from a plat class to a chain class, and VI seems to forget this.<br />
<br />
Shaman were always a Chain class. There were just a few pieces of Chain type armor that they put plate graphics on (Totemic, Rune Etched, Jaundice Bone).<br />
<br />
Sorta hard to 'forget' something that never happened.<br />
<br />
Go check out the REAL plate type armors that existed pre-kunark and you will see that none of them are Shaman usable.<br />
<br />
Bronze? Nope. Clerics (an actual Plate wearer) can use.<br />
Steel? Nope. Clerics can use.<br />
<br />
The other (provably) plate type armors are further restricted by issues beyond plate-vs-chain-vs-leather-vs-cloth (single class, or melee only). And none of them have Shaman on them.<br />
<br />
Everything usable by multiple classes that had Shaman on it pre-kunark also had Ranger and Rogue - the other 2 Chain wearing classes.<br />
<br />
Plate = Warrior, Paladin, Shadowknight, Bard, Cleric. That is IT. Shaman aren't on the list. Never were.</div></div><hr />
