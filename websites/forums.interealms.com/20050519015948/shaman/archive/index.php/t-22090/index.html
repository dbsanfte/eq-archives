<br />
The pet does a ton of good.  Up until PoP, my pet was able to solo ANY mob, so long as my pet was hasted and the mob was slowed (and I always kept my regen spell up on the pet).<br />
<br />
The pet is not anywhere near as useful as a Necromancer or Magician's pet.  Aside from a certain attack skill nuance, our pet's *should* outdo a Shadowknight's, at least pre 60.<br />
<br />
Even when not soloing, the puppy is still a nice DPS addition to a group.  <br />
<br />
And yes, if you can pierce a mob for as much damage, that's good, but keep in mind the dog will be hitting a lot more often than you.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the problems you are having with your pet are due to a lack of you...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I give my pet 2 weapons and haste him. When I pull with slow, I sic him on the mob long enough to DOT it. By the time I've got 2 DOTs on it, the mob comes to me (about 85% health). Then I tank it until it starts to run, recasting DOTs as needed.<br />
<br />
I use a jade chokidai (?) prod, which by no means is a great weapon. For melee, I find my dual wielding pet to do more damage than me. <br />
<br />
So, in essence, the pet to me is like a DoT that can short-term tank long enough to slap a couple DoTs on the mob. Others may have other uses.<br />
<br />
In soloing or small group hunting, I find that even its DPS is better than not having it around.</div></div><hr />

Even some lower level raids where mobs don't cast the nasty stuff.  With our DPS problems, you tend to add as much as you can anyway you can.  In your 40's/50's, Dog Dog isn't that bad of a tank either with a couple buffs.  Just depends how you like to fight at that time.  I bot'd a Cleric up with this Shaman, so I let Dog Dog tank alot for me.<br />

<br />
The only people saying this about our pet are people who play a class that can't summon a pet and some Shamans...<br />
<br />
20 DPS is nothing really, and dogdog isn't exactly free either as he requires rebuffing and dies fairly easy. On top of all the trouble he can be.<br />
I use my pet for pulling and as an occasional speedbump, however he can't take much damage, so isn't too useful for that either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">He is okay for use in pre-PoP soloing, as a timer for FA in normal LDoN and that is about it.<br />
<br />
I don't use a pet in Hard LDoN as he is dead in one round if he some how gets agro.  <br />
<br />
All in all not a bad solo DoT but then again we aren't supposed to be soloing according to the original Devs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well puppy is a heck of a lot better since Sony made pets non agro a few years ago. Before that they were a pretty big liability for the benefit.<br />
<br />
Best spot for fluffy? Like others have said in easier content. In normal ldon's where I am the puller, slower and only healer it is a really good pulling aid.<br />
<br />
Ok, in real fights: 650 mana, 15dps (in tougher zones with my haste clicky chest), and since I go thru puppy at a pretty good clip since I'm not about to worry about him dying to enrage or buffing it (except for haste).  I'd say puppy usually lasts 20 hard mobs (and I'm just throwing a number out - sometimes its 1 mob sometimes 50) average fight 35 sec.  So thats 700 seconds x 15dps = 10,500 damage for 650 mana.  In my book thats a good deal as long as it is not inconvenient or dangerous.  Maybe I'm overstating how long he lasts, but even if its 10 fights on average its still a good deal if you have just a little bit of downtime to cast and haste it.  Thus, I am never in a hurry to recast puppy unless it is convenient (puppy is priority last in the food chain).<br />
<br />
Now, if Sony actually pumps up puppies hps a bit and allows zoning with buffs (with aa's) then I will probably spend the time to pump fluffy up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">personally, i use my pet so much he's hired a lawyer and is talking sweatshop laws. think i might be out some serious money here due to the settlement he's going to land for himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
seriously...people knock dogdog all the time, and they say things about how they don't bother buffing him and blah blah blah--and half the time, it's the same guy saying &quot;yes, we have great mana regen ability, but not enough to do with our mana in the first place&quot;.<br />
<br />
***?<br />
<br />
at 65th, fighting *ANYTHING* (including in a hard ldon last night), dogdog is right there by my side at all times. <br />
<br />
when i break him out, i give him 2 daggers, focus of the soul, strength of the diaku, ancestral guard (in certain cases i have clerics virt him--has saved my ass more than a few times and allowed me to throw a quiesence on dogdog that saved his butt as well), and swift like the wind.<br />
<br />
here's the thing--he attacks as though he were a level 61 warrior. so buffing with fos and diaku give him over 100 extra points of atk. the higher the attack rating, the more the hit, and the higher the avg dmg of their attacks. if you're with an enchanter, have him NDT and vallons your pet--one of my rl best friends is a chanty and has pet attack command, so i load his pet up with fos and diaku, he ndt's and vallons on both, and we have twin scarecrows who hit for 55-60 almost every attack, and very rarely miss.<br />
<br />
throw the mage pet weaps on him, and he basically performs as a lower hp version of pets beastlords are using up to about 58th level (minus stun portion of bst pet proc at that level, but will proc a lot with fists of ixblat, fos, and diaku).<br />
<br />
whenever i hear people knocking dogdog, i shake my head.<br />
<br />

<br />
ALWAYS.<br />
<br />
Free DPS is free DPS, period.  He's also perfectly capable of holding off a mob long enough to slow/root it.<br />
<br />
It may take some work to keep dogdog up and running, but in my opinion, the benefit outweighs the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">According to my logs, the other day I killed 48 level 49-51 mobs in PoJ. With 60% haste and Focus (didn't bother with FA) Zibarer did 123,548 points of damage or 31.7 DPS. My Monk, who was tanking and working on Wu's (so lower DPS), clocked in at 75 DPS. That same night my pet was doing 29.2 DPS in LDON again level 60-61 mobs.<br />
<br />
Edit: For comparison purposes, we had a levle 62 Mage in LDON and his pet was doing 55 DPS. Of course, multi-mob fight parses are not 100% reliable, especially when done by a caster who is not always in range, but it gives you some basis for comparison.<br />
<br />
Naturally, there are times when using your pet is pointless or even counterproductive, but as a general rule I am not sure what's wrong with almost mana-free 30 DPS...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Im gonna have to agree with the always cast dog dog posters.  I always have pups up, and buffed.  It takes so little mana to buff it i dont even ntice.  Now, i dont spend time before we start an adventure buff the dog, i will buff him as pulls are inc, or as the grp is killing.  I dont do a ton of hard ldons, my gear isnt up to the lvl needed unless the rest of the grp is geared for it.  But even the ones i have done, i have the dog there by my side the whole way.  Great for extra dmg, crowd control, speedbump as you run...i guess its all about how comfortable you are in controling a pet.  <br />
<br />
For all those no dog dog posters, what is wrong with extra dps?  Granted its not a ton, but it is some.  Dog dog also will push in raids.  He is always there to come to your rescue if you need him.  He will follow you everywhere you go.  I say to you people, give pups another chance.<br />

The key to soloing in Dulak, Dewya, is get yourself a mount. Once you have that, you can tank &quot;in the face&quot; and get all the benefits of sitting mana regen. Just remember to not turn autoattack on. Coupled with slow, dogdog (with weapons so it double wields) and poison dots, you can chain pull in most areas in Dulak depending on your level. Although the time per mob is slow, you have no downtime so the XP per hour is still relatively high. It took me a few weeks of soloing in Dulak and some pre-nerf GoD fishing to get my horse but I still think it was the single best purchase I have ever made.<br />
<br />
Oh, and don't get jealous of melees beatting the snot out of mobs faster than your pet. They get real jealous of our slow, dots, healing, SoW, invis and so on. It evens out in the end. I've seen groups of high 40s struggling in Dulak with me comfortably soloing in my low 50s right next to them. At levels 49-55, shaman are exceedingly powerful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tekmojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">what a nub question</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I've parsed puppy at about 15 to 18 DPS unarmed in LDoN with the variance coming between normal and high risk...thats with FoSouls, Swift, and FA.<br />
<br />
Armed with weaponry you can buy at the Magus from cash weapon drops in dungeons hes does ~30 DPS.<br />
<br />
With mage toys and an added muzzle hes ~35 DPS.<br />
<br />
He also generates similar results in PoP up to about tier 3 for dmg purposes, his dmg does fall off when fighting mobs that near or exceed level 65.<br />
<br />
Puppy is as good as you make him.  When I'm grouped usually my clerics Virtue him, in addition to the FoSouls and 600 hitpoints in mage summoned gear, dogdog exceeds 4k total in hps and rises above speedbump levels.<br />
<br />
Considering that in most xp environs puppy can generate near 2k dmg per minute he is worth casting if you educate tanks to not have pets eat rage, and you garner an additional hp buff besides your own...even a Rangers skin spell can help.<br />
<br />
From what I've parsed in hard LDoN's if fully geared and buffed, over the course of 90min puppy can dish 100,000 dmg without issue...hes worth the virtue, hes worth the FoSouls, hes worth hasting and arming, and he makes a very prompt timer :)</div></div><hr />

In fact yesterday morning he did all the dmg to Lodi except for a couple epic dots.  Took awhile lol but hell that was the easiest most relaxed fight I have had in awhile.  Good Doggie :)<br />
<br />
I have always loved our pet(s).  I have used them for just about everything I have ever killed and never regretted them.  Sure he may not compare to others pet's but he still can hold his own if taken care of. No complaints here.</div></div><hr />

Someone on a previous thread posted that it did indeed work.  Is this first hand knowledge?  I haven't had the desire to burn 20aa on something that might or might not work (yet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Puppy is useful.  DPS is DPS, that said most classes could sneeze and score an extra 15-20 DPS which makes dog dog stand out a hell of a lot less.  That said, dog dog saved my ass on many occaisions if for no other reason than the 4-8 seconds it took a mob to kill it I was running away like I do when my wife chases me with a &quot;to do&quot; list.  Dog dog made a GREAT speedbump, that's pretty much it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kenneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The pet is also useful for soloing rootable, summoning mobs.  As long as the dog is on the mob, and the mob is rooted, it will not summon you.<br />
<br />
It is also possible to single pull with the pet.<br />
<br />
And, in case of emergency, he can give you a few seconds to gate (which is helpful for me because I never have gate mem'd).<br />
<br />
I get varying amounts of DPS off of him depending on how he is equipped and buffed and if someone is tanking so he can hit in the back (anywhere from 20 to 40).  I'll take it.  I don't do alot of healing on him unless the mob summons.  If the mob doesn't summon, I just periodically Q him or let his natural massive regen take over in the short downtime.  If he gets to be nearly dead, I wade into the mix and back him out, and sit him down.<br />
<br />
It is all a matter of personal play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tekmojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">See... the arguement isnt how usefull the pet is guys, I was just refering to how when breakin into the storm wave... while 2 mobs are on your tank and one on you or whatever.... is it better to slow them or get out a pet ???    definantly slowing them...then get out the pet... <br />

If you are breaking on to the Stormwave and you have three mobs on you or your party, dutifully knock some sense into the person who pulled them. If you *ever* get adds in Dulak, someone screwed up somewhere. I don't think I've seen mobs as myopic as in that zone.</div></div><hr />
