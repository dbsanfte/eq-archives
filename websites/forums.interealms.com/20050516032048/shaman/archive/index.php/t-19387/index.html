<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wow... since my return a year ago, I haven't had the time to come around much.<br />
<br />
I was happly playing my shaman, getting groups and leveling. As I approach 65 (64 and two yellow) I was getting more time to relax.<br />
<br />
So I say... Self.... you should see whats up on the shaman boards.<br />
<br />
Well a few of the 2nd generation old school are still around thats awfully nice to see.<br />
<br />
The one issue I have seen that still hasn't subsided it the abundance of negitive posts.<br />
<br />
I just thought I would take this moment to say..<br />
<br />
I enjoy playing my shaman. Yes I have some issues but hey....This game does not drive me to the brink of frustration.<br />
<br />
I am not saying &quot;Hey Sony is doing a great job&quot; Im saying after 5 years Im still enjoying it. When everybody gets so worked up I sugguest getting a cookie and a glass of milk. sitting back and LOOK at the game. And say... WOW... this is a cool game that has hooked me into playing for a long time. &quot;I wish I had the vision that the creators did&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
<br />
DIEUM/FULGRIM/PHORGRIM and I have all enjoyed this game for years... I will not squable of the problems but enjoy the positive.<br />
<br />
This was not to bash anyone ... just hopefully soften the mood around here....<br />
<br />
And I say... if you want to see the power of a shaman, just listen to all the folks that thank you for everything you do for them. (Really listen) I hear it every night and it makes me come back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dan_N</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My shaman, while he's very versatile, leaves alot to be desired and that's where most of the frustration I believe comes form.  I'll continue playing even if our proposed changes don't go through.  I'll buy GoD and any other expansion that comes out.  But it's not because SoE has done a good job, it's because of the people I know in game and the enjoyment I get from playing with them.<br />
<br />
I don't see a problem with people coming here and complaining about the lack of attention ouur class has gotten.  We are merely giving feedback to the changes they have made.  One thing I think we should do, is that just like we have sent feedback on the negative things, we should also send some feedback on any positive changes they have made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the creators and The Vision(tm) have been gone for quite a while now.  Currently, it's just one million monkeys in a room banging on keyboards.  I heard that, in addition to EQ code, they've also banged out a new version of Hamlet, in which he kills Claudius in the chapel like he should have, and everyone lives happily ever after.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, the people who are perfectly happy and uninformed about EQ don't visit message boards.  If they did, they'd become informed and grow unsatisfied with what their class has (unless they're a hybrid, cleric, druid, rogue, or int caster  ;) ).<br />
<br />
Edit:  Dan posted while I was writing mine, and I second everything he said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with you 100% Fulgrim.  While looking at the possible new additions for GoD, this board has been completely overrun with negativity and cynicisim.  Most people would rather make a sarcastic remark and threaten to cancel their pre-order than actually try to contribute some constructive, original thought.  I realize that a lot of people are frustrated and disappointed with the class at this point, but I wish they would realize that expressing those frustrations in every post is just bringing down the morale of the entire board without having any positive effect.  It has gotten so bad that for about a week, I pretty much stopped posting here - I just couldn't stand it any more.  For a while I considered leaving this forum entirely.<br />
<br />
My advice:  If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all.  Don't criticize something unless you are prepared to offer a well thought-out, in depth, reasonable alternative and are ready to defend it.  Also try to think about new developements with an open mind, such as the new slow - I'm convinced it will be a good spell, but most people simply refuse to think about it in terms of a supplemental slow rather than a primary slow, despite half a dozen very long, very descriptive posts about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Fulgrim.  Where I am at in the lands of Norrath, I'm more than happy with what I can do.  I'm not in a time raiding guild (most raids we do are around the bot tower bosses dificulty), nor super power equiped.<br />
<br />
I am continuously learning new strengths and limits.  The latest being in a group (brd, shm, wiz, bst, pal) winning a Hard level Everfrost Ldon (cleric went LD zoning into the adv and never returned).  We barely won, but what counts is we won without any deaths (I think I wore out my heal spells playing MH).  That was the most challenging and difficult thing I have done to date, and I loved it. (now that I'm done tooting my own horn)<br />
<br />
I always chuckle a little bit, sometimes even laugh, at how violently angry some people become when they feel they aren't getting their way, or things aren't how they think they should be.  Yes, there are a few things that probably should be looked at or 'tweeked', but overall I'm happy with the shaman abilities (pre time enabled - I can't comment on those abilities since I'm not there yet) as they are.<br />
<br />
Part of my views may be due to that, the rare times I don't find a group or don't want to start one, I go off and 2box with one of my alts.<br />
<br />
Ah, another mindless rambling of mine.  I wish everyone safe travels and good battles roaming Norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think what your seeing is more that people are just frustrated because of addressing class or game issues, Sony seems to contiually being adding content to it's game every expansion.<br />
<br />
I for one think there is plenty of content, I would rather see game mechanics and class issues seriously looked at and tweaked.<br />
<br />
Anyways it won't happen, it's easier to make a new game (EQ2)<br />
<br />
hopefully they won't screw it up and make it the time sink that EQ1 is or else I will be moving along to play WoW or something else.<br />
<br />
Game wise...<br />
<br />
For me it's about quests, I love doing them and then getting rewarded for doing them. ie. Plane of Tactics Trials, small groups, successful - reward.<br />
<br />
No killing mob x 100 times hoping for some guts to do a combine/hand in, that is just tedium and unfortunately in EQ there is much to much of it.<br />
<br />
That to me is a game issue.<br />
<br />
Class wise...<br />
<br />
Imagine being Sony and having 13 classes over 65 levels and 100's of aa and trying to keep them all balanced and contributing equally to raids, groups and solo play - ain't going to happen, how can it?<br />
<br />
It's too huge a task and I really think alot of people miss the boat on that one.<br />
<br />
Sony does a pretty good job there, and yes you need multiple classes that can slow, snare, root, heal, mez etc... because what do you do for group encounters when you can't find a shaman? or cleric Call it off? Sit lfg for hours? You need multiple class coverage of important skills.<br />
<br />
But they can tweak things, like looking at aa's and saying ok rabid bear is a joke, how can we make it better or more useful, FA - 6 mins? can we make an aa to make it last longer?<br />
<br />
Slows can we add a mr debuff (thank god their doing this) to make it easier for shamans to land their slows?<br />
<br />
Epic cast time, 9 secs? maybe shorten it to 6<br />
<br />
These are little tweaks that could be done for every class to make the class more interesting or more useful or more importnatly more FUN to play.<br />
<br />
Because to me it's all about the FUN Factor<br />
<br />
Camping mobs and items is not FUN<br />
<br />
Using VP (aa to lower its reuse timer?) is FUN<br />
<br />
Using Spirit call (aa to lower its reuse timer?) is FUN<br />
<br />
Watching mobs die while I malo and slow it, it's down to 60% health then casting a 6 sec dot (Bane) to have it actually land and not do it's damage until 6 secs later.... (so 12 secs damage time) it's not fun, it's frustrating!!!<br />
<br />
The game should be looked at as how can we make it more FUN, yes I want things to do, but not things that are tedious and mind numbingly boring like sitting in one spot and camping it.<br />
<br />
If I kill a ph - I want a boss mob to appear. Don't make me keep clearing an area 10 times and then not have a spawn... it sucks, if you want to make it harder, make the PH harder to kill.<br />
<br />
That way if you can't kill the ph, there's no way your going to get the boss mob to spawn.<br />
<br />
Make the ph harder than the mobs in the general area and make the boss mob harder than the ph. <br />
<br />
It's an easy fix, make the item lore for all accounts on that server so the person can't sit there and farm the crap out of it. You got one sell it or use it or give it to a friend. <br />
<br />
Anyways am I being negative, no I don't think so I think I'm offering pretty good solutions to things that make me nuts.<br />
<br />
Anyways forums need negativity they need helpful hints they need input they need differing opnions they need it all or else they'd be boring to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I try to stay away from the general section.  It's pretty much worthless crap, except the tidbit of news here and there.   I poke in to see if i can pick out something important once and awhile.  Although, its pretty difficult.<br />
<br />
So yes I agree, lol  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I honestly don't mind the negativity directed at the Class and its problems.  I think for the most part it is health.  <br />
<br />
I know I go to the &quot;when I worked for the government&quot; well too often but it works so here goes.  I can never recall picking up a ringing phone in my office and having a constituent/voter/citizen/taxpayer say &quot;hey everything is great, I really like that new law your boss passed, have a good day.&quot;  No they usually called to complain about some issue and it did not bother me at all.  Some aides would get their red-power-ties in a knot over complaints, but that is part of what a democratic government is about; fielding complaints in an effort to fix things.  This board is the communication organ of a lobby group.  <br />
<br />
What I am pleased with in regard to this board is that folks aren't nearly as mean to others as they used to be.  We use to have a lot of really smart but really harsh folks on this board who used their skills to belittle others.  Thankfully this is not as common.<br />
<br />
I don't mind negative folks too much.  I don't mind stupid people at all.  I just don't like mean people.  They suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't think it's too bad.  The main problem as I see it is too many people talking and too few listening.  Some shamans say how usefull they feel in groups and I think it's great, but basing overall class effectiveness on your personal experiences in the face of very tangible and applicable numeric evidence is mindboggling.  I know I'm frequently frustrated with what I consider to be the oblivious nature of many shaman who come out gunning everytime someone has a suggestion to improve the class.  The class needs a boost, the fact that some people don't see it doesn't make it less real.<br />
<br />
Now the number of words getting filtered out by the language filter seems to have increased and there is clearly more anger.  I find this comical.  It's just a game guys, no need to flame anyone.  It's one thing to argue and discuss, it's another to lose your cool.  Personally, I don't post the first thing that comes to mind ... it's what seperates me from the animals ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gonna have to disagree.  I am perfectly happy playing a shaman.  Do I think things could be changed to make the class better?  Of course.  Does this stop me from playing my shaman the way I want to play him?  Definately not.  Anything that gets changed will only make my shaman better than he is now.  I have no problems playing him to the fullest extent that I can, and do so quite often when I solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this was a PvP game or for Shamans on pvp servers having  hard time dealing with all the goodies othe classes have then yes. I could understand the whining. But as things are now I feel the whining is just crazy. Everytime I click on general I find my self more and more depressed. I was a happy shaman before I quit eq. <br />
<br />
Its depressing to see all the class bashing now that I have returned. I played a really gimpy class in daoc and it was a pvp game. To succeed in pvp your character must lay the smack down or have a way to retreat.<br />
<br />
 We whined and got tune ups. When I left my class was a flavor of the month class with new people rolling twinks every day. I found I liked it better when we were considered gimped.</div></div><hr />

I love playing my shaman. I've played Tormac on and off again since the game came out.  <br />
<br />
At the same time I'm a bit disappointed by the spells that looked Sony had made for us in GoD.  The spells seem to be better, but the whole canni spell the way it was originally proposed seemed worthless, as well as slow diseased base Dot.<br />
<br />
I wish Toyota made a super charger that fit in my MR-2's engine bay, I've written Toyota urging them to do so, but that does not mean I'm unhappy with my MR-2.  <br />
<br />
Same goes for my shaman, I love playing him, I just think that Sony needs some help in coming up with improvements that would be useful for Tormac.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">So, anyone who voices their opinions about why they are not having fun is &quot;negative&quot; and is &quot;hijacking&quot; your thread? Since those people have a later registration date, for whatever reason, than you, that seems to have some meaning?<br />
<br />
Really.. you can and go have fun and do your own thing, but please do not presume to tell others how they should be feeling.<br />
<br />
No, I am not and old time shaman, but I've been playing this game since Beta 2. I am in a situation where playing EQ with my shaman is providing little satisfaction for many of the reason outlined in the many &quot;negative&quot; posts you so disdainfully mention. The only reason I still do log on is to talk to friends and support my guild on raids. If not for those two reasons, I'd stop playing a shaman and play something else since it really isn't much fun for my level of play.<br />
<br />
But, we all play for different reasons and we all have different play styles. It just rubs me the wrong way that you come here, after a noticebale absence that you yourself mentioned, to complain about our attitude over issues we feel strongly about.<br />
<br />
So, to mimic the thought about all the &quot;negative&quot; people are all registration dates '02 to '03, I will say the &quot;happy&quot; people are seemingly all under 65 or pre elemental. See? Exactly....<br />

<br />
negativity?  sure i suffer from it.<br />
<br />
tonight my guild had 20 peeps on, and the 65 chanter does the main slows.  plus the AE mez's.  and the VoQ/KEIs.  and has the AA for pet control.  sure, he dies more than i do, but never loses lvl.<br />
<br />
oh, and out of the 20 in my guild, i am the only shaman not bot'ed.<br />
<br />
my nukes blow.  my debuffs are not needed.  my buffs do not last long enough.  nothing lives long enough for my dots to be effective.  my pet is an expensive joke after i equip it.  my melee skills are a dress wearer and they are lvling up a BST, who was the main shaman before i joined.<br />
<br />
i solo for exp, and hate timed events like LDoN and Trials.<br />
<br />
my future is bleak and getting bleaker with every expansion.<br />

i truely believe Sony has no clue about the shaman class in this game.  that we will get no boost; either in equipment, spells or aa; and when finally my friends want me to start a new character; i will quit the game.<br />

yeah, i am negative.  i think we are all a bit negative.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I don't agree with Fulgrim. I don't mind the &quot;loss&quot; of Vision, so to say, which went with Brad, that &quot;vision&quot; was a mess anyway. If it'd be still here, we'd probably still have lvl 50 max and melee's would swing Short Swords of Ykesha. As for the game, then I don't really find it that fun anymore. One thing what you expect over such a long time (and I am in EQ since beta) is improvement, advancement of your class, in his/her areas. Well, we got one such improvement, back when Kunark was released. After that, we've been forgotten, or ingored. Other classes have continued to advance (all good with me, cheers to other classes), but we've been sitting in the dust ever since.<br />
<br />
We've come to the situation, where we are offering actually quite little to groups/raids. Yeah, we still can slow better then other slowers, but over the time and with the improvements to all the other classes, this is just a marginal difference now. Buffs - who needs them now? With the items out there nowadays, most people have their stats at caps or pretty close it, and rest have it over the caps anyway. Heals? Well, I don't want to be a main healer, but being the pure priest class, I'd expect that I would still heal better then any hybrid class. Debuffs? Looking at the spell data of the spells, which have been released with last expansion packs, I get the feeling that those debuffs are only needed for ourselves - how else would I put it, seeing that many other classes have pretty steep negative resist checks with their spells, while we shamans have none, literally. So, yeah, we can still debuff, and probably we need that more then other caster classes, for our own spells. Heck, we've been forgotten even with the spells what we got before the other classes did, say, SoW. Yes, little spell and all, yet we were the first to get it and cast it on the people out there, and now we're last with it, as every other class who can cast it, has superior version of that spell when compared to ours. We almost were left out when it came to new lvl 60+ regen spell, when it was given to druids but not to shamans, nevermind that we get regen before them. But at least that was fixed in the end, although our regen-ability is still limited to only that spell, and no such useful AA. Even our own &quot;offspring&quot; class, beastlord, has AA regen (with other features) ability on top of the spells. Hell, we lack total utility so much that having already 3 shamans on the raid is a waste of group slots. Why? Because 1-2 of them can do all the shaman majik needed for the raid, and 3rd literally has nothing to offer - DPS sucks, heals suck, buffs suck, no utility spells/skills/abilities..<br />
<br />
I don't want to have any other class get nerfed. Nope, that just sucks. I personally simply want our class to be improved, and the improvements what I think of and many others do are quite reasonable. Unique and shaman only debuffs and buffs, which affect the SKILLS directly. Debuffs and buffs which affect the special resistances directly, i.e. reduce the slash resistance on some mob or increase it on the player. Curses which affect the target directly, their soul, i.e. cast a curse on spellcaster mob, which halts it's HP and mana regen for a time, causes spell miscasting and fizzles, weaker and much less precice melee hits. Shaman only AA Slow, for example, which would slow as our spell does, for the same amount (75%), but would be not mitigateable. Make it slow refresh, like 20-30 minutes, which will ensure that one shaman can't chain cast it, but at the same time would give few shamans on the raid something to do. Heck, make the last level of that AA slow ability even slow those unslowable mobs, a bit, that'd be something unique to shamans only. You know, real curses as such. We're shamans, bloody hell, spiritual realm is our realm, that would add so much and would be unique to shamans, offer also loads of utility to groups AND raids, and giving something to do for every shaman on the raid.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, I don't find the game &quot;fun&quot; for last 2 years, only reason I am still hanging in the game is because of the great people I've met and do things still with. I don't log on daily to play, that's boring, if not annoying. I do log on on guild raids and different events, because that's fun, due to people, not the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Do I like to play my shaman?<br />
Yes, I love the way he plays, but more importantly I have a wonderful guild and I like the PoP and to some extent the LDoN raid encounters a lot.<br />
<br />
Do I think we are falling behind?<br />
Yes, we are falling behind every other casting class with every new expansion. <br />
Every time other classes regenerate another mana per tick and we didn't get a new cannibalize we fall behind.<br />
Every time we get a long casting spell that keeps us from cannibalizing we fall behind.<br />
Every time we get another disease DoT we fall behind.<br />
Every time encounters get shorter we fall behind.<br />
Every time MOBs have fewer HPs we fall behind.<br />
Every time resists on exp MOBs get raised we fall behind.<br />
Every time slow is mitigated we fall behind.<br />
Every time we get another ineffcient spell to compensate for our better mana regeneration which really is not better anymore we fall behind.<br />
Every time we get another Avatar spells while other classes get a better haste or ATK buff that actually lasts a decent amount of time we fall behind.<br />
<br />
This has been going on for five expansions. Maybe we really were overpowered back in Kunark but I do not think we needed five straight expansions getting far less upgrades to every single one of our spell lines then every other class got.<br />
<br />
Up to now it was mostly a 'oh well, we can still canna and slow and heal, let them have their toys' thing. But the more mana other casters can regenerate and the shorter encounters get (read: PoP) and the less HPS MOBs have (read: PoP, LDoN) the more we fall behind.<br />
Cannibalize doesnt cut it when other classes can just chaincast for an entire encounter and not worry about mana, doing 3 times the emount of healing or nuking because we get quadruple-shafted with long casting times, inefficiency, high resist rates and still having to actively cast to get our mana back.<br />
Thing may seem fine when you are just entering PoP and they probably arent too bad overall: Slow is still needed, other people's mana regen still does not approach shaman's, MOBs still last a couple minutes each.<br />
A couple tiers later, a couple FT more, a few K more HPs on the tank along with a couple hundred AC . . . now you run out of mana before the cleric, doing nothing but desperately debuffing, slowing and casting our quarter-duration buffs and getting your mana back while he could probably keep the group healed without slow if you could actually bring some decent mana regen or DPS to the group.<br />
<br />
This is what is happening now, and while I still like playing Murtak and probably will keep playing if only because I like the people that does not mean everything is all right. Shaman need upgrades, we have not gotten any since Kunark.</div></div><hr />

I think I remember you way way back when the Shaman was first nerfed.  (Disease DOTs and Kiting)<br />
<br />
I have a question and hope you come back to answer...<br />
<br />
Would you play any other class now?  The game is very different from the last time I played.</div></div><hr />

It perfectly describes the situation. The problem is that &quot;most&quot; people don't realize it. Once you reach that level, all you do is watching you nod to every point veeshanMurtak made.<br />
<br />
Edit: The Reputation system is broken btw. Consider this a rep bump, man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah I remember them weren't Tudamorf was a former Shaman turned Enchanter, right?  And Eduin thought we were a melee class?  I know he was an ass.  They came around about a year after the first nerf.<br />
<br />
The sad thing is everyone still moans and groans about the Shaman.  Ever since the first nerf, its been that way.  I found one comment hillarious.  Something about us being Uber during Kunark but now we suck.  I remeber post Kunark we were bitching and moaning like never before.  <br />
<br />
Do you still have fun with your Shaman?  Would you still start one today or would you start something else?  I cant seem to find anything but a Shaman that I like besides the Druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Rontero, thanks for a question that I will gladly answer.<br />
<br />
If I were to start over I would probably go for a different class.<br />
<br />
There have been vast improvements to some very broken classes.<br />
<br />
You know folks... I agree we need help... I just don't believe that all the negativity and BASHING our brothers is helping our cause.<br />
<br />
On a completely other topic let me go back to Rontero's question.<br />
<br />
I would like to state openly that at launch the shaman was too powerful. YES I SAID IT.... and anyone who was there KNOWS it... if not only deep down inside. DOTs did twice the damage you could casts and run.... etc etc... you could Charm really high level content... WELL for then... We got hit by a giant bat that started the nerf wars.... <br />
<br />
I agree we have been the bastard stepchild for years and I think its mainly because sony has the nerf list going... haha... look... shaman nerf nerf nerf nerf... ok... if we nerfed em so much they must be working as intended now.<br />
<br />
If the shaman was a selection I had to choose from and I knew about nothing about him.... I would probably select him again.<br />
<br />
Knowing the power of the classes I would probably pick someone else.<br />
<br />
Open the flood gate... I must be wrong... I would choose something different. You know what... who cares...I like the (Thought of being a shaman) I have invested time and money into him and I could use some improvement. I don't believe I ever said don't fix the shaman I just said... hmmm continue to have fun and be positive (While they make changes)<br />
<br />
Imagine if you would. <br />
<br />
Sony Dev: Hmmm what should we work on.. Druids nah... those folks gripe about everything, Warriors nah &quot;Working as intended&quot; and man... they can bitch... Clerics? haha... whatever, those whinny folks have complete heal!... oh we did get that well thought out non threatening document that was consise from those intelectual giants the shaman... maybe we should work on it...<br />
<br />
I know those squeeky wheel folks will say... we have to fight and threaten or we will get overlooked. You know, they might be right ... but what do we get? a couple of entries into a database that make a couple of things wrong better? or worse yet.... these things now make some ppl upset....  but the others happy... <br />
<br />
MAN lets get over it.... calm the waters and use Brains not Whines and Bitches. I know as a developer I tend to help those with well thought out plans that don't rub me the wrong way, far more often than those who bitch all the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy crap... sorry folks...I won't change anything here. I just wasted your time. I appologize. My ranting about ranting just made me no better. <br />
<br />
Can't we all just get along. I share my opinions and you share yours...<br />
<br />
Yours is valid, I just wish I had the choice to listen or not. So my fault... I will shut up now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Giac, rep system is working. Check and see if you have a pop up stopper enabled. You might have to turn it off briefly to use the feature.<br />
<br />
I guess I bumped veeshanMurtak's rep not so long ago...so the system told me to spread around my reputation bumps before doing it again. Didn't really remember and I bump good posts no matter who makes them.<br />
Sorry, I just assumed it was bugged after I read Sunmoon's post about it in the other thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Glad to see my post about being happy and having fun.... is trying to be hijacked by negativity...<br />
<br />
But hey... also nice to see a few ppl don't take the game to seriously.<br />
<br />
This highlights the real reason for the negativity, IMHO.  Many of us play the game A LOT, and with that amount of time commitment, it is hard to just blow off the various disappointments with the class.  Casual players (like me) find it easier to just let it go, and try to enjoy the game without becoming as upset with the various problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did not read boards as much back then but the Kunark and Velious complaints I remember were never about class power - it was about hard to get spells in Kunark and overly resistant MOBs in Velious. Both of those were legit complaints at the time but I do not think people were actually saying a shaman with a full spellbook or a shaman fighting MOBs he could actually land spells on was underpowered in any way.<br />
<br />

<br />
I still have fun playing, but I am not at all sure if I wouldn't be happier playing another class - something that has not crossed my mind since I switched from a ranger to a shaman pre-Kunark.</div></div><hr />

- Awesome post. That's exactly how I feel. <br />
<br />
Call me negative, give me negative rep bumps if that makes you feel warm and fuzzy but I watched this awesome class since 99' being slowly nerfed into the ground. And no, I won't just **** and &quot;get over&quot; it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">The problem with the original poster complaining about how this post was hijacked by negitivity, was that his OWN post was laced with negitivity - not necessarily about Shaman, but still.<br />
<br />
But that's not important.  <br />
<br />
A little background about me:  I played EQ right from it's release, day one, although I wasn't always a Shaman (it was, actually, the last class that I picked)<br />
<br />
I played steadily up until right before Velious was released.  Had to quit because of RL issues.  I re-joined fairly recently,  not long before LDoN was released (took advantage of the Evolutions package at Babbages to nab all the expansions.  If it wasn't for that, I probably wouldn't have came back.)<br />
<br />
My old shaman, before I quit, was a level 54 Barbarian.  I played on the Brell Serilis server as Barnabas Shadowseeker, though I doubt anybody remembers the name any more.  I recognize almost every name that says they come from Brell that posts.  Juujuu,  the guild Silent Redemption (I remember when they were first formed still, even!)  One of my best friends at the time, I no longer know if she plays.  (If anyone knows of an Aenie,  at the time had the surname Fairblade I believe, let me know in a PM.  She may have quit.)<br />
<br />
Basically, i've missed a LOT.  In fact, my current 42nd Vah Shir Shaman has better equipment then I could have imagined.  (I've given UP my iksar ceremonial chestplate, where before it was an item i only dreamed about.  Back then, I was guildless, but i had MANY friends in high end guilds who invited me to a lot of things.)<br />
<br />
I am very happy with my shaman right now.  But, having the experience I have (however dated), and the fact that I visit these boards, I know that there are problems in the high end.  Especially since I do not see myself ever getting into the elemental planes, let alone Time. <br />
<br />
This post basically has no point, but i'm trying futilly to get Morrowind and the expansions installed (great offline game to play while relaxing from the EQ grind) :)<br />
<br />
Yes, there is a lot of negative comments on this board.  All over it, really.  But, the way I see it, it is more anger because of love for the class.  Many of us have spent countless hours (well, countable, but.. ) playing the Shaman for many reasons.  Some because they wanted to be able to do everything the Shaman can,  some because of the memories we had back in the days before we felt underpowered (I remember first getting Turgurs.  I felt like a GOD.)<br />
<br />
It's not that everyone is asking for powerful abilities , or over-powered ones (some people are),  I think the biggest thing people want is upgrades that we would use, but aren't necessarily even the most powerful spells.   Turgurs, for example, is a level 51 spell.  With the level cap now at 65, that is a lot of levels without any upgrades for a spell line that is considered our primary forte in most situations.  I could come up with some ways for improvements, but this isn't the place for them.<br />
<br />
Or, barring being thrown a bone, with any luck future content will be tailored to a point where Shaman are as valuable as they once were.  <br />
<br />
Another problem I see is the lack of... focus on what a Shaman is supposed to be.  The problem with having so many different abilities is that it's hard for a development team to figure out what to do.  Are we a pet class or not, for instance?  Surely, dogdog isn't the most impressive pet out there (hardly noticible in some situations), but hes been our constant companion since level 34, and we get AAs for him, and at least one spell I can think of (level 50) that is pet specific (though not terribly impressive.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to comment about any of the data about Gates of Discord, because honestly, I think SOE is toying around with the parse data so nobody can get a firm lock on what we are going to get.  They have said that parsed data doesn't show everything, and wont necessarily reflect what it will be with it comes out.  <br />
<br />
... frankly, I think whoever is in charge of that does it for the fun of making people jump.  It's one of those little perks that makes a job like that worthwhile. :)  <br />
<br />
I think i've posted enough for now.  I tend to go overboard, and looking back at what i've typed... yep, i've over-done it.  <br />
<br />
Like I mentioned before, if anyone from Brell still knows if there is an Aenie, and if the original person still plays that character, I would appreciate knowing.  I have very fond memories of my time back on that server, even though I dont play on it since coming back (I wanted a fresh start.)<br />
