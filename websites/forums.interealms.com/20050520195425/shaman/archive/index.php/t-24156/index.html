<br />
We all have done it.  Camping the Pipes for Monk epic in Chardok, grinding experience to ding 60 in Sebilis, or maybe cybering with the WE druid from your Tables group (lolz.)<br />
<br />
But how do YOU do it?  Drink lots of caffine?  Eat something?  Listen to music?<br />
<br />
I personally am one for consuming large ammounts of Mt. Dew Livewire, and listening to some good music I can sing along to.<br />
<br />
Now, please.  Talk amongst yourselves!</div></div><hr />

if you really need to stay awake ... red bull mixed with blau saour ( blue pig in german just can spell it right ) and a few CDs of ramstein should do the trick<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I go to bed, if I am too tired to play, I am probably better of sleeping instead of trying to grind the last piece for epic|grind the last few percent xp|whatever.<br />
Part of the reason is I am not having fun if I am too tired, and on top of that I might even start making mistakes when I am tired. For me, and the people I hang out with it's fairly easy to spot when we should camp for the night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pr0n and Coca-Cola.<br />

 :D  :D  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In general, I don't stay up.<br />
<br />
The few times I have, it was for a guild raid, like on Vex Thal (lasts forever and all the loot at the end) or camping the Emperor spawn the first time.  I would get up and walk around the room, drink lots of Diet Coke, and talk to my wife who is doing the same thing in the chair next to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A big pot of coffee (the longer on the go, the better) and music on my CD player (the more tired, the greater the volume). This works until such time as I start having no recollections of pulls .. then it's time to give up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go to sleep if you're tired...  I can think of a few times where I stayed up a half hour or so longer than I had planned, but by and large I always had a set time that I planned on logging off to go to sleep and stuck to it.  People that deprive themselves of sleep for a video game, IMO, have at least some minor problems.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I was in an uberguild and still didn't have to make my life revolve around EQ.  Believe it or not, it is very possible. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Agree with Chees - Rammstein is decent for keeping you awake (and the neighbours too when I get too enthusiastic roaring along with the lyrics /blush)<br />
<br />
But.... if you want to be serious about it, here's what to do:<br />
* good thick drapes for your house<br />
* artificial light only permitted at any time<br />
* comfy chair<br />
* remove all clocks<br />
* vary the time you go to sleep at until your body clock is utterly phucked<br />
* catheter is optional<br />
<br />
But on the whole, having a life is better :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bawls seems to do the trick for me.  Sometimes I will do a glass of grapefruit juice followed by a soda, that really gives you a buzz, heh.  Oh ya, I also crank up my music a bit...700 song playlist mix of Metallica, GodSmack, Offspring, Bush, Slipknot, Nirvana, Live, Tool and more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If I get tired, I camp out.  Last time I tried to stay awake I ended up tanking a named in the Dranik's Hollow expedition for half the fight before realizing he wasn't slowed.  Did malos and cripple, just forgot slow.  Took me half the fight thinking &quot;why do I have to keep healing myself so much before I caught on.  Thankfully this was before the mitigation was put back so I still survived.  I was laughing at myself the rest of the fight and even told the guild so they could laugh at me as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I just /follow the cleric (or other caster) and go to bed.<br />
<br />
Usually the amout of afk exp I make will make up for the unrezzed death.  :P<br />
<br />
Also miss slow a couple times, then /say 'faaking' helps the group think you've just fallen asleep and will be right back...so they don't boot you, or at least they port you to a safe spot.<br />
<br />

(Ok I'm kidding, I just say I'm tired and go to bed.)</div></div><hr />
