<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a couple heads ups-<br />
<br />
I) On the topic of tweaking Luclin:<br />
<br />
First thing you need to do is go into your Bios an see what your AGP appeture is set to.  The memory value there should be as close to without exceeding half of the physical memory of your system.  For my system (512 MEgs Ram) this means 256MEgs, as an example.<br />
<br />
Second, you should go into the Windows System.ini file (found by typing SYSEDIT in the run line) and add this line to the section called &quot;[386Enh]&quot; :<br />
<br />
ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1<br />
<br />
Finally, you should alter your Virtual memory settings (My Computer Properties, farthest Tab then click on the button) so that the minimum and maximum Virtual Memory Size is exactly double the physical memory of your machine (1024MEgs in my example) then reboot.<br />
<br />
I dont recomend doing this to lower end systems, but for anything 800Mhz and up with 256 or more memory, this will greatly improve your performance.<br />
<br />
<br />
II) Modus Operandi while in Luclin<br />
<br />
Due to the outstanding relationship between our two guilds over the course of our history, I want to extend an open invitation to any KotE member to come hang out with us whenever they happen to be in the area and might wish to.  KotE and Corps have always been completely above board and fair with each other and Id like to see some of the straglers from both our guilds getting more groups with people they can trust.  Conversely, if you need more bodies for somethign you are doing, don't hesitate to call on us.  Weve gotten a lot done by working together regularly and I would like to see this trend to continue.  Basically, I have always felt our two guilds are alike with the major difference being that the nicer people go to KotE and the more vulgar people go to Corps =p<br />
<br />
III) Our regular routine<br />
<br />
To accomadate people's desire to explore Luclin and maintain our efforts to be fair to the masses, I have adopted the following schedule for The Corps:<br />
<br />
Mon-Thurs  Luclin XP groups/General Play<br />
Friday         Luclin Raids/Quests<br />
Saturday    Open Raid Day<br />
Sunday       ToV Armor Farming (2pm-8pm CST)<br />
<br />
The reason I post this on your board is to make you aware of our likely wherabouts, should you be interested in hooking up with us.  In particular, any KotE wanting to participate in some ToV action as a regular thing are more than welcome, as this is a somewhat boring task that not everyone is interested in. I will do my utmost to see that things are handed out fairly, as it is in both our guilds interest to get people decked out in the best armor we have access to.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the invite to Vindi and the help on the Woushi attempt.  While niether was successful, we learned a lot(particularly about Woushi) and will be improved on subsequent attempts as a result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>RizzWulfgard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thank you for the systems info Jice, and thank you for the invites on groups. <br />
<br />
KOE enjoys working with The Corps, and as always if you need assistance, please feel free to ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info Jice and especially the schedule. Always good to work with the Corps.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Jice, I will keep lookout for Corps folks on the moon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as system tweaks, one other I have found helpful is to go into the options screen just before login and select Texture compression from the screen just after the one where you select the models you would like to display.  Also, I cranked texture quality down to low.  This is supposed to degrade the quality of the graphics, but danged if I can tell the difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I think everyone here at KoE has been made aware of the benefits of using memturbo.  Might want to spread this one to the Corps folks as well.  Memturbo (http://www.memturbo.com) scrubs your RAM meory and forces backgroup apps to release all memory not currently being used to the available pool.  On my machine, I went from around 240 megs of available RAM at startup to just over 310 megs available.  Just download and run the program, scrub your RAM before starting EQ, and set the application to check for available RAM every fifteen minutes.<br />
<br />
Thanks for postiong, Jice.  I had been meaning to put together a composite post of tweaks for Luclin, and as usual hadn't gotten around to it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you Jice. It's always good to hook up with the Corps... I look forward to seeing more of you guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Jice....We go back to when you played Memendosa and I have always had a blast when grouped with you.  So as always if you need another Druid give me a tell.:D <br />
<br />
I will also try getting with you guys sometime.;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">WOW!!!! Is my comment on the ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1 line added to the System.ini.<br />
I added this to my 98 PC (766 P3, 384MB of Ram, TNT2 Nidiva Graphics card).  It has shaved almost a min off the zone times in Luclin.  I could not believe the difference it makes.  This is my wifes machine and the one Shambul uses when he plays at my house.  It is less than half the power of my machine and Shambul is just blowing me away on zone times now.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">FYI don't do that texture preload thing they have on the Dev boards unless you have a UDMA 100 Hard drive.  If you have that fast of a system, chances are it won't save you time anyhow.<br />
<br />
Also, we have as a guild decided to persue Katta faction and to hunt it in Sanctum Seru.  Katta has the most diverse quests and is a conveniently located central point of operations.  Seru seems to be the evil faction and is opposed to both the Cats and Katta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sarconus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the post. I have always treated The Corps as our sister guild and thier members. Call upon me any time you need also have 49 warrior Tevin (retired) and 48 rouge Kuluien.<br />
<br />
Farewell and good hunting</div></div><hr />
