I need it, I want it, I must have it - its a moral imperative seeing as I had one pre kunark , but lost it to a LD and no rent bag. My server GM at the time ( Vyrinn ) wouldnt return it.<br />
<br />
   Took me a few tries to get close enuff to the Dealer for shaman / Cleric / Drudads to actually gamble. So there I am, bankroll in hand, 27k worth of tokens later  I won the following :<br />
<br />
 210 tokens<br />
 4 SoV era wis caster armour quest gems<br />
 4 gnomish fireworks<br />
 1 of each of the following racial illusion potions, dwarf , iksar , troll, woodelf , barbarian.<br />

Well, Sony just did what they needed to do to help out the economy.  In this thread alone, 250K plat has been claimed to been spent.  This is a faster money sink than horses and lizards.  And could you imagine if you actually won semi-worthwhile items.  Strikes me as being a great idea for a money sink, but the win rate needs to be bumped up just a bit.<br />

<br />
No, they are not, but sucessful casinos keep the customer in the house. Win a little here, win a little there, lose lose win, lose lose lose. Eventually the casino ends up winning, but you need a better carrot then a pot of cold vegtable soup to keep the person sitting at the table. You keep the loses small and unnoticed, but make the wins flashy so the person sits there playing all night and doesn't relize they're down $1000 until the morning. <br />
<br />
When you already have this many people say their not going back, then the carrot isn't good enough.</div></div><hr />

As stated in the patch message and a couple other threads it's in the basement at Shandeling's Roost in Shadowhaven. From the bazaar zone-in head East. Loc is about 39, 861.<br />

Vuri Pandar is the one for priest class prizes. Tried it once, token cost me 100pp with cha buff from the female &quot;waitress&quot; NPC. Vuri said something about I barely won. Grats Vegetable Stew, +5 wis, didn't even pay attention to duration, no drop.<br />
<br />
/rude Vuri Pandar<br />
chomp, chomp, chomp... Kaninfrenzy takes a bite of Vegetable Stew<br />
Ahhh. That was tasty.<br />

I've always wanted a DE mask but I bet my chances of getting it at a GM event are better than here  :D.<br />

Like a few others have said, this is probably aimed at getting ride of duped plat, shark plat, etc. Yeah they could make the games more fun but I don't think this is where they want to focus their efforts or have people really spend their time.</div></div><hr />

Nah instead of spending some time actually putting something fun into the game for all servers, they give us this crap while diverting resources to crap like the fallen server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I was hoping this would be the typical &quot;great reward rates at first and then nerfed to hell&quot; thing that EQ usually does, so I blew 20k quickly on fireworks and stew.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">What I was really hoping for was that they'd put in some kind of actual card mini game that you'd actually play.

They could have had it just say the hand values -- Full house -- you win 20 chips..<br />

4 of a kind -- here is your golden ticket<br />
<br />
pair -- here is your stew...<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
What I resent is that the 30k I spent had NO chance of winning anything because they botched the itemization -- hence it was money down the toilet that I did not get back...<br />
<br />
Spent another 25k after they fixed it and got beer goggles -- at least that is of a tiny bit of use when someone says &quot;I am going to pick this chest&quot; in ldon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I myself spent 20k on a bunch of soup. Man was I a sucker.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>CollectraBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I spent around 90k on tokens, from what i know my guild has spent at least 400k ( yea bored today ) and the best thing we've gotten is ST resist stones ( yay...), and 15% apply poison mod gloves with the uberest dot around ( something like 5dmg/tick, and yea I was at the clr/dru/shm guy).<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I'm not worried too much about not getting one of those neat toys, but am kinda disapointed at the win % in terms of gold tickets.  Most people had been on all day and nobody heard of ( on my server anyhow ) of anyone getting one.  I just heard maybe of '5' 3rd and fourthhand reports of people scattered across servers getting a ticket.<br />
<br />
If your gonna go spend money on this, I suggest you use money you really dont need for anything at all, and yea it does feel like tradeskilling except it costs more, you spend it faster, and your skill REALLY doesnt improve:)<br />

<br />
imho, the casino isn't really built for people who aren't rich.  If you don't have a few hundred thousand plat with nothing to spend it on, then the casino is probably not for you.  If you just go and drop 2k, don't expect to see anything back.<br />
<br />
Here's what I have gotten so far:<br />
<br />
two instant cast gate potions<br />
about ten illusion potions<br />
a billion stews and firecrackers which I destroyed<br />
about a dozen velious quest gems.<br />
a range slot item with +1 to everything, but +35 to fire resist.<br />
same as above except +35 to poison.<br />
some gloves with +15% apply poison skill, and 10 second cast time poison bolt (our lowest level poison dot).  They are all/all and tradeable, and if they work at level 1 they might be ok for an alt.<br />
Two deluxe sewing kits.<br />
edit:  Also got 3 potions that cast &quot;harvest&quot;<br />

Someone from a university sociology or psychology department ought to study this game. The way people flock like lemmings to spend their plat on things that are utterly useless. Its a classic example of how to manipulate human tendancies. The developers at SOE may not be the most talented game designers, but they are utterly brilliant at understanding and taking advantage of known human behaviors. If it gets a chunk of the overabundant plat off the servers, I say good job to them too. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Holgresh Elder Beads, Pre-nerf Fungi Staff, ornate chain speed horses/drogmars, ST resistance stones, Ton Po sticks, etc are not completely useless to a character, in a general sense. They're as useless as upgrading any other piece of your equipment, which in the context of the game, is far from useless. And things like Beer Goggles, Guise of the Deciever,also have a use, enjoyment. Simple fun. Odd that a game should provide you with fun, I know, but hey, it does occasionaly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I think SoE did exactly what they set out to do, and I cheer them for it.<br />
  The economy will be back to normal in no time.<br />
I worked in a real life casino for 12 years.  Trust me the odds are no better then what you were seeing in Shadelings roost.<br />
  On the Vazaelle board today 2 people posted that they recieved Rubicite BP's, oh and one recieved the &quot;super&quot; lizard mount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I was hopeing that you could buy the items with tokens, that way you had a choice of if you wanted to gamble or not if you wanted the items.<br />
<br />
Hell with the way they have it set up, ain't no way I'm wasting plat there.  The other way........I would have been tempted to try to win some more tokens to get me on my way to getting item X.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Hail,<br />
<br />
I spent 10kpp on tokens, won about 20kpp back in additional tokens, and of course ultimately fed those back to the dealer.<br />
<br />
One Harvest potion.<br />
One Deluxe Sewing Kit.<br />
Several fireworks.<br />
Three stacks of food (at least).<br />
Two Velious quest gems (black marble &amp; something else).<br />
My biggest 'win' was receiving 20 tokens back (~2kpp value), which happened a few times.<br />
<br />
Very smart tactic to somewhat repair the economy.  Exactly the kind of plat sink the game needs.  I'm sure I'll be tossing more pp down the drain in the future.  Holgresh Elder beads are a toy I've wanted for some time.  DE mask would be fun, but I'll take the beads.  :cool: <br />
<br />
As to the poster wondering where some of us are getting our money...<br />
Eventually if you are fortunate enough you will reach a stage in the game where there are little to no tradable items that you can purchase for upgrades.  The 'fun' toys are either rare as hell or obscenely expensive (even for the wealthy), your spellbook and that of your friends is pretty much full (excepting ancients possibly), and you find yourself in the role of a shopper with nothing worth buying when you browse the bazaar.  If you don't succomb to twinking, you can end up having a very full bank account w/o even trying too hard.<br />
<br />
Of course many of us in this situation don't stop playing, so we end up continuing to accumulate platinum.  Even without smart business practices you can end up gathering hundreds of kpp just by playing the game and selling your loot below market value.  <br />
<br />
I personally have gone from being one of those players who rarely had 2kpp to scratch together to now having over 400kpp with very little I'm interested in buying.  When I win loot, I typically play 'Santa' and give it to friends or allies.  My solo playground (Tactics pit) can generate between 10-50kpp in a single session.  If I really farmed it hardcore (instead of casually while LFG for an Adventure) and sold everything I acquired I think I could have a million platinum within a week's time.<br />
<br />
I'm not in a big guild, not EP flagged, and I don't have any 'leet' secrets for gathering pp.  Read the boards, do the research, and most of all, spend your time IG on pursuits that are enjoyable to you.  If a good percentage of your time IG that you enjoy is also productive in terms of item/wealth accumulation, you'll soon be able to blow thousands of pp in a casino as well. :p <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

We're sorry to have to say this, but the new casino has become too popular. The huge number of players gambling at the casino is causing issues with the servers, and has been responsible for a few zone crashes. Unfortunately, this means that we have had to remove the casino NPCs until after the New Year arrives.</div></div><hr />

Give me a break. &quot;We have no clue what we're doing&quot;, &quot;We are lying, we just took millions of plat out of the economy.&quot;, &quot;Why until after the New Year? Who knows.&quot;</div></div><hr />

After a couple weeks, is there going to be anyone left wanting to play this game?  Or is it purely a temporary fix to remove plat from the game?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">If you don't know how to make huge amounts of plat now you never will.  It's not that hard to do and no i am not saying using cheats either.  There are many VIABLE items you can create with tradeskills that people will pay big money.  If you spend hours farming certain items or zones you can make large amounts of plat as well.<br />
You also have to realise that at some point you have everything and anythign you want and so the plat rots in your bank.  Giving it away isn't realistic so stop saying that.  If you were in our positions you would be doing the same thing.  losing 200-500k on these casino's to get an item we want is justified.  Ceretainly i think we would all have rtaher they just made a new merchant with these items and stuck a HUGE price tag on them but we can't have everything so we take what we can get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>thinzad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">some gloves with +15% apply poison skill, and 10 second cast time poison bolt (our lowest level poison dot).  They are all/all and tradeable, and if they work at level 1 they might be ok for an alt.<br />

Have you seen/heard of the same item, but no-drop?  Someone showed a pair of such gloves to me, but could not remember where he got them and I've been trying to track it down.<br />
<br />
Also - do these All/All gloves really work to apply the poison?  I'm feeling just a little miffed if they are letting anybody/everybody (with several hundred thousand plat to play with) start doing the Rogue poison thing.<br />
<br />
Finally, what is the exact name of these, please?  I want to vent at Sony.</div></div><hr />

You might have seen then as nodrop if someone augmented them. And just because they are all/all with + Mod to a skill doesn't mean anyone wearing them can do the skill.</div></div><hr />

I have seen those gloves before.  Snakefingers (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=7479) .  As I recall, you don't get to apply poison unless you are a rogue regardless of any item benefits (like the gloves) listed. <br />
<br />
So unless you are a rogue, the gloves are nothing but a twink toy, and not even a great one at that, since Poison Bolt is only a 5hp per tick DoT for up to 7 ticks (at level 12) w/ a 6pt DD component.  Ten second cast time makes these pretty cumbersome even for a twink unless you are pulling with a glove click. :rolleyes: <br />

I heard (not confirmed) Beer Goggles no longer drop in Greig's End.  Those silly things were always highly sought after (even to the tune of people blowing DKP on 'em, lol) awhile ago.  Too bad the goggles have no hp on 'em, or they'd be worth putting on against certain AE's. :D <br />

Ok, so these are like the Embalmers Skinning Knife that say a Rogue can use them, but do not summon bandages because Rogues do not have the necessary Mana?</div></div><hr />

 My warrior had no trouble proccing the bandages off the Embalmers Skinning Knife. I never heard of a proc that rused up your mana before.</div></div><hr />

Snakefingers is the name of the no-drop version.  Could someone with the tradeable kind please give me their name?  I've been swatted down on the /auction channel trying to locate a pair so I'd like to be able to redeam myself, as well as maybe buying a pair.</div></div><hr />

If, for some reason, you have one that doesn't work, a petition will fix the problem.</div></div><hr />
