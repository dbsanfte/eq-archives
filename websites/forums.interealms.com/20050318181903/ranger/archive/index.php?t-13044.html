<br />
If I'm right, and I want someone to correct me if I'm not please, I wonder how long it will take before any rangers get awarded these parchments by their guilds, considering the relative power of our 65 spells vs other classes.  Not really complaining, since I want our clerics to have Group Virtue and our chanters to have Group VoG too, but just saying, seems like we might have to wait a while! :)</div></div><hr />

I did get my Strength of Tunare spell off my very first parchment turn in though.  Seems the change to the return has had a good effect.  Either that or I'm just really lucky.  Now to get CoR, hehe.</div></div><hr />

Next time my guild kills a PoP boss - find a way to murder them all before it dies so i'm the only person standing when the boss goes down, then ninja the parchament!</div></div><hr />

For guilds who can get into third teir planes, 65 spells won't be too bad, but I don't know how everyone else will get them honestly, not for a very long time anyway.  Hopefully there will be an easier way to acquire them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">decairn</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It will be just like Luclin, but worse.  The top guilds only will get them, but unlike Luclin, other guilds are likely not to move in as it takes a serious leap in guild ability.  So you'll be seeing ridiculous prices on any that do become available.<br />
<br />
All the ones below 65 are common enough, parchments drop with decent frequency and are not limited to raid mobs either.</div></div><hr />

but it was met with a little confusion.<br />
<br />
I agree with you.  I think our 65 spells will probably be very rare to buy because first off it will be rare for the raid leader to award the ranger a level 65 spell because their are so many more casters that have better 65 level spells.  And secondly because we only have 2 spells that can be generated from that turn in so unless the ranger gets unlucky and keeps getting Cry of Thunder (or PotW) he will stop looting once he has gotten his 2 spells.  Hence no extras and no reason to loot from that point on.<br />
<br />
This way to get spells just further seperates the hardcore Uber guild players and the more casual middle tier guild players.  Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mirklin Darklander</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the other hand, if there's only 2 chances of spells you could get and BOTH are valuable, wouldn't a guild who has extras be MORE likely to turn it in to that quest giver since they KNOW they'll get something they can sell, as opposed to getting say &quot;greater imobolize&quot; or something less usable?<br />
<br />
I know our guild has &quot;class nights&quot; where basically when we're raiding, any parchments that are dropped generate spells for that class, the class members then take the spells they need, and the rest are turned back to the guild bank where they reside for awhile, and if no one needs them, they are sold on the open market to fund further raiding...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well eventually it might get like that Mirklin but that will be down the road a bit.  First the rarity of the spell would need to be built in.  I know for just value wise for a raid the shaman, cleric and pure caster spells (the good ones) would be far more valueable than the 2 ranger spells.   <br />
<br />
If you think about it the pure casters, shaman, cleric etc get completely new spells at 65 so when they turn their shadowed parchment in they have a random chance at 5 or so spells.  Verant might have built in a rare spell to come out of that so in fact Group Virtue could be the rare spell for cleric, for example, and so all the other 65 spells would become slightly common since clerics would keep on turning in shadowed parchments in search of Group Virtue.  If they keep getting spells they already have then those get distributed into guild and then flow into the public once the guild is full of that spell.  <br />
<br />
The ranger 65 unique spells are limited to just 2.  Once you turn in a few shadowed parchments you most likely will get your 2 spells and have no need to roll on shadowed parchments from that point on.  The extras you might have gotten would most likely be distributed within guild.  Only if the rangers in the guild keep getting unlucky and get Cry of Thunder or PotW over and and over will extra spells filter down to the public.<br />
<br />
62-64 level spells are a bit of a different story since, as I have been told, the parchments can be obtained by pickup groups that most likely would roll on any parchment that dropped.<br />
<br />
This is of course limited to just the people who will probably never see the mobs that drop the shadowed parchments.  If they do only drop off of the very high end stuff then the casual gamer will be forced to buy his/her spells.  It is only these people that this thread really is directed to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thundax Stormkeeper</div><div class="date">11-17-2002, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has a list of classes that we work through will parchments obtained from guild raids, or from people donating them that they have aquired earlier. We have a seperate list for Ethereal, Spectral and Shadowy, and just keep working through the list. Certain classes that we have alot of like Clerics or Paladins we will have them twice on the list each run through, whereas Rangers who only need 2 ethereal spells will get skipped when we deem that they don't really need guild help getting their spells (because they already have them).<br />
<br />
I don't really see how guilds can award parchments at a raid. It seems really difficult to decide which person gets to loot a shadowy parchment out of a raid of 60 people considering 45 of them are probably spell casters and would all want the parchment.<br />

<br />
As for awarding Parchments. I'm an officer in my guild, and we realized it was gonna be pretty much impossible to award parchments. So we just decided to loot them all, turn them in to the NPC of the class that the guild could use spells from. Then award the spell you get afterwards, it gets alot easier that way. Gives you all the time you need to think through the awarding of the spell.</div></div><hr />
