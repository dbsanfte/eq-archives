<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, I havent really been to Ykesha any, but I am also lvl 44 atm, and my magelo is in my profile.  Everything in there was pretty easy to get for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>xorekill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would recommend, if you want to solo, the castle near the Dulak zone in Gunthak.  From the Dulak zone, just hug the right wall around.  You'll find the castle with a pit and valley to either side.  From here, you can go up and pull down either mushrooms, drogmors, or initaites (various races) and solo with some difficulty.  On a bad pull, you'll only have to deal with 2, unlike in Dulak where a bad pull can sometimes net you 3 or more depending on pops.  But, be aware of the Ogre initiates, as they seem to have higher resists and more hps than the other mobs.  Be sure to land a mala-x before you slow.</div></div><hr />

Solo is all I did from level 1 to my current level. I was stoked at level 44 cause I could do the nadox elementals at that level. Gunthak is full of solo spots. I would setup sometimes in front of the pirate fort (make your first left from the tunnel after entering from the beach), and pull the obvious single pulls from the fort and whatever mobs I felt like in the tunnel. Dulak was a little to tough to make good exp at consistently. Mostly my time was spent soloing in nadox mostly, gunthak occasionaly, and doing the drunks a little till I got my drunken flask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well atm i'm grouping with a lvl 54 Shammy, but he says the exp is horrible with me grouped, but i told him i'd grp until i could get buffed with c3 (that helps me solo cause i run outta mana too quickly...should've said that in my first post  :( ) and then i'd solo a bit.  i was able to solo Jetsam and Flotsam for the Stoicism quest at 43 (dk blue) and most of Dulak mobs are dk blue, so i should be able to solo pretty well...just too many adds for me to handle by myself with my current amount of mana. plus it takes so long to med/rest that it's not very efficient leveling. sry about not saying a few things in my first post and thx again to everyong that helps  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Garet_Jax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 44 you can go to DL and solo at the skelly camp. great exp, you can stay ther till 51 then it drys up loot itsnt that great but ill take a few pp when ever I can get it =D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gimak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I Solo'd Dulak from 40 to about 46 then went to CoM till 50 then back to Dulak.<br />
<br />
Solo the entrance - you'll get trained now and again but you can bail easily.<br />
<br />
CoM has been revamped so I'm not sure how that'll now but xp was really good for a few levels in the high 40's.<br />
<br />
From 50 on I solo'd near the Ocean Crasher dock - if you head there you'll see a wood wall to your right if you are looking at the dock. Head over there and pull from the buildings beside and in front of you. Won't get trained or get adds if you keep your head up.<br />
<br />
As for DL, I solo'd until 40. Thought xp was much better in Dulak, plus you get the odd jewel that drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">just got back from CoM, as in grp there with 2 guildies, and all of use died at least once...40 Paladin, 41 Monk, and me, 45 Shammy. luckily, the Paladin had a Cleric on another account, so we all got 90% rezzes :D  so no1 lost ne lvls.<br />
<br />
i also tried to solo Dulak last nite at 45, and too many adds for me to handle by myself. even with doggy and c3, was too much.<br />
<br />
so i'm wondering around, trying out different spots. thx for all who posted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">City of Mist is your best bet.  Since the revamp things die ridiculously easy with as little as Togor's Insect's to pull, Venom of the Snake and letting your pet munch them to death.<br />
<br />
With Stoicism you dont have much down time.  Takes me 8% mana to cast stoicism, but after cannying I end up with more health and more mana than it cost to cast :P.  Do that while your pet is munchin on the non-running enemies (did I forget to mention that :P).  It's too damn easy actually.  And I need my pages out of here anyway so no harm no foul here.<br />
<br />
1% per kill as an iksar is damn good - that skelly camp in DL takes 2 skels to get 1% for me at my current level of 46 (dinged 47 in an LDoN mission but I'll be goin back to CoM after the game :D ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well, i'll try soloing there when i recover (broken wrist, so i can't do much hunting  :( ) and i've hit 49, so should be easier with EBolt/Plague, and new buffs/pet. thx  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why solo?  Shaman a great and in-demand group class.  Try some LDoN and make massive easy xp!<br />
<br />
I guess some people somehow enjoy the tedium of soloing and maybe they're good at it but I get way more xp and have way more fun in groups than I ever could solo.  Killing things solo takes way longer and there's more down time...ick!<br />
<br />
The *only* thing I can ever see myself soloing is the drunken pirates to get a flask if I ever find that good solo spot where you can get singles.<br />
<br />
The emphasis of this thread seems to be soloing - and I never have been able to understand why people play MMORPGs (where one of them M's stands for 'multiplayer') with the intention of soloing.  It boggles the mind.<br />
<br />
Well anyways, whatever floats your boat.<br />

I'm assuming that you're a low level by both the way you talk about the flask and your distaste for soloing.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you feel like playing, but don't feel like doing LDoN...again (or OS...again.  or raiding....again).  It's not as if people who solo do nothing but solo their entire lives, it's just something to do to not inconvinence other people: with your boredom, your lack of time to put forth the effort required, or your overall non-social attitude for that day.  There are days when you can be LFG and giving tells to everyone you know and people you don't know for 2 or more hours.  There are days when I only have an hour to play, I don't wanna take a slot in a group that could potentially be used longer, that gimps the group sometimes when your only haster / slower leaves.  There are days when my last few adventure's (LDoN or otherwise) just feel too monotonous, and the challenge of soloing is more appealing because it's a challenge - it's something different.<br />
<br />
You go ahead and sit on your bum cuz you don't wanna solo on those days that you feel like playing but can't get a group or don't want a group.  I'll go get xp in CoM or somewhere with my LFG flag up bound in PoK waiting for someone to send me a tell cuz they need me instead of avidly looking for a group when it's not going to do a lick of good, k?<br />
<br />
Hopefully this has provided your mind with insight as to why people would solo.  If not, I weep for you.<br />
<br />
Oh and one last thing, with KEI and Virtue you can solo and gain xp faster than some LDoN groups (the slow moving ones).  Right now I leave LDoN groups with about a yellow of xp, if it takes less than an hour thats good, if it takes the entire 90 minutes + clearing of the level thats not good.  I can get a yellow of xp an hour soloing in CoM.  That's another reason people solo instead of group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i have done loads of LDoN advs. (how i got from 45-49 in less than a month) and i agree, it's MUCH more efficient. and sumtimes i just don't feel like grouping (as Vesik said). i'm also on a 3 hour per day limit cause of mom, so don't have alot of time to wait around to get a grp together. been taking a break from EQ tho lately (wrist) but i was able to do an adv. at near-full-ability &lt;cheer&gt;. gotta go. later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Soloing is a matter of taste.. and its just ONE option. I'm often the only one on in my guild, and often when few people are on.<br />
<br />
I love to duo, and enjoy joining higher lvl people in higher lvl zones to learn what lies ahead.<br />
<br />
At lvl 44 I'm soloing Ice Giants in Everfrost, Wolves, Zels and hoppers in DSP, Hill Giants in Rathe, and the highest level named goblins in Runnyeye (looking for a BAM).. and xp off all.<br />
<br />
Learn when to tank (not much at this level), how to buff pet, what to set for spells, how to root/dot, how to dot and run, and when to zone/gate : )<br />
