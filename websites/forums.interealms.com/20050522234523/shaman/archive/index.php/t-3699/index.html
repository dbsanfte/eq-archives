<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm curious what level can you start grouping in Maiden's Eye?  Especially to hunt the mobs that drop the centi weapons.  Can a group of 45's do it?  My guild is small and new but many of the members are pushing 40 or 41 and most of the rest have mains in the mid 30's  Me having two &quot;mains&quot; am a little behind with a lvl 32 Shaman and 32 Warrior.  Or do you need to be more 50+ to hunt in ME?  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go try it and see how you go!<br />
<br />
Not so long ago things in Hate and Fear were higher level than the highest level player.<br />
<br />
A group of 45's could certainly survive there I reckon, you're going to get a lot of resists on things tho so make sure you have a beefy tank and some healing power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you might jsut manage it, you'll need a dam fine group, im thinking to b save go 48+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The mobs that drop the centi weapons are the Umbrous Toilers. They are all over, but there is an area on the north wall, east of the big fort that is generally considered &quot;toiler hill&quot;. You can hang out at the north wall and pull them up the wall in reasonable safety. It's akin to hunting in OT. The toilers hit for a max of 131 and are still blue at 60. I feasted on them solo at 54 with little trouble. They seemed to have low MR, had maybe 5-8k hp and run when low on HP. I would imagine that a mid to high 40s group would have no trouble with them - assuming they had a good slower. If you were too low to slow effectively, then you might have trouble. Keep SoW up, know where the zone is and call your trains and you shouldn't have any trouble. Just be prepared to see lots and lots and lots of stuff red to you everywhere you turn.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lot's of stuff there thats red to me.  They also assist each other and you cannot lvl pull as they are blue to a 60.  But you should still be able to do it if your careful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Toilers are definately your best bet in the 40's.  Havent done anything more than pass through ME in a couple levels, but as I recall...<br />
<br />
At 55, some of the gorangas were blue, some were even, some might have been yellow to me at 55.  Stay out of the fort looking thing in the middle of the city.  Full of robes and 4 arms, and alot of those are quite high level.  Not that easy to get singles at all either.<br />
<br />
I havent' fought vampires, skellies or wolves that much from ME, so I can't comment on them to much.<br />
<br />
Toilers are definately an option though.  To get to toiler hill.  Zone in from Dawnshroud, run straight, you'll pass the fort I warned you about.  Be sure to con all the robes, some see invis.  When you pass the fort, turn left and continue to follow the wall of the fort.  The zone wall is right in front of you.  Most people fighting toilers kill them on that wall, from the fort edge to the edge of the lake.<br />
<br />
Not much wanders between the lake in the fort besides toilers, although occasionally a robe will wander in.<br />
<br />
edit - I dont know my right from left.  No, really I dont</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would suggest avoiding everything but the Toilers if you are there in your 40s, with the exception of the goranga gatherers. The goranga gatherers are in the mid-high 40s in level. The goranga named get up to lvl 58 or so. <br />
<br />
<br />
The vampires are a fun fight, but NASTY. They appear immune to disease and poison, flurry but do not enrage , lifetap (sometimes double!) for 200 points of damage and hit for up to 150. I think they get up to lvl 55. Since they could do 700 pts of damage per attack (150+200 +150+200 ) and they attack fast, I don't think you want to mess with them under 50.<br />
<br />
Bats, Skeles and wolves are pretty much straight melee fight. They have a ton of hp, some hit into the 160s and drop no loot that I know of. Worms are also a straight melee fight, but occasionally drop loot, though I've never gotten any from them. <br />
<br />
The robed guys ( Xi Vius and Xi Xaui ) are SK or Clerics. The clerics can be rough since they will nuke for 500 pts of damage. Good MR helps, but being high lvl helps much more. If you are lowish level, I would recommend avoiding them. They are up to lvl 55. They drop a couple of decent drops, including the Shrouded Medallion. <br />
<br />
The 4 arms ( Xin Thall Centien ) are usually clerics or tanks and up to lvl 58. Again, the clerics can be nasty. If you are a bunch of lvl 40s, I'd avoid them. Unless you have a whole bunch of 40s and want to attack it like a raid target =) They do drop some really nice loot though, ac 20 belt, ac 20 rog/brd gloves, etc. <br />
<br />
Toilers are your target though. They drop centi toes and meat ( good stuff to practice baking with ), words and runes, and centi items. The centi warhammer and warspear are reasonably common and I've had to leave a lot of centi weapons to rot because they are lore...<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
