I don't know enough about the man to know whether I like him or not but I find it funny some of the things his opponents are saying about him.<br />
<br />
They range from all sorts of rhetoric including if he were to be elected it would be the end of democracy to if he is elected France would lose any sort of prominence it possesses in the world (as if France had some sort of prominence to begin with?)<br />
<br />
At any rate it really sounds as though this guy is the protest vote to basically &quot;check&quot; the current leaders into falling back in line with the people.<br />
<br />
Its not unlike a Ross Perot run or a Ralph Nader run.  I don't think anyone seriously expects him to win but he is stirring things up a little which to be honest I think the French could use.<br />
<br />
Sounds like someone needs to tell France &quot;HEY in democratic societies shaky up the vote is often a GOOD thing&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not this guy.  He's essentially a fascist, which is not a funny thing any way you slice it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kullaas it doesn't matter what the guy is.<br />
<br />
The fact that that the Socialist party is trying to use scare tactics to block this guy on the premise that it will be the end of France is just silly.<br />
<br />
Instead they should be trying to engage this guy into a debate and argue down his ideas on national Television.<br />
<br />
When Perot or Nader ran in this country people were either upset or happy about a &quot;strong&quot; third party showing.<br />
<br />
But I don't remember hearing anyone saying that the third party if they win would end the US.<br />
<br />
In fact the people who were upset were upset because it was siphoning off votes from their choice.  Perot stole votes from Bush Sr. which allowed Clinton to sneak in during his first office (his second office was a no-contest really) and then Nader siphoned off Gore votes in various places which led to a Bush Jr. win so the third party thing has worked for and against both sides in this country.<br />
<br />
In France though they seem to think something like this is huge or something.<br />
<br />
Also our number of examples of Facist governments is very limited and while I'm not saying I favor it I do think facist government systems might be more akin to democratic ideals then any other models of government pervailent in the world.<br />
<br />
Communist = another excuse for dictatorship with no examples of &quot;good&quot; guys.<br />
<br />
Dictatorship= at least their honest in how they rule (of which there are a few &quot;good&quot; dictators.)<br />
<br />
Monarchy = Dictatorship through bloodline (of which there are a few &quot;good&quot; monarchs.)<br />
<br />
Democracies and Democratic Republics which we(the US) are the second type and have a whole range of good to bad in terms of how they rule throughout the world.<br />
<br />
I don't know of any facists currently in existance and the historical scope they did exist was too limited to critique that system very well but keep in mind that both Britain and the US almost joined the Germans and Japanese due to similar feelings of various OTHER governments.  And at least Facists have a sort of parliamentary system where as communists and dictatorships at best have puppet shows.<br />
<br />
At any rate whether you like the guy or not the way to be handling this isn't smearing a guy with &quot;End of France&quot; BS but rather engaging him in debate and ousting his ideals.</div></div><hr />

Fascim =/ funny<br />
<br />
LePen is very unlike Ross Perot or Ralph Nader.  Fascism is NOT about honoring the will of the people, it's about establishing dictatorial control by the government.  Were I a citizen of France, I'd be quite upset as well - having LePen in power would very definitely be the end of France as we know it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Tel that this might be a very good thing not only for France but for other republics as well. This man won his primary because of a record low voter turn-out.<br />
<br />
If you don't vote, you don't get to complain about who gets elected.<br />
<br />
The lesson this can teach France, the US, England, etc. is that if you have the right to vote, youo'd better use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off several people are confusing several things I said.<br />
<br />
First a &quot;third&quot; party candidate showing well in the polls is good for France cause it will mean French people will get off their duffs and hit the polls hard to get their voices heard.<br />
<br />
The anger this man presents to the French people will improve voter turn out thus improving the voice of the people.<br />
<br />
I'm comparing this phenomenon with Perot or Nader running (which led to more people voting in both accounts cause they wanted to make sure the third party was stomped.)  However I'm not comparing the men to each other.<br />
<br />
I very well know Perot and Nader and Le Pen have nothing in common... its the &quot;third party anomaly&quot; I'm comparing in terms of how its affecting polls.<br />
<br />
Secondly I'm not saying Facism is democratic... far from it.  However what I am saying is there have not been enough Facist governments to do a comprehensive study to determine whether they are an effective form of government.  The ones that did exist were squashed (mainly due to reaction to their aggression) so early in their lifecycles that government/social scientist never got a chance to study their ability for longevity or impact on the economic scene.<br />
<br />
Also the definition provided above does not accurately portray what a facist government is.  In fact I would go so far as to say that person who wrote that definiation oversimplified the definition to match that of &quot;dictatorship&quot; which if anyone took a course in governments aside from the standard government class all college people take which mainly covers our own form of government they will know of the more finer points of differences in styles of government.<br />
<br />
Also the above definition could easily be applied to what we call modern day Communist Governments.  So the definition is SO vague its useless.<br />
<br />
A facist government often will have a strong central leader like Hitler or Mussolini(sp?) but they also have a parliamentary bureucracy in place as well and of which has the ability to trump the central leader on occasion.  (Hitler and Muso both got trumped a few times by their parliamentary bodies)<br />
<br />
Also its kinda hard to argue against that as a system of government the German Facist was one of the most efficient and productive in the world at that time.<br />
<br />
Yes morally we have some problems with how they did things but on a pure economic state they were a superpower.<br />
<br />
And on a pure military front they were a super power (remember it took the US Russia and Britain COMBINED to crack the German military machine.<br />
<br />
And on the scientific front they were also a superpower.  They almost had the atom bomb before we did had it not been for a VERY lucky break when Norwegian resistance fighters destroyed a main payload of atomic material.<br />
<br />
So what I'm saying is Morally Yes I've got some problems with PAST facist governments.  However the raw system itself is not evil in my opinion and in fact might be a model which could surpass democratic models of government in terms of efficiency and other National traits.<br />
<br />
Remember folks Democracy is NOT the normal method of governing in the history of mankind.  We are an anomaly.  A freak in the history of the world.  More over if we look at every pass attempt at Democracy it has ALWAYS ALWAYS turned to Empire.  And I don't mean to steal words but George Lucas said it best.  Its not because of a Coup or a violent revolution its because the people GIVE away their power to the government.  For examples look at Greece, Rome, and Britain(they had a democratic form of government before us).<br />
<br />
And well lets look at the US today.  How much MORE power do we give our government today than say 100 years ago... then compare that to 200 years ago.  We live in a much less free nation today than our forefathers did.  And our goal on the world scene is QUITE often viewed as Imperialistic though in a manner different from previous forms.  <br />
<br />
Rather than conquer the land we simply exert so much influence over an area that other nations will behave the way we want to.  Much simpler than sending an army in to hold the place.  And again I'm not totally against Empire either.  <br />
<br />
<br />
In fact depending on how its run I think Empire can be a very beneficial method of governing for the people even if the people don't have as much voice.  Remember as a nation we have had ingrained into us that<br />
 the voice of the people = good<br />
 the voice of the one = bad<br />
But to be honest this method of thinking is fairly new and at best in its infancy still and nobody really knows whether that is a good thing or not.  I generally tend to operate under those assumptions myself but I look around at various historical models than I look at the road the US is taking and I have to question if this really the best path.<br />
<br />
More over I'm very open minded about the possibilty that perhaps the human race simply can't handle democracy.  Since the tradional method of rulership has been monarchy it may be something very much ingrained into us that we as a human race are meant to follow kings and emperors.  One could even argue this religiously stating that EVERY major religion makes references to the power of Kingships or Emperorships and NEVER to the power of the people.<br />
<br />
In a sense pick your religion and &quot;god&quot; says Kings are the way its done.<br />
<br />
Just some food for thought but remember America isn't called the &quot;Great Experiment&quot; for nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
while I'm not saying I favor it I do think facist government systems might be more akin to democratic ideals then any other models of government pervailent in the world.  <br />
<br />
Read the whole sentence and coupled with my previous argument that the FEW examples of Facist governments did at least have a parliamentary body able to &quot;check&quot; the central authority and those parliamentary representatives were elected there (albeit from a previleged elite class) then look at the list of governmental types in my first post and you will see my statement is dead on.<br />
<br />
Monarchies... King says its done<br />
Dictatorships... Dictator says its done<br />
&quot;Communists&quot;... hide behind a name... All Communist countries are either Dictatorships OR more akin to Facist states themselves with a central leader a Parliamentary buraucracy.<br />
<br />
So Kullaas stop trying to shove words in my mouth and paint me as something I'm not.<br />
<br />
As I said I favor a Democratic Republic system of government first and formost but that doesn't mean we should ignore other forms of government or entertain the idea that perhaps other forms are better.  If we didn't look at other forms of government  for ways to either improve our own or even to replace our own then we wouldn't be a very good model for a <br />

<br />
Now that is a better question/argument.. or at least a more clear approach to getting what info you want me to provide.<br />
<br />
A monarchy is a hereditary based system of government where the people have no say whatsoever (including the &quot;elite&quot;) and the King pretty much says the word and that word is done unquestionably.<br />
<br />
The definition of Facism provided in this thread is overly simplistic and really would require a course to fully explain the differences between a facist government and a dictatorship.<br />
<br />
On the surface they appear very similar in practice they behave a bit different.<br />
<br />
A dictatorship is essentially a monarchy without the hereditary link to pass on rulership from leader to the next (though in some countries I do believe that the sons are usually set in place to take over from their father i.e. Iraq and the Hussein family)<br />
<br />
Facism however has a parliamentary &quot;council&quot; with representatives elected (usually from some sort of &quot;elite&quot; class) that presents a second &quot;voice&quot; within the governmental structure (albeit that voice can be weak in comparison to the central leader).<br />
<br />
Nazi germany is unfortunately one of only 2 prominent Facist governments to take as a study case in point so please forgive me in my example and don't decry me as playing the Nazi card in a thread (the one that supposedly makes the thread a null and void topic).<br />
<br />
But Nazi Germany makes a VERY good example case.  Brush aside the moral agenda the government had (which I admit is a major thing to brush aside but its irrellavant when talking about RAW performance of a governing system).<br />
<br />
Hitler was ELECTED to his position and subsequently changed the government to enforce a Nazi agenda (much like any communist country does today) by suppressing the opposition and rigging the future votes of the public.<br />
<br />
More over the Parliamentary positions were elected in this case &quot;fairly&quot; in as far as those &quot;elite&quot; who were allowed to vote all voted equally.<br />
<br />
The Parliament quite OFTEN disagreed with Hitler and his view and on several occasions forced Hitler to change his plans.  Admittedly Hitler was in general the stronger of the two sides but Hitler had to rely on the Parliamentary system in place to maintain his power base so he at times had to go along even if he didn't like it.  The Parliament was heavily in control of the military might of Germany (along with various important generals like Rommel and SS personal like Geobels).<br />
<br />
While in general ALL of them had a very similar agenda they didn't ALL agree about HOW to complete that agenda and this lead to power struggles within the government (often unseen by the outside world partly because we purposely blinded ourselves so that we could demonize one man Hitler and thus make it easier to rally against Hitler).<br />
<br />
Rommel and Goebels and other Nazi big wigs didn't become prominent household names til AFTER the war ended because it wasn't til AFTER the war that it became apparent just how much power these men had in their various sections of the Nazi power structure.<br />
<br />
So you see in the case of Facism There are elements of REPRESENTATIVE government (albeit they represent a select &quot;elite&quot; and not a general populace) which right there makes it closer to a democratic system of government then those other three types I mentioned.  Especially when you consider the forefathers first favored an &quot;elite&quot; landowning class to be the ONLY ones to vote.<br />
<br />
Also Hitlers position as Furher would not have passed down to his hereditary heirs rather the Parliament had established rules to go about ELECTING a new Furor.<br />
<br />
So does this make more sense?  I'm not saying Facism = Democracy what I'm saying is there is more in common with Democracy/Republicism to Facism than there is with Democracy to Those OTHER three types of governments that now PERVAILANT in the world.<br />
<br />
More over just because the two prominent examples of Facism were evil and failed doesn't mean this system itself is evil.<br />
<br />
2 historical examples(Germany and Italy and I suppose you might want to include Spain though it was a piss poor example of anything) in the great scheme of things is hardly a fair comparison.<br />
<br />
If we took Democracy's track record we could easily say the Greeks were just as bad as the Nazis in that they purposely owned slaves, genocided their enemies when possible, and were in general an expansive nation.<br />
<br />
The Romans were even worse at it than the Greeks.<br />
<br />
And even us Americans can be said to be HIGHLY expansive pushing native peoples out of the lands and FORCING our will upon the rest of the world (not to mention the Genocide of the indians and the owning of slaves).  All of sudden things don't look so black and white as to whether a government dictates solely on its own the moral compass of the nation.<br />
<br />
But then I have to ask you... Where do we draw the line that EXPANSION is evil or not?  Without expansion you and I wouldn't be able to have this debate... With it you and I ARE having this debate.... It is that fundamentally close to OUR lives even today.<br />
<br />
SO while previous forms of Facism were what we termed evil who is to say that a future form of Facism won't turn out to be a &quot;good&quot; and effective form of government.<br />
<br />
If the French people VOTE to choose this then THEY chose it and its their RIGHT to choose it.<br />
<br />
Likewise if a nation were to VOTE to turn communist then THEY chose it and they have a RIGHT to choose it.<br />
<br />
Its the VIOLENT creation of these regimes that defies what we consider right or wrong... Peaceful coups or voting in of that type of government is EXACTLY what Democracy is about...<br />
<br />
But what I see people in France doing is decrying this Le Pen person as some sort of power hungry individual when in fact he is COMPLETELY playing BY THE RULES so even if he is power hungry (which you would have to argue ANY leader is to some extent... its part of the fire in the belly they need to own) he is not breaking any laws by trying for this power grab.<br />
<br />
So make up your minds folks... you either embrace democracy in it full ugliest which means allowing us to choose our own fate even if that fate is a stupid one or we go under a system like Monarchies or  Dictatorships where the decisions are made for us which to be honest throughout history have been no better or worse than the decision the Mobs err the Democracies seems to make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets look at some extreme examples.  First, the bad:<br />
1. South Africa, pre-1992.  Representative democracy.  The majority population of the country's citizens were deprived of basic civil rights and forced lived in squalor.<br />
2. Haiti, post 1988.  Representative democracy.  Every new elected leader has robbed, pillaged and robbed the country blind.<br />
3. Argentinia, post-Peron.  Representative democracy. This country has been an economic basket case ever since Peron, despite abundant natural resources, a pleasnat climate, and a strong cultural work ethic.<br />
4. Yugoslavia, post-communism.  Representative democracy which evolved into a representative-fascism.  We all know what happened here.<br />
5. Lousiana, pre-Huey Long, post-civil war.  Representative democracy.  Actually locally governed by a long list of do-nothing corrupt carpet-baggers who drove the state into dire poverty and kept blacks oppressed.<br />
<br />
Now, the &quot;unexpected&quot;:<br />
1. Yugoslavia, 1945-1990.  Communist state under Marshal Tito.  Some freedoms, econmically relatively successful (remember the &quot;Yugos&quot;?).  Rather good standard of living.  No civil strife, no ethnic cleansing.<br />
2. Cuba, 1960-present.  Communist state under Castro.  Minimal freedoms.  Despite a debilitating 40-year long trade embargo, the population is relatively healthy and educated and a middle class has developed.  Common people are far better off compared to the pre-Castro dictators.<br />
3. China, 1990-present.  Communist state with many economic and some political freedoms.  Economy and standard of living showing huge gains, dire poverty and starvation has been eliminated.<br />
4. Lousiana, under Huey Long (and later, Earl Long).  Benevolent (but somewhat corrupt) governor- dictator.  Built highways, roads, bridges, libraries, museums, hospitals, colleges, airports.  State experienced a huge increase in the standard of living, despite the rest of the U.S. being in a terrible depression.  Abolished poll taxes, hired many blacks into the state government, allowed blacks to vote, and used National Guard to protect polls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is what I was trying to present all along.<br />
<br />
The system of government in and of itself is rarely good or evil its just some systems seem more or less prone to behaviors considered good or evil.<br />
<br />
In the end however I've found that the culture(of which the political system can be a greater or lesser extent of) is the overwhelming factor in choosing a moral ground to work on.<br />
<br />
Oh and to add to Locz list there... The French people now have a tough choice to make...<br />
<br />
They choose a racist facist(Le Pen) or they choose a swindling crook (Chirac).<br />
<br />
Frankly its the French own fault through lack of voting they are in the mess they are in now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also to measure where I stand politically the 1 dimension scale (i.e. Left or Right) won't map me very well and I'll come out as moderate.<br />
<br />
However if you use a 4 dimensional scale (of which is considered more accurate to depict someones politcal &quot;place&quot;) I come out as very economically free, personal liberty free, internationally Hawkish, Technologically free, and at the same time personally morally conservative.<br />
<br />
As a Christian (especially in regards to science and &quot;Morality Laws&quot;)  I actually come out very much AGAINST what most other Christians say.  I don't believe morals in micro-managed situations should be codified into law... Its broader principles such as Life, and Liberty which should be codified into laws which protect said ideals.<br />
<br />
As for answers to your trivia question...<br />
<br />
American Civil War and ... don't have a clue on the second one but I will propose the American Revolutionary War though to be honest we were not yet a democracy and Britain while it had a parliament would still be classified as a Monarchy at the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the trivia question, it depends on the definition of &quot;war&quot; and &quot;democracy/republic&quot;.  Do the wars have to be declared?  And do communist countries count as &quot;republics&quot; (eg. People's Republic of China).  Some candidates:<br />
<br />
Korean war (RPoC, US)<br />

 <br />
Hmm well...<br />
Field Marshal Rommel as well as many, many other German soldiers certainly wasn't a Nazi. He was a soldier, nothing more, nothing less, and not only didn't care for the nazi party, but actually actively opposed them in the end and joined the Wehrmacht's (unfortunately failed) attempt to kill Hitler and save what was left of Germany then. The SS found out about his involvement, and paid him a visit, offering him a choice: to be dragged to court along with his family, and be executed as a traitor, or to take the poison they brought with them, be buried as a soldier, and his family would be safe and provided for. It was an easy choice for him...<br />
<br />
Please, don't compare men like him to scum like Goebbels and his cronies.<br />
<br />
And he was well known enough during the war... so well known actually, that his name alone was used as an excuse for a defeat (&quot;Well, uhm, and then we met Rommel's troops...&quot;). Read the book &quot;Rommel&quot; by British General Desmond Young, written in 1955 or so... it's interesting, and you may learn a thing or two about &quot;the other side&quot;. ;)</div></div><hr />

Le Pen got to the final round with 16% of valid votes... therefore the main reason for him getting there is not so much the low turnout (which was due to the fact that everyone thought that the second round would be Chirac vs. Jospin) but the large number of candidates that shared the rest of the votes. <br />
<br />
If you add up all the left affiliated candidates you get to more than 40% of votes, same thing for the right affiliated (about 40%). Also note that Le Pen has had about 15% of votes in most of the recents election, so his score in itself is not a surprise.<br />
<br />
The awful thing for democracy is that about half the population will have to vote for someone they either don't agree with, or simply despise. And based on the above, I wouldnt' blame it on the French voters.</div></div><hr />

He want to pursue a more politic solution of removing him from power, because he feared killing him would create a martyr.  He was just implicated later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Morgaelin while Rommel was a soldier first and foremost he was also a Nazi.<br />
<br />
He believed in the idea of a Super Race and he even based his selection of officers on that premise.  Also he believed in MANY of the political goals of the Nazi army and it wasn't til later in the war when his supplies were being cut off and he was getting lunatic orders from Berlin that he became a turn coat and even then relunctantly.<br />
<br />
Yes Rommel made some headlines during the war but he was never demonized like Hitler was.<br />
<br />
Its a common rallying technique that has been used throughour histroy.<br />
<br />
Demonize the other side's leader.<br />
<br />
WWI it was Kill the Kaiser<br />
WWII it was Kill Hitler<br />
Gulf War it was Kill Saddam<br />
Today's Terrorist War its kill Bin Laden<br />
<br />
Wars that don't pin a blame on someone specific are often much more hard to rally against.<br />
Examples include the Civil War &quot;North vs South&quot; concept rallied a little but it was amazing how many relations simply walked away from each other mid-battle if they were on opposite sides.  And it was doubly hard to keep a soldier in ranks after he actually had killed his brother/cousin in battle.<br />
<br />
The Vietnam War.  Aside from a lack of clear purpose there, the main demonization was against a nebulous group.  The VC.  In fact to help demonize something the troops started using &quot;Charlie&quot; to identify the enemy.<br />
<br />
Also in WWII on the pacific theatre references to Emperor Hirohito were almost nothing.  Its was always the &quot;Japs&quot;.<br />
<br />
So as far as what happened in WWII there were several Nazi big wigs (or if your insistant Rommel and several others were not Nazi's they still had significant influence on the direction of Germany) which restrained Hitler's will for a long part of Nazi rule.<br />
<br />
In fact I would argue that until the last year of the war when Hitler in his madness started cleansing all opposition (including Rommel) that Germany's success was largely due to other leaders in the Reich's government structure.<br />
<br />
When Hitler took over full control and essentially changed the facsist government into a pure dictatorship is when Germany faltered and eventually loss.<br />
<br />
As far as reading material I've read tons on WWII but I'll look into the book suggestion you made though I believe I've already saw the &quot;biographical&quot; movie of Rommel based on that book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morgaelin</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked the book again... Kullaas is right. Rommel's plan was to have the army arrest Hitler and put him to trial for his crimes. However, he was heavily wounded during the fighting after D-Day and so couldn't take further action. When he recovered, the whole thing was over and had failed badly.<br />
<br />
Telumehtar - in the entire book, which I believe to be rather fair and unbiased because it was written by a british general, there is no hint that he was a nazi or believed in that super race stuff. And I think I saw the movie (long ago...), and remember it starting right away with a scene that wasn't in the book. ;)  Other than that, I agree with your post.<br />
...<br />
Hmm... I could probably try to write some long boring paragraphs about all this, but after all this is not really about the original topic, and honestly I don't trust my english writing skill enough to express myself correctly about a rather complex topic like this. Sorry, I didn't mean to hijack the thread.</div></div><hr />

I read *alot* of stuff about him from a multitude of sources including his journal.  From all I read, he was a Nazi in name only.  He didn't know about the camps.  He either disagreed or was nuetral on most everything else.</div></div><hr />
