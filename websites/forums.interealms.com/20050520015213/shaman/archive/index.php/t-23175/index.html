I'm honestly thinking that the shaman one is going to keep with the nice tradition of time weapons and keep Turgor's or Nihil on it.  It would make the most sense to me (well... nm hehe).  I know personally that there is only one thing that would force me to bank my TA.. and that's something else with the same effect on it.  The only real question is.... right now I think that TA has the best weapon graphic in the game, and I would hate for it to be something like the hammer that the clerics got.  <br />
<br />
Cleric weapon is nice I guess for a free heal.. combine that with their weapon from VP and that is two free heals for no mana (great for emergency times).  Bard is a minimal dps wise upgrade, however I know that that focus is something that is great for them, and combined with the huge increase in resists and hps.<br />

I'm pretty certain it was posted on the cruicible somewhere that our weapon had Daluda's Mending on it.  But I could be getting confused with the VP weapon or something else.<br />

<br />
Aruman, which mob dropped those 2 weapons? Pixxt Riel Tavas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It always amazes me when people say they have had so many Saryrn kills and so little drops.  In the last 4 kills of Saryrn I have seen 2 drop and before I was Time flagged 1 rotted.  <br />
<br />
Back on topic tho yes, Balance would be great on a weapon of that lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/shrug, its just the chaotic nature of the RNG.   Our guild has gotten 5 TA's out of 43 kills.  The other guilds on our server that have been farming Time for a long time now (less than us tho) have them going to alts or rotting.  <br />
<br />
Saryrn drop rate (43 kills):<br />
<br />
Symbol of the Planemasters - 12<br />
Ring of Evasion - 16<br />
Time's Antithesis - 5<br />
Runewarded Belt - 16<br />

Veil of Lost Hopes - 5 <br />
Cap of Flowing Time - 18<br />
Gloves of the Unseen - 18<br />
Edge of Eternity - 17<br />
<br />
Now, for most guilds thats probably a fair drop rate, as most aren't going to have over 5 mages or 5 shaman.  Unfortunately for us, we have 9 shaman, 3 active ones still without a TA.<br />
<br />
Until we see a Detrimental Extension Focus from Tacvi, I'm not sure if I can give up my Hammer of Hours though, even if the Tacvi weapon has Balance of Nihil on it.  Sure, I'll loot one, but I'm not sure which I'd keep equipped most often.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">clicky slow is good .. it's very unexpectedly good .. i just got a TA off saryn last week, the difference between casting slow and just clicking it it immense .. there's no recast time to wait for .. so even on resists, you can just click again without waiting.

<br />
Seems to me is that their goal is to make it impossible now for anyone to get even remotely close to having all the focus' required of them.  Just like added extension to HP only spells (Discordant Guard), haste spells (Discordant Speed), 2 one needed to have range focus (Discordant Range and Discordant Distance), a focus to increase mana regen spells (Discordant Clarity), and even one to increase the lenght of mezz (Discordant Thoughts).. not to mention what was already mentioned of Discordant Time (lengthens slow casts).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Looking at the necro weapon they might also try to saddle shaman with bane on the weapon... Horror is the necro equivalent of bane so that would not surprise me as well (though it would disappoint me) All in all I have yet to see a weapon from GoD that would make me want to bag my TA. Also, I, like Gloriana, am stuck with a time BP until further notice as it and the hammer of hours are the only items with the best detrimental spell focus on them. The focus on the GoD BP is laughable at best. <br />
<br />
Seriously makes me wonder what they were thinking going from a BP with a focus to extend all detrimental spells to a focus for slows only... If nihli is actually running the full duration typically we have had more than enough time to get a turgurs on over it :o All I will say is if we are forced to get all these many focuses for each and every god damn type of spell they better damn well extend them to work to level 70 or I am really gonna go nuts. <br />
<br />
Though a horrible thought just occured to me... Maybe they only plan to extend GoD effects to level 70 and the trend for level 66-70 spells is to not have such broad reaching focuses... which IMO is evil and shows just how poorly they planned older focus effects.</div></div><hr />

Sure it does, for one we don't do Time anymore.  And even if we did, you actually have to be able to zone in to loot something.  When you have 5 Time capable guilds on a server, having your instance allow you to zone into someone elses can be an issue.   You can't clear Time one night and zone into someone elses the next night.  Nor would someone be able to zone in to ours then be able to make their raid the next night. <br />
<br />
Oh, and you also assume that the other guild would go for it, which for some guilds won't happen.</div></div><hr />

What's beautiful about it is this:<br />

<br />
Sure ya can.  you just need to understand how instances set.   wait till after tier1 is cleared.  and your in tier2+  then just add the person.<br />
<br />
The only real trick to it is making sure the guest is smart enough to not join thier normal guild until AFTER tier1 is beat again and the guild is in tier2+<br />
<br />
otherwise they'd taint the whole instance.   We have the guild who clears time1 day on Tuesday trading with the time1 dayer on Friday and no one has cleared thier instance in 3-4 days.<br />
<br />
tier1 sets the instance.  trading after tier1 over, is okay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
None of them are instant recast spells, so if they were to put Nihil on it, they'd give it a large recast.  Recast-Timer clickies are the new wave, and the best shaman clicky in the game is in a zone that is about to become a ghost town.<br />
<br />
I just hope that in OOW they give SOME type of TA replacement, hopefully on the epic 2.0.</div></div><hr />
