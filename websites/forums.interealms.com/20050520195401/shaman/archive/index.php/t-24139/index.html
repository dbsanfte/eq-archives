<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taladorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I originaly posted this in another thread but after some consideration this an important question that needs to be seen.<br />
<br />
Post on EQLive from an SoE developer:<br />
<br />
&quot;The slow mitigation on all NPCs was corrected a few nights ago. Most NPCs from Causeway and beyond are supposed to mitigate slow, however, as was indicated by the original poster, the slow mitigation settings weren't occuring after the last full live patch.<br />
 <br />
So yes, all NPCs in Omens partially mitigate slow, this is intended.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Here's a question for ya.  Since all mobs are mitigating slow and our healing ability is scaled off of clerics healing based on slow.  Shouldn't that mean that our heal spells in OoW should scale up towards clerics as much as the mitigation level?  <br />
<br />
Why are our OoW heal spells still the same % they were in the past now that all npc mitigate slow?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This subject is well worth as many threads as we see fit to post after all slow seems to be are core ability around which all else is based.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has become painfully evident over the last two expansions that shaman are not meant to be a reliable and consistant main healer.  That is why our heals do not scale accordingly.<br />
<br />
Sucks, yes, but as this change to OoW shows, it's obvious.  Mitigation across the board.</div></div><hr />
