This is but the tip of the iceberg.  I now wouldn't be a bit surprised if the PC police grab onto this and run with it through our media.  Further empowering our enemies in their ability to affect our lives.</div></div><hr />

Peter Jackson and NewLine Cinema didn't name this film...  Tolkein did.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llegolas</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote from the petition:<br />
&quot;I too am appalled, not only at the eerie significance of the title of the movie in question, but at its euphemistic nature. Clearly, Mr. Tolkein was a closet homosexual and deserves his lawn chair next to the Lake of Fire, where he and Mr. Jackson will be sipping bloody Marys forever in the hereafter. New Line cinema (whose name is obviously an allusion to sinful drug abuse!) should be ashamed of themselves. The Lake of Fire for all of them! God bless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr Jackson you should be ****ing ashamed. I am so disgusted by this blatant disrespect to those who died. In fact I'm so disgusted I refuse even to use the numbers before and after 10. Face it people, you're all being ****ing childish about this. Tolkien didnt write the book so thet people could get offended over half a century later. Its people like you who are disrespecting those who died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the bigger picture is that Tolken is actually behind the 9/11 attacks. The entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy is actually an Islamic Extremist Terrorist training manual. WAKE UP AMERICA! The third book in the series, The Return Of The King, instructs Muslims to combine all their countries together and install Osama bin Laden as King. Tolken is controlling all this from his grave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An outrage... I'm proud enough to admit I never went to a literature class in my life and I agree. Rename the film to &quot;Hobbits in Suicide Plane Crash on Elven Dwelling&quot; that would be better. Personally I can't look at a pair of pants without thinking of august the 11th&quot;<br />
<br />
Blah hahahaha!</div></div><hr />

1258. Treacle I'm so offended I could ****. I mean, Saruman is an anagram of Ram Anus, which clearly incites unhealthy practices involving livestock. And furthermore, Peter Jackson is an anagram of Sneak Project, symbolising that the whole trilogy is merely a front for the Evil Empire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.petitiononline.com/trutower/<br />
<br />
contents:<br />
There is currently a campaign and petition being passed around, demanding that New Line Cinema rename the upcoming film 'The Two Towers' because the title &quot;is clearly meant to refer to the attacks on the World Trade Center.&quot; <br />
<br />
That petition ignores the fact that the book of the same name was published by J.R.R. Tolkien in 1954, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the tragic events of September 11th. <br />
<br />
In light of the fact that the aforementioned petition is utterly misguided, and misguides others by way of an under-researched frenzy of political correctness masking factual fallacy, we the undersigned ask New Line Cinema to ignore the aforementioned petition being hosted at http://petitions.org/twotower .</div></div><hr />

I particularly liked this comment:<br />
Joey Michaels I think a good alternate title would be &quot;Saruman's Axis of Evil&quot; <br />
<br />
And that's and entry they DIDN'T void out.<br />
<br />
And this:<br />
Could you please start a petition to stop those fascist police from using 911 as their phone number too? That is also something that bothers me<br />
<br />
And:<br />
Yes! Stop the film! Maybe then I can have my precious back...</div></div><hr />

I brought them to read while visiting my grandparents parents for Christmas and when my mom saw me reading &quot;The Two Towers&quot; she asked me &quot;They have a book about september 11 out already?&quot;<br />
<br />
On another note:  It amuses me the number of people supporting the movie's title based on the fact that the movies were made before the attack.  Do allthese people really not know anything about Tolkien?</div></div><hr />

Read some of the sig's.  Every one I read was outrage over the stupidity of the petition.  Admittedly, I only read about 20 randomly, but I figured that if the 21st was in support of it, that's still only 5% lunatics to 95% sane.  That's probably a better ratio then one would expect these days hehe.</div></div><hr />
