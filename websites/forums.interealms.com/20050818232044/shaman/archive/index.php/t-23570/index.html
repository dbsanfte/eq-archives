Any truth to this??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">#$$!$# and I have 24 AA's banked for this.<br />

How fast is Lucy usually updated?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Question is, is it removed for good from all, or only from shamans? I can't check it myself on beta server, because those dang things go down every time I log on them! A conspiracy, I swear! Every time I got on so far, I saw the message &quot;Servers going down in 5 minutes, please log out&quot;...</div></div><hr />

No.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">and even if, its nothing the majority of the shaman asked for. sure, it definitely can come in handy, but all in all its nothing more than a bone from sony that might even be thought of making the communication between clerics and shaman worse than it is already -&gt; better if 2 sides tear themselfs up than both argue with/against sony (yeah yeah, i know, conspiracy theory, hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">lol, no truth to it, yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Basic question, how do you filter Lucy to show aa's?  I only get regular spells when I look at the shaman lists.<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />

only the damage component, it can double, but the mana stays the same.</div></div><hr />

Please tell me that's a joke.<br />
<br />
What that says to me is that shaman will now be punished for having crit nuke aas.  So randomly, the AA might say &quot;ha ha&quot; and take you to blood aggro.<br />

<br />
wonderful.......</div></div><hr />

Now raids can just log in one of the many bot Shaman to do the rezz and leave the Clerics in to heal.</div></div><hr />

Last I saw its a lv 70 AA</div></div><hr />

<br />
When is the NDA over?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's not a rez people.. it's a summon body.  It won't give you an exp and when it's used, that people can still get a regular rez for exp.  It's only available at level 70 but has a really low recast timer.<br />
<br />
oh. yeah.. I think that happened was that they refunded alot of AAs for everyone, and Call of the Wild was one of them.  It's still there don't worry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think we all knew that it is not a rez. BTW it summons you to your corpse, not summon body.<br />
<br />
I think the last few post all know of it's use and usefullness but being a lvl 70 aa is stupid imho!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Originally I thought level 70 was fine, that it should be hard to get.  But the more I think about it, the more it should be something that is available to the lower shaman/druid community as well.  Level 50+ would be very reasonable.  They want people to group in dungeons and go exploring.  Giving a level 50+ shaman/druid this rez allows groups to actually go places without worrying about &quot;what if the cleric dies&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think we all knew that it is not a rez. BTW it summons you to your corpse, not summon body.<br />
<br />
It all depends on your perspective at the time Niwggib, technically you and Val are both correct.  If you are standing at a corpse it summons a live body. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">yeah, that's why i refer to it as a body summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Seems kinda funny to make the spirit summon aa lvl 70 when it seems the need for it cropped up more from Gates content. That content thats currently being done by lvl 65's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Like it will take more than a week to level from 65 to 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I plan on leveling to 66 on my first kill.<br />
<br />
I would love to have this aa but I will survive if I don't get it. Actually I haven't played in several days. I'm getting so totally bored with EQ now. I'm hoping OoW can bring back my interest...if not I'll be leaving.</div></div><hr />

This could have rocked for an AA but having to be lvl 70 and 9 AA's is crazy. This is perfect for lower levels... as is the melee gate spell but alas that is also 66+.... SoE for yah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">LOL youi people actually think the level req and AA cost of this ability has anything to do with its usefulness? HELL NO!! Its set at lvl 70 and 9 AA because SOE wants us to PLAY. <br />
<br />
There are some things that are done in this game for completely non-game reasons, and I think this is one. Doesnt matter how much I WANT it lower level and lower cost, you can bet your bippy I will have 9 AA banked the day I ding 70 and will grab this AA ASAP.</div></div><hr />
