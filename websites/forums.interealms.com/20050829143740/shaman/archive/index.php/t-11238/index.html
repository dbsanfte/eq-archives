<br />
http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_spells.jsp<br />
<br />
<br />
and it looks like shamans are getting stoicism, which is going to be a huge boon for all the younger shamans</div></div><hr />

What's the difference between Pure Blood (51) and Disinfecting Aura(52)? <br />
<br />
Disinfecting Aura (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2526) <br />
<br />
Pure Blood (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3693&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
Very, very little.<br />
<br />
Was wondering about the druid version, what's the difference between Healing water, lvl 44, 200 mana, 425 points healed, and <br />
Chloroblast (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1290&amp;source=Live).<br />
<br />
Apparently, originality is in short supply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/sigh , so much for killing clerics and druids with our pos/ dis dots. <br />
<br />
<br />
thats gonna hurt the PvP shammys BAD. i feel for ya bruddas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Please tell me more spells are still to come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the big difference:  Pure Blood can be cast by clerics and druids, Disinfecting Aura can't.  So, for this spell, shamans get SQUAT, while clerics and druids get something new.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, SOE, but I'm not interested in your new content.  I cancelled my pre-order for LoY, and I won't be ordering it for certain now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a difference, by 3.5 cast time, 2.5 cast time is nice. Also 2 less counters, but I will use pure blood and move Disinfecting Aura to the back of my book for the cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya, now I get to use my awesome DD's to outnuke a druid with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Looks like they're making Disenfecting Aura a slightly more potent version of Abolish Disease now?  Lucy shows that on test atm it's removing 48 disease counters.... /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Santero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Disinfecting Aura (http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2003-02-22%2022:53:34) <br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Uh, seriously  - WHY?<br />
<br />
Of those pop encounters i know, the max disease counters added are 36... Abolish will do here...<br />
<br />
And there might be som at 99 - but whats the point of this spell anyways, still need 3 casts as abolish...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">thoroughly disappointed in this crap.  really getting very tired of the lousy spell selection that they have offered shaman since luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zenohs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
*** not like i can land any poison dots in pvp anyway since i'm only 55(pre malo), but if i actually do land one, this new spell takes care of that.  i actually worked out a pvp combat strat using insidious decay and plauge/scourge despite its 2+ minute duration... guess that one just got hosed too.. woohoo now i can stand there and try to nuke, am i a shaman or a wizard now verant?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">And still no Root Kiter or Root Trainer spells...*sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sigh :(<br />
<br />
Unoeye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They changed disinfecting aura on test now it has -24 dis and -24 poison counters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Soulstorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">All you PVP shaman are acting like they should have considered what effect the release of &quot;pure blood&quot; would have on PVP balance. <br />
<br />
Hah! Since when have they considered ANY change from a PVP perspective right off the bat? Manaburn... Charmburn... etc. The game has never been and will never be designed for balanced, satisfying and rewarding PVP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Varyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When I saw that they weren't releasing the spell info until the day before the expansion I thought maybe it was because they were doing some really cool stuff and it would take a long time to balance.  Instead it appears that they knew they weren't doing jack squat, and wanted people to imagine something better than what they were actually getting in order to increase pre-orders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They changed disinfecting aura on test now it has -24 dis and -24 poison counters. <br />
<br />
Incorrect. It is 48 Disease, no Poison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Doh misread it <br />
<br />
guess we got a new abolish disease but that removes more counters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Soulstorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Caterpillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Glad a made a ranger!  It's bad enough that our dots were hard to stick...now with this ghey cure it wont matter if we stick or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;hey verant! /rude!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Incorrect. It is 48 Disease, no Poison. <br />
<br />
And it's absolutly USELESS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Man I misread it too.  I thought we were only getting slightly jipped by them increasing the number of counters it removed.  But no now we need to get a new spell to get back our old functionality.<br />
<br />
Bad move vi.  Hope you change this before servers come up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Salamonda Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">What if Pure Blood is vendor purchasable, and is NODROP?<br />
<br />
Non-Ykesha shaman just lost a very handy spell at the expense of not playing the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Anyone found a vendor selling them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">they changed disenfecting to remove 48 disease counters, we do get a new spell...just one with the same name but diff effect now basically</div></div><hr />
