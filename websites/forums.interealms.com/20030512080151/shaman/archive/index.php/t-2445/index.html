<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to try and verify something for my epic.  I've been reading recently on a variety of issues with having too little or too much faction regarding the Spear of Fate.<br />
<br />
I'm to the point in my quest that I have just received the books from Ghiosk, and would rather not have them poof on me on turn-in, so I would like to verify some information.  I have read that if you have too MUCH faction that things can work improperly or not at all.  At one point I had complete the Rathe Mtns NPC turn-in twice because I had mistakenly believed that the shield was given out directly.   After completing this step the second time I had discovered that you merely needed to use the proper phrase.  The end result is that I have more faction that I normally would have.  I have not skipped any other steps nor have I completed any of the other steps more than once.  Do any of you think that my turn-ins will be at risk because of the repeating of this one step?  I tried to talk to a guide about checking faction, but they wouldn't do it.  Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least Ghiosk is a regular spawn who always drops the items you need, if you had to redo the reports stage, that would suck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cammere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">RE: Faction. I have 'too much faction' for the Epic and recently handed in the Ghriosk books to Spirit Sentinal in EJ only to be told that he didnt have a use for them and I can have them back?<br />
<br />
Maybe the faction trick has been nerfed?<br />
<br />
Asking a GM resulted in the usual 'no idea' response.<br />
<br />
Any comments?<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading. Camm</div></div><hr />

<br />
I too may have too much faction I did the woe/envy quest twice too and I think I have more faction. I have done everything else the 6 com reports and the 3 books and gotten faction for both.<br />
<br />
I have to complete the mob in The Hole and 2 mobs in CoM till my epic. Now my question is when do you need to be ally ?? At the last mob who drops the Iksar scale? Do I need to con him and be ally for it to drop the scale?? <br />
<br />
Im kind of worried I may have too much faction and done the quest's twice..</div></div><hr />
