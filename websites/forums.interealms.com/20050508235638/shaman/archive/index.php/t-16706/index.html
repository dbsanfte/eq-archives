<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sony has announced that until sunday they are bringing back items that are no longer in the game.<br />
<br />
Just curious from the guys who have been around for a while, what items do you miss that no longer drop in the game.<br />
<br />
Personally I would love a mistwalker for my ranger</div></div><hr />

Bringing back how? Dropping from same mobs or just dropping from GM events?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">they didn't say how but logged on today and they had a very interesting message about it.<br />
<br />
Something to the effect were all going to be RICH!<br />
<br />
Sony has lost it lol</div></div><hr />

Could Sony possibly be more vague?</div></div><hr />

Used to be that anyone I saw using it had either been around for a really long time (or had bought a character that was really old :D ).  Now with GMs handing them out....feh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seeing as how I missed out on getting one on prexus years ago by like a day or two I think I wouldn't mind getting one now.  I don't see why they changed in in the first place.  Making the game more fun for all classes and not just 3 (chanters, rogues, bards) is a good thing.  (No, I don't think potions count)</div></div><hr />
