<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naomiy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering if anyone knows how to calculate attack. The only piece I can figure out is 1 for 1 strength. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All I know is, offense and weapon skill have a larger effect on the atk rating than str does . . . but I do not know the exact correlation between them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kansan Cloudkicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The things that go into are:<br />
<br />
Base offense : every time you level up your offense goes up 5 until it reaches 252, each increase in offense increase yields 1-3 atk.<br />
<br />
Weapon skills : same deal, as you increase in that weapon skill, yout atk increases 1-3, and as long as you are weilding that weapon, you will have that atk.  the atk is not dependant on the stats of the weapon.  so a rusty dagger will give you the same atk as a Lurid Dagger. <br />
<br />
Strength : For every 10 strength you get, you get 9 atk, so you want to be maxxed out at 255 at all times, a strentgh greater than 255 will do you no good.  <br />
<br />
Atk buffs : cll of the pred, SON, FON, WP are some rangers atk buffs.  VOG, Avatar are some other ones.  Aura of battle items, right click grim aura will also give you atk.  <br />
<br />
Bascially i believe that atk is one of the most important stats.  i get mine up to 1450 now, and do much more damage than any other melee besides a rogue.  Atk &gt; all</div></div><hr />
