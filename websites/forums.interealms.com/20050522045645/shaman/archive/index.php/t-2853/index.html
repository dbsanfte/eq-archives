<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeydin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do you find the exp penalty to be a real pain, or do you not even notice since you have less downtime?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To be honest, I don't even think about it.  I duo mostly with another iksar monk that is about my same level, so we gain xp at the same rate.  I don't constantly check my xp bar after every kill, and I don't pay that much attention to it unless I'm about to level into new spells.  So my response would be to play what race you think is fun, (if that's your question) and not worry about the xp penalty.  <br />
<br />
The only time I do think about the xp penalty is in deciding where to hunt.  I try to find xp bonus zones to offset it, so some of my friends that arent lucky enough to be iksar won't get too far ahead of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't see it but that's because it's my only charecter as a Troll.  If I could do it again though I'd go Ogre 6 days a week and twice on Sunday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Whether the exp penalty is justified by 'less' downtime depends on your equipment and if you group or not.<br />
<br />
A barbarian shaman soloing with JBB and fungi is going to have pretty much the same downtime as a troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This has been my only real char, ever, and once I hit 55-59 I liked to bitch about it alot, because alot of the other barb shammys I know seemed to rocket to 60. Yes, its painfully painfully slow, 1 blue an hour duo was generally a rocking duo group, paired with same level iksar monk. But now that im 60 and torpor'd its alllllll good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've never really noticed the penalty myself...probably because my two highest characters are both Iksar and my next in line is a Troll. I would probably notice it more if I played any characters other than Ikky or Troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&gt;&gt;A barbarian shaman soloing with JBB and fungi is going to have pretty much the same downtime as a troll.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Troll/iksar regen isnt that good. A barbarian with JBB and fungi tunic would have much less downtime than an ordinary troll or iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I never think about it. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Never noticed the penalty - until hunting in a &quot;pinkie&quot; city.  The absence of the penalty is like a 25% ZEM, since I get 100% of exp instead of 80%.<br />
elsewhere?  I love regenning hp fast - I kill more.  And I hear chars of all races and classes moan about leveling slow.  <br />
<br />
What's your plan?  zoom to 60?  avoid the racial penalty.  any other plan, don't worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I never really think about it.  With the right gear and at the right hunting grounds, xp flows nicely.  <br />
<br />
Widda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No notice at all.<br />
Hell levels seem longer and all that crap, but that's just cause I am whiney.<br />
<br />
Seriously, it is basically negligible.  Trolls are the coolest, I'd take em even without the regen.<br />
<br />
After a certain point, exp comes pretty easy soloing, I know for a fact that some crackhead with a JBB could easilly get from 24 to 56 in like a week or less, regardless of level.<br />
<br />
Mistmore to 50, HK to 56-57.<br />
<br />
Who doesn't love Sploitmore Castle, honestly?<br />
Your faction with Mayong Sploitmore could not possibly get any worse.</div></div><hr />

Color me obtuse I have no clue what you're talking about.<br />

My only time in MM is to fix faction OR whack the Dire for some poor Shaman who can't get help.<br />

Please explain or send a sneaky-pete message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I didn't really pay attention until my mid 50s.  Of course, I also met some of my best friends in EQ at that time and they'd regularly comment on how much xp they had gained after a night of chewing through the sarnaks in Chardok.  When everyone else in the group (Barb, High Elves, and the like) started commenting on their xp gains for the night it became really obvious how much slower I was moving through the levels heh.    <br />
<br />
BarbWar tells the group, &quot;Nice.  Made a full yellow tonight! =0&quot;<br />
HieEnc tells the group, &quot;cool, pretty much same here.&quot;<br />
You tell the group, &quot;=/  little lil under 4 blue here...  Bastards. =P&quot;<br />
rest of group snickers and makes 'witty' jokes. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I play two comps and on my other comp was a half elf ranger. Very obvious that my troll shaman had an exp penalty. Got even worse in the mid 50s. I think 54 and 59 is the only hell levels and although my shaman hasnt gotten beyond 57 yet, my ranger and rogue have. I would bet money that any other race moves through at least 54 (and probably 59) faster than my shaman moves through 55, 56, 57 or 58. When you can see your trolls exp bar as well as an exp bar for a halfling rogue at the same time, it's just bright as day that the troll is slagging far behind in exp per kill, but I also can't imagine playing any other race for my shaman, trolls rock :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Anithar AnachroniX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't think of the 'exp penalty' as a bad thing. You can look at it this way...<br />
<br />
Most likely you will have 20% more playing experience than barb sham's your lvl. :)<br />
<br />
When it comes to the game, take the journey that bests suits your interest. Don't let ONE thing determine the reason why you DON'T play that race.<br />
<br />
Being Iksar myself, and going through the game the first time I really don't notice it at all. I look at it that while it might take me a bit longer to get to a lvl, I'm at least playing the race I like the most, and not following the 'crowd' or popular choice, which seems to be barb. :)<br />
<br />
So pic which one YOU like, no matter what penalties or items you won't get to wear, in the end you'll stay with your char cuz it's what YOU like. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Notice... yes, it's pretty obvious each time you group with others when they start talking about how much they get etc... but it only bothered me once (towards the end of level 59), and I'd take troll as main shaman over again anyday. <br />
<br />
Trolls are cool - of course they must balance all that coolness someway, or we'd only have trolls in Norrath ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yzzy be me only experience so hav nuttin ta compare it to (udda dan PLed twinks).  Absolute best exp me's got tho has been one blu per hour since 54th if dat any measure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Iksar are superior. Simple fact. Expect to work harder to meet that higher standard.<br />
<br />
/ooc<br />
<br />
Yeah, it can be a bit of a pain..but like my monk's faction work it's something I'm proud of. I know I have more put into Jhar than generic shammy x who played an easier race like barbie girls or kitties and got to level 50 in 3 days played.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think the key thing about the exp penalty is that one notices it only by comparison. I used to group with an Iksar monk all the time and ( by definition ) I didn't notice it, so I didn't think about it. If I grouped with a human or a halfling all the time, I would probably be really frustrated because they were a few levels ahead. The only think I didn't like about Iksar was the armor restrictions. Not only no Jaundiced, but I can't wear the IGS either. Grr. Otherwise, we rock as a race. With regen 3 aa skill , bear form, fungi, regrowth and iksar, I regenerate 50 pts a tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The only time I noticed the exp penalty was in level 52.  That level was a pain in the tail!  I'm already a yellow into 53, and that took just a couple hours hunting in Fungus Grove. <br />
<br />
But yes, I have noticed the difference and no I would not change my race (Iksar) if I could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kealios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Widda is a liar and an ugly troll!!!  (j/k!)<br />
<br />
I have a 52 Iksar shaman on Rodcet Nife, and regret making an iksar nearly every day.  Yea, I notice the xp penalty daily (I lay 8 alts, so I can tell...) but I also lose out on certain eq:<br />
<br />
JBB and the quested Darkness neck piece.  I'd go Troll in a second, so I could be ugly like Widda...the only piece I'd lose is is Hate Iksar-only BP, but I'd find a replacement easily.  The xp penalty kinda sucks, but I'd gladly take it to be worth more--trollllllll baby!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Bah, people get obsessed about certain items they think they can't live without. I'm a CT following Troll (no snare necklace for me) without enough cash to buy a JBB. But I still have fun, and I don't get worked up about items I can't use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The penalty does sting, but it's worth it in the end ... so far. Maybe after I get Canni 5 and don't care as much about a smaller stream of HP I can covert into mana verses a major chunk I'll wish I had not suffered so, but Canni 5 is still off a ways. <br />
<br />
Then again, I would hate to meet the person who would start a character based on what they could do at level 60 with 23 AA points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Was it a pain? Nope, never noticed it really to be honest. I don't know about the &quot;less downtime&quot; part because I never played a Shaman that didn't have innate regen.<br />
<br />
I do see it now, though, that I'm not playing either race. I have a DE Rogue that has become my main. I duo her with a Troll Warrior exclusively and the XP difference is noticable. However, that doesn't mean that I wouldn't play a Troll or Iksar Shaman in the future, it just isn't that huge of a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">As an iksar, I will say the armor restrictions are more of a pain than the xp penalty.<br />
<br />
The lack of toys to help me out aren't that big a deal, since my SKILL covers whatever they leave me without.<br />
<br />
If I had to remake my character, I might go troll instead of iksar, but that would only be so I could experience a new newbie area.</div></div><hr />
