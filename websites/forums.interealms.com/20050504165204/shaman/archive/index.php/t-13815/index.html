<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">welp i posted awhile back about it.. and now my little dorf cleric is 40..<br />
<br />
problem is most of that PLing was doen by a 65 druid and 65 chanter pullen trains in sol a killen 15 20 gnoems at a time :)<br />
<br />
but both the druid and chanter log at night ushally when my play session starts.  so my question is how can a shaman effectively pl a cleric?   my first guess was just get him to 41 (my sham being 62) and group em with my sham.. but is there any better way to do it?<br />
<br />
fyiw all his skills are maxed.. we casted spells non stop trying keep them up since useign DS to kill for the most part.. and his melee skills are maxed lol<br />
<br />
anyone advice would be really appreciated. as i would lvoe get em up so he can become useful. once 46 i plannend take him to CoD and just group em with everyone. or solo if later at night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you get atone at 39? What I did  was pulled big mobs, beat them down, and had the cleric atone them, then get the kill, or pull mob, dot to all hell and zone just before death. Both work really well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hullk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I leveled up my cleric faster than I thought was possible.  Here's how I did it.  It involved using a descent damage/delay weapon (Got a sarnak devastator for 3k in the bazaar - 12/20 5 str 5 sta 25 mana, effect: holy might, procs at level 1), and Clarity 3 or above.<br />
<br />
Level 30-40ish - Undead in Kasorea.  Find a nice pull spot (I usually worked my way to the Xalgoz area).  Have the cleric start meleeing, and chain nuke with your undead DD.  At the same time have your shaman chain cast with your JBB (if you have one).  If not, throw on an ice nuke.<br />
<br />
The mobs there don't have that much hitpoints (1kish), so your 2 cleric nukes, and 2 JBB blasts should kill it, with the cleric doing slightly more damage.<br />
<br />
Level 40-50ish - Undead in City of Mist.  The zone in area should be dark blue until 45 or 46, so use the same strategy as above.  After 46 you'll want to head over to the castle area before the locked doors and the black reavers.  The undead there are higher level, and should be dark blue up to 53ish, but the exp slows down.<br />
<br />
After level 50, I just started grouping him with my shaman and my brother's warrior and druid.  We usually hunt for exp in Crypt of Decay, and the exp flies.<br />
<br />
Only took me a week or so to get him up to level 50.  May not be the fastest method, but it does work.  Hope that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks thats a good idea.. cleric does have a decent fast wep soemthing liek 12/20 8 wis (rock studded smasher i think)  but he also has a little slower (somethign liek 12/35)  but it procs a 580 nuke.. dawnfire, of the morning light (something like that)  simi rare drop from fear.  procs ushally once a fight or so.<br />
<br />
i go try that out tonight in CoM. (when i pl i allways make sure cleric has a aego c3 full sham buffs ushally bmb)   to bad DS potions are so danm expensive :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just recently took my cleric from 40 to 43 at the giant camp in FV. I got her a KEI and i gave her my shaman buffs. I broke the 3 giant camp by pulling with a slow and rooting it. Then I let my cleric beat on it and nuke. I let her borrow my Soulstripper (with a 75 hp lifetap proc) for the job. When she got the giant below 50% I nuked the giant down. Took me about 6 hours ?? total. When her KEI ran out she was still doing ok since her 1HB skill was up pretty well she didn't need to rely on nukes too much. There are probably faster ways to do this but it worked for me plus I made about 3k on all the vendor loot from the camp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
group them with your cleric, and power the melee with traditional methods, cleric adds heals, buffs. send in pet when mob is not going to be ks'd.</div></div><hr />
