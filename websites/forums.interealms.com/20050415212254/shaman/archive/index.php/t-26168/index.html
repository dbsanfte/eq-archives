<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lestumpette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To me this is an interesting question since I think the constraints forced on a person while leading a raid as guild leader might have a significant impact on their ability to play a character to the limit.  While it is difficult to argue which is the easiest class to manage under raid conditions, I am certain it isn’t a shaman :).  I’m aware that leading a guild and leading a raid are often not accomplished by the same person, but I am also aware that many guild leaders DO lead their own guild raids and this is the situation I am curious about.<br />
<br />
The only character I ever play is a shaman and from my experience with this class, leading a raid would be a serious challenge to my ability to perform at my best.  Although I haven’t seen many shaman fill the dual role of guild/raid leader, I’m sure there are more than a few players out there that do it.  I would love to be corrected on this, but it seems to me that we shaman are in a minority in this area of the game.<br />
<br />
I’ve known warriors and clerics that filled this role very successfully, while still maintaining their character functions perfectly, and it would be naïve and disrespectful of me to suggest some classes couldn’t rise to the challenge.  However, when a guild is at the forefront of the game doing the really really difficult content, are all classes equal in this capacity ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been an officer in both guilds I've ever been in. I lead raids when needed which has been much more frequent rescently. On top of that my guild doesn't seem to have much luck keeping active shaman so half the time I'm the only shaman on the raid. Just to keep myself from getting bored I bot a bard too =)<br />
<br />
Honestly anyone can lead a raid. It's not the class they play it's the person behind the keyboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's really really obvious when our Bard officer gets busy with guild business, because it's somehow always HoS/A:CoC that gets pushed off the &quot;to do&quot; list.<br />
<br />
More on-topic, I've led a lot of raids.  I find plenty of time to &quot;/t [puller] pull more slackass&quot; while Malos is casting, so it's not a problem really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find that any class other than a warrior/offtank should be able to lead a raid effectively. I remember having 3 warrior officers in my guild, and it was a mess when adds came in because they would be busy typing.<br />
<br />
For example, in Uqua, sometimes the pullers pull one more mob. If you had 4 warriors and one was the raid leader just explaining something to your guild, 3 mobs get picked up and the fourth gets loose. It's not the 4th warrior's fault. Sometimes bad pull happen, but that's why you have lots of warriors (and offtanks). One loose mob there could be catastrophic to your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When assists were superimportant in Vex Thal, we always used something useless like a wizard or druid (hi Mordlu! :eek:) to keep an eye over the whole battle and have the right guy in his target.  Whole different job from Raid Leader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On my Monk, when I am the raid puller, I really, really do not want to be the one responsible for keeping the raid in shape, moving people between groups, handling tells and so on.<br />
<br />
On the Shaman, well, I supposed it would be doable, but really, isn't that what DPS classes are for? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMO Rogue is the best, simply because they can almost always watch the pull as it happens, look at the mob positioning, the pathing back, just in general be more informed when creating the strat. <br />
<br />
If you're a shaman and leading the raid, it can get ugly lots of tells etc you can't do your job that well and you can't not do it because people need jobs, mobs need slow.<br />
<br />
A rogue otoh, can just not attack, it's not going to make or break non-named type situations (unlike  unslowed mobs or unbuffed main tanks with hard hitting mobs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would say an SK......utility, DPS, survivability and FD when things get out of hand.<br />
<br />
I don't think the raid leader not surviving a raid is a bad thing, I just think that he should be able to view the events that go on through-out the raid. not simply mistakes on the pulls, but being sure all the classes are doing their jobs and watching for fatal mistakes that continue through a wipe that could have been saved.<br />
<br />
i.e. a warrior doesn't have aggro just as mob gets to him, and a wizzie doesn't duck off a pre-emptive nuke, mob charges wizzy and the warrior snags aggro just as a heal lands on the near-dead wizzy, causing the mob to charge at a cleric, etc, etc, etc. there are several points in the small quick scenario that could have stopped the mob from getting to the cleric. an attentive leader playing an FD class could watch these events and call for certain things the raid needs to do, without being next on the mobs to do list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, I tend to disagree.  I play a shaman, and I run the majority of our guild raids.  Fact is, people shouldn't be dying all that often.  Every death is a screw-up, and slows the raid down.  Splits need to split FAST.  All mobs incoming, whether 1 or 10 of them need to be grabbed by the tanking crews (war/pal/sk) with non-damage generating agro, except for the MT.  The bards and enchanters can lock em down fast while the shaman slow.<br />
<br />
On main mobs, let's face it.  With the new exception of panther, we do **** for damage.  (Very few exceptions, but there are some.)  DoTs are such huge agro, that you probably shouldn't be using em much on raid level mobs.  95% of my mana during fights on raids goes to heals/cures/buffs.<br />
<br />
Given that scenario, by the time I die, our raid is already fubar.  I also have a back-up raid leader that can pick up when I eat it if he's still alive (druid).<br />
<br />
There is no reason shaman can't run raids effectively.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I used to run dots on VT named, just cause those robed bastards are such suck dps that taking agro was fun :)  I remember evaluating the ranks of Weapon Affinity for a friend based on what dots I could run against him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wondered if you were still around Chutoi, nice to see ya poke your head out :)<br />
<br />
  And yeah, I agree that almost anyone can lead a raid, it just depends on the person behind the controls and how well they organize, delegate and prioritize.<br />
<br />
  However, using a rogue for the SoS scouting etc... definately sounds nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jindaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have to agree with Chutoi - I always found my shaman to be the perfect raid leader.  Having lead over 220 raids in the last year and a half, I found that as a shaman I could focus on a specific task (slowing. Malo, ...), assign other functions, and keep an good overall eye on the raid.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>decius1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In my experience, being a rogue has been a godsend. There's nothing like seeing a new place yourself to plan positioning etc. There's nothing like being able to look ahead and spot potential problems early. And when you're actually fighting and you're having to type some quick orders, missing a round isn't going to cause any problems. For tricky encounters where you need to see exactly what's going on, you can become a fly on the wall and just stand back and observe without agroing monsters, getting run over by the pull etc. Finally, your survivability on wipes is high, meaning you can get things reorganised pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
Any class can lead a raid, but being a rogue does help I think =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Any 'busy' class is going to be tough to be raid leader with, if there aren't enough of them.  A class like bard, enchanter, shaman, etc would be difficult in small raids where there are maybe 1-2 of your class.  Continually halting the raids to handle rebuff tells because you're the only shaman sucks horribly.  If you have all the bases covered, then raid leader class simply does not matter.<br />
In a smaller raid though, you might be less frazzled if you have a class you can play that has limited responsibilities in-fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>lestumpette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think when I pondered this thread I thought much the same as jdthomas did, it’s the ‘busy’ classes that are going to have a harder time leading raids.  Prior to posting this question it had never occurred to me that a rogue would be suitable, and now I’m glad I did because it’s a bit of a revelation to me  :).  However, regardless of class, Caanus said it best “organize, delegate and prioritize”.  It makes sense that he/she that masters this, really masters the raid.<br />
<br />
I’ve heard it said so many times, it might start out OK, but as time passes being a guild officer isn’t usually fun, and this is probably true of a full-time raid leader.<br />
<br />
Most people are into EQ to have fun.  Some of us find that fun by micro-managing every last bit of our class (and some might call this anal hehe), while others are more into playing the fundamentals well (i.e. buffing/de-buffing and/or slowing), therefore making extra time to control a raid.  There most certainly are a lot of people that have a great time leading raids; Taraddar, Chutoi and Jindaan sound like they enjoy it.  I am of the opinion that a shaman can find something to do anytime, all the time, if they are so inclined.  Sure plenty of those things will be small things that won’t make a big impact, but hey, we are good at so many things and so much of what we do augments other players, even if only a little.  More so now than ever before with the Leopard/Panther line.<br />
<br />
This latter addition to our spell set looks set to change things for shaman.  A little or a lot, I’m not sure since I’ve yet to experience the spell myself being only level 60.  I think if you were a shaman leading a raid then this spell wouldn’t be getting the attention it requires for maximum effect.  From what I’ve read about Leopard/Panther so far, it can have a massive impact of MOB death rates if properly used.  There may be content as yet unencountered that will require such high DPS to beat.  But that issue is for another thread ….<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Raid leading isn't often done at the times when you're actually IN a fight, which is when you go nuts casting Leopard/Panther.  When high damage killing the named is the issue, leading is pretty much done.  Information, Organization, Strats all have to happen before you engage.  While I've seen a number of quite complicated battles, I haven't seen any that were actually dynamic.  If people know their roles going in, then a leader's job is suspended between &quot;charge&quot; and &quot;send tells for Dragon Giblets of Defense - 2mil dkp&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Rangers are very suitable as raid leads imo, innate camo, allways looking on the raid from the distance easy to manage ppl around during fight while shooting arrows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would say it's not really what &quot;class&quot; can lead, but what person can lead and do their respective duties.  Multi-tasking is a must!<br />
<br />
For my guild raids, it's normally either myself (SK) or the GL (a wizard) leading.   Most of the time it's both.  The rest of the officers do their parts also.  It's really helps that during raids, officers retire to a teamspeak channel all our own.  That way, if one of us gets too busy, someone else can give instructions.  For our functionality, it's actually a given that we work as a team, rather than 1 specific &quot;leader&quot;.<br />
<br />
On any given raid I'm tank/ot leader, co-raid leader, OT, 2boxing my groups cleric (used to box shm, but we have more than plenty of them atm), back up pulls, scouting, tactical info...  And they wonder why I took an EQ vacation last week.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Only times I had any major issue was when I used to get spammed with /tell hell.  That's normally the first thing to slack.  People now know not to send tells during a raid if they need a response, unless it's an emergency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Heya Caanus.  Yep, I'm still around!  Unfortunately, I got banished to Princeton, New Jersey for work for 4 months, so I play on a laptop and I'm putting in 12+ hour days--which doesn't give a lot of time for posting!<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's entirely true that (absent a first run on a mob) about 85% of a raid leader's job is done PRIOR to engaging.  Assign roles, positioning, heal strats, rampage, go over mechanics of fight, etc.  Ideally, in a well run guild, you have class leaders to whom you can delegate.  Usually, I just have to know who's in the raid, relative hp/ac for splits, know which players are best at paying attention, and assign roles accordingly.  Once you know your resources and the fight mechanics, everything is cake.  I'll give a quick recap of the fight, tell everyone what's needed, and assign resources in a general way.  I'll ask the warrior CL for a MT/RT list, say I need 2 druids on rampage heal, 3 paladins on cure duty, etc.  Tell your clerics whether you need a CH chain, or a specific spam heal tactics, etc.  Work around your AEs--counteract mana drains with bard/cleric groups, or SKs for mana taps, and concentrate your healers into mana generating groups if you can.  High damage AEs, spread your healers, etc.  Most everything is situational.  Got a killer AE?  Then there's probably some trick to the thing you're missing.  Plan.  Plan.  Plan.  Stuns and knockbacks will screw chains.  Spam healing eats mana like nobody's business.  Estimate mob dps and raid dps to determine length of fight to estimate proper healing strats, etc.  That's not really the point of this thread.  Thing is, most of that is done well before you engage.<br />
<br />
Actually during the fight, I'm doing relatively little in active guidance absent some major screw up.  Warn of special attacks or emotes in case people miss them, emergency healing the RT or MT.  Re-arranging healing assignments on the fly for dying/oom healers, timing AEs for dodging them, or just watching for screw-ups, etc.  If I can't do that during a raid and handle my own duties, I don't have any business running raids.  It's just multi-tasking.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it ain't always fun (frequently frustrating in fact), but the better you run your raids, the better attendance you get, the more fun people have, the more they stick out the tough ones, etc.  It's a self-perpetuating cycle.  If, by a bit of effort on my part, I can make it fun for everyone else AND make sure we kick ass, I'll do it willingly.<br />
<br />
I still have jelvan fights though!  Triplets suck!<br />

Haven't seen you in so long, but I've still got that shield on Bane Warding you loaned me when you retired!  Unfortunately, it's on E'Ci now =p</div></div><hr />

I'll say a big phat 'HA!' to retiring hehehe.  I was forced out of EQ by RL back you-know-when, but I still manage to get on every so often and pound a few MOBs on Tunare.  You're on a bard now i see ... hmmmm.  I bet that's got something to do with speed ;)  Hopefully you've seen how good . no wait .. how GREAT the modern shaman is and reinstate Kryscha as your main.<br />
<br />
The BW shield.  It's had such a good home these last couple of years I think it should stay where it is.  I forgot how much fun that quest was until you reminded me.  I ended up doing it 3 or 4 times for various people.<br />
<br />
And on the subject of the thread, Chutoi you clearly know your business when it comes to being a shaman and raid leader at the same time.  Some very good points.<br />
