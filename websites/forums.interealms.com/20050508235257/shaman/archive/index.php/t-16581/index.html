<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doleck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The last two times I was in PoN fighting hob-gobbies. The tank was an SK (different sk's) and both times eventually a wipe occured. Both times I the slower was killed and the rest of the group either died or made it to zone.<br />
<br />
I thought sk's were supposed to be great at taunting and holding argo. Was he doing something wrong, are they overrated, bad luck?? Do they have a choice of a spell argo vs just taunt and melee?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A good SK is a sight to behold. You must of had some bad luck with those two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">MOBs that are immune to snare, like hobgoblins, are a bad choice with a shadow knight tank since their darkness line won't land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You had bad SK's. Normally it is trivial for them to maintain aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually house, even if they are unslowable the spell being resisted creates aggro.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, if SKs just taunt and melee, they aren't going to hold aggro any better (actually worse most times) than a warrior.  They DO however get a few great spell lines to help with aggro management.  They get a direct aggro increaser, similar to the encie line (+x% hate), they get a &quot;dd hate&quot; type line, (quick cast +x00hate to target), and they get their snare line.  They have other tools, but these are the ones I've seen work the most effectively.  A good sk holds aggro very, very well...just like a good pally.  Heck, they hold it almost as well as a shaman determined to get aggro ;)<br />

<br />
not true... i play an SK as my main and snare does just fine as an agro generator even when resisted.   Add in our spear line of DDs and agro is easy to hold <br />
<br />
sounds like the original poster had a lackluster SK as your tank.  Much like if you had a crappy cleric one night in a group, don't expect that all clerics suck at healing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I play a 65 shm and a 65 sk.  Even if they can't snare, an sk can cast Terror of Thule (+600 aggro), which is like an EB proc from a warrior (700 aggro).  Plus they can aura of hate and spear of decay.  There are lower levels of these spells, although the sk may not have had terror of terris or what not.  I can't grab aggro quite as fast w/o snare, but it isn't *that* big a difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Margok Grimwurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My main is a 65 sk and if your sk cant get argo within 3 seconds or less you've got a ****ty sk. takes me 1-2 casts of a level 15 spell to get and hold agro wether its resists doesnt stick or target is immune it still causes agro. I always ask the chanter or shaman to slow on inc.. Hell the whole party can chain cast anything they want and if I want agro im not worried about getting and keeping it. Sorry for your bad experience. I do warn them from time to time they may get a love tap but usually even if I lose agro for any reason all it takes is one cast of clinging darkness and its mine again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Worador Spiritbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I hear about how great SK's are at getting and holding aggro. I have met far and few in between. If I want to work on my defensive skills , then I don't mind having a SK as a MA. <br />
I'll take a mediocre paladin anyday. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">An SK who knows how to play his class well can make a great tank. He might not have the hit points that a warrior has, but he can get &amp; hold taunt very quickly. <br />
<br />
My boyfriend plays an SK and we have been paired up for quite a while. He can manage to keep the mob off of me while I'm debuffing, slowing, crippling, and dotting. <br />
<br />
SK's &amp; Shaman make an awesome duo. I'm sorry you had some bad luck with those two SKs. Don't write off the whole class to these two.</div></div><hr />
