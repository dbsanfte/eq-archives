<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">honestly your best bet is probably the Giants in RM but you won't be making the kind of money you want. Just about any spot that is as good or better than RM usually stays a secret for a good long while as people don't want to have the type of competition that you run into there. My old favorite was the guards in Paineel but they added faction hits to them so I had to stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Braag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know about 1000pp an hour, but I found the warehouses in Dulak to be a great spot for making plat (that is as long as a the gem drops haven't been nerfed). ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dulak is your best bet, My wife (53 Shaman) made 1.5K there in about 2-2.5 hours.  All she did was kill EVERYTHING she could starting at the zone in (tunnel) and working out to the open area, keeping that as clear as she could.  Jewelry and gem drops, and usually 5 pp per kill add up!  Plus you can still get some exp off it.  The boats work well also.  At your level (same as wifes), I would reccommend the &quot;Lady D&quot; (second boat in going counter clockwise).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been hitting cystal caverns farming velium.. all the mobs are easy just root them cuz it sucks when they run away. I have surprisingly made some good pp this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jumgurorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Agree with the post above. Crystal Caverns is a gold mine. Kill the Orcs for Velium (ez sell in bazaar), or kill the Geonids for gem drops. The geo's are almost always claimed but there are plenty of Orcs to go around. <br />
<br />
Also, whack some of the Ry`Gorr Elites on the way in for armor drops.<br />
<br />
Have Fun, Jumgurorm</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dulak is good, when it first opened up the gem drops were awesome, would usually get a diamond or BD every time I cleared the dandolak, which was like a 15 minute spawn I believe. Xp was good as well, dou'ed there when my ranger was 53 and shammy was 51 til the ranger was 55 I think. Think I made 20-30kpp just off of gems and trash loot. Parked my druid there to ferry it back and forth to the bank/mytrader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yea, use to like gunthrak alot too I remember it being the first place I made decent loot, now it just seems so lame now even the iksar blood seems pretty nerfed. I farm named in velks. When I had my 60+ monk/shammy combo I could keep clear the top 2 sheves clear keep all the velium since it sells for decent pp. Or camp the one thatr drops the haste gloves and wrist bands, I would make 2k-12k a night for a few hours work. Sometimes even less, like everythign else though it is never rock solid, but seems to be the most solid yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>armagedon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You want a 1000 pp spot per hour? For a lvl 55 i doubt you can find one. Best spots i know for your lvl are about 700pp / hour at max.<br />
<br />
Differents spots for farming purpose :<br />
<br />
-Ice Giants in Everfrost. (About 600 to 750 pp per hour if you have the 3 spots, most of time it's camped)<br />
<br />
-Hill giant in RM (Sony nerfed them. Now they drop far less money than before on average. I would say an average of 15 pp at max per giant. Before the nerf, common drop was 20 to 30 pp per mob now common drop is 0 to 10pp for 80% of them and rarelly 20 to 40pp. The max still about 40 pp per mob but now it's very rare to drop as much money. Most of the time HG drop now between 0 and 20 plat and maybe one on 5 is rich like before ! :-)<br />
<br />
-Felwithe guards (You ll ruin your faction with HE but who care HE? :)<br />
Felwithe guards drop a nice 2 sword you can sell to merchand for 20 pp + they drop 0 to 6 plat in money + often a fine steel weapon. Average per guard about 25 to 26plat. They are lvls 38/42 good xp (zem is 33%) until 53/54. 500 to 700 pp per hour.<br />
<br />
-Dulak harbor : Gem drop has been nerfed but still not so bad considering you get good xp too at your lvl. Money drop is not so bad average of 5p + ton of weapons to sell.<br />
<br />
-High hold keep (Kill nobles and bards for good Xp until 56) Plus you can kill guards (lvl 22 to 30 for most) with your dog for money. (Guards are cakes and they always have a 5pp sword + money so it's about 8pp per guard. You can kill about 70 to 80 of them per hours if you know the place. 500 to 700pp per hour. You can sell and bank there.<br />
<br />
-Wyverns in cobalt scar. It's depend of your server economy but their hide can be sold in bazar for 150 to 250p per hide.<br />
They are easy to kill and they are Plenty of them. hide doesnt seem too uncommon. You can farm about 10 hide eatch 2/3 hours of played + some gems drop + some money. Not so far of 1000 pp per hour if you can sell hide for a good price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hi tist,<br />
<br />
     2 other good money makers are Nadox (the shrine camp near the zone to Torgian Mines) and Acrylia Caverns. This may or may not be alittle tough to solo for you right now, but if you can con a melee friend into duoing with you not only will you cash in, but you'll be able to get some xp while doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I need money bad and was wondering if some options.. I would like to make 800-1000pp per hour (items or cash).. is this possible.. need a good place<br />
<br />
DULAK,  not sure about the 1000 a hr, but I know that drops on the oceancrusher avraged 6+pp per mob that I killed.  Plus you get Fine steel weapons and gems that drop.  This adds up over a while..   I did this zone and made ok plat.   This zone spoiled me cause I'm not making the same as I did before, now that I'm in Nodox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't know about 1000pp an hour, but I found the warehouses in Dulak to be a great spot for making plat (that is as long as a the gem drops haven't been nerfed). ;)<br />
<br />
Agreed, this zone has the best Exp bonus with the best pp per drop combo I have seen in a while at our lvls.  roughly 6pp+ per kill,  and the epx to boot for 2 boxing, soloing or grouping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm still a big fan of OOT. Seafurys are easily soloable at 50 using root and puppy. Seafurys usually drop 4-6p, a nice bit of exp, and fire emeralds, fire opals, mithirl amulets which all sell for a good chunk of change. Plus, if you snag the Gornit camp, he con's LB and drops around 30p almost every time and fine steel weapons (there is a merchant on the nex island cause you will get A LOT of stuff to sell). There is also the Ancient Cyclopse which occasionally spawns and drops a ring used for the Jboots quest.  There is also the pirate camp there, although the mobs dont drop anything, they do drop Gnome meat and Dark Elf meat (which I save up for my essences). Oh yeah, Gornit also drops fire giant toes for some alchemy combine<br />
<br />
There is my 2 cents =)<br />
<br />
<br />
*EDIT. On second look a the topic... this zone is probably too low to be worth while for you to farm.</div></div><hr />
