<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I recently dinged 65 and although I mostly group with my small guild, I find myself solo early morning and late nights.  Was hoping some of you could post some current info on good spots/mobs to solo as a low level 65.  I only have 5aa's, but have good gear and most spells (only missing LDoN dots).  I've solo'd in PoJ and PoI using root and rot method, but am looking for other options.  I figure PoV will be doable once I get Bane and perhaps Anathema, they should help root/rot dps.  <br />
<br />
So, any recommendations?  Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nadox is a good place to grind out aa if you are still learning the solo grind as most mobs are dark blue. Inner Acrylia is also good for the same reason. I like both because dog dog can pretty much tank here if you get into trouble and the zones tend to be kind of quiet. If you didn't by chance do Blood of Nadox you can solo it while getting some good experience. You can learn how to tackle adds, and in Inner Acrylia there are some nice named to play with. Neither have top quality xp but it depends if you are looking for the best xp, or the best fun.<br />
<br />
I think I found these two places the most relaxing to solo, although I think PoValor has the best solo xp for root rotting that you will find at your level of aa. Check out a great post on soloing Crystalline Golems by Twoflower. <br />

<br />
If you can handle the BoT crowd (Which I assume is the same on every server) try and hang in there to get canni V. it will greatly reduce your downtime, or uptime (if you are a glass is half full type of shaman).<br />
<br />
EDIT: Congratulations on level 65 by the way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used to solo the Moktors in UP when I was looking for armor to twink my Paladin (camped him in the zone). You will occasionally get lucky and find A Gantru Raldukan, Gantru Dralkenr, or Fallen Sergeant for some decent droppable bazaar fodder. They summon, so you'll be tanking in Teh Face(!), but they don't hit hard once slowed (pull with malos from max range), and it means you get doggy dps.<br />
<br />
Lots of people recommend the post-revamp Acrylia Caverns (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=14520&amp;highlight=acrylia+caverns). I found it fun to solo when I was looking for my VT shard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Definitely recommend finishing up Bane and Anathema ASAP.  Then depending on what you want:<br />
<br />
<br />
Droga - Good for loot and decent XP.  Built for shaman<br />
<br />
Nurga - Same as Droga, but lower level and lower loot.  Faster kills if you are interested in Chardok faction<br />
<br />
ChardokB - Great for XP and OK loot.  Best if you have non-KoS faction with Chardok, but I run down all the time without training.  Secret is to jump into the slave pits and camp there to lose aggro, then invis and run in the rest of the way.<br />
<br />
Charsis - Need the key and a terrible place to CR.  But, rarely camped, has good loot and is easy once you know it.  Get a group down here first and finish up your master key then come back to solo.<br />
<br />
Veksar - Need Bane since higly disease/poison resistant.  Seems to be better xp and loot than droga, but harder.  Also good for Cabalis faction.<br />
<br />
Siren's Grotto - Camp the haste belt off of fellspine.  Or the sirens.   Or the Ulthorks near WW.  All good camps.  EB needed here.  OK XP and decent loot.<br />
<br />
The Deep - Easy kills, bad loot, XP comes from mass numbers that you can kill if you are quick.  Was easy and no-risk xp here for me at 65.<br />
<br />
PoN - Can root rot a lot here.  Consider the gargs past the PoNB entrance or doing the maze.  To get into a maze start event but never hail the quest mob when inside.<br />
<br />
PoV, PoI, HoH, IA, UP, etc. - Already mentioned or straightforward</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey guys, thx for the inputs.  Am hoping someone can also include how much aa exp the various mobs in these &quot;solo&quot; zones give per kill.  Not looking for exact figures, just ball park numbers.<br />
<br />
For example, I've solo'd in PoI IZ a couple of times, just single pull and root/rot/dog.  I get about 1.5% aa per kill on db.  On lb, probably less than 1%, although it is often enough that my bar will move up a % pt.<br />
<br />
How does this compare to flies in PoD, or golems in PoV?  <br />
<br />
Any other observations/info?  Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can't really comment on the % of an AA per kill since I duo everything.  Even started bringing my GF's druid along 3-boxing so I get the leadership AAs.  But in all the spots I mentioned I get from .7 to 1.5% of an AA per kill.<br />
<br />
The thing you want to focus on is % of an AA per hour.  Include the time it takes to get to the site and your camp spots.  The planes are easy since they are so accessible.  Other places I mentioned may take you awhile to get there.  ChardokB, for instance, takes me over 30 minutes for the OTM since I run through FM every time to grab some more faction and to check on the angry goblin.<br />
<br />
For just straight XP, PoV golems or PoTactics around the pigpen would be your best bet.  Can solo 60% an hour there at 65 with Bane I believe.  PoF looks to be about 1 AA an hour, although I'm not flagged for that yet.<br />
<br />
The other places I mentioned I can get from 30 - 40% of an AA an hour for my duo.  Personally I like the change of pace and the better loot that these places offer.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />

<br />
As long as you have your 65 spells, you should be able to solo PoV golems right away.  I was using 3 dots (sarryn, ultor and epic) and I did just fine.  Pull with Malos, root, slow (for when root breaks) and dot away.  Of course, without Bane and Anathema, it takes a little bit of time.  I usually got around 3-4% aaxp (I think... been a while since I've hit the golems) per kill.  A little boring but very doable.  :)<br />
<br />
Grats on 65!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hi Thunder... grats on 65... took me 3 years or so myself, so I know the feeling to finally get there :).<br />
<br />
PoV gave me about 5% AA.<br />
<br />
Droga gives 2-ish% near the front, but I found that deeper in, the mobs are around level 61 and give about 4%.  So comparable xp and good loot to boot.<br />
<br />
Nadox and other places might be a tad easier and give about 1% per kill, but could go faster/easier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slavage909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Pon Hedge you get 4-5 percent aaxp per kill<br />
<br />
It only takes one ultor one pox 2 epics and 3-4 bloods<br />
<br />
I can kill one without canni 5ing during the fight if hps is a trouble. <br />
<br />
I almost always have to keep Q going on me.. 471 hitters.  debuff with malo and decay and you will never get a resist.  THere lvl 59-60.<br />
<br />
I do the three night stalker on the right side of the maze...only three mobs on that side.  Been told respawn is 16ish mins.   I had to wait for respawn if I do 2 mobs but always have one up with doing 3.</div></div><hr />
