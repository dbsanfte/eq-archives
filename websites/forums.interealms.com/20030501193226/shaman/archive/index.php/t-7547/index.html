<br />
Editted with new content below:<br />
I decided to edit this post to let people know what this thread has become.  If you just read a few replies and then make a reply yourself, you probably will think that I am some jerk making fun of Anomalos because he didn't like my site.  The truth is that Anomalos *had* posted all of my personal information including my address and phone number.  He has since then editted the information out, so it looks like I am just attacking him for no reason.  grrr...  why cant we all just get along! =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you start any later in the game with an eq site?<br />
<br />
Btw, the site design sucks.  Try having multiple links on the main page, instead of 100 things on the first page, PLUS the freaking forum on the bottom?</div></div><hr />

Bigemnose, the site is a good, solid start. It has a lot of work to be done, true, but you have a good foundation. Looks like a good beginning to me :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and for Callir and Bigem, don't take things so seriously.  He's trolling and advertising, so that's exactly the way I treated him.  I hate spam.  Even if the site was good I wouldn't like it.  I was giving him a tough time cuse as a first time poster he comes and advertises, nothing more.  RELAX.<br />
<br />
And if you're actually serious about coming up here, hehe, you need serious help.  It's a message board about a game.  Loser.</div></div><hr />

You all have large hand guns, and the ability to shoot the wing off a fly at 300 yards.  Can we move on now?  The guy was a jerk, and Thantu really should remove your personal information, and suspend/ban/warn/punish the jerk for posting it, possibly forwarding the whole thread to law enforcement for investigation for conspiracy to commit assault.   Of course the downside to that is your offer of $100.<br />
<br />
That said, I guess I missed the satire on your site?  A comic you didn't draw, news that... Oh wait.  I remember now... that one article about the PoP Motto.  Nevermind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whether the address and the phone number coincide I do not know, but I will find out this weekend.  Maps.yahoo.com shows it to be a 18 hour and 44 minute trip from my place to his.  I have been needing a vacation for a while anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">???<br />
<br />
Don't you think you're both overreacting a bit?  I think Anomalos was overreacting when he decided to be the Ralph Nader of website advertisers and issued the &quot;/bitchslap&quot; and then I definitely think he crossed the line by posting your personal information (I hope Thantu deletes it soon).<br />
<br />
But, calling his number and threatening to go there, that's really crazy.<br />
<br />
I swear, it looks so extremely bizarre, it looks STAGED to get corpserun.com more publicity!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
313 shows up as indeed being in the area he posted, but he could be using a false name and address.  That being said, I found this information on the net about a Ted Teknos in Michigan, and I am going to contact the university to find out if it is him.<br />
<br />
Dr. Ted Teknos is an otolaryngologist/head and neck surgeon with a clinical and research focus on head and neck cancer and microvascular reconstruction. He attended Harvard Medical School and completed his residency in otolaryngology/head and neck surgery at the Harvard Combined Program/Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Subsequent to his residency, Dr. Teknos completed a specialty fellowship in head and neck oncology, microvascular reconstruction, and skull base surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He has been practicing at the University of Michigan since 1997, and focuses on neoplastic diseases of the head and neck, as well as microvascular reconstruction following tumor removal. Dr. Teknos' research is primarily on novel antiangiogenic strategies dealing with head and neck cancer, with clinical research related to microvascular reconstruction.</div></div><hr />

My address isn't posted, since it's not my name on the house.  This guy actually did call me and threaten me, I thought it was funny.  This whole thing was a joke for me, and it still is.  I recorded the conversation for people here at work, and they're still laughing.  Yes, it was wrong of me to post his info, but that's publically available, and it was a joke.  This is no publicity stunt for the site glori.  I'm not some fly by night poster here, I've been a lurker for a while and a poster for about a year.<br />

Then why did you post his information as your own?  And now Ted's a Doctor?  Why didn't you put the Dr in front of &quot;your&quot; name when you posted &quot;your&quot; information in the first place.  You wouldn't happen to be Ted Teknos Jr would ya?</div></div><hr />

As for just razzing the guy... BS!  You took it upon yourself to post my personal information and ask people to come attack me.  And why?  Because I took the time and MY OWN MONEY to make a web site for Everquest.  You are the apitamy(sp?) of what is WRONG with Everquest these days.  You got nothing better to do then sit around on your fat ass and cause trouble.  Well this time your going to pay for it.  You are going to be an example to the rest of the EQ community that it is time to start taking responsibility for your actions.  I take your threats seriously, and as I said before, I AM taking legal action against you.  I am just making sure I have all of your information correct before I call the police, Theodore.</div></div><hr />

No ass.  I'm greek.   The fact is greeks have a certain way we name our kids.  The first born son is named after the father's father.  My father's father is named Theodore.  Therefore we have 3 Ted Teknos's in the family, as there are 3 brothers who's first three sons are named Ted.  Got anything else smart guy?</div></div><hr />

Divinator, it has now been deleted, but Anomalos quickly escalated from &quot;wow, your site sucks!&quot; to posting Bigemnose's real life name, address and phone number.  While I don't think Bigemnose's threats of violence are warranted, Anomalos was completely out of line for posting that information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I'm familiar with naming first born sons after previous patriarchs of the family.  I'm at least the fourth in a row with my name.<br />
<br />
Now I have to admit I'm REALLY confused.<br />
<br />
You said the first born son is named after the father...  And your fathers brother is your first cousin not your uncle, aged 36 currently, who is aparently named after your dad's dad.  That makes him the first born son, so your dad must therefore be younger than age 36, which means you at age 23 were conceived while your father was no older than... 13?<br />
<br />

Dood you're hopeless, hehe.  The 36 year old is my 1st cousin.  His father is my father's older brother.  That is why my 1st cousin and I have the same name.  Our grandfather was Theodore.  Sheesh.</div></div><hr />

Some of us will be drinking at 8-Ball Willies off of Corporate and Hwy 121 in Lewisville on Saturday.  Feel free to show up if you'd like.  I should be the only 5'6 bald biker with a Sons of Thunder logo.  <br />
<br />
Hope to see ya!<br />

I'd like to be refunded 3 minutes of my life back.<br />
<br />
Yeah, 1 minute reading some site called Corpserun.com, and 2 minutes reading a thread advertising it on Shaman's Crucible.<br />
<br />
If you could help me out with that, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I should have clicked away after wasting 15 seconds of my life viewing corpserun.com, but I read the next message.  And then the next...and next...and now I find myself at the end of thread in a near Nietzsche-ian state of inner crisis and transformation.  <br />

This is what the internet is for?<br />

Someone owes me four minutes of life back.  I think it's Thantu.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, bigemnose you dont have a case. The internet is public domain and so is your information, you have no legal recourse. <br />
<br />
Once he starts threatening people, and offering other people to whack him, he's crossed the line.  He DOES have a case here.  There have been a ton of cases EXACTLY like this, where people have posted private info and been threatened, and the poster did go to jail.  Ever hear about the person who posted his ex-girlfriend's home addy and talked about her rape fantasies?  He went to jail.<br />
<br />
Dude, you went WAAAAY over the line here.  You have broken the law and if this guy persues legal action you WILL be arrested.  There's no grey area here.  It doesn't matter that you were &quot;just kidding&quot;, you broke the law, very clearly.<br />
<br />
First that moron in chat the other night, now this :(  The Crucible has hit a new low :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Bigemnose Andhow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Well... I'm not going to press charges against him since he took my pesonal information off his post.  Still pissed that he did it in the first place.  It was completely uncalled for, and I am not going to go to Michigan and kick his ass either.  I think he has learned something from all of this or atleast I hope he has...  <br />
<br />
All I wanted to do was get the word out that I had a new site.  Sheesh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">where people have posted private info and been threatened, and the poster did go to jail. <br />
<br />
You're so full of crap.  If I did what that guy did with his girlfriend's address, that might be different.  I didn't post anything PRIVATE.  Just do a whois on his domain, and it'll pull up an address.  How am I to know that's even really him.  That's right, I don't.  I never threatened him.  I said someone go bitch slap, here's the address.  I stated that it wasn't cool that I did that, end of story.  This guy is getting backround checks on me, calling me and making real threats, and you're telling me he has a case against me?  Piss off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Heimdall Azureguardian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Yeah, you broke the law Anamolous, but you'd probably win a Jury trial... or at the least get it knocked down to a non-felony.  Of course, pressing charges of your own against Bigemnose is also an option if he were to do so against you.  He offered you money so he could smack you around.  That's also a conspiracy to commit- arguably more so than yours even, balanced by the fact that you started it thereby provoking him with mitigating circumstances.  The end result would be both of you paying money to the government and defense lawyers.  :p</div></div><hr />

You know that it's against the law to speed?  How bout littering?  How many times a day do you break the law, if you want to get technical you freaking jackass.  Broke the law, come on.  There's no law against posting public information.  Some people I swear.</div></div><hr />

Bigem, if you dedicate half of the energy, time, feelings and money into your site as you did into this thread, then I'll be a hooked and returning viewer of your page.<br />

Good luck with the site.  This was a great ad. :p</div></div><hr />

Make a half decent layout, add some good content, etc, and maybe it will be good.<br />

There's no law against posting public information.  Some people I swear. <br />
<br />
You're focusing on the wrong half of what you did.  You posted his information, then tried to get people to beat him up.  You provided something of value: His information, and asked others to &quot;pay&quot; for it by smacking him around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">You're posting your interpretation, which is a far cry from the facts.  I didn't tell anyone to go beat him up.  Originally I said /bitchslap, as a joke.  Then I posted his address and said go bitch slap him if you're in the area.  You can basically take almost any phrase said by anyone and turn it around to make it malicious.  What do you think makes a politician a politician?  Manipulation of the language.  I can also probably take a speech written by the president, and re-word it based on my interpretation, and make it sound like he's saying &quot;FU*K YOU&quot; over and over again.  Doesn't make it true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Heimdall Azureguardian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Fine you're right.  All of your peers, coincedentally the people who would make up your jury, have so far intrepreted it as beat the crap out of him.  Its just me though.</div></div><hr />
