<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi's. Next year is my final year of high school and it got me thinkin who here went to College/University/straight to work or joined the military? <br />
<br />
Being from Ontarion,Canada, we have a 5year highschool program and starting next year a 4 year program will be phased in. This means that there will be double the number of graduating students, approximately 56k's worth. Also here in Canada, unlike in the states, Uni is pretty much the standard choice of all students, since Canadain collages are few and far between. Of course with all this extra competition, I'm concerned with whether I'll be able to get admitted into a nice UNI and was wondering what everyone else did when entering probably the most critical juncture of one's life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously.  You learn so much more than booksmart stuff.  You learn to basically grow up as a person.  You know, the whole roomate thing, getting partying out of your system etc.  It's important for people to leave home and go do something else for a few years.  You'll appreciate your life much more if you do.  Besides, if you go for something besides an art degree you'll most likely be making much better money than you could be from the military or just going to work.<br />
<br />
My 2 cents<br />
Good luck :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">College is fun, the most fun you will likely have in your life. Booze, women, party, non-stop.<br />
<br />
Now, all you gotta do is get a piece of paper, in any field, that says &quot;degree&quot; and you have a huge advantage over anyone else, even if you are an idiot.  Anything worhtwhile, you learn on the job.<br />
<br />
It is all about the piece of paper, turns idiots in to money makers. Hell I work at IBM and we have people with the most silly degrees you can think of, doing IT work, and they are just flat out dumb. Some people not finished degree who are bright as hell but make 30% less money, go figure.<br />
<br />
have fun but dont flunk out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You learn to basically grow up as a person.  <br />
ROFL.  College just delays the growing up process.  You'll grow up a hell of a lot faster in the military.<br />
<br />
 Also here in Canada, unlike in the states, Uni is pretty much the standard choice of all students, since Canadain collages are few and far between<br />
I'm not sure by your post but it sounds like college and university are two different things in Canada. <br />
<br />
<br />
My personal choice:  Entered the military, served my time and then went to college on GI Bill.  Graduated with ZERO student loans/no debt.  Very nice to not have 15 -20k in loans on my shoulders.  And I got to do some very cool stuff.<br />
<br />
my advice:  Go to college/university.  Enroll in the Canadian Reserves or equivalent.  After a couple years of both you will know if the military is the life for you...if it is, become an officer.  If not, stay a civilan and get a nice job after your schooling is done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Souldreamer Bearspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In the US, the difference between a college and a univeristy is this.  <br />
<br />
Univeristies contain several colleges into one big school.  For example, I went to Kansas State University which had the college of arts and sciences, college of engineering, college of agriculture, etc.  Within each of those colleges, are different departments that then have different majors.<br />
<br />
My sister went to Mcpherson college, which is a small private school that has several degree programs, but they are all under one college, just different departments.<br />
<br />
As far as what you should pick, that depends on what you would like to do in life.  Right now, with the economy the way it is, getting a job right out of high school probably isn't your best bet.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure how the canadian armed forces are either so I really can't comment on that.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to look at the different universities or colleges close to where you live, see what major you might be interested in and go from there.  Visit them next year, see what campus life is like.  I wouldn't trade my time at KSU for anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the tips everyone, its realy helping clear the big picture up. As Far as I know there is a rather large difference between Collages and Universities, with Univiersities being best described as a longer program concentrating on academics and collages a shorter, more hands on program concentracting on the real application of skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are thinking about military, talk to a recuiter and ask them about the military paying for your university.  And go to a university if you can get in, a degree is worth more than a diploma.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I took the military route and am thankful that I did.  However it doesn't have to be the military, it can be any worthwhile or even half-ass endeavor that has nothing to do with school.  Even though I was very prepared for higher learning institutions after high school, I truly needed a break from the last 13yrs of straight school and didn't even know it.  At 18 I didn't know what the hell I wanted out of life, to jump right back into the same environment which I had come from would only insulate me further from the real world out there.   As such, you will waste a lot of time and money in college if you don't have a goal or direction to begin with.  Experience something outside of school, hell join the peace corp for a few years  :D  and find out who you are and what you want out of life then when you find out what you are interested in, take your life experiences and a fresh look back to college.  I was 22 when I went back to school and had a great time, but what a huge difference between myself and the 18 year olds who took classes with me, just four years of life experience and I could hardly relate!  If you have any doubts about school, just back off for a year or more and experience life.  Hope I didn't get too philosophical  :p .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">depending on the course...college is very good for auto getting jobs right after grad.  alot of univ grads end up at timmy's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Come to think about it after my 3 year in this university, I wished I have joined the military in my country.  It's not like we're fighting anyone.  And it was mandatory, so I shoulda get done with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Did college first for a couple of years after High School, started looking into job prospectus at graduation and didn't like the odds. So I signed up with the military. It was honestly the hardest years I ever hope to spend but they were well worth it. I left with a couple of skills not taught at any University; responsibility and the ability to effectively lead other people. Pushing the people under you to realize their full potential without squashing them in the process is one of the most sought after skills in the real world. After discharge working full time and still finishing up a couple of degrees was a cakewalk compared to the military. I'd recommend it to anyone considering it. Like all of life, the hard things are worth the most in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I went into the military.  4 years in USMC.  Way more valuable than college, at least for me.  I had 4 years of experience when I got out and was more advanced in my field than almost anyone else my age.  I also was making more money on my first job ($42K/year, 10 years ago) than any folks I knew coming straight out of college.<br />
<br />
This only worked for me because of my MOS in the Corps.  Had I spent 4 years as an 0311, I would certainly have had a problem finding a job afterward.  Since I was a programmer (4063/4067 dual MOS) for 4 years, I had 4 years experience advantage on most other folks my age.<br />
<br />
I'm beginning to hit a point now, however, where having the piece of paper would help me advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Looking back, I probably wouldn't have went to college right after high school, and if I did, I would have just went to a community college for 2 years.<br />
<br />
I went to a state university right after high school (Go Seminoles!)<br />
Yes, I had fun.  However, I could have got the same first 2 year classes at a community college, at a much cheaper price, and the classes would have been easier.<br />
<br />
I also would have more considered going into the military.  Not only does it teach you much about life, but it has many financial perks.  Pays for some of your college, and other perks after you retire.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you're like me, but I didn't (don't) know what to do in college, 4 years later, so I've taken some time off from it.  So, I just dinked around taking random classes, with a bunch of credits and no major.<br />
<br />
I'm not all that hip on the U.S. college system vs. some European countries.<br />
<br />
U.S. Colleges make you take **** classes you don't need, and won't remember.<br />
<br />
European colleges are more to the point.  You take relevant classes, and you get done faster.  I have a friend studying medicine in Switzerland, and she's way ahead of a friend of mine going to UCF who has been in a medical program longer.<br />
<br />
I say, stay home for a year and a half or 2 years, save some money, get a part time job, and go to a community college.<br />
<br />
Even go to a technical college, perhaps.  Some programs only take 1 and a half to 2 years.  Some can net you a pretty decent job, and you can go into a real University after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Go to school, or military thats your call on what you think will fit you best.  If you choose school dont fail out :)  but the advanteges of school/military over looking for a job right out of high school are tremedous.  The world is becoming more and more based upon technology and u need an edjucation.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually, in the US, the difference between college and university is becoming less clear.  Traditionally, a college is a four year institution that results in a bachelor degree.  A university offers advanced degrees--masters and/or doctorates in some field, I believe.  However, I seem to recall reading about a legal case where a college wanted to call itself a university and sued some government agency.  Go figure.<br />
<br />
At any rate, yes, go to college.  The military may be a good choice for training, or financial aid, or just a chance to find out what you want to do, but get a degree before, during, or after.  Even in some militaries, it's difficult to advance past certain ranks without a degree.<br />
<br />
You can get a job with no degree, but unless you are extremely lucky, you will eventually hit a wall past which you can't really advance without a degree.  This is becoming more and more true (there are occasional exceptions) with the huge number of students that are graduating every year.  School doesn't necessarily make you more mature and certainly not any more experienced for a job, but it does help with communication skills, analytical thinking, and some basic skills that employers look for.  2 or 3 degrees make even more of an impression if you have the patience.<br />
<br />
Heck!  I got 5!  :)<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
P.S.  Forgot to mentions, I recently read about a study that (in the US) college graduates make on the average $1,000,000 more in their life than non-graduates.  Of course, that's over their whole life, but still.  I expect that number to get larger in future years.  More and more the better jobs require a degree to get a foot in the door.  Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am not sure but I believe Canadians get their University education (from public unis) for free, or darn near free.  So the whole military thing is unnecessary.  <br />
<br />
Military is a very valid option in the states here, especially for kids without financial means or the rich parents to provide tuition and living expenses.  <br />
<br />
I did my uni without the military and ended up 30k in debt.  My job is one that you don't actually need a degree for, but I'm positive the degree helped me actually get it.  Also I make about twice as much as a degree-wielding person in the field of my major (Biochemistry).  <br />
<br />
In the end it all comes down to MONEY.  Do what will make you MONEY.  All else is dust in the wind.  If you can't get enough money to do the things you want and live the way you want, it's pointless to keep at that same job.  Go get a tradeskill and chances are you'll earn more money anyhow.  <br />
<br />
I suggest learning a trade in addition to the uni, be it welding, plumbing, pharmacy assistant, electrician, or any of a host of &quot;Blue collar&quot; jobs that uni-educated people generally look down on.   It took me until 3 years after I graduated uni, but I now have a really valuable tradeskill that is currently making me quite well off.</div></div><hr />

It's windy in Lawrence cos Manhattan blows and Columbia sucks! Aroo! (Or Lincoln and Norman, I suppose. :p )<br />
<br />
Rock chalk Jayhawk!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Plus you can always frame your degree on the wall and show it to dates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey baby, got any English Grad in you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Uniforms are *so* overrated.<br />
<br />
(Don't ever try that ... pick up lines are an insult to intelligent life.)<br />
<br />
On a serious note, I've been through three schools in the past four years while trying to get settled. (A Community College, a State Uni and your average run-of-the-mill Uni.) There really isn't a noticable difference between the two. The Universities offered a more diverse selection of classes, but only by a whopping four or five pages because of offering more majors. If the Military is your thing, go military. But don't expect to find a well-paying job without a college degree unless, as it has already been stated, you're very lucky. Even knowing people I was told that a degree is a must anymore. I tried taking a year off and seeing what it's like, then moved back to Ohio and got my butt back in school after a year of struggling. I learned that job stands for Just Over Broke, a career is something else entirely...<br />
<br />
My boss told me one day while I was trying to get a friend of mine a job with the company that he was getting an average of 30 unsolicited resumes a week (It was ten times worse when the company was looking) and if he saw they didn't have a degree he'd just toss it in the shredder. If they were attending college, he'd at least give them a glance.<br />
<br />
Even without a degree, putting that you're in a College or Uni makes a noticable difference when looking for a job. <br />
<br />
Something to keep in mind.</div></div><hr />

A college is merely a &quot;dorm room&quot; i suppose you yanks would say, and not much more.<br />

Do what i did, rent a house not too far from uni and have friends in different colleges. You dont have to put up with the room mate ****, and you get to turn up to all the parties :)</div></div><hr />
