<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No, im not talking about bank area, or nathyns house.. im not sure if anybody else knows about this spot, never seen it posted,  so i guess not many ppl know.<br />
<br />
a couple days ago, me(57 shaman) and my 52 warrior friend were in Katta looking for some exp... all camps were taken, nathyns, bank area, gy.. so we started doing gargoyoles from the graveyard house for a while, they were easy but had high ac, so i started looking around for a place to hunt when i found this *aweome* exp spot!!<br />
<br />
this is how you get there.. first.. go to the graveyard.. then walk out, and outside of the graveyard to your right there will be some stairs leading to this big house.    this is the place.. at the stairs there is usually 2 leggionares that are too low lvl to give u good xp at 57.. but just outside the door there are 2 centurions.. those are all lvl54 mobs.. they hit for 157 max, have no resists (never got a resist on any spell exept for the odd JBB partial resist)..some summon, some dont ive noticed.. at the time i was just pl'ing my warrior friend but he was getting 3% xp per kill and we were doing it non stop.. at 57 sometimes i pulled 2 but im pretty sure at 58 you can single pull all of it.<br />
<br />
so once you are done with the 2 entrance mobs, open the door and there will be a cent to your left and to your right.. further into the house by some stairs are 2 other cents.. when you go up the stairs there is one cent to each side..<br />
i doubt you will be able to clear the entire house though, the repop time on them is extremely fast.. with me and my 52 war friend we were pulling and killing non-stop and we could keep about 5 clear before the first repoped.. also, you dont have to kill the lesser guards outside of the house becuase they dont help the cents.<br />
<br />
there are also corporals in the house that are just as hard as cents and drop a 210 range throwing items which is nice to give to one of your monk friends :)<br />
btw.. we pulled all cents to the graveyard.. if a undead popped and added i would just have my pet destroy them.<br />
<br />
this is about all i have to say, if you guys have any questions let me know.   im going back there tonight to see how much exp i get solo :)<br />
<br />
ps: if you are on Saryrn server, Stay Away!!! All mine!! jk =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What were the faction hits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">im pretty sure they are on same faction as all other katta guards, aka, validos custodus or so... i will check when i get back home and post all faction hits for sure.<br />
<br />
edit: here are the faction hits:<br />
<br />
Validus Custodus got worse.<br />
Katta Castellum Citizens got worse.<br />
Nathyn Illuminous got better.<br />
Coterie of Eternal night got better.<br />
Seru got better.<br />
Hand of Seru got better.<br />
Eye of seru got better.<br />
Hand legionnares got better.</div></div><hr />

Is it safe to say that you are already KoS in Katta?  I know I am because I killed those little dock people in Twilight to get through 54.  Assuming you are KoS... do the lesser guards attack you?  I'm assuming you are using horse and JBB as well...... thats what I would like to do.  Also, your profile is very similar to mine.  You're the only other shammy Ive seen with a History of the Dizok.<br />
<br />
I hope your soloing worked out well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hi Naala,<br />
<br />
yes i do use the history of di'zok, i picked it up on a chardok raid a couple days ago, since i never melee anymore since i got jbb i used it in place of my rune etched icewurm fang to give an ac and hp boost =)     yes i do use the horse and jbb, i malosini so that i always get full dmg hits with jbb when i do these.<br />
<br />
edit: no i am not kos yet, once i do become kos i will have to clear the roamer guard and the 2 lesser guards at bottom of stairs to get to centurions.. but they are easy kills and still dark blue to me so its no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">is there a good spot in seru to balance the faction hits ?<br />
<br />
tnx for this info btw )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you are talking about balancing out the validus custodus (katta guard) faction, then hunting nathyns house guards should do that, im not sure if it fixes seru faction, but im sure it fixes the validus custodus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I tried these out yesterday and wasn't impressed with the XP at all. These guards have too many HP to make it worth while. It took 3-4 BoNs, 2 ebolts and 1 plague to take one down. Don't even bother trying this without KEI or the downtime will drive you insane. They were all dark blue to me but I didn't see an XP gain that was greater than doing Nathyn's guards which are 5x times easier to kill.<br />
<br />
Maybe with a partner this would be better but as for soloing ugh, there are many other better options.</div></div><hr />
