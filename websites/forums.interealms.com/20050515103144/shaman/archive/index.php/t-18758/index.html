<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i've been into KC a couple times now and someone mentioned to me that I would ruin my OT faction (?) and i saw a post just now that there are some spells there? I'm a barb shaman, anyone know what spells are in OT that I can't get elsewhere?<br />
<br />
Also, what other places should i stay away from? I read a few places some people ruined their epic faction?<br />
<br />
Sudden;y I've become very scared to kill anything!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Small dogs, hands, ghosts, undead jailer and most importantly undead  have no faction. <br />
Medium and large dogs, constructs have Venril faction (Overthere), so does Venril himself.  Basically, avoid dog captain camp, dog warlord camp  and maybe hand camp.<br />
<br />
You can XP fine in the basement without faction worries. Maybe Verix has faction too, not sure. If you screw up your Overthere faction, just tag along some Kunark dragon raids (minus Trakanon) and get a nice chunk of positive Overthere faction. Or you can do the ever boring sarnak whip quest in Overthere.<br />
<br />
PS: undead jailer is not an undead!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What is it i need the faction for?<br />
Do barb shammies care about OT faction at all? I have taken some VS hits for sure, i remember...<br />
<br />
I bought some spells in FV so are there more to buy in OT?<br />
<br />
thnx!<br />

As a barbarian you start out KOS to OT and you will remain KOS to OT.  You have absolutely nothing to lose by hunting in KC.  Frogloks will also be KOS in OT, since they worship mithaniel marr.  I don't have a clue how OT feels about the vah shir.  Iksars are also hated in OT.  All of these races are welcome in FV, though, so they have a base of operations in kunark (except iksars though, who of course have cabilis).  Back during kunark and velious days, having a place to sell at and a guildmaster to visit somewhere on the continent were important.  Now, though, it doesn't matter if FV, OT, and cabilis all hate you because you can just take a book to pok.<br />
<br />
You also asked about some spells you bought in FV.  Well, there is a corresponding evil vendor (who I believe is located in ocean of tears) who sells the exact same spells.  I think there is another one in cabilis who, again, sells the exact same spells.  There are a few spells you get via a turn-in quest in the barbarian hut in FV, and there is an NPC somewhere in either OT or OOT who does the exact same thing.  Again, I think there is an equivalent NPC in cabilis but I am not sure.<br />
<br />
So basically, to sum it up, I'm a barb and I hunted in KC.  Been kos to OT my entire life and have never been bothered by it, except for when dragoons used to kill me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jinhiem summed it up.<br />
<br />
OT is the evil version of FV.  Only evil races are welcome there.  Back in the old days it was a PITA for evils since they would quickly find themselves with no base of operations for the entire continent of Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OT vendor spells are Kunark era spells that are available in the Barbarian Shaman guild at the FV docks or at the P&amp;D vendor of Everfrost. Here's a link to find the equivilent spells in other faction areas:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't take advice from Barbarians about OT vendors. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
  Kuglaz Grot (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4409) is the Shaman spell merchant in the OT fort.<br />
  Bukuku Wolffeetz (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4396) does the spell exchange quest.<br />
  The Great Oowomp (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3957) is who you get your Cann2 quest from, he is in Timorous Deep.<br />
 There are no &quot;evil&quot; Shaman spell vendors in Ocean of Tears, AFAIK. If there are, I've never needed to go there to get them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />
