<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I was a young turkey, new to the coop,<br />
My big brother Mike took me out on the stoop,<br />
There he sat me down, and he spoke real slow,<br />
And he told me there was something that I should know;<br />
His look and his tone I will always remember,<br />
When he told me of the horrors of... Black November;<br />
Come about August, now listen to me,<br />
Each day you'll get six meals instead of just three,<br />
And soon you'll be thick, where once you were thin,<br />
And you'll grow a big rubbery glob under your chin;<br />
Then one morning, when you're warm in your bed,<br />
The farmer's wife will burst in and hack off your head,<br />
She' will pluck out all your feathers so you're bald 'n pink,<br />
And scoop out all your insides and leave ya lying in the sink <br />
Now then comes the worst part, he said not bluffing, <br />
She'll spread your cheeks and pack your rear end with stuffing.<br />
Well, the rest of his words were too grim to repeat,<br />
I sat on the stoop like a winged piece of meat,<br />
And decided on the spot that to avoid being cooked,<br />
I'd have to lay low and remain overlooked;<br />
I began a new diet of nuts and granola,<br />
High-roughage salads, juice and diet cola;<br />
And as they ate pastries, chocolates and crepes,<br />
I stayed in my room doing Jane Fonda tapes;<br />
I maintained my weight of two pounds and a half,<br />
And I tried not to notice when the bigger birds laughed;<br />
But 'twas I who was laughing, under my breath,<br />
As they chomped and they chewed, ever closer to death.<br />
And sure enough when Black November came around,<br />
I was the last turkey left in the whole compound;<br />
So now I'm a pet in the farmer's wife's lap,<br />
I haven't a worry, so I eat and I nap,<br />
She held me today, while sewing and humming,<br />
And smiled at me and said, &quot;Honey, Christmas is coming.&quot;</div></div><hr />
