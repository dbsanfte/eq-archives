<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Choose your favorite suggestion for offensive AA abilities in OoW ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dire detrimental spells I think is probably the best one. Quick casting tears of saryn, malos and velium strike is something much sought after I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I only see one making it in the game, pet duel weild...and don't get your hopes up, quite frankly i don't see how you can make a poll withought explaining things, some of those i wondered, huh? for the simple fact that they were not in depth and explained nothing. i admire you admirition to trying to sum up what you would want.  Although you could have givin better input than &quot;innate rabidity&quot; what does that mean?<br />
like the other post, what is passive canni? all these things your 4th grade teacher should have tought you, who,what,why,when,where,how? not that you arent going in the right direction, but if you could just expand a little, you may just be on to something?<br />
<br />
P.S. My punctuatiuon and grammer suck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">These are not my ideas, they were suggestions made by the people who read and post on this board.<br />
<br />
You can see the relevant thread here:<br />
<br />
What aa would you like to see in OoW? (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21385)<br />
<br />
In any case, I'm sure that all shaman familiar with their AAs would know that &quot;innate rabidity&quot; refers to a permanent rabid bear effect ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">aa's for pet duel weild? uh yeah that sounds like something to ask for. why not ask if you can take it in the ass without the lube please and thank you while you are at it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would prefer to see Enchanters lose (or reduce) their current haste spell line in favor of a spell-haste line making them more of the buffers of the mind and us the buffers of the body.  That would give us a way to fix our long cast times while giving us something to bring to a group that can't be replaced by someone who brings a lot of other stuff too.<br />
<br />
As far as fixing our offensive abilities I would like to see higher skill caps (so we can actually hit something),  bash (so we can handle casters better) and useful buffs like +atk, +strikethrough etc.<br />
<br />
And give us warrior crack!  A long-lasting (4+hours with enhancements) regeneration buff (so I can sit in the bazaar all day like the enchanters and clerics).<br />
<br />
Make us a warrior's best friend again.<br />
<br />
Pet dual wield isn't something we should have to pay for.  That should have been in from the begining.  I consider it a bug that he can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally, instead of being forced to take only the AA they offer, they should give you an either/or type of selection.<br />
<br />
People play differently, and as such, should be given a differing selection of AA.<br />
<br />
Train one and others become unavailable/disappear from the list. This would allow a wider variety of choices and allow a player to 'specialize' into the kind of shaman they want to be. <br />
<br />
For example... a SHaman that is more focused on dealing damage, or one more focused on group buffs/healing.<br />
<br />
This could be used to balance the characters abilities too IMO.</div></div><hr />
