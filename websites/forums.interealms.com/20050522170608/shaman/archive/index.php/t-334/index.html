<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>illieanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">greetings! i am a human mage, and because of one careless kill (gnome at bb docks) i am now kos to truespirit faction. i am hoping some of you will have some ideas about how i can improve my faction. an enchanter friend of mine suggested charming the mobs for the beginning of the shaman epic quest and doing the gem turn in, but i am not sure that faction will change if the mob is charmed.<br />
<br />
any thoughts/ideas on this would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
thanks so much!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Faction will change with charmed mobs.  But it might not be enough.  Also, something odd I found out.  Seems part of the Wizard epic quest uses TrueSpirit faction as well.  Hmmmm</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only two epics that are primarily true spirit faction based are: Shaman and Shadowknight.  From what I recall Shaman work on raising it and Shadowknights work on lowering it.  Most of the other epics are the results of multiple item turn ins, not faction checks.  This is why other epics can be MQ'ed a bit more easily.<br />
