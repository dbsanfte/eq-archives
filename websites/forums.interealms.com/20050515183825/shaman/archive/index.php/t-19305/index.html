<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah they broke pet shrink a couple of patches back. Beasties can't shrink pets either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">But look on the bright side, we can grow 'em now!</div></div><hr />

I've been able to shrink a BL pet myself.  Just not my dog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ogre beastlord pets are shrinkable okay, cats dont seem to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can shrink cat pets once but their still rediculously huge max shrunk now when you got everyone shrunk down and in a tight squeeze.  Most annoying change verant has made recently (since they had the bug with huge pets) and theres just no reason to have done it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i was casting shrink and tiny companion all day yesterday on my beastlords kitty pet and I had no problems shrinking him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can shrink them one level, its just you used to be able to shrink them twice so they werent 6 times the size of a max shrunk player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There's nothing wrong with the shrink spells. The problem is that our dog pets are summoned at their minimum size already. It's like trying to shrink a gnome.<br />
<br />
As to why our pets were changed in that way, who the hell knows. I do know that I can grow mine to be taller than I am :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually it's the wolf form that can't be shrunk anymore. Our pets as well as druid and rangers wolf form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maybe if we're lucky for 20AA we'll be able to shrink them again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lol,,,,,,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">great, now new shamans are leveling up thinking that the pet isn't shrinkable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">great, now new shamans are leveling up thinking that the pet isn't shrinkable. Um, why would this be bad? It's not like this is some false rumour. personally, I love making them max size, although people seem to cast invis on me when I do that, can't imagine why  :D Same with bear form hehe. I do wish they tied your pets size to your size, would be very handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">More proof that Sony has forgotten about the shaman class...Once again we get screwed over.<br />
<br />
I demand a better slow and ability to shrink my pet!<br />
<br />
heh sorry I'm drunk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I do a /bug report on this every few days.  If we all keep doing it we might wear them down enough to fix it.    ;) <br />
<br />
(i also do a /feedback Please fix Rabidbear AA so it stacks with other buffs and does something useful)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hrm, haven't tried to shrink mine in a long time, but I remember back when I used to that the first cast would grow it slightly, and the next 2 would bring it down to rat size.   Most likely you've tried multiple casts already though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've been thinking this...i use to be able to make it really really small but no more...nothing happens when i try..so i amuse myself on raids by double growing all the halflings..in old models their heads are so big :D<br />
<br />
Well it amuses me anyway :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I bug-reported this, I want my small chincilla!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Um, why would this be bad?

<br />
because we've been able to shrink the dog for quite a while until recently. Its not really beneficial to have have a huge pet 100% of the time. 90% of the time I want my shrunk as small as he can go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I would like to be able to shrink my pet but I've never had a problem with my pet at normal size or had a group complain about it at normal size.  However, I've been in many groups where people wanted the BL's pet shrunk as much as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hell i remember casting grow on my pet and it turned into rat size instantly.</div></div><hr />
