<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently soloing wooly mammoths in Everfrost. They give wonderful experience (nearly a blue bubble at 24) and they con dark blue - yellow.<br />
<br />
My problem is when I cast spells. I have two different scenarios that happen. I have regen, SOW, strength buff, and a shield up.<br />
<br />
Scenario 1:<br />
<br />
Open with root<br />
Cast Envenomed breath<br />
Cast Affliction<br />
Re-apply root if necessary (usually not)<br />
Sit and med/canna dance<br />
When Envenomed breath runs out, reapply<br />
Cast Walking Sleep<br />
Wait for root to break and melee to death (Mob is usually well below half hit points at this point).<br />
Wash, Rinse, Repeat. <br />
<br />
I end up with nearly half of my mana and 3/4 of my hit points on average.<br />
<br />
Scenario 2:<br />
Open with root - RESIST<br />
Root again - Resist<br />
Mob closes and starts pounding on me<br />
Cast Walking sleep - usually sticks<br />
Cast root - finally sticks<br />
Back off<br />
Cast Envenomed breath - resist<br />
Cast again, resist <br />
Finally sticks<br />
Cast Affliction - resist<br />
resist again<br />
finally sticks<br />
Root breaks<br />
By this time I am almost OOM so I just melee the mob until he dies.<br />
<br />
I end up with about a red bubble of health left and no mana in this scenario.<br />
<br />
<br />
I usually split 50/50 between these scenarios - I'm either really lucky or really unlucky.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any thoughts or critique of my technique is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try this technic, forget about the rooting.<br />
<br />
Pull with Walking Sleep, Cast Envenomed breath as the mob is incoming, then cast Tainted Breath while meleeing, melee till death.<br />
<br />
For the Yellow cons use Affliction as incoming and cast EB and TB while Meleeing.<br />
<br />
Try this out and let me know the outcome.<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Forgot to mention, unless heavily twinked I would avoid the yellow cons, it really isnt worth the downtime and in the long run you will get more experience soloing the blue cons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't try to solo the yellows, and possibly the whites as well, as you'll get too many resists for it to be worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Don't root something and then try to drop two DoTs on it: more than likely you'll break the root. Ideally you (or a tank) should act as the root, but if you can't stand being beaten on by the Mammoths (they do hit very hard), pull with slow, cast Affliction and Envenomed Breath through the hits, and then root and back off. Assuming the root lasts a decent amount of time, you can then melee once it breaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another option is to use flash of light... ya the lvl 1 spell... It hardly every resists and then if  ya can't root it the mob is not going to attack right away. The only problem with this tactic is if there are any other mobs that may agro (and mammoths do assist one another)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The problem with Flash of Light is that you are just asking to be KS'ed when the mammy starts wandering off. Competition for mammy's is quite strong. Get a ranger friend and duo them. You should be able to go almost nonstop. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I moved my TB to page 50 once I got Lvl 19 DoT's. I have seen on this thread and others how people still use it in their 20's. I pulled it back, but not really seeing the benefit of it. Is it a mana efficency issue? Should it be used even once I get my Lvl 24 DoT's?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sorry, What I meant was Flash of Light, followed by root. Flash of Light usually does not last a long time and ya can bet the mob is really pissed when he's blinded.  <br />
  Usually, a mob comes attacks ya, root fails, flash of light, step back, it wanders away, ya root it and  ya can go back to root and rot method of kiting.<br />
<br />
Also, later in life ya add a puppy so that as long as ya have more agro than the puppy, it ignores him as he nips the mobs butt.. and like a nicely trained mob it returns to ya after flash of light wears off. (Pet kiting.)<br />
<br />
The main advantage of flash of light is it uses VERY little mana and because it is lvl 1 is hardly every resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for all the suggestions!!<br />
<br />
I've found that Walking Sleep slows the mob enough to land my DOTs (EB and Affliction) while engaged in melee.  I've been pretty successful standing toe to toe with the mammoths - but regen is pretty key. (Scurg's suggestion worked well :))<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm also curious to hear about tainted breath - is this spell still worth casting in addition to envenomed breath? Will they stack?<br />
<br />
Thanks again,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yes all poison and disease spells stack. The main question is how useful the damage is. As you get better poison and disease spells, the mobs have a lot more hp  and it is no longer practical to use some of the earlier ones. At most I would go back one earlier version.<br />
<br />
For example <br />
TB costs 40 mana and  gives at most 66 damage ( 10 dam intial,  8 x 7 (56) DOT)<br />
<br />
EB gives for 100 mana 212 damage max. ( 30 intial dam, 26 x 7 (182) DOT)<br />
<br />
Adding DB as a dot  will give  an additional 66 damage. So why do it?  Well the higher the spell the more it is resisted.  Whereas TB might stick and give full damage EB might get resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heres a tip:<br />
<br />
Pull your mammoths towards one of the ruined temples. If you get a root break, run around the outside of the temple staying close to the edge - the mammoth gets kinda &quot;stuck&quot; in the wall and its movement slows right down. You can easily cast a root or a dot without getting hit at all - it is even possible to snatch a tick or two of medding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have found if I am going to be casting more then 2 spells a nice debuff works wonders for helping get roots Poison Dots and Slows to all stick with a minume of resists.  Pull with a magic resist debuff and then follow with a root or DoT.  Will cut your resists by alot for those higher level creatures.  Also Flash of Light works wonders if you get in real trouble.  You can ussually keep flash of lighting them till you recover enough mana or HP to cast a higher level DoT, root, or Heal.  Has saved me many times I was too low on health to get the mob into run mode.</div></div><hr />
