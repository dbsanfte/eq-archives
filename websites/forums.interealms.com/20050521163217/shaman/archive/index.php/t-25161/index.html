<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Friday night, raids end early. 8pm EST. I spend half an hour afterwards in guild chat channel, asking for group. Never a single tell. I see groups form up all over the place. I see RSS groups move, I see MPG groups move. And I see beastlords in every damned one of them. I give up after half an hour and I log for the night.<br />
<br />
Log in this morning, spend 2 hours lfg. Never a bite. Log out.<br />
<br />
Log in this afternoon, spend an hour practically begging for a group, nothing. I even offer to join a fellow putting together an epic mob kill in Siren's Grotto, and get told &quot;sorry, we don't need you, but thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's the last straw. I just can't take this any more. MAYBE there was a brief moment when OoW came out when shaman were considered a valuable class again, because it was new terrain, and new mobs, and people were a bit afraid of things. But the zones are figured out now, and the mobs are figured out, and its gone right back to what it was with GoD, and with PoP before that....shaman are 5th wheels. Groups want DPS, DPS, and more DPS, and that's it. They expect me to MGB Wunshi and then give them Stamina at the end of the raid and then its &quot;see ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not going to WoW--I have no interest in a game that requires PvP. I'm not going to EQ2, because I have no reason to believe Sony will avoid the mistakes of EQ1--they sure as hell didn't when they put out SWG.<br />
<br />
So I guess I'm just gonna fade away, park Fuda in Halas one last time and listen to the wind howl as I log out.<br />
<br />
Its been quite a ride these past 5 years. A lot of it was worth it. But its ending with a whimper instead of a bang, and I regret that tremendously :(<br />
<br />
Be safe, everyone, and good luck in your travels.<br />

I say this.. because especially on my server, I've heard nothing about any shaman having problems finding a group (at least not ones that wanted one).  I've heard a few of my guildee beastlord whining about it.  And, I know that I have never not been asked to be part of something that I wanted to do, and I never had to be asked to leave because they didn't require my services and wanted a beastlord or chanter.<br />

Really, i'm not trying to diss on you, I'm just saying that normally in circumstances that I see like this, it's usually the person to blame.<br />

Good luck in real life though.  I'm sure that all of us at one time or another wish that we didn't have this thing called an addiction (me included).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What Valsuvious says is true.  If you had recently joined a guild, people might not want to group with you because they don't know you or they don't like how you play in groups.  I wouldn't group with a lot of people because of two main things: 1) AFKs or inaction 2) carelessness.  If you're appropriately geared for the zone, you can have any group makeup.  I duoed everything in WoS with a cleric, even the &quot;scary&quot; named that everyone would flee from.  It's an unfortunate consequence that guilds often break into cliques when it comes time to exp.  This even happens in WoW guilds right now.</div></div><hr />

I am on Bertoxx with Fudapuda(in different guilds who have competed in the past for the high end content)and I can tell you, I have always had respect for this player. It's a bummer Fuda is leaving the game, I wish you luck in RL.<br />
Get some sun.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sigh, Fuda. I honestly do not think the problem is the shaman class, I think its the lack of players overall. I usually have very little trouble getting groups, but if I do, then I make my own. Shaman ARE a ton more powerful in OoW. BLs cannot replace us in RS or deep MPG, where resists are regular, and I generally need Malos to land Nihil or I get waxxed. <br />
<br />
And for you people suggesting its a skill issue, I can asure you its not. Fuda is one of the top Shaman in one of the Top guilds on Bertoxx, well respected by other guilds as well as the shaman community overall. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Fuda, I hate to say this, but give WoW a shot. Reports are amazing. I dont think the PvP thing is gonna pan out in the end. I fully expect Blizzard to down-play that end of the game, in favor of the more popular PvE. So take a month or 2, try a new game, and maybe, if that doesnt grab you, come on back to EQ and see whats what. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think Shaman are easily back on the &quot;map&quot; as far as group value goes. I have reasonable DPS with a mage-toyed doggie and new spells, I have excellent healing with new AA, new items and new spells, I have some of the best new buffs in the game.  Hang in there Fuda. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sigh, it's sad to see the Crucible fall to the state where the Old Guard isn't even recognized anymore. Fuda's been around as long as I have, since the begining. His skill is top notch and he was one of the ones making everyone go &quot;wow, I never knew a shaman could do something like that&quot;.  It'll be sad to see ya' go, but I agree with Blazz, give it a bit of time. Populations are low and it will probably be a couple of months before it shakes out, but when it does I think the game will be better off than before. We're loosing all the impatient and immature players right now. When things settle out I think the player base will be a lot more like it was back in Kunark or earlier and in the end the folks you play with are what make the game so much fun. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Doma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for the last two posts guys, much better than I would have put it about fuda, I wrote a really angry post about ppl making assumptions about other people playing ability then deleted cos I didnt think it was worth the hassle. Like fuda I am having similar problems but I am signed for another 6 months :(<br />
<br />
remember ASSUME = ASS U &amp; ME<br />
<br />
So dont go around assuming how people play cos  unless you know them or seen them play you will look as dumb as your post when people correct you about the person.<br />

<br />
What I am saying, is that since GoD came out, you have prob seen 10k posts on these forums about some shaman mentioning how hard it's been for him to get a group.  It doesn't matter if you have have 10 clerics in the guild and only 3 of them are able to get a group at any time.  Not to mention the chanter who can't get a group in a zone where charm isn't available.  Or the warrior who can't get a group cause he has to fight the other six warriors in the guild for a group, not to mention the six other tank classes who also need a group.  What about the SK or Paladin who had almost no chance of fighting for a group cause the IKk group trial named were too hard for them to tank.<br />
<br />
Point is, that most of the time I see people whining about how they can't get a group, is because the person themselves aren't very good at playing their class.  This is true I think especially for some during GoD trials.  I never had a problem ever getting a group.  I was the first person on the server to finish up Tipt/Vxed and all the Ikk group stuff.  The three other shaman in my guild were in the top 10 of getting it done as well.  Never once did I hear of them, me, or anyone in the other guilds on my server at that point have problems ever getting a group.  Most talked about how they had to go anon sometimes cause they would leave crap groups for better ones. :)<br />
<br />
I do know we had some problems as a class, and I have prob defended SoE more than the average person, but all is not lost.  I guess that I'm just a fan of making due with what is given to you, and I have done that with my shaman and I will continue to do so.<br />
<br />
edit:  oh, just to mention.  Whenever i see someone in my guild taking about not finding a group, I ask them a few questions.  95% of the time, they haven't bothered trying to put one together, they just expected one to fall into their lap.  You gotta be proactive at times if you really want a group.  <br />
<br />
last.. wtheck is this old guard thing.  A person has been around 2 years and they are considered old guard?  Even is a person has been playing since beta, it doesn't mean that they know everything there is about the game.  I have a few people I know that have had the game for five years, but that doesn't mean that they know more than some of the newer people.  A person's knowledge only goes as far as to their actual experience in the game and how much they have read.  A person can easily get 800 AAs sitting in BoT without knowing what kind of mobs are in tactics.  I have a new shaman recruit for my guild with absolutely no raiding experience, 100AAs, and 4k hps and yet, I would put his knowledge/skill level in the top 5% of any shaman that i've ever talked to/had contact with.  Overall, all that it means is that some people are proactive and learn alot in a short amount of time, while others can be around forever and haven't learned much (as a young shaman, i spent a solid 5 hours a day reading the crucible, figuring out where solo/group at, reading what mobs I could fight, reading what things I could raid when I got to a level I could do that at.. etc.).  I thirsted for knowledge and it wasn't until the last year after I hit PoTime that I really realized that I didn't have anything that I hadn't read or figured out on my own yet.<br />
<br />
sorry... didn't mean to derail the thread.. went off on my own little rant :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Onto the trials. I'm not talking about the Tipt/Vxed trials. Let's be honest, a chanter/cleric combo can beat both of them easily. I'm talking about the Ikk trials. A cleric/shaman cannot keep a main tank alive in these. If they end up able to, then I guarantee you this is a 2500+ 12.5k hp tank, with some huge dps. However, how ideal is this situation. How often do I see groups that need a cleric/shaman to heal? I'll put it this way, I'm the only shaman in my guild right now that has more than one trial done. The other shaman that has them done.. finished it because it was him and I and a cleric healing on trial 2 (before the recent nerfage). Ask TR how many of their shamans have more than 1 trial done? Bet you that it's none. But why is this? It's because we cannot heal, nor can we provide quick dps, without us being the tanks. Sure, when I passed ikk trial 1 I did 85% of the damage to the mob. However, this was before she summoned, and I countered all my dmg by zoning in and out every two dots.<br />

****, can you say owned by your own words?<br />
<br />
It's funny. I remembered this, because when I read that post over at the Cleric forums, I had long finished up all 3 Ikkinz trials with the famous Shaman/Cleric(me using Tnarg's and him using the PoP spell Supernal Light btw) combo and I was one of the most vocal Shaman on this board explaining and ranting about what was wrong with our class, independently from the Ikkinz trials, while you and Jinheim were the &quot;Shamans are fine&quot; voices till the you hit this wall.<br />
<br />
I remember Jinheim posting how he'd not be getting group invites from his guildmates for Ikkinz trials because Shamans weren't needed they said and since he wasn't going to invest any more time in EQ, he quit. At about the same time you fessed up to how our class faired over at the Cleric boards in form of that post and I was surprised you were actaully seeing the light back then, but I guess a few months down the road your memory blurred and you came up with that bull**** above.<br />
<br />
Sorry, mate, I have no problem with you personally, I just don't like people trying to be elitist when they obviously are not. Hypocrisy sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I dont think there is a single person that can claim Shaman weren't extremely poor during the Gates era. I had a lot of difficulty getting through the trials, because I just didnt get invites. Hence, I had to make my own groups, and ended up failing a number of times, mostly do to inexperience, occasionally due to bad luck, but almost always the inadequacies of our class were a contributing factor. <br />
<br />
With the release of OoW, however, we were given a significant upgrade, especially when compared to other classes. OoW didnt &quot;100%&quot; fix us, for certain, but at this point, the problems we have with our class are similar to the problems that other classes are facing. I especially think that we got a BIG jump toward the BLs, because Nihil is so strong, and many mobs in OoW has good resists. No BL is gonna be slower in a lot of places in PG, RS, etc, unless there is a mage in the group to de-buff. They will die from resisted slows, and very often. Personally, I dont even bother trying to &quot;get away with&quot; just Nihil in those places, prefferring the safer &quot;Malos on INC, Nihil on engauge&quot; method, and the reason for this is the ONE thing that we are hurting for that Giac and I can agree on, emergency survival. <br />
<br />
I honestly think all classes are in this same &quot;hard to find groups&quot; boat. I see every class in my guild complaining about it at one time or another. Much of OoW is rather forgiving group-wise. Adequately gered Rangers can tank nameds in WoS and RCoD. Pallys and SKs are usually OK for nameds in PG. And not &quot;super uber&quot; geared players either. With EP level stuff dropping regularly in OoW, and Time-Ikky level stuff dropping in PG trials and RS, the gap between the &quot;average raider&quot; (not top 3 guilds, but like me, farming Time, maybe at the end off EPs, working through Ikky, etc) and the non-raiders is closing. There are a couple of recruits and new members of my guild that have 3-5 PG Trial items each, and they arent even EP flagged, much less Time flagged. <br />
<br />
It will be like this for a while. Someone on anotehr thread mentioned that it will probably get worse when Christmas comes and people get EQ2 and WoW in their stockings, or new computers that will run new games better, or new console and hand-held stuff, or whatever. I agree with that theory, but I am not sure SOE will respond for a while. We will have to see, but until SOE starts merging servers (which would be an &quot;admission&quot; of sorts, of the decline) we are going to have to be more flexible, and more pro-active about groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gonna have to disagree with you here, Blazz--I see it happening every day on Bertox. Tiegar gets groups, Brutel gets groups, Fuda doesn't get groups, Talabax doesn't get groups. I mean come on, Talabax holds title from Best of the Best tourneys on Bertox in the past year, he's beaten everyone who would show up to fight, and yet he posted on our own internal boards that he's not logging in because he &quot;can't find anything to do&quot; at the moment. But I see beastlords as the ONLY slower in RSS groups and MPG groups every day. Its definitely going on in my guild, at any rate. We routinely have 3-5 beasts logged on and all in groups, while the 1-3 shaman sit in PoK and go begging, except when jerks send us tells asking us to run all the way to RSS just to buff their groups.<br />
<br />
Anyhow: I reached a compromise with my guild leaders--I'll play Fud on raids IF we need a shaman (as yesterday, I was the only shaman online for entire Time raid--our guild is down from 6 regularly played shaman to typically 1, sometimes 2 now, which I think supports my contention that OoW is turning out to be a bust), but I'm not going to run Fud as my &quot;main&quot; any more; I guilded my lvl 41 warrior yesterday, and I two-box him with my 33 cleric now. I'll be leveling the two of those up in my &quot;exp&quot; time for the foreseeable future, and using Fud basically as a buff bot for DC raids only. At least I don't quit playing entirely, that way, and hopefully I'll rediscover some FUN in the game.<br />
<br />

I guess this is why I am not seeing it. We have 1-2 BLs who are only semi-active, at best, yet we have a solid 6 shaman that raid at over 75%. But honestly, I will put myself up against a BL in RSS all day. I bring a &quot;different&quot; package to the table, but my DPS isnt horrible anymore, and my healing can be critical. Basically, Fuda, it sucks that the people have a &quot;min-max&quot; philosophy. <br />
 I was the only shaman online for entire Time raid--our guild is down from 6 regularly played shaman to typically 1, sometimes 2 now, which I think supports my contention that OoW is turning out to be a bust)<br />
Heh, no wonder Call was being so friendly with me, LOL. But I dunno, I got an RSS group with your guildies just last week, and when I had to leave, Talabax took my spot. But I do have to concede the point that, once again, we arent &quot;the best option&quot; in some situations. Perhaps its different with your guild, being quite a bit more advanced gear-wise than us. I dont see many in my guild going anywhere NEAR RSS without a Shaman. <br />
And btw, Blazz, have you looked in your inventory since last night...?  :)<br />
OMG YOUR KIDDING!! WOO! Been a good 10-12 Saryrns now that I was the ONLY Shaman who didnt have a TA, and the bish wouldnt cough one up! Heh, Call said he would hook me up if they had one rotting.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'll certainly admit that I'm picky about groups, so to some extent I impose self-limits. I avoid pickup groups if at all possible, and I even avoid grouping with some members of my own guild who I know have skills too weak for the area they are trying to exp in--I just don't see the point in spending 30% of my time (or more) doing CR. <br />
<br />
And part of the problem is just basic burnout, too. There aren't too many hurdles left to leap any more--11k HP, 9k mana, 500 AAs, all leader AAs maxxed, 1750 tradeskiller (plus a baby gnome tinker at 231 presently), more cash in the bank than I could ever spend. I guess I'm just less and less tolerant than I used to be. But I still think my initial point stands: There are two &quot;basic&quot; approaches to grouping (If you'll allow me to be reductivist for a moment)--you either construct a group &quot;offensively&quot; or &quot;defensively&quot;. <br />
<br />
Defensively designed groups are great for shaman--your intent is to minimize the effective damage to the group, and shaman are great at that: we have nice buffs for it, we can heal, and we can Slow, root, CC, etc. Lots of defensive tools. <br />
<br />
Any time a new expansion comes out, there is going to be a period of time when most groups will be constructed around that defensive model, because players are naturally cautious in unfamiliar territory. You don't know how the mobs will react, you don't know what environmental variables will affect you, you haven't tested escape strategies thoroughly. Defensive is the optimal approach.<br />
<br />
But as time passes, and players learn the lay of the land, they shift attitude to a more offensive approach to group design. Increase DPS at the expense of damage mitigation, because they've learned the tolerances of the area. This is also natural, since increased DPS, if it doesn't cost you in other ways, increases exp per time period, and loot per time period spent exping. <br />
<br />
And shaman just don't scale well in the offensive approach. We CAN'T bring to the table what most other classes can. YES, we are better off in this regard with OoW than we were in GoD, and arguably better than we were during PoP, but it isn't enough. The tolerances of MPG and RSS just aren't narrow enough to argue for our presence. And so, we lose out on group spots to those who can bring &quot;most&quot; of what we bring (or else it can be purchased in PoK--i.e. paying for buffs before you leave) but can also bring that higher DPS that the offensive mindset requires.<br />
<br />
And then, to drive the nail in the coffin, you have the groups like I saw in RSS this weekend, which had a shaman bot they dragged along and camped at the camp spot. Stay there all day, just log the shaman in long enough to buff when somebody dies, or when the buff wears off. Heaven forbid we actually open up a group slot for somebody who actually plays that class as a main, when we can bot the buffs instead.<br />
<br />
All in all, I'm just angry at the continuing marginalization of our class. I'm sure I'll get over it with time, but my three-month assessment of OoW is that it didn't fix our problems, all it did was postpone them for a few weeks, until people had figured out once again that we weren't going to be valuable to them in the min/max game EQ has become.<br />

<br />
Not really, in there I said nothing about how long it took for those other shaman to finish, nor did I mention in the cleric post when people in my guild (especially the shaman) finished up the trials compared to everyone else. <br />
<br />
Most of my argument on the cleric boards, was because the clerics had a problem with the new shaman heal saying that we would replace them (same argument everytime a new heal gets introduced).<br />
<br />
Anyways, I rarely feel the need to get into arguments with people, simply because i'm sure if you dwell deep enough, you will prob might many times where I contridicted myself a little bit.  Mostly cause some of my points that I post tend to go with the current times.  Some of the stuff that I posted on the shaman boards were influenced by how we as shaman were feeling back in the day.<br />
<br />
I will stand by my side and say that I was wrong in saying that we shaman we totally fine during GoD, however, I will say that while we had some problems, I don't think that hope was as lost as most people who posted thought.<br />
<br />
Really, most of the fight with shaman in GoD was over my complete disgust at the state of these boards.  It was extremely depressing to come here every day and hear only people talking about how they couldn't find a group and their friend who was a beastlord could find a group whenever they wanted.  It didn't matter if you didn't know the difference between canni and turgor's, if you couldn't find a group or had trouble with something in the game, it was all SoEs fault cause &quot;SHAMAN SUCK right now&quot;.  I know I share this sentiment with a lot of people.<br />
<br />
Guess that I, unlike many other people, tend to try to look at the bright side of the picture no matter what.  Even if something sucks, it's always worse somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

I'm telling you, that there are alot of places where you can function as the slower and as dps.  I continually in RS groups average 350+ dps (not including pet) on every fight.  Although my dps usually starts the few seconds after slow hits, overall I still do a ton of dmg.<br />
<br />
going to post some parsings sometime when I get a chance to show some people where shaman could be right now in terms of dps on some mobs.  I truely feel that we bring a lot to a group that might not be known simply because we aren't pushing ourselves to our fullest extent sometimes.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure I'll get over it with time, but my three-month assessment of OoW is that it didn't fix our problems, all it did was postpone them for a few weeks, until people had figured out once again that we weren't going to be valuable to them in the min/max game EQ has become.<br />

Honestly Fuda, I am not trying to disagree with you here, but one point I am trying to make is that there are a TON of otehr classes in the same exact boat we are. The min-maxers will always find that &quot;perfect&quot; scenario for a group in any situation, and we are just one of 12 other classes that dont fit it. The whole point I am trying to make is that we are MUCH better, not totally fixed, but MUCH better. <br />
<br />
Before OoW, we required emergency attention or faced the death of the class. Now, there are 10 other classes in this same boat, and without completely changing the game, I guess I will live with it. I dont need a warrior tank, a cleric healer, or a rogue DPS in every single group I make.</div></div><hr />
