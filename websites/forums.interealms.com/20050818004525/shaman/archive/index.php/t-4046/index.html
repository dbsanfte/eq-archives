<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know anything about making UI skins and such but was wondering if someone could make something like this for me:<br />
<br />
Name          HP/HP<br />
Surname<br />
HP Bar HP %<br />
Mana Bar Mana %<br />
Pet HP Bar Pet HP %<br />
Stamina bar<br />
Exp bar Exp %<br />
AAxp bar aaxp %<br />
<br />
And I'd like the bars to be one solid color. What I mean is, sometimes people put in like a background color and a foreground color(like the exp bar...orange=background,blue-foreground.)  All of them with the exceptions of the exp bars of course :p<br />
<br />
Also, if someone could do the same kinda thing for group bars (solid color hp bar, with hp % off to the side. And maybe the bottom half of the bar be a pet hp for those who have pets). Was checking around and didn't see any but I probably missed them. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
So far I haven't figured out much about this stuff but I'll keep trying :(</div></div><hr />
