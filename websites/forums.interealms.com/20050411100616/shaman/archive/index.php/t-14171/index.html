<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Impact</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if it is possible to change my &quot;screen&quot; name on here.  I used impact for a login  becasue that is what I use for everything but would like it to show up as Lilce, my shamans name.  <br />
<br />
I know on some forum's hey have a feature where your name that you post with is different then your login.  Is this not possible on this forum or am I over looking something?  I would just recreat my account but usually it won't let you do that becasue you can't have more then one account per e-mail address.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
