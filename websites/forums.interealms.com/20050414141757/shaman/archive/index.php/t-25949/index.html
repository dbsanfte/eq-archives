<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Cross posting from the EQLive boards (link below) to ensure the shaman community is aware of what I consider to be a fairly major bug at the high end of our game and to request the assistance of our class representative.<br />
<br />
Since the Dragons of Norrath patch any time keys combined (Quintessence of the Elements) do not work. I mean, they DO NOT LET YOU INTO TIME!<br />
<br />
What was to be an exciting climax to my last year of effort has been doused with an expansion release bug affecting content not even remotely related. Instead I've been standing outside of time begging for pushes from those who combined their keys pre-DoN. My newly time flagged guild has fairly significant percentage affected so it's crippling our ability to progress.<br />
<br />
I've done the requisite /bug /petition /report with no response and if you note the thread below on Sony's own boards, they have not responded there either.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure who the current class representative is but I hope this post will get your attention. If you have any avenue to pressure SOE into taking some action (or at least an acknowledgement of our plight) it would be greatly appreciated.<br />

Newly flagged, since the DoN patch, characters cannot zone into Plane of Time  (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=tech&amp;message.id=86282)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Um, are you guys just trying to zone straight in through the dial?  When you go into Time the right way, you have to take the story route through PoI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It may just be the cynic in me, but I'd bet rl $ that this whole guild is going to have a big ol' foot in the mouth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah, forgot to /cast dispell the naysayers.<br />
<br />
This is a problem affecting multiple guilds on my server and if you take a moment to read the posts on the EQLive thread you'll note it is across servers.<br />
<br />
I personally have spoken the Librarian in PoK. Seen the Seer (though I'm not sure why since I'm completely flagged), who does nothing. Gone through the factory in PoI. Popped over to the Machine that ports you into time for the first time. Hailed the Librarian again, tried to zone into time:<br />
<br />
&quot;You do not meet the requirements for this zone.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have tried with my Quintessence in inventory, in hand, equipped in range. I have tried clicking the sundial also (but that shouldn't work anyway till I zone through PoI). I have been pushed into time, disbanded raid and get promptly booted.<br />
<br />
While I understand your desire to be cynical, I do not think this is a &quot;whole guild is going to have a big ol' foot in the mouth&quot; issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Odd.  None of our recently flagged members have any problems zoning in to Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Although this in no way makes any difference to me personally the whole Time issue and the subsequent replies from GMS and the posts on the Sony board show me one thing<br />
<br />
SoE communications still stink (not commenting on CS just communication).<br />
This to some people is a MAJOR bug,i know if id been flagging for Time and eventually got it id be pissed off to find this bug.<br />
Now if a GM doesnt know its a bug why blame it on the player not having all his flags.<br />
Can you get the QoE to zone into Time without doing some flags ?.(Honest question ive got no idea).<br />
If the GM doesnt know 100% then why not tell the player &quot;ok ill look into it for you and get back to you&quot; etc.<br />
Theres 2 pages of posts on the SoE boards spanning 2 days and not 1 dev or SoE employee has posted saying &quot;this is not a bug&quot; or &quot; there is a bug&quot; or even &quot;we're looking into this to determine if its a bug or not&quot; instead they again seem to ignore the problem hoping it will go away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well, there has been a HUGE bug with ALL of the planes since DoN patch, SPECIFICALLY Time, and instanced versions of encounters.<br />
<br />
I don't know what they are doing about it, but I do know that they know it is a bug.<br />
<br />
My guild was bugged on our first weekly time run after DoN patch, we had a GM observe the problem we were having, we got into time and got bugged again at P1. they are aware there is a bug, however I can't say what they are doing about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">there has been a serious bug with time since (it seems to me) before DoN when zoning into the instance (P1 specifialy).  It locks out half the raid from thier trials.  The zoning into time using the QoE hasnt been a problem for us because we've been time since before OoW/DoN, and people with the looted time key havn't had any problems getting in.  <br />
<br />
And to answer the question of, can you get into time without having all your flags?  I belive so, all you have to kill to get into time would be M. Arbitor of Earth (for earth B since you cant draft into there), then the 4 gods for thier time peices.  I belive the other gods are just for Access to EPs so you can get to the gods.  I could be wrong, but I think that's how it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Today you can enter time a few different ways.<br />
*Kill all tier 1-3 planar progression mobs and get their flags, then go kill the 4 elementals.<br />
*Kill the 4 elemental bosses (killing each one gives you a key to their zone), combine their 4 items into your time key, enter through poi.<br />
*Get gimped in with people who can already access time.<br />
*Obtain the alternate key via joining a time raid and looting the key from phase 2 or 3 (I forget which phases it actually drops).<br />
<br />
***the way you use the alternate key (looted from various Time mobs) is to have it on your cursor and click on the Time dial.<br />
<br />
I still want to kill Fennin Ro to finish my original PoP progression, but I don't need to because I looted the alternate key.<br />
<br />
You no longer NEED to kill the planar progression tier 1-3 mobs. You no longer need to kill the 4 elemental bosses either. But you still can. Conceivably you can get level 45 toons into Time by going with a Time raid and looting the alternate key.<br />
<br />
As for your problem with P1 where some people can't zone into the instanced zones, everyone must be off of their mounts. No one can be on a mount inside the instanced zone. As soon as one person summons a mount, it will block anyone else from entering that one instanced zone (but will not affect the other instanced areas). So have everyone zone in without a mount and do not summon the mount until everyone is inside. Try that and see if it fixes your issue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's been possible ever since they added raid-flagging (the original 85% rule) to make a Time key without doing Planar Progression.  The flag for Time is independent of the progression quest, only needs the 4 &quot;god shields.&quot;  I know several apps and many bots who became flagged for PoTime in this fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hugebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We had issues in PoTime last night<br />
<br />
All groups were set to zone into T-1, 3 groups of 18<br />
When it was time to click in.... it only let 18 people zone in at a time<br />
<br />
Imagin 3 trials with only 6 people in each trial, It makes it a little tuff heheh to say the least<br />
<br />
Well, we survived.  We killed VZ &amp; TZ, but when it was time to do Saryrn the lag monster ate us when she was at 50%, the entire zone froze till we all got booted....<br />
<br />
After a bit our corpses started to popping to the GY.... :(<br />
<br />
There were a few that were able to rez up on T-4... but this was all for not because the rest of the guild was locked out due to the fact that we were bugged, PoTime thought that there was another guild doing time... there was, it was us, but we were locked out.  #$%^&amp;!<br />
<br />
The good news is we will have lots up on our next raid night<br />

This happens to us every damn time we raid Time.  We /ooc /auction /rs /guild /shout kill your pets, your familiars, and your mounts, and everyone does it.  Still, at every trial zone in like 5 people are stuck outside chain clicking the dial to get in for a good 5 minutes.  Gives some message about not meeting the requirements of the zone.  REALLY annoying.  We've had this same problem for months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if its server specific?  I'm on Luclin, and none of our folks have trouble getting into time.<br />
<br />
We do, however, have some difficulty zoning into the p1-p2 parts, but we solved that.  Since the instance is limited to 3 groups, we discovered that if people only click once each, they have a better chance at getting in.  If all 18 click twice, only 9 or so got in, and you had to wait for the instance to realize that those 18 clicks did NOT = 18 people.<br />
<br />
There is also a separate known issue with zones freezing/crashing.  It appears to do with buff slots.  In Qvic, Natimbi, etc.. if you have full buff slots, and an npc AE's something, it has been known to cause the zone to crash.  There is an eqlive post from the devs about it.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So for us, the /ooc /shout when raiding is:  &quot;Make sure you have at least FOUR buff slots free&quot;, &quot;make sure you click any instance or zi stone only ONCE&quot;.  &quot;If you don't get in, wait 30 seconds, and then click ONCE again&quot;.  Thats kept the majority of our raids crash/bug free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Man, Sheep of Luclin are really nice guys.  When our guildies can't get in, we point &amp; laugh (think Simpsons), yell at them, and generally give them hell and raise a stink.  Oh, and we never ever provide guidance to apps/newbies.  Ever.  There's a pretty firm belief in the &quot;push them out of the nest&quot; method of flying instruction in Silent Resurgence :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shammygirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">THis has been a huge issue, if you read the link you can see that, theres liek 4 different threads on the eqlive website about it too, affecting severeal guilds gamewide, across several servers.<br />
<br />
I have it on good authority that this will be fixed within the next week...check the threads the post is there...finally...my guild leader posted it on our guild website also, as it is affecting some of us as well.<br />
<br />

 Ok, this issue has been fixed on Test and will go live sometime between now and next week. When it is fixed, everyone with their Quintessence that isn't able to get into Plane of Time will need to click the time machine again to get a character flag.<br />
<br />

Lets hope, My guild started giving the alt key to flagged peeps who were bugged to ease VFing since SoE was not even acknowledging this.</div></div><hr />
