<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My main character is a lvl 51 shaman.  I have recently been playing a lot in some of the harder areas then where I hunted in the 40s and have noticed the need to upgrade my gear.  My questions are...<br />
<br />
   I am currently wearing a Worked Dragonhorn Bracer (good enough in my opinion) and a Chipped Bone Bracelet (crappy).  Any recommendations on the second bracer? I am not rich and have been eyeing the Coldain Military Wristguard but would like some suggestions.  I also hunt a decent amount in UP so i could try for bracelet of sense or fortitude, although I got no idea how rare they are.<br />
  <br />
   My second question is about my BP.  I am currently wearing Ceremonial Iksar Breastplate and I really enjoy the regen but I am beginning to wonder if I shouldn't just get something with more ac/hp since the regen isn't that much....any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you could post a magelo I'm sure you could get a lot of suggestions.  You can look in Karnor's for a Supple Scale Armband... not great but I think it's an improvement from Chipped Bone.  Coldain Wristguard is good too if you can get it<br />
<br />
Also, the regen really is nice on the bp.  I wouldn't really consider upgrading unless you can get an Emerald Dragonscale Tunic (from killing woushi or bought, I'd only switch if you need the wisdom badly) or if you can get a quest bp from one of the velious cities, anything lower quality than that and I'd say the regen is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's my profile currently, I am working on upgrading my rings as well but I think I know what to get for them, although suggestions are always welcome.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, if you have read any of the posts, you should know that we are going to tell you to ditch your wis gear and get some ac/hp. So, here goes:<br />
<br />
Some cheap upgrades are bs electrum ears, velium fire rings, go for barbed rubi bracers on both wrists or possibly a bracer of fortitude. Velium bs neck gives nice hp as well as some mana, crystal spider eyes, slime covered rubicite coif, quest or hardened grey flesh arms, shimmering terrorhide cloak, brown chitin or quest legs, barbed dragon booties.<br />
<br />
You will find that most of these upgrades are actually pretty cheap. You will also keep a decent wis level, and get some raw mana while gaining some ac and a ton of much needed hp. <br />
<br />
You dont need to switch our your bp, unless you can get a fungi. You need to switch your mindset when looking at gear.<br />
<br />
I really dont see why people come here with the same wis profiles over and over and post that they aren't performing as well as they thing they should. There is a reason that we say go with hp/ac over wis and it is because it makes you a much better shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Those upgrades cheap? Hehe, bracer of fortitute alone sells for 14-17K on my server.  Guess it's all relative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's not that I am in the wis mindset, it's just that when I was lower level I was, and now I am trying to get out of it.  I am not rich so it's not been an easy process...thanks for the suggestions.<br />
Honestly I have noticed a big improvement in what i have been doing with just a couple switches so a few more changes will get me in good shape I think.</div></div><hr />
