<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sevenkilts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any nice experiences here? What are the challenges you all found to solo as an Oracle? My standings to Yeldema are 3 to 0 for me. (Self buffed only). However, I use a support group that handles eventual adds. I tried Hechaeva and Mazi each once and got them to 20 percent, then had an add and my support group was slacking and acted too late. I know that Lodizal was successfully shaman soloed on 7th Hammer but I don't have the patience to camp him.<br />
Post your challenges here. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I've done Vraptin, Mazi, Yeld, Hecheva, and the one near Yeld that I can't remember the name of! I think any of the nesters that don't flux would be doable. Just important to have a couple clicky items~<br />

Guess I didn't really answer your question....but that's cos I'm looking for a challenge too. :&quot;)</div></div><hr />
