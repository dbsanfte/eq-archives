<br />
Would be neat to own one i think, the stats were kinda good on it as well.<br />
<br />
Also one more question, are there any good quest bows after the raincaller? I see alot of nice Luclin quests, but none for a nice bow. There is even a quest out that results a 20 wis shield. Lets hope there is one and no one has found it yet.<br />

You need to be on Giant faction to do it, and since the quest giver also drops the bow when you kill him, most folks don't really bother, least from what I've seen.  I believe its actually easier to kill him than to kill the wurm that you need to whomp for the quest piece, but not having done it I could not say.<br />
<br />
Other than that, if you want an upgrade you are stuck looking for a high end player made bow or a bow from Dragon Necropolis, although decent bows also drop in the Hole and OS (Bow of the Underfoot and Windsaber, respectively).  Player made Compound Shadewood bow ends up a bit better than a Raincaller in ratio, although it has no stat mods, and I am pretty darn happy with mine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just kill gleed ;p much easier.</div></div><hr />

difficulty the quest would require you to be about lvl 50, and with today's mudflation you're looking at 25/35 200-250rng, 10str 10dex and 6-10ac.  psst, verant, i'm talking to you =P.<br />
<br />
2 more things... what is fleeting quiver haste? i've heard 60%, i've heard 20... figured someone on this board should know.<br />
<br />
and verant... have you ever considered having quivers with stats or effects?  maybe that would be too hard, unless the ability to negate an item's effect due to class was already enabled.  heck, most folks would use up a general inventory slot for a 10 to all resists quiver, even if they couldn't use arrows.  no, nm, scratch that, runs into too many problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do agree whole heartidly, there should be another bow, to continue on the trushot-raincaller line. That would be awesome.<br />
<br />
Where did you get the blow gun? it says it can be bought in stores, no i dea where to go to get it. Just want one for the novelty, and one of those cross bows from Thurg, but i hear there no rent. <br />
<br />
After the Bow of the Huntsman, what should i be looking for in a Bow? Velium, shaded compound, windsaber, or Bow of the Underfoot? All these should be easy accesable to me.<br />
<br />
Doesnt seem to be anything more out there to get thats good to use without going to TOV or Sleepers, and there out of reach for me right now. <br />

<br />
karlac, if you're in a guild that's beaten the vindicator (or is roughly that level of power) you should look into getting a bow of doom from the umbral plains, drops off doomshade, 33/35 with stats, only known bow with a unique graphic.  on par with the AoW bow's dmg output when you've got the 10 dmg arrows and EQ.  primal is better, but hey, what can ya do.<br />
<br />
that, or look into buying a DN bow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Purifyre</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I grabbed it from a merchant in the shortie area of Shadowhaven - I originally thought it was a Twilight Sea quest item but it had full weapon stats on it with the exception of what class/race could use it.. I kept it in the bank in case it might get fixed in the future but so far it hasn't..  I don't know what mob drops it sorry :(  It appeared to be something a player had sold to the merchant rather than a regular merchant sold item..</div></div><hr />

The equip for it was None/none though like mentioned above.</div></div><hr />
