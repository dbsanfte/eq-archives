<br />
Looking for a full time raiding guild? Then this is not the guild you are looking for. Instead, try this one http://www.circleofeternity.org/ <br />
<br />
The majority of KOE is comprised of mature gamers who have RL responsiblities but still find the time to log on, kill stuff, and have a great time together. We average 2 to 3 raid events per week with smaller events in between dependent on circumstances.<br />
<br />
While the majority of us live in North America, across all time zones, we have a players in Europe and Australia. You can find keepers on line 24/7.<br />
We do not seek specific classes but we do welcome new people into our family of friends.<br />
<br />
We wear our tag with pride and do not grant it lightly. As such, KoE uses a recruit process. <br />
<br />
To become a KoE recruit, players must meet the following criteria:<br />
<br />
The player must be at least Level 55<br />
The player must be a registered member of this message board (please complete the email confirmation)<br />
A KoE guild member must request recruit status for the player.<br />
<br />
To become a member of KoE, players must meet or exceed the following criteria:<br />
<br />
The player is a current KoE Recruit<br />
The player is at least Level 59<br />
The player must demonstrate skill in their class and the ability to perform in a raid environment<br />
The player must display social and communication skills compatible with KoE values and standards<br />
The player must read, understand and agree to compy with our charter http://www.interealms.com/koe/charter.html<br />
The player must obtain a KoE sponser<br />
<br />
It is not easy to become a keeper, but the journey is well worth the efforts. <br />
Thank you for your time and interest in Keepers of the Elements</div></div><hr />
