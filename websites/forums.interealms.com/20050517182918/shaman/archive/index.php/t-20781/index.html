the mighty Brenlo speaks.<br />
<br />
<br />
clear as usual of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">which either means,<br />
(1) nothing will happen as usual, or<br />
(2) they'll nerf the wrong thing<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if the extent of that balancing is removing ht/lb/mb, fixing snare and horses, etc. it'll never happen because nobody running the show has a clue about what pvp really is.<br />
<br />
Really it boils down to this.  Sony has absolutely no clue how to balance classes on blue servers, can we really expect them to fix class balance on red servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frogy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haha so true. They will prolly just make it so you need better resists to resist stuff again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bards will be given mb/lb/dt the damage cap will be removed from dt and the spell repop times will be removed from spears. all characters will have perma crimson potion effects. bard mez will no longer be broken by damage delt to the mez'd player. rangers will be even further nerfed with the removal of eq and a cap place on the aim aa's at aim1.<br />
malo/malos will no longer land in pvp.<br />
only evil chanters will be able to tash other players,<br />
<br />
this is my prediction for e</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Two big things need to be fixed in PvP (I'm a bluebie so when I say PvP I mean dueling or just arena brawls).<br />
<br />
1)  Interrupts.  I have gotten to the point where I just decline duels from any melee.  Knights are the worst because they have bash - the absolute worst is a knight with that stupid runic proc axe.  Not only does it take me five tries to channel a spear of torment, it only hits him for like 100 damage which is absorbed by the rune (which procs again immediately).  Not being able to channel spells due to some knight just hitting autoattack and bash is probably the most frustrating thing I have ever encountered in EQ.  Any time I duel a knight with EP plus gear, it takes me at least half an hour to kill him or just give up.  I get bashed and stunned over and over and over again and there is nothing I can do to counter it.  Dueling and losing is ok.  Dueling and losing because you can't even cast a spell is not ok - its annoying.  Oh yeah - beastlord pets.  These are even more annoying because you can't joust them.  I've been playing FPS games for years so I can literally run circles around most players and buy myself a second or two to get a headstart on a cast, but against a beastlord's warder, I can't do this.  It autotracks and you can't get it off you.  It just stands there quadding and bashing you, while the beastlord quads and kicks you.  Fortunately they don't do too much damage or there's no way a bst would ever lose a duel.<br />
<br />
2)  Resists.  If they just made our disease dots unresistable I'd probably be happy.  I don't need to be able to do a lot of damage, I just need to be able to do something.  As it stands now, no dot will ever land on an VT+ geared person.  Without our dots all we have are nukes.  Velium strike is pretty crappy, but with malos in I can usually kill a caster with it off of an endless chain of small partial resists.  However, against a melee, there is no way you are ever going to channel a VS (see point 1).  Spear of torment is a joke.  A lot of classes have access to some form of rune, whether it be a clicky, a proc, or an actual spell.  A wizard with epic can pretty much stalemate me just by recasting the rune every time it finally breaks.  A necro or wizard with their time wand, you can just forget about this duel being over in under an hour.  If I had some way of doing consistant damage, though, it would be ok.<br />
<br />
Basically, I am just annoyed that shamans go from being one of the best pvp classes to one of the worst (although still one of the hardest to kill) due to gear inflation.</div></div><hr />

stopped playing on sullon when they nerfed archery.  i miss my hunter so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aten bracer with pillage enchantment needs to go or needs some serious rethinking, like double the cast time.

One time In tactics A bard played Druzzil's Dissilusion for 20 minutes.  That song either needs a Logg recast time like Boa****ll bellow or it should cost Mana.  All the other melee will eventually run outta Pumice but not a bard this is a bit unbalancing. no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since when are MB/LB/HT the top 3 overpowered pvp abilities? Muhaha, they give me np at all in pvp :) In fact, SK's+Wizzes are 2 of the easiest classes to beat for me :)<br />
<br />
Just remember some pvp abilities which are broken in some duels are balanced in others. LB/HT/MB aren't a threat at all to bards, and even time geared shamans cannot drop me below 90% hp, yet SOLELY because of mend and dot nerf, I cannot beat an EP monk. Is mend overpowered? Yes, to bards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Aten bracer with pillage enchantment needs to go or needs some serious rethinking, like double the cast time.

Honestly, as a magician with 400 AA and Aten Wrist, I strongly agree with you that it needs nerfing.<br />
<br />
A few things though, the bracer is quite literally the 'only' useful thing I can do PvP other than send my pet.  I parsed resists extensively, and the outcome is NOT pretty.<br />
<br />
A magician with 15% spell haste, full GoD critical nukes, 26% fire nuke focus did around 60 DPS chain casting my best nuke against someone with 500 save vs all.  50% of my spells were flat out full resists, the remainder were insanely mitigated.<br />
<br />
I am all for fixing the imbalanced things from PvP, but I would like the ability to actually land my nukes versus melees with gear, and yes, I feel a shaman's pain when it comes to PvP :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For YEARS they keep saying they will look at it.  When they do it gets worse.  Resists need to be looked at, as well as all melee damage. Well a entire revamp would be nice but I will not hold my breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It can't really get any worse, not for the shaman class. Any change is good change at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes you are right Asta. Solo Pvp vs Time or elemental foes for a shaman are hard at best.<br />
<br />
Change may do us good.</div></div><hr />

The s-t-f-u tripped the badword filter.</div></div><hr />

could ya ease up off the language filter just a tad so it doesn't look like i'm swearing? thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, pvp in EQ has been broken since before Velious and its getting worse all the time. I wish them good luck in retuning it, it would take a miracle, no less, to make me enjoy shaman pvp like i can enjoy when playing another class.<br />
<br />
Im going to play something else from now on.</div></div><hr />
