<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I was hoping to get some good advise on what UI skins might be out there to help make the shaman canni-dance go a little more smoothly... I've always just played with the default UI but now I find that playing a shammy I am constantly hovering my mouse over the blue mana bar to get a % of mana left so I can see when the tick has just gone by &amp; it's time for me to stand &amp; cast canni again.<br />
<br />
Well there must be some UI skins that provide mana / HP status in a percent form already so I am not constantly moving my mouse around trying not to miss the next tick go by.<br />
<br />
Also I was at one skin page one time when I thought about trying a skin &amp; decided not to mess with the game that seems so finiky as it is, is there a lot of extra problems anyone has noticed using skins &amp; how easy is it to load a skin &amp; change back to the default UI if I didn't like the skin or was having problems. I'm thinking from looking at the EQ file structure that a particular skin would just be it's own folder within the skins directory, pretty straightforward I would think if thats the case.<br />
<br />
anyways thanx</div></div><hr />

Remember, even if you ignore whne the tick happens and just stand/cann/sit, you'll have a 50% efficiency rating.  If you want more, you might have to strain your eyes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ha!  I see you've already posted there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup,<br />
<br />
Got things figured out &amp; found a nifty little self-window skin to incorporate into the EQ default UI without having to fool around with re-configing a complete new UI look.<br />
<br />
Quick question thought I replace the EQUI_playerwindow &amp; target window .XML files in my EQ directory &amp; the defaults get re-downloaded during start up which I then again just re-pastde the new I want into the EQ directory before logging in &amp; it all works fine.<br />
<br />
Any ideas how to avoid having to paste over the files that get downloaded each time I fire up EQ (files from SOE) with the fuiles to get the playerwindow skin loaded for play time?<br />
<br />
Dunno if that made sense, hope so.<br />
<br />
thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkforest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did you make a seperate copy of your default ui files and rename it?You just copy and paste the default folder and add the files you want to keep in there then when you enter /loadskin (insert what you named your copy of the default here) and away you go.From then on the custom ui that you made will reload every time you enter the world and if there is a part you don't like you can just take it out and eq will automatically repatch the default for just the file you took out.<br />
<br />
Hope that answered your question :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just &quot;making a copy of the default&quot; folder is the absolute worst advice anyone can give regarding the use of custom UI's. There are files in the default folder that are updated frequently and will cause anyone who just &quot;copied&quot; their default directory endless headaches.<br />
<br />
The best thing to do is to create an entirely NEW EMPTY folder in the UIFILES folder and place the new windows/ui files you want to use in there. Then while in game type &quot;/loadskin dirname 1&quot;. Any required files it doesn't find in that new custom directory it will load from the original default directory, but it will use the new windows you put in the custom directory as long as they contain all of the required XML data objects.<br />
<br />
However, I'd suggest thoroughly perusing eqinterface.com and reading any of the extremely detailed guides, how to's, tips &amp; tricks, and do's and don'ts before taking any advice offered here.<br />
<br />
The UI I use is the most unbreakable I've found in a long time (haijacks &quot;Master Control&quot;). Even so, I've had to make a few minor updates to it about every other patch to keep it working. Mainly the EQUI_Animations.xml and occasionally some of the graphics files. I generaly watch the default EQUI_Animiations as well as the EQUI.XML file for changes and updates, then make sure I port those changes over to my files.</div></div><hr />
