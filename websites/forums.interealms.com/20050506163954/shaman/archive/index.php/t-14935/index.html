<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking to get a idea on what you have found in droga and what camp it dropped from</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We roamed through it for about 3 hours and found absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
There is a high elf rescue quest, and we found 2 of the pieces.  Then folks got tired, including me, and split.<br />
<br />
Pretty open layout now, and pretty much anyone can single pull as a group roams about.  Very few wanderers.  <br />
<br />
A few casters, notably the Ice Masters, but nothing too extreme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Way too many casters IMO, just like the old one.  Some of those wizards are incredibly annoying, I fought a few that were 60+ using Solists on me.  We wandered through the warder area, saw nothing, down to rukgus, killed that area a few times, saw nothing.  Found the high elf lady, I found 1 of the mobs w/ a piece while wandering around invis, but didn't get the other 2.  Also found a paladin guy in the area before rukgus, with the big pool (can't remember the name of the camp - where the earring of essence used to drop), but he wouldnt say anything, then our stupid wizard killed him in 1 hit.<br />
<br />
Mobs have a lot of hp (most are 10-15k), but most all hit for less than 200.  Pretty damn boring zone, IMO, all they did was update the levels of mobs, and change their names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">huh , i have seen a very nice 1hs drop from the warder/traitor area, a respectable 2hs from a seer and a nice set of legs from another area and a solid BP for its level, this is from 2 short visits. sadly i dont know the zone or repops on named mobs, was hoping to twink out my SK lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We got this stuff:<br />
Barbaric Leather leggings<br />
14 ac 8str 4dex 8sta 4agi 65hp 30mana 12 svd svp<br />
weight 1.2<br />
all melee all race<br />
<br />
And a really nice piercer 15 20 i think with loads of stats and 6% backstab modifier. usable by rogues and shaman. <br />
<br />
some nice caster shoulders. <br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">where did they drop, are the camps the same as they used to be or are some in new places ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All off of names but the same named guys pop in different spots. The spear drops off of the named jailer. <br />
<br />
I never hunted there much and a friend and I were duoing in there. He is a 65 chanter. I just followed him around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The dining room area where the wadrer used to be is still anmed camp right ? I was lead to believe a nice 1hs for shd/pally dropped there and i been camping it all this time, doesnt matter if im wrong, its all faction, but i wanna upgrade my SK damn it lol</div></div><hr />
