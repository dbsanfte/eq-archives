<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read somewhere that No Drop augments that are applied to droppable items make that item No Drop.  Removing the augment returns the item to it's droppable status, but also makes it so that you can never apply that augment to the item again.<br />
<br />
So I just bought this wonderful Tae Ew Shield and it has no augments.  I try to apply an augment and..... it won't let me.  Because someone had applied it before and then removed it.  Now the person I bought it from may not have known, or maybe he did.<br />
<br />
But how are we supposed to know now if an augment was ever applied and removed from an item we buy?<br />
<br />
The above scenario did not happen to me, but seems like it could very easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are misinformed.  Removing the augment does not make it so you can never apply that augment to the item again.  What it does is destroy the augment.  If you have another one, you can reapply it if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You sure?  Could have swore I read something from Absor about not having the augment work again on the item.... or perhaps it said that the augment was gone forever.  hmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You lose the augment when you remove it, but that doesn't stop you from adding the same augment later.</div></div><hr />
