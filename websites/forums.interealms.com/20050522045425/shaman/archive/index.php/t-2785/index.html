<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a new player...I'm listening to the arguments and see how many people say it's better to have ac/hp over wis...<br />
<br />
This is my first character. I'm still fairly new to the game, have seen about 5 zones...<br />
<br />
I'm not wanting to know about items that are WAY outta my reach, like the Fungi BP and the JBB...I want to know what I should be shooting for w/in the next 10-15 levels or so...What should I be saving my coppers for? I would love more Ac/Hp, so what can I upgrade w/in the next 10 levels w/in a price range that I can shoot for? Maybe one piece at a time type stuff? <br />
<br />
Magelo? Forget it...Why show you what I can tell you?<br />
<br />
BANDED EVERYTHING EXCEPT<br />
<br />
Mammoth Hide Leggings<br />
Chrysoberyl Talisman<br />
Tattered Mantle<br />
Cutthroat Insignia Ring (+2Dex)<br />
Silver Ring (+1Wis, -1Cha)<br />
<br />
I have 130 pp. I'm having fun exploring different aspects of the game  and have already become a Master Brewer (121). I want to fight, but I like this tradeskill idea. <br />
<br />
So...What are some ideas that I could shoot for under a 500pp price range that I can save for? I understand different servers, different prices, but on smaller stuff, I think there's a pretty set range (ex:Banded, 1pp per AC point). Thanks for any advice you can give!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For the next 10-15 levels, what will help you the most is a good-ratio weapon.  Incremental increases in AC, HP, or WIS will help a little, too... but more and faster damage are your friends right now.<br />
<br />
You'll want to keep both piercing and your blunt skills trained, and make sure to keep your defense skill maxed as you level.  Here are a few recommendations for cheap weapons (ideally you'll want one piercer, one one hander blunt, and one two hand blunt... of course that's ideally...)<br />
<br />
Piercing:<br />
<br />
Bloodstained fang (Dmg 9, Dly 32) - sells for next to nothing (10 pp?) <br />
<br />
Rukgus's sticker (Dmg 6, Dly 25, +3 Str, +2 Wis, +2 Int) - probably under 100 pp <br />
<br />
Ebon war spear (Dmg 8, Dly 31, Rangeable, +4 Str, +3 Wis, +5 vsMg) - probably 100-200 pp, this one is nice because when you upgrade you could move it to your range slot to continue to benefit from the stats. <br />
<br />
Bettle stinger (Dmg 8, Dly 23, +4 Agi, +4 Dex, +4 Wis) - 100-200 pp) <br />
<br />
Spine chill spear (Dmg 10, Dly 28, +3 Sta, +6 Wis, +10 vsCold) - 200-400 pp <br />
<br />
Slime coated harpoon (Dmg 10, Dly 25, Rangeable, +5 Wis, +10 Mana) - 200-500 pp <br />
<br />
One hand blunt: <br />
<br />
Screaming mace (8 dmg, 35 dly, Effect of Screaming Mace), Cold iron morning star (9 dmg, 35 dly), Enamelled black mace (Dmg 8, Dly 28) - These are old-world weapons, now make nice lower level weapons, and are probably around 50-100 pp <br />
<br />
Wraith bone hammer (Dmg 8, Dly 26, +5 Str, +2 Wis, +2 Int), Sharkbone Warhammer (Dmg 8, Dly 26, +5 Wis), Velium Etched Stone Mace (Dmg 7, Dly 22, +3 Str, +3 Wis), or Centi warhammer (Dmg 15, Dly 32- great ratio!, +5 Str, +5 Sta, +2 Wis) - 100-200 pp <br />
<br />
Smoldering Brand (Dmg 9, Dly 22, +3 Str, Effect of Burn from level 1 - NICE weapon), Ykeshan War Club (Dmg 9, Dly 24, Effect of Ykesha from level 37) - 200-500pp <br />
<br />
Two hand blunt: <br />
<br />
Drakkel Forged Sledgehammer (Dmg 22, Dly 50) or Gatorsmash Maul (Dmg 30, Dly 70) - 50-100 pp <br />
<br />
Drakkel Icegrinder (Dmg 27, Dly 45, Effect of Ice Rend) - 200-400pp <br />
<br />
Shield: (throwing this in there since they can provide nice AC/HP very cheaply)<br />
<br />
Bark shield (+15 AC, +5 Agi), Chitin shell shield (+15 AC, +10 vsPos), Crystal webshield (+15 AC, +10 vsCold, +20 HP, +20), <br />
Crustacean shell shield (+17 AC, +4 Str, +10 Sta, -7 Cha), Velium round shield (+15 AC, +10 vsCold) - 50-150 pp <br />
<br />
Clay guardian shield (+25 AC, +50 HP) - 200-500 pp <br />
<br />
Other:<br />
4 AC/45 HP, 5 AC/55 HP, or Adamantite bands (75 HP, -10 vs magic) can generally be found cheap (offer 50 pp...)<br />
<br />
Basically, don't sweat it.  Banded and a nice weapon are all you really need until well into your 30s.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Things to look for in the inexpensive range, (some of which, if like me, you will be wearing well into your 40's, and maybe 50's)<br />
<br />
Gatorscale Leggings - Decent AC, and a decent Wis boost for low/mid levels (leggings are the shamans worst nightmare) - generally go in the 500pp area.  Have seen for less.<br />
<br />
(Still wearing this, at 53) Giant Woven Vest - 18ac, +STR/HP/svCold - AC is weak at my level, but the price on this is dropping through the floor.  Have seen it on vendors for less that 400pp... and HP=Mana after a while.<br />
<br />
Imbued Ivory Collar - again, nice balance of AC and wis, although a little more costly - about 1k, but have seen it auctioned at less than 300, so keep your eyes open.<br />
<br />
Chipped Bone Bracers - Again, AC and Wis.  And it makes your dot's a little more effective... anywhere from 300 ea to 4-500 a pair.<br />
<br />
Imbued Ivory Earing (presuming you are a follower of the Tribunal) - once again, AC and Wis, with a little sv cold... about 1-300 ea, depending on seller.<br />
<br />
There are loads of other things you can look at.  If you plan on being primarily a tradeskiller, you will want all the wis gear you can get.  With smithing, you will also want all the STR gear you can get, but that is unimportant at higher levels (when you can self buff to 255 with no problem).  If you plan to be a raid shaman, at some point, with a high end guild, you will want to start building to AC/HP gear.  No hurry there, as you have 40 or so levels to worry about it.  If you are just going to be the 'average' shaman, in a nice small/mid sized guild, and not concerned about ToV, Planes, etc, go for a nice mix of AC/HP and wis gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jagged bands (rings).  AC5, str+3, about 25p each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What you want is a jeweller to make some jewelry for you.<br />
You can get 2ac 35hp 25mana earrings for basicly the cost of a black sapphire and a gold bar.  I'd estimate about 100P-200P for one of these.<br />
You can get 4ac/45hp rings for the cost of a fire opal and a gold bar.  This should cost under 100P each.<br />
You can get a 7str 7wis veil for the cost of a plat bar and ruby.  This should cost about 300P or less.<br />
Also, there's rings you can get that have 5ac 30hp 30mana.  They might serve you better than the pure ac and hp ones.  They are velium jade I think, so they'll cost probably about 150? or 200p to make (i forget the cost of a velium bar, but a jade piece is cheap like borcht!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stick with the banded for awhile, never will hurt you to have some ac.  Buy some cheapo 3ac/35hp rings or 4/45.  All the equipment listed in the previous thread are some nice ideas.  BTW if you can find ivory on a vendor (11pp) and find a kind shaman to imbue it, then find a kind high level bored enchanter, you can get the tribunal earrings for cost...roughly 30pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't forget the Charred Guardian Shield from Sol A.  I think it's AC 12 Wis 9.  Been a real long time since I've used one but I had it for at least 20 levels.  You should be able to buy it for 100-200pp max.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>monotikitia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Look me up (I play on Tunare as well - either as Monotikita or Nergal, my main)  I've got some old stuff taking up bank space (a decent piercer, some Totemic pieces I upgraded etc) that you can have.<br />
<br />
I'd also suggest looking into some Fire Opal rings (ac/hp).  Velium would be ideal (6ac/65hp), but probably out of your price range.  The platinum version (5ac/55hp) is likely much more affordable.</div></div><hr />
