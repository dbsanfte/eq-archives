<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering what observations people who are playing the Beta have. One thing two Shm friends told me, very few mobs can be slowed. Almost everything they have seen is immune to slow. Which led me to wonder, will this be the standard or is just for beta testing? Anyone have knowledge about it or for that matter other observations that concern the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">don't betas usualy sign a NDA ? not that it realy maters.. with a 3 week schedule tho.</div></div><hr />

It did have a NDA.<br />
<br />
And it does matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can keep it that way too, as long as they increase my healing power by about 50% to compensate.  <br />
<br />
I actually hate slow immune mobs, but I hate spam healing and not having it help at all more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just mean.. if they push it out in three weeks.. by the time a leak developes its already a released game :) It is speculated to be a very short beta. In the typical sony fasion, full of bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Litgruv bein' all sneaky-sneaky.  :)<br />
<br />
Just PM it to me, I wont tell...I PROMIES!!1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">NDA are bullcrap anyway.<br />
<br />
It's there to threaten people to not tell the rest of the world how bad the game is so they don't lose pre-orders.  Sony needs to have some open betas for once so we can all scream and rant about facts instead of rumors like we always do ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, one cough for 'same crap as GoD with holy-trinity oriented mobs + nerfed slows' and two coughs 'might actually be worthwhile'?</div></div><hr />

Can't say much because of NDA, but I can tell you I'm feedbacking things as I encounter them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure if all the mobs are immune, shaman in Beta will /feedback /feedback /feedback.</div></div><hr />
