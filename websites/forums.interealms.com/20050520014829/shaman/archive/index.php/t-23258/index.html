<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been gone for over 4 months from EQ, and curious how things with EQ are going.<br />
<br />
Mabey it's just me, but it looks like the players are dropping off fast??<br />
<br />
Last time i came to the board, the first page was always full with new posts from that day.  Now theres only half that it seems.  Funny thing is i went looking around some other EQ boards, and they are all like that!<br />
<br />
So whats up?  Am i imagining things, or is EQ still going strong as usuall? Something seems off.  I was thinking of coming back, but i figured i'd get the scoop first.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A lot of end game players have wandered off in the past six months or so, but good lord there seemingly millions of new chars running around (on fennin anyway) with a new guild or three every other day.</div></div><hr />
