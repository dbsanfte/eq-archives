<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FenrisBound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering if anyone knows what slows are best at what lvls, for soloing and grouping. Also, does anyone have the formulas for how the slow rates work. O, by the way I'm a 37 Shamy. There used to be a thread that discribed this but I can't find it, which is a DRAGGGGGGG.<br />
<br />
     Thanks Hoodovoodoo <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The newest slow you have always provides the biggest result.<br />
<br />
Drowsy = level/4+10<br />
Walking Sleep = level/4+20<br />
Tagar = level/2+20<br />
Togor= level+10<br />
Turgur = level +15</div></div><hr />

:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My opinion as 60 shammy is that until you get to 51 your most efficient slow is walking sleep if you are in full group killing stuff fairly quickly. No need to waste your mana since you will need it for other stuff.<br />
<br />
It's only when you get to KC, or Chardok or Seb, etc. that you need a better slow IMHO and you should be 51+ in those areas anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">51+ for Chardok and Seb, sure... KC??? 44 is high enough level to play in KC.... I did it with my mage, I did it with my shaman, I do it with my paladin... Only for the harder/deeper parts of KC do you need to be 51+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still use Togor's sometimes. In my opinion, the biggest benefit of Turgur's is the duration and not the extra slow percentage. If things are low-level and are dying really fast (i.e., the other day we were having to get through light blues on a CR) than I'll switch to Togor's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One huge advantage to Turgur's Instects (51) vs Togor's Instects (39) is that Turgur is a 3 second cast versus 5 second cast for Togor.  Those 2 secs really make a difference if you are getting beat on.  <br />
<br />
Though as the previous poster pointed out their effects are nearly identical at 60th, with the 39th level slow enjoying a significant mana discount. (250 vs 175, notwithstanding specialization effects).</div></div><hr />
