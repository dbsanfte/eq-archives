<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cleat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shamans of Norrath, heed this thread. We have become considerably obsolete in higher tier areas, so much so, that we can not play or find players that would have us group in GoD areas, yet we paid to have this ill advertised expansion.<br />
<br />
As in the EQ has become of age, most of us are at our 65th season. <br />
Points to consider:<br />
<br />
We are awesome for the under 65 player with our buffs.<br />
We are awesome in normal LDoN.<br />
<br />
In PoP flagging raids, we become triage players as our nukes and dots mostly are too slow for the mobs save maybe the end mob.<br />
In elemental, we become less useful as mobs become unslowable, resist much and agro on us considerably. We see there is something wrong with our class.<br />
<br />
We see our lvl 60+ pet get out-damaged by the necros mid 40 pet.<br />
In GoD areas, we are not needed for our stat buffs, we can’t even spot heal well, out triage abilities are useless and we get killed a lot if we even try to participate on a mob. This slows down the whole group, and eventually we are not wanted in these areas unless players feel sorry for us.<br />
<br />
At 65, elementaly flagged, our stat buffs become useless, our healing abilities are null, our dps is also null comparable to the mob and what our cousins can do. We are old world, a dead class at higher tier areas.<br />
SOE has made a thread in their own ‘developers’ forum called the future of the shaman, where hundreds of ideas were given to improve our broken class. SOE NEVER responded to even one post and moved the thread to the class boards.<br />
<br />
SOE developers short-sightedness in programming migating slows and immune Mobs and releasing gears that puts a player far over their stat caps has effectively hurt the shaman class, and since the release of GoD, our class is unplayable in those areas.<br />
<br />
The new spells on ‘test’ still do not meet our needs to become a groupable class. Unless stat caps can be lifted, these lvl66-70 spells are triage spells only. And these new spells still do not address the current state of the class, nor will they change the ‘old worldness’ of the shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamans of Norrath, it is time we respond to SOE neglect. I call upon all shamans, no matter how painful this may seem, to RETIRE FROM THE WORLD OF NORRATH. Put your shaman on an extended vacation, and work up those alts you have or start a new peep. Do this till SOE responds with something actually positive, something that will make us proud to be a shaman and wanted by players in higher tier areas. Do not fall for the small ‘bones’ SOE may throw to us. <br />
<br />
Shamans NEED an extensive overhaul to be playable. Younger shamans, heed this also, for when you become seasoned, you will be extremely disappointed and wonder why you put so much time in developing a class that becomes utterly useless in the new content of Norrath.<br />
<br />

To be perfectly frank, no. Sorry. I love my shaman and I love this game. I do not see the changes to regen and Quies/BoT as &quot;bones&quot; but rather as a viable beginning to a balancing process that is going to take some tweaking and adjusting, especially after the release of OoW. <br />
<br />
Shaman are very valuable in Time. Shaman are very valuable on most EP God raids. Shaman have abilities that make them valuable on quite a few EP mini raids. Shaman are viable group members in EP XP areas. Shaman contribute quite a bit on many PoP flag raids. And with the recent changes, Shaman are not as totally worthless in Gates as they were at its release. <br />
<br />
Its a process, not an event. I wish people would stop waiting for the &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;. There is no magic wand. If your looking for an excuse to quit playing EQ, well, here ya go, &quot;They arent fixing my class fast enough, WAAA&quot;. <br />
Shamans NEED an extensive overhaul to be playable. Younger shamans, heed this also, for when you become seasoned, you will be extremely disappointed and wonder why you put so much time in developing a class that becomes utterly useless in the new content of Norrath.<br />
Sorry, disagree again. Extensive is not the word I would use. In fact, moderate might be too strong a word. Shaman need tweaking. they need to have their abilities adjusted to fit the current state of affairs in EQ. Ovehaul? Nah. <br />
<br />
And please, stop telling younger shaman they are going to suck when they get to higher levels. I imagine if a level 52 shaman suddanly found himself at 65 with 100 aa INSTANTLY then sure, he would be disappointed, but you cannot say for certain where the class will be in 3 months, 6 months or a year. To be perfectly honest, although shaman could have been a bit stronger through PoP, it wasnt until Gates that the class became this obsolete. <br />
Shamans, please link this thread to other forumes you may go to.<br />
No offense intended again, but in the infamous words of Gloriana, &quot;Who are you again?&quot; Have you read this board much? Do you not see the general atmosphere of the people here, one of aprehension, and disgust, and downright disappointment? This thread isnt going to do anything to help our class, but if we can get the developers to read this WHOLE BOARD with a more objective view, then MAYBE we can get something more accomplished. As it stands, we got a &quot;bone&quot;, and while it wasnt QUITE enough to put us back into the realm of &quot;Uber Class&quot;, it did help, even in Gates. I fully expect more changes in the future, and with another expansion and 5 more levels/new aa's on the horizon, the future is basically uncertain. But its not so bad that I think we should throw in the towels, here. There are a lot of classes in EQ that have similar problems with the current end-game content. We are just a part of a bigger, overall list, and I am willing to give them a chance to fix it. Besides, I am having a BLAST, even if we do &quot;suck&quot; at certain areas. For now, anyway, I want to play.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Koda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have been reading the threads on this board for years now and never registared until now, to respond here.<br />
<br />
First, seeing Cleat as a lurker means he is new, maybe not, maybe just re registared. He seems to know about the class aok.<br />
<br />
Too bad this thread is getting flamed, I feel this player has a lot of fustration with his game and is reaching out.<br />
<br />
The aurgument goes that sony will slowly bring shamans up to par. I don't know, I haven't seen much improvement except the upgrade to Q and replenishment (which is a class shared spell) in years. We all know what the problems are, slow casting slow dots/slows not working, etc. I love cleats use of being a triage class, it so fits in :-)<br />
<br />
I bought the god expansion and was very disapointed in it. My shaman is lvl 65 with only 120AA and elementally flagged. But I do have a very hard time finding a group in god zones. Not so much in the elements and ldon (both normal and hard), but I feel like I am being a gimp when I do get into god - which is rare in itself.<br />
<br />
Some here say that we should continue to post positive suggestions in hopes sony will pick up on them. I went to sonys forums and read the threat that cleat mentioned and I understand where he/she is coming  from. <br />
<br />
There has been mountians of reasonable suggestions put out on this forum and other forums, including sonys official forums, on how to put the shaman class back into a positive position in the game at upper tier areas. And these suggestions have been out there since the release of god.<br />
<br />
Blazz, you agree with alot of info in cleats thread, yet you crit it at the same time. (?) It would be better if you explained how effective, what ways, the class is good in the areas you mentioned instead of just saying they are.<br />
<br />
Cleats thread seems to be some sort of call to action on the players who are fustrated with the class, fustrated with the amount of feedback given to sony and getting little or no response from sony. I do personally know a few who have stopped thier shamans and moved to another class. <br />
<br />
If everyone stopped playing their shaman, that may give notice that the class is feed up, but I don't think it would be that severe of a notice. Cleat didnt ask for a strike, a set time or anything. Maybe a scheduled strike would get some notice - certainly worked for the warriors.<br />
<br />
My two cents worth.<br />
<br />
(BTW - I love playing my shaman too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well, the way the game is built right now, if every shaman quit tomorrow would anyone notice?  <br />
Honestly I think they could just delete our class and nobody would care much.  We're that non-critical to every portion of the EQ game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if it's not fun stop playing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I just cant see quiting.  Ive turned my shaman into a bot so to speak for my SK.  I do on occasion break him out of the mode and go farm up in AC, but for the most part he just backs up my sk.  As for the whole lets go block the bazaar..I say screw that!  The only people your hurting then are those who need to get into the bazaar.  Lets not make it worse on folks who havent done a damn thing to us..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Unfortunately, Sudedor and Landragoran echo what I and others have noted before -- we could all quit and there would still be more than enough bots around to make up for us.  Heck, the bot supply would actually become even more excessive for a while as many handed their characters to their friends and guilds or sold them to strangers.<br />
<br />
Sony has crafted themselves the perfect out for all their blunders with shamans -- the blunders themselves have rendered us so unimportant that it doesn't matter how bad they are or how bad they ever get; the game has immunized itself permanently against its own floundering design decisions by virtue of the bad design itself.  Perhaps that effectively defines those design blunders as actual good design then.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, it's just a matter for the bulletin boards now, as what happens to shamans has gone from being central to the game to completely irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>graul_maul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I know exaclty where we will be 6 months from now.  Same place we were at 6 months ago, which was the same place we were at 6 months before that, and 6 months before that...anyone seeing a pattern here?<br />
<br />
I pretty much have given up on the &quot;shaman fix&quot;.  It is more of a myth now, that carrot dangling on a string for us.  I pretty much just bot my shaman to buff the group.  Even though we all know the stat buffs are pointless, the general population still thinks they are needed.  I never get asked to join groups with my shaman, but i am constantly asked just to buff them up.  I can also use my shaman to help me speed through the levels if I ever want to create a new tweek.  Maybe that is the design for the shaman class now, the ultimate BoT for making a tweek character.<br />
<br />
I don't think I could have leveled a worse class to 65 then a shaman.  I loved playing Graul Maul, the retarted troll, and it is what had me keep my shaman going for the 4+ years that I played him, but I finally gave up and rolled up a new character that consumes my time.  Graul has a born on date of August 1999, and died March of 2004.  I am at the point where all the change in the world might not bring me back, just out of spite.  I lived through all the horrid crap a shaman had to endure throughout their lifetime, from the horrible days of them telling us Alchemy is not broken to the horrid state we are in now.  In all that time, I got to enjoy the power we once held in the Kunark days, and seeing us not receive crap since then.  You can talk all you want to about how the shaman is not as bad off as people here say, but those of us that have been around as long as myself, know different.<br />
<br />
A lot of the classes need different tweeks and fixes for things, shaman are not the only broken class in the game.  But by far, we have been the most ignored for the longest period of time.  Would SoE even notice if all shaman across the board quit?  Doubt it, there is not a single thing in this game where you need a shaman.  Not a one.  How would anyone know that we are even gone.  I don't know of a worse class for stacking on raids, and in case you have not realized this yet, raids are what this game has moved towards.  Someone here posted that the shaman is nothing more then the court jester of a guild, and I think that is the absoulute gods honest truth anymore.  Talk about how great your shaman is, and then please pass to the rest of us whatever it is that you are smoking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the point that Blazz was trying to make was:<br />
<br />
1.  There are countless other threads on this board that already talk about the exact same thing.<br />
<br />
2.  Why did Cleat suddenly decide it necessary to make his first post on this topic?<br />
<br />
3.  Shamans start hitting the brick wall in GoD, but still have acceptable roles in PoP/LDoN.  The majority of these &quot;shamans suck&quot; threads started after the GoD release, but trickle down into Elemetal PoP / LDoN.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, the majority of the shamans on this board are frustrated.  To be honest, though, did Cleat bother to check the dozen other threads that talk about the exact same thing?<br />
<br />
<br />
Cleats thread seems to be some sort of call to action on the players who are fustrated with the class, fustrated with the amount of feedback given to sony and getting little or no response from sony. <br />
<br />
Since the disgruntled posts started we have seen the following changes to Shamans and GoD content:<br />
<br />
- Regen upgraded, Quiescence upgrade x2, Breath of Trushar Upgraded x2?<br />
<br />
- Complete revamp to our GoD spell line<br />
<br />
- Complete revamp to Sewer/Tipt/Vxed trials<br />
<br />
- Complete revamp to Mob dps/hitpoints for: Natimbi, Barindu, Qinimi [see above for trial zones]<br />
<br />
- Nerfing to chanter pets for Tipt/Vxed<br />
<br />
- possible upcoming change to pets that will allow them to zone with you making our pet aa's USEFUL.<br />
<br />
Granted, some of these items should have been fixed before release and the work is not over, but we have gotten some feedback and some changes.  Like Blazz said, we need some tweaking- not a complete overhaul.  There is no point in SOE handing us a ton of stuff to just come back a month later and nerf us because we became too powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">While the issues you raise appear to be valid ones, I for one am not of the mind that cancelling accounts or no longer playing a shaman are viable ways to get SoE's attention. <br />
<br />
Cancelling accounts DOES hurt them at the bottom line...true. But for them to truly FEEL the magnitude of that, it would have to be the entire shaman community. A handful cancelling will not have much effect. If anything, SoE might view it as culling out some of the disgruntled undesirables. The reason that they started addressing GoD-related issues is partly due to the sheer magnitude of people leaving EQ over what was deemed as a very poorly constructed expansion. At that point, it wasn't just &quot;Joe Shaman&quot; and &quot;Mary Magician&quot; leaving, it was the majority of some of the more prominent guilds. With such a mass exodus, they HAD to take a look at what was causing it (and I don't think it was entirely based on the quality of the other, comparable games out there). Therefore, the trickle of a few dozen shaman cancelling in protest over lack of changes in the viability of shaman as a class most likely would not even be acknowledged.<br />
<br />
As for switching to different class with an alt: that would take away from people voicing their concerns about this class. Most likely, it would get those people in arms over the state of the &quot;new&quot; class. EVERY class feels that their are certain areas that could use improvements. [Insert class here] does not corner the market on it. <br />
<br />
SoE is slowly doing something rather unprecedented in the history of EQ: they are slowly starting to listen to the customer. First the summit, now the Class Correspondents. Following the summit, there seems to be more of an SoE presence among the various class boards as they are trying to see what we the players think and feel. The fact that SoE is coming out of their ivory tower IS a good thing. I think the best thing for us to do as a shaman community and as an EQ community is to give them a chance. Work with them. Show them their misconceptions and let them explain to us a little more about why some of our ideas might not be the solutions sought. For the first time since I started playing (April 1999), I can see them offering the olive branch to players. We have a choice. I don't see cancelling accounts or hiding in other classes to make our points about the status of the shaman class as being the right choices. <br />
<br />
Again, this is my opinion. Sometimes I'm right; other times I'm wrong...</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
-Breath of Trushar (Heal over Time) Increase hitpoints by 360 per tick for 4 ticks<br />
<br />
changed to:<br />

-increase hitpoints by 630 per tick for 4 ticks<br />
<br />
<br />
-Balance of Nihil- decrease attack speed by 60%<br />
<br />
changed to:<br />
<br />
-decrease attack speed by 75%<br />

[ I wanna say that they worked with the resist modifier as well, but suck at reading Lucy]<br />
<br />
You got me on Ancient: Chaotic Pain, I could have swore that they bumped it up as well, but Lucy only lists the fizzle rate being adjusted.<br />
<br />
The point I was trying to make is that we have seen changes for the better, so it is obvious that SOE/Brenlo are not completely ignoring us...progress is just slow.<br />
<br />
Were the GoD spells a pile of crap upon release? Yes<br />
<br />
Do we see much improved versions of the original spells? Yes (sans Chaotic Pain)<br />
<br />
It's slow because we are being tweaked to keep up.  It also looks like with Omens, Devs are listening to our issues regarding stat buffs.  We are making progress- it may be slow, but we are moving in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

I do not criticize his problems with the class, my disagreement is his &quot;solution&quot;. I just do not see us as needing a COMPLETE overhaul, and I certainly do not see things as being so bad that we should bail out on our class as some form of &quot;protest&quot;. For the record, I didn't agree with the way the Warriors staged a walkout either. I find that kind of thing kind of lame in the overall scheme of things, really. Regardless of the result, the method of action still sucked, IMHO. <br />
<br />
As for the value we have in the areas I mentioned earlier, I will break it down:<br />
Time - Many Time events involve multiple mobs, there-by increasing the need for muliple slows/debuffs. Also, as you progress deeper, spells like BVlood of Nadox and RGC are a big help overall.<br />
EP Gods - With the exception of Fennin Ro, these battles involve multiple adds, in multiple areas, all of which need the abilities we provide, once again. <br />
EP Minis - Yet again, there are many mobs here that involve multiples, and a couple where Blood of Nadox and RGC are key again. <br />
Gates- We are perfectly viable back-up healers now, with the changes to our HoTs and regen. <br />
<br />
Please do not come back with a ton of &quot;Yeah, but this other class can go this better, and that other class can do that better&quot; responses. This kind of thing is true of almsost every single class in the game, not just us. My point is that we are ABSOLUTELY not worthless in these areas. Could we be stronger? Sure. Do we still need some modifications? Absolutely. Are things so bad that we should QUIT!!! HELL no.</div></div><hr />
