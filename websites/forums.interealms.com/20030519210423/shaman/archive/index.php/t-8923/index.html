<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so here is my situation.  I have a group of friends and we all group together fairly often.  Sometimes there is a bard in the group and sometimes an enchanter.  So far in the planes the bards crowd control hasn't been all that great as he is capped at 55 mez, and 52 charm until we can find him his new songs I believe.  Basically this leaves me for crowd control when we pull mobs the bard is not capable of mezzing or charming.  <br />
My question is, would it be good to just root the mob/slow it and get everyone to move away from the add or try to get aggro and park the mob else where?  I have been having a bit of trouble getting aggro from the mob in a reasonable amount of time as I usually have an sk and pally in the group that build up considerable aggro while they are coming in.  Basically I am wondering what other shamans do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I find most pickup groups don't pay attention to mobs that I root even when I announce it with my hotkey. So I usually get some distance, slow the add then sit to get aggro then root park out of the way of the others. 90% of the time a slow followed by sitting down will get aggro so it's very effective. I'd just tell your sk and pally friends to not aggro the adds unless you are having problems with resists and are getting pounded on too much while trying to root/slow the adds. This allows you to get aggro as you want and park them out of the way.<br />
<br />
Then again I don't claim to know it all so there might be better replies with other useful hints :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmmm I completely forgot about sit aggro, guess I have been on good ol gluey way to long.  Thanks for reminding me about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sit aggro works good, sometimes tho you get a ping pong once you stand back up, if you find you are doing CC alot I'd give up a spell slot and load up listless power or some low level cripple line spell, its fast cast, low mana and hella aggro after a slow and you dont have aggro cast that and you will.  There is a sticky here somewhere that talks about shaman tanking using this and envenomed breath.  Many is the time i have tanked in PoV using these two spells to hold aggro while my group searched for a replacement tank so I know they hold aggro very well :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont know the composure of your group but depending who is in your group etc, a cleric with Blessing of Revinnance can significantly help you get your argo faster.  Since it improves the cast time on your Malo and slow lines aswell as most other spells you can malo, slow which usually will pull the mob to you and then you can root it a little ways away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have a shadowknight you shouldnt have to do crowd control. Personally I have no problems getting aggro. Turgors generates tons, our DoT spells generate tons. I would wager that shaman can out-aggro just about any other class in the game if they actually work at it, certainly we out-aggro every melee class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If we have /autopull engaged, I slow, bring 'em to me, and park 'em a bit outside the melee range.  I use Paralyzing Earth,  click with my Spear o' Fate, and soften them up however else needed.<br />
<br />
Then, when it's time to bring them to the group as a whole, I hit them with Bane.  Usually enough to break root.  If not, JBB.</div></div><hr />
