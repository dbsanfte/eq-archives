<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sold off all my twinks' gear in order to buy a jbb eventually.  Sold my last item priced over 1k tonight (grey flesh trouses for 1200).  That put me up to 19120pp.  I check keyword &quot;jaundiced&quot; in /bazaar in idle hope that a Jaundiced Bone Br will show up.<br />
<br />
AND IT DID!  for 19000!   I could afford it!  I promptly ran to the trader and bought it.  wooted in guild channel...then one of the monks said &quot;oh, I've had one sitting in bank for a while, I would've just given it to you, guess I can sell it now.&quot;  :p   But I'm still happy I finally got a JBB again (was borrowing one from a friend then he took it back a while ago).<br />
<br />
So....ditch my barbed rubi bracer or my spirit caller's?  Check my magelo for stats.  I'm leaning towards bagging the spirit caller's.<br />
<br />
Hehe, I think Bane is gonna be getting a lot less play than it has been recently.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">keep your bracers .. once you hit 60 and get canni5 you wont use jbb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm 60 and have had canni 5 quite a while now, and use the JBB all the time.   Solo, duo, trio, you name it.  Plenty of people with canni 5 make frequent use of the JBB. <br />
<br />
Doesn't mean I don't use DOTs, but just because I use DOTs doesn't mean that a mana-free damage item suddenly has become useless.<br />
<br />
Blanket statements usually should be looked at with quite a big grain of salt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup, there are times you switch back to your JBB. I seldom have Spell Slots for both my Dots and Ice Strike free, especially when people expect me to men Craps Mending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">May not have canni5, but definately still use my JBB all the time and I cant see that ever changing.  I have actually just ditched my other bracer (wolf callers) for the coldain military wristguard.  Mana free damage and longer dots &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a couple of stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What he's trying to say is its more efficient to canni + a dot than to JBB since you have canni5<br />
<br />
With affliction items like coldain wristguard and more it totally owns the JBB in terms of soloing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">But surely with Canni 5 it is the other way round? It is not worthwhile casting canni4 every few seconds so pile on a couple of DoTs, JBB blast continuously throughout the rest of the fight, then hit Canni5 at the end to gain back all the mana spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okay, I know I've been the whiny voice of &quot;the little shaman&quot; who would never see a JBB or Fungi or any of those other neat items/spells you big folks get. Well, I must apologize to you. It's possible.<br />
<br />
Last night I went to the Bazaar mainly to get some food since I didn't feel like making a bunch of Fish Rolls. When I'm there I usually check the price of a Barbarian Spiritist's Hammer, look for spells and, for the fun of it, see if anyone happens to be selling a JBB.<br />
<br />
I couldn't believe it when I actually saw one for sale. And it was only 15k!  I just knew it had been sold but checked out the merchant anyway. It was still there! Unfortunately I only had 4k in the bank so I started making desperate, pleading begs to my guild for anyone to loan me the 11k I needed. As I was begging and getting my cash from the bank I got a /tell from the merchant. It seems he was on while I checked him out. He asked if I was interested in the bracer and said that for a fellow shaman he'd lower the cost to 12k. More desperate tells to my guild then followed. I just KNEW someone was going to poach it from me. So I begged the guy not to sell it for at least 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
As we were talking I asked him if he'd trade the bracer for 4k, my ODS and my Sarnak Battle Shield. He hadn't played in a while and was pretty much selling off his shaman stuff. He asked what an ODS and SBS were. When I showed him he, get this, agreed to trade the JBB straight over for the ODS! He was mainly playing a cleric and felt the ODS would be a great benefit to the character.<br />
<br />
To be fair, I told him the JBB usually went from 15k - 25k and the ODS usually sold for around 6k. He didn't care. He wanted to help out a fellow shaman and felt the deal was square.<br />
<br />
I nearly cried.<br />
<br />
So I'm now the very proud owner of my own Space Ghost power blaster. <br />
<br />
For all of us little guys out there, it's possible for miracles to happen.<br />

That's so funny :D  I'm reading the whole post looking for the Space Ghost reference.  <br />

Congrats.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My only comment is that you should not rely so much on your JBB that you fail to cap your evocation and conjuration skills.<br />
<br />
Oh, and scientists have shown that if you use your JBB too much, you will go blind.<br />

Pass me my braille keyboard would you now, sonny?  That's a good boy.</div></div><hr />
