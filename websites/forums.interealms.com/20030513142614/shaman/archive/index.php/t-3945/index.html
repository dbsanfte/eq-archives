<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Selkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">New here, not sure if this is the right place. :)<br />
<br />
I should preface this with the fact I'm new to the shaman class - level 11 - and new to soloing, as my main is a rogue and can't solo fer crap. *grin*<br />
<br />
My first question is about the patch that changed the damage mobs take while dotted and running.  Before the patch, I didn't know it was even a problem.  My basic strategy has been to cast Tainted Breath, take off, cast Sicken, take off, cast Drowsy and turn to melee.  The thing is, I haven't noticed any difference between pre-patch and post-patch.  Both before and after the patch, the mob's hitpoints don't go down much while I'm kiting, but when the mob stops (when I turn to melee), its hitpoints drop in a chunk.  Is this how it works for other people, or is it maybe my lag?  Have other people noticed a big difference since that patch?<br />
<br />
My second question is, what droppable lowbie-shaman-usable weapons proc a dd or dot?  Thanks for any input. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bytorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To answer your first question:  Depending on how far away you are from the critter that you're killing, the damage might not update on your screen correctly.  <br />
<br />
For example, if you rooted a monster and cast a DoT or two on him it might look like he hasn't taken any damage at all.  Then when you cast a nuke or get close enough to him for your client to update with his current hit points, you'll see his life drop quite quickly.<br />
<br />
Regarding the second question:  I don't recall what the exact damage of the proc is, but I believe the Velium weapons have a small proc that will work at level 20.  <br />
<br />
Another option would be to do the Screaming Mace quest (or buy it if you're an evil race).  The proc on that weapon is Yaulp which adds AC and STR to you.  It's a fairly decent item and having a little extra AC from the proc will help you as build up your melee skills.<br />
<br />
Something to keep in mind:  Soloing between levels 16-24 (or so) is fairly painful.  You'll probably find that most critters will take most of your mana (and a good chunk of your health) to kill at those levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shamrox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For the Weapon:<br />
<br />
If you cann affort the money (4-6k on Inny) go for a REIF (Rune Etched Icewurm Fang) DMG/Delay 12/19 +5WIS and procs a 81DD.<br />
<br />
One of the best Shammy Piercer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When does a REIF begin to proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Smoldering Brand procs Burn at level 1 I believe.  It's not much, but mobs at that level don't have many hitpoints either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I *LOVE* the smoldering brand as a twinking weapon for any class (including casters). It was a bargain when it sold at 1k, and it's even more of a bargain now that you can find it for 100pp in the bazaar. 9/22 with a 14pt DD at level 1 is awesome, especially in the low levels when you have a damage cap and you can't get your money worth out of more expensive weapons.<br />
<br />
But if you can afford it, I've got to recommend the REIF. It's doesn't seem cheap at the time, but consider that if you spend 3-5k on one now, you won't have to buy another weapon - ever (until the next expansion, I should say). You won't get the proc at low-levels, but the amazing 12/19 ratio makes up for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i remember when i got my howling harpoon at lvl 39 in KC i was like &quot;yay! a stun that procs next lvl!&quot; has been my main piercer untill lvl 52...when we did the manor in kael and i gor a REIF.<br />
OMG<br />
awesome ratio, killer proc! i only use the HH when i need stuns.  the damage output i get with the REIF is amazing....and then it procs!<br />
very worth while weapon to get, altho im not sure what lvl it procs at.<br />
my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Selkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the explanation and the weapon suggestions.  As for soloing not being efficient until later, I guess I'm just glad to be able to solo -at all-, hehe. I guess I'll group if I want exp, and solo if I'm in that mood where ya just wish you had a neutron bomb.  (If you've played a totally group-dependent class past 50, you'll know what I mean. :p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">REIF procs at level 35. Still, a great spear to have at low levels due to the awesome ratio. If you're gonna melee, it's a great weapon. The big 2hb weapons are awesome too, but if you wanna carry a shield for ac/stats, the REIF owns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Selkie,<br />

My main is a 51 cleric. So I am also used to not being able to solo, or if I can, it is stuff that most shaman would not consider worth soloing. Since I chose the Shaman to be able to solo at all, I was surprised when many said soloing until 24 was painful. For me, it was a BREEZE. lol. I think it is a perspective thing. Check out my guide in the level 10-20 forum for how I did it with my Vah Shir. The zones will work whether you are Vah Shir or not. Post is named:  Vah Shir Shaman, 15-23<br />
<br />
I think I grouped for half of level 20, and most of level 38. Other than that, I was pretty much solo with a couple short duo sessions until level 39. I must say, Shamans rock! I am still mostly soloing and learning TONS on this board. The REIF is really quite nice, get one as soon as your AC is up to par. Make sure defense stays maxed, I had a pain getting mine up 20 points from level 38-41.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps a bit, hunt well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The reason your kiting doesnt seem  like its doing anything is cause you dont get your first 'real' dot till 24.<br />
<br />
Sicken/TB are very weak, and the 19dot isnt that much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yes, the real goodness starts at 24...went to frontier mountains and got to 34 in like a week =)</div></div><hr />
