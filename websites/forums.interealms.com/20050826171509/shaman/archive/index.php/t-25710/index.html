<br />
If I remember, it was like 2600 before..<br />
<br />
2800 - 2600..meh.  Has anyone noticed if the did a ninja inate sow?  Last I checked it still didn't have it.  I could be wrong..could be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No innate SoW. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While we are on it could someone over at SOE look at the recast time please? Cut it down to half or something. There is no reason for it being that long.<br />
<br />
Last i checked we can't 'pet canni' and when a horde of angry GoD or OoW mobs storms into camp, 'Super Fluffy' is the last spell i would consider casting for emergency - right after Talisman of Serpent  :D .<br />
<br />
It's just a stupid annoyance like so many tiny details in the shaman spell setup.</div></div><hr />
