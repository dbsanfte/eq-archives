<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been getting flags to go elemental but it has been a bit of patch work.  For example, I have Rallos Zek but lack MM and Agnarr.  Anyway, I have been to the seer numerous times and I now hate her, but I have been able to straighten out most of my prelagging stuff.  At this point, I have completed all three HoHo trials.  I never did AD tho and now very few if any guilds I know even bother with him.<br />
<br />
My question stems from something that several peeps in a high end guild at the FoH level told me awhile back.  They said you didnt need AD for Elemental access.  Although I have completed the 3 HoHo trials, I still can't zone into HoHoB but get the message, &quot;Although you have fought bravely, you still lack the will to enter the Temple of MM&quot;.  I can get piggyed in to kill MM but im wondering if the lack of haveing killed AD will result in my being unable to access the elementals once I've completed the remaining mobs I need?  Is my lack of having the AD flag the reason I cant zone into HoHoB as I assume it is?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
And please don't make me go back to that dang seer again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You do not need AD to get into the elemental planes. You can use the 85% rule to raid into HoHb and kill Mith Marr.<br />
<br />
And yes, the lack of AD is why you can't zone into HoHb. My fiance's rogue just has that issue the other day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got same problem. I am fully elemental flagged but have never killed AD. So yes it does work. I also need one of the SoL Ro minis. So although I can zone into PoFire,Earth, Air and water I cannot enter HoHB or Sol Ro's chamber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try seeing Maelin (gnome wizard in top of library) as well as the seer? couple 8months since i did that myself, but remember he had something to do with stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you don't need ANY of the sol ro minis if you piggyback into his room and get the flag from him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can back what they're all saying up. I only have 1 Sol Ro mini, and although I have all 3 HoH trials, I have never killed Aerin Dar.<br />
<br />
I was piggybacked in to HoHb for Mithaniel Marr, and also into Sol Ro's room for Sol Ro and can now freely zone into all the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
The message I get when trying to zone into HoHb is something like, &quot;You have fought with honor, but lack the valor&quot;.<br />
<br />
I still want AD for completeness and for the boost it gives to the charm, but I doubt my guild will ever do it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As the others already posted you don't need AD for EP access. The 85% rule is nice to get some peeps into the zones but it's a PITA to do so if you have 5+ without the required flag.<br />
<br />
Killing AD isn't that hard for an EP guild. Depending how fast you get the raid organized you should be done with the flag in a hour or less. You can bring your twinks / friends to get the flag too. With AD falg you should get an AA point and an update on the figurine too. This alone makes it worth to kill AD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I have to say here, killing AD is not that hard for an elemental guild, but getting them to go do it is. It still needs a sizeable number of people to kill, it's by all accounts an annoying fight, and an elemental guild would rather be hitting elemental targets with those sorts of numbers.<br />
<br />
My guild currently has 2 mains who don't have the AD flag and it's not worth spending an hour for a few drops that will go to alts because mains don't want, for a charm upgrade and AA for 2 mains, and for maybe a flag for a few alts.<br />
<br />
I might still want AD, and it's a pain having to piggyback in to MM who we still kill occasionally, but even if we don't have another target, I'm not going to ask my guild to take an hour to kill it just so I can get a charm upgrade and an AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Izarek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think flag sharing has changed a bit lately.  For a few months at least if you didn't have all 5 SolRo minis you couldn't enter SolRo's chamber.  I noticed this recently when my guild was doing backflagging for MM, all of the people who couldn't zone into HoHb without help wasn't able to be flag shared into HoHb.  For my shaman he lacked PoJ trial.  He had all HoH trials and AD.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There are times when raids become bugged even when you just formed em. Had that happen a couple times rescently where we formed up a raid outside PoAir or Fire or someplace, zoned in and none of the unflagged could zone in. Reform raid and they could get in. Your raid may have just been bugged if no one at all could get in.<br />
<br />
As far as sol ro's chamber goes I've never seen us not be able to get unflagged into his chamber. Back when we first started killing him there was some confusion because the 5 mini's flags disappeared when you got sol ro flag and people thought it flagged them to enter his chamber. It doesn't and you ended up with people unknowingly using up unflagged spots. Not as confusing anymore since the mini's show up even after getting sol ro flag now.<br />
<br />
As far as ad goes the only reason i could see doing him for an elemental or better flagged guild was if you lost enough old members that you couldn't reliably field enough people to do marr and needed to do him for reflagging. His loot is just almost total junk and he's rather hard for his level. Best solution is to try and buy flagging spots with lower tier guilds or flag share with them so you can get a few people flagged here and there.</div></div><hr />
