<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, folks, I need a little help here. I'm a level 52 Shaman, who's been 52 for WAY too long (Going on two months now). I'm also dirt poor, with no epic (nobody raids Fear on Saryrn), and no JBB.<br />
<br />
I need a way to pop up at least a few levels, with at least a moderate amount of cash to come with it. Preferably solo, because, every good grouping area is packed with level 60's farming for AA exp.<br />
<br />
So far, my experiences have been...<br />
<br />
Sebilis - Packed to the brim with AAexpers<br />
Velk's - Ditto<br />
Karnor's - Can we pretend this place doesn't exist?<br />
Katta - I like my faction, and can't split Nathyn's guards well<br />
Scarlet Desert - Pretty nice in the bloodtribe caves, spawn is slow<br />
Cobalt Scar - 20 people quadding at once. Fun!<br />
Jaggedpine - Nice zone, but absolute hell on my machine<br />
HK Nobles - Perma-farmed. Camp-stealing rampages. Reminds me of the old days in the HK area.<br />
Seafuries - Mind-numbingly slow. Hefty HP for little return<br />
Felwithe Guards - Pains in the butt to slow and kill, nice cash, low exp.<br />
<br />
I've even gone so far as to try The Grey, Grieg's (That was a disaster), and Cabilis guards (Heh... Not worth the trouble)<br />
<br />
C'mon guys, help a lowbie highbie out.<br />
<br />
My magelo, for what it's worth: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=80907<br />
<br />
Planning to get some 6 / 65 rings as soon as cash permits.</div></div><hr />

Right zone, wrong mobs.  Kill revs and revers in the south wall camp.  It's not fun, but the xp will get out outta 52 so you can move on the HHK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hello,  I also play 60 shammie on saryrn and if I were you I would try kc for some exp at 52.  Still a good place to exp.  I also have a tear in bank.  I play wierd times, but look me up and maybe we work something out.  There are quit a few guilds that still raid fear, its just finding them doing it at the right times.  Jyphant is name of shammie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did a post on Kedge Keep. You might want to try soloing there one 2nd floor (east cubbyhole is safest, or you can try south if a little more brave). Just need alot of fish scales or an EB item to do this and be sure to read up on everything you can about Kedge before doing it. There's an &quot;ultimate guide to kedge keep&quot; I found off one of the big EQ sites but I forget the page offhand. Find that and read it, and reread it. The preperation may be kind of a pain but once you go in knowing what's there and how cautious you need to be, the reward (of xp) is well worth it in my opinion. Lately though the south cubbyhole in Kedge (at least on mith mar) has turned dangerous for some reason. Pirhanna spawns pop up there when you least expect it at times, and not from just killing the tiny fish either (which is a no-no) but weird multiple-pops in south cubbyhole that were not happening a few weeks ago, so something's changed about the dungeon I think. XP was nice at 53 to 54, so I bet at 52 you could do 2nd floor as well. - Warmag of MM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PolarAxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can you pull the revs in SD one at a time, or do you end up with all of 'em if you're trying this solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was about to post the same question.  I dunged 51 and realized I have nowhere to group but KC right now :(  <br />
<br />
Maiden's Eye is the one you left out, but I've never been able to get a group there.  Noone is going to take a 51 shaman when there are so many 60s LFGing all the time.</div></div><hr />

Can you pull the revs in SD one at a time, or do you end up with all of 'em if you're trying this solo? <br />
<br />
They can be pulled one at a time with dots or slows and will no add unless you are within melee range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Racknar,<br />
<br />
Define not fun. Long fights? Low xp (contradicts your post), much downtime? Slow spawns? Or....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Guilds still do fear on Saryrn, you just gotta know which ones.<br />
<br />
My guild(Isengard) is doing fear tonight, but since it was completely cleared yesterday, the golems probably wont be up, and I'd gladly invite you to come along(the guild is always very cool about people coming along if they want epic pieces that noone else needs) but we have 2 shaman who need the tear, including myself, so i believe you'd be out of luck.  <br />
<br />
People do clear fear every now and then, just got to learn which guilds do what.  Isen has become very epic orientated lately for example, yesterday we got 2 people their epics, or atleast did almost all of the second persons, and tonight we have half our guys in fear and a couple groups in com to do reavers/ghiosk neh etc.<br />
-<br />
<br />
As to where:  Im currently hunting in CoM, soloing the u turn, SO BACK OFF :P  its pretty good exp, but for the life of me, i cant find that gdamn spectral courier in the stables(or when i do, he drops that damn scroll...3 or 4 times straight, no log).<br />
<br />
If your not in a guild, find one.  I suggest Shade's of Friends as a small guild of some of the nicest people i know.  Talk to the officers, they are really nice.  They do pog alot, often in the area's were teh bears are(drop shaman gear) so youll be fine in their hands :)  I believe they were in Air yesterday too.  Small guild, they are really focused on having a good time and making great cash(they do groups up in pog, sell the stuff then split the returns amoung everyone.  I was in the guild for a short bit before i came to isengard and made alot of cash).<br />
<br />
A Guild will solve alot of your woes right there...<br />
<br />
As to the kedge keep guy: the ultimate guide can be found from the KK map on eqatlas.  Theres a link there.<br />
-<br />
<br />
Try COM(only when im not on! lol), pull at long ranges with slow, and youll be able to single everything, or do Rockhoppers in DSP.<br />
<br />
Flawless/Superb hopper hides go for over a hundred plat at any given time(though due to stupid merchants Flawless has randomly jumped up to 200-500, which is completley ridiculous, so expect fast sales if you put it at its old price of 130-150.<br />
<br />
HQ hides are 20-25 :)<br />
<br />
Silk swatches and leather padding are fantastic money makers...go to lguk and have your pet eat up all the spiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">spliting the guard in katta is cake , just stand far enough away and you will not get any adds. i have never once gotten a add this way .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Xertt, Jyphant, I just may take you guys up on that. :D <br />
<br />
After bouncing around zone to zone, I discovered the wonder of partnering in Fungus Grove. Nothing quite as nice as casting Turgur's wile a mage epic pet beats on something, giving me the full hit of the new exp bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I also found that Katta is an excellent place to hunt at 52, maybe even a bit earlier if you have good ac.  Last night I was able to take on two at a time without my pet, just root pulled and then slow - root - dot one then the other to split the spawn. <br />
<br />
Best place I saw for this was down by the bank and up by the graveyard.  The respawn time is about 8 or 10 minutes I think so after the initial split you can take on a two guard spawn pretty much non-stop.</div></div><hr />
