<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm starting this thread mostly out of curiosity (okay, and a healthy dose of boredom while I sit at work wasting my time).   <br />
<br />
What race did you pick for your shaman and why?<br />
<br />
I'll start: I went shaman with my dwarf priest.  Hadn't really planned to since I was so used to shamans getting the shaft from EQ1, but saw a friend of mine on her shaman soloing blue ^^ group mobs at level 18.  I'd already made a dwarf (my EQ guild opened a branch in EQ2 and picked Qeynos alignment) priest at that point, and after some consideration I decided that a dwarven shaman would be pretty cool.  After all, dwarves and barbarians had enough in common to get the 2 races lumped into the same Qeynos village, so why not a dwarven shaman?</div></div><hr />

Love the Barbarians. (Especially the EQ1 Barbarians with their Kilts and Scottish theme.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've grown quite attached to being an Ogre in EQ, so the transition to EQ2 for me was an obvious choice. Actually, being a Shaman was a secondary consideration. I was bouncing back and forth between Warrior and Shaman for awhile. I eventually settled on Shaman when I heard we got Wards as our main specialty.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">H00000man! We be everywhere mon!<br />
<br />
No reason really....my last gig in EQ1 was a DESK, also been a barb, vahshir, iksar....short races really dont appeal to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Barbarian Mystic...  <br />
<br />
Main reason I picked Barbarian is cause I typically always get agro and I like to play a good aligned race and the barbarian was an obvious choice for me...  and Dasha da Barbarian Shaman was my second life for over 5 years I thought way to long to switch roles....<br />
<br />
Dasha Barbarian Shaman eq<br />
Dasha Barbarian Mystic eq2<br />
hmmm notice a trend...</div></div><hr />

My second choice would have been gnome. Might save that for the monk twink though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After 5 years of being an ogre shaman in EQ1, I never even considered being anything different :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Erudite.  Just for the heck of it.  He's not a a shaman yet, but will be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zeltaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I first started a Barbarian priest, but I dont know why, I just wasnt happy with the model for her, and being that big boned was sometimes rather hazardous. *LOL* So I deleated that char and made a High elf priest like I had in Beta. I like being an elf, but I also just wish the devs had made the barbarian models a little better. :( I love being a barbarian shaman in EQ1, but I also like my High Elf Shaman in EQ2 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There is only one true race for a shaman: iksar. All other races are only weak softskins! And every broodling knows that you need scales and a tail to be a powerfull shaman. :)</div></div><hr />
