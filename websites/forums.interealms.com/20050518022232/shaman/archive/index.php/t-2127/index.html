<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yard trash mobs drop spells there? Or just the dragons? <br />
<br />
Didnt have my key last time the guild went, but did manage to score a copy of Pox from a kind guildmate. Topor did drop for the shaman that went...as well as a spear of constriction....mmmmmm spear........<br />
<br />
Any other shamanly drops I should have my eye out for in there? My bracers seriously suck, anything for me there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yard trash drops spells, Phara Dar drops a really nice back item, pretty much NToV quality, for casters/priests. Mostly VP drops stuff for int casters, and *gasp* most of the click-nuke varieties are actually pretty useful.<br />
<br />
The weapons that drop there are basically toys if your guild's capable of NToV or better, I don't recall any good bracer dropping there though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">when the hammer drops, go linkdead &quot;accidentally&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Probably, your guild isn't going to kill a lot of the trash stuff if they are serious about clearing it.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because some spawn that see invis and some spawn that don't see invis.<br />
<br />
Your raid leaders will probably kill just enough so that the mobs you have to pass don't see invis.  They probably won't kill any that don't see invis due to the risk of a see invis mob spawning.<br />
<br />
Bring your patience, VP is a game of waiting.  Hosh and Silverwing cross each other's roaming paths so the initial pull is a waiting game for Hosh to be deep in his lair before the pull.<br />
<br />
Be prepared for odd mob warping, mobs that gate away (Hosh is bad for this, kill him in his lair if at all possible).<br />
<br />
The drops in VP aren't too bad for shaman.  Hammer of the Dragonborn, Spear of Constriction.  Phara Dar loot is especially nice.  You can see the drops here: http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=93<br />
<br />
Some of the fights are really fun and require tactics that we don't use anywhere else &quot;wurm herding&quot; heh!  Make sure you get all the melees to bind in one place for easy CR!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe VP's considerably easier if you have a substantial number of MB wizards availible. With even 2 MB wizards Phara Dar will go from being one of the most annoying mobs in the game to something that dies in about 30 secs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Like Gloriana said, you won't be killing much yard trash. I think some people CoH from Hoshkar/Silverwing safe spot to the pool room. Even if you don't CoH there, you'll end up invising up to the lava drakes, killing 2 drakes, a few raptors and a couple of wurms. Then you're in the pool room. At this point bards and rogues work out how to pull the dragons solo to the pool room. <br />
<br />
Phara Dar's earring and crown are both nice for shamans, though the crown is a little light on the AC. She gets manaburned on our server, along with Hoshkar and Silverwing. Cheating wizards!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ok I have to ask has anyone seen that hammer that procs the group PE? I have heard its from Grieg's and also from RoF in acrylia.  My guild is going to start farming VP to fill out kunark spells again for some classes and I am dreading getting the hammer :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">lots of hours invested for precious little these days.<br />
<br />
PD is about the only thing worth killing<br />
<br />
just pray the number of see-invis wurms is very small for the quickest clearing possible, else its the most boring event, in fact i'd rather gauge my eyes out with rusty teaspoons that go do VP.<br />
<br />
nice for casters aye.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, it's not really bad....it just requires you to bag your primary weapon and shield, equip the two handed hammer and right click PER person.  It's a nice buff (adds 20 extra sta) but doesn't stack with agility or avatar.<br />
<br />
As soon as you're done buffing with the hammer, you say, &quot;anyone else need Primal Essence?&quot; (crickets...random cyber) &quot;Okay, putting the hammer away!&quot; Get out your trusty spear and shield combo.  lame_warrior01 tells you, &quot;I need PE!&quot; Grrr, repeat.</div></div><hr />

I can imagine how annoying that is... it's annoying without having to switch gear. My pet peeve is<br />
<br />
Me: give me tells for *insert buffs here*<br />
*I now get 12 tells*<br />
Me: Ok, anyone else needs this buff?<br />
*crickets*<br />
Me: last call, anyone need this?<br />
*crickets*<br />
*remem spells to what I need now*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have a trick I do for people in my buff cycle before raiding.<br />
<br />
I send out the call for folks who need focus to come SIT DOWN in front of me. If they are not sitting in front of me they don't get the buff. <br />
<br />
That stops the rampant running around and lends a small bit of civility to the process. Also when they are kneeling in front of me it does allow me a second to gloat that the bastards better be worshipping me. (Laughs)<br />
<br />
Once they get thier Buff I tell them to get the hell away from me so I can keep track. <br />
<br />
Then for Group buffs I get the leader of the groups name and Make a hot key with thier name saying get next to %t if you want Stamina. <br />
<br />
It seems to work fairly well. But I have had a contest of wills before with clueless jerks that don't want to sit down. Damn shame they don't get buffed.<br />
<br />
Your Milage may vary of course.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, I can't really get mean about it right now, I have to suck it up and just deal with it since I'm a guild n00b and want to become a guild full member. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It really does get much better at 60...with group focus, group sta and group agi, you can almost leave them up all the time.  I realized awhile ago it wasn't really buffing that annoyed me, it was all the constant spell swapping.  Now, I mem the combat spells that I'm responsible for and generally still have room for buffs as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If your guild has primal weapons the hammer is pretty ok to lug around. Avatar overwrites primal essence.<br />
<br />
I always keep the PE buff up instead of agi (they dont stack either) since PE gives me 60 extra hps and that extra dex i use to proc weapons for pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The Primal Cudgel is the one with the group PE..its 20 to str/dex/sta/agi andstacks with everything accept AGI..only draw back is that it doesn't work with /tgb..but it is one handed,and isn't all that below epic so you can actually use it for a while instead of swapping its like.. 10str/stam 15wis 100 mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was wondering about it from the perspective of a shaman in a guild where most melees have primal and maxed sta anyway.  I'm in a guild like that, and have the three VP medallions finished.  So, it's just a matter of time before I have a chance to loot the hammer.  The shamans in my guild don't seem to think it's a big deal, and don't seem to be overloaded by it. Of the active players, I think there's four hammers at most raids (usually around 4-6 shamans).  I didn't really care about it until I got my first taste of PE on myself.  Now, I want the thing just to self-buff.  20 sta is awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've attemped 4-5 VP clearings and several &quot;hey, it's a Tuesday, why don't we go kill Silverwing?&quot; events.<br />
<br />
Only one hammer has ever dropped!  It definitely hasn't been common to us.  Silverwing is a bitch, we also haven't had one of those nice bard lutes drop either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Oaklanbash_Vaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My guild has been farming VP the last month a bit (although there is a guild called Smooth that has 4 mana burn wizzies and clear VP with a single group).  We have had some really good luck.  3 Rend Robes, 2 Mage Lavadiamond staves, 3 Phara Dar cloaks, 1 Phara Dar earing, 1 Phara Dar robe, 4 Silverwing hammers (I had no choice, I had to loot the last one, doh).  What was posted before is correct.  Just plan on being CoHed to the first safe spot hallway where you pull Hoskhar and Silverwing to.  Then CoH to the 2nd safe spot and kill the 2 lava drakes/2 raptor spawn and run to the last place you will move to for the rest of the night.  The remaining 4 dragons can all be pulled with ease to this spot.  We have yet to do what Legacy of Steel did a few weeks ago, have a screenshot with the remaining 4 dead at once.<br />
<br />
But be warned, our first clear took over 5 hours with 23 people, and we didn't even kill Phara Dar.  Of course now we have 5+ wizzies with Manaburn and 40+ per trip, so it takes us 90 minutes at most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Silkenshammie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">VP can be fun.  Personally, I believe any guild that just coh's around is missing out on the enjoyable part of it.<br />
<br />
The rampage of killing your way into the pool room is actually the highpoint of the raid for most people I've taken through vp.  Dipping into the barrel to find out what your next GW variant is going to be, beating the split that contains 2 dispellers and resplits to a 1550 hitter .. makes a real change from sitting around waiting for hosh/sw to stop dancing with each other so you can pull them to zi.<br />
<br />
PS The guardian wurms have in the past had fairly respectable droprates on malo/torpor etc but something seems to have changed recently.  There's either a new variant or a vastly changed poprate on a new variant gw.<br />
<br />
We used to jump in there with an exp group once every few weeks to farm spells and for the fun of it .. but the last time we went after the first 9 or 10 gw's we popped a 1550 hitter that had massive regen.  I mean .. 2 warriors, monk, ranger wailing on it for 4 minutes with me keeping it under constant epic, bane, ebolt and we couldn't move the hp bar.  In the end, we camped out and sacrificed a melee or two.  So .. we thought &quot;bugged gw, np we move&quot;.  Invised up to the Hosh pullspot and started pulling to there .. great spot you can just keep a stream of gw's coming in as fast as your mana can take them.  Half an hour later, what do you know but we get another of the &quot;super-regen gw's&quot; .. this one we managed to see it's healthbar move when the cleric started nuking ( wasn't a 1550 hitter ) but it regenned back to full the next tick every time.   Soo .. we root it off, leave a torpored monk to tank it and camp out.    Come back and figure we can avoid it pulling other gw's .. and then of course another 30-45 mins later we spawn yet another super-regen gw.<br />
<br />
Sooo .. either we just had a hellish night or VI have decided to nerf spell-farming groups in there :)<br />
<br />
But seriously .. if your guild is just starting on vp .. do everyone a favour and don't coh around .. pull sw and hosh to zonein using a bard and good scouting ( plus antigate measures ), go on a killing rampage up to the poolroom then sit around while your bard/rogue team does the work.</div></div><hr />
