HEH what song are you using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HEH what song are you using?<br />
<br />
Song is called Swords in the Wind By ManOWar.  You might have missed it but the Song artist and Album is shown near the end of the film</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not bad, but it's a little long to use as a webpage intro.  Of course, if you're just making it to show off your guild, it looks pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">wow ! those hackers made me very afraid !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I kinda like that song once it gets going :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My brother and I had a man a war tape way back in teh  day and I loved it. I haven't listened to em much recently but I always loved the story and most of the songs on that album.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zizaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well for someone's first attempt at Flash I'd say it was ok... being a flash developer I have to say the loading part jumps around alot and looked like crap and the text looks really bad might try some shadowing or beveling to make it stand off the pictures.  Also its a bit long for an intro to a website.  With a little tweaking it could be looking really good :)</div></div><hr />
