<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slacethehard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I popped into PoV to finish off an aa killing a few golems, had my pet buffed and ready when I get to west wall there is a group there already so I go to North wall and finish my aa in 5-6 kills. <br />
<br />
The other group ask me to buff them with wunshi and fortitude which I gladly do, I'm about to leave when they pull a golem, my dogdog is fully buffed with Wunshi, Str of Diaku, Speed of Vallon, FA and Spirit of the Leopard I send in the pet for free dps as I slow with TA and let dogdog have his way with the Golem as the group beat the golem down the group was a lvl 66 pally, 65 shaman (with pet), 65 cleric, 65 Ench, 60 Ranger, 65 druid now I guess they were'nt going all out DPS but when the mob died I got the xp!! just with dogdog no dot's the SoL proc was going off every round at last we have a decent pet! cannot wait for Panther!<br />

&quot;Those that brag, will only see regret from that which is taken away&quot;</div></div><hr />

Please close this thread.<br />

edit: ...just looking at the group, it doesn't look like there were much of a dps group anyway and depending on how much they were slacking, they wouldn't be difficult to KS using higher level DoTs even. Jesus, this is probably the most irresponsible thread I've ever seen on these boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It must be true because I zoned into fire and was at the tables the other day. There was a raid doing Fennin and I waited behind them all, when they pulled Fennin I sent the pet in. He ks'd the whole raid. man. it's the truth.<br />

No need for evidence, it's the truth!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One time a GM came to answer my petition, and I accidentally hit /pet attack instead of h for hail and puppy still had Panther on from the MoB I just killed. The GM went down like (insert your server's most famous cyber celebrity here) and I was, like, 'Oh, snap. Pwnt. You got Tupac'd!'<br />
<br />
I see us getting nerfed. We're obviously overpowered. I mean, a Time+ Shaman (since you have your TA) with his pet just as well buffed, if not better buffed since he had FA, than the people there, who could very well have been from a family guild using epic 1.0s, must obviously be overpowered, since puppy ranks out a high amount of DPS since, you know, pets have naturally low dex so adding dex makes them proc more. And, you know, maybe the Ranger or the Druid were AFK, or slacking, or didn't have many AAs, or anything else.<br />
<br />
People. Please. Try to unknot your undergarments out of 'the pinch' and flossmode. In the groups I play in, where I will sometimes sit outside of group to slow/buff so a friend with fewer AAs can soak them up with the group, there is no chance in hell of puppy stealing the XP. Or of my stealing the XP if I dotted the sh*t out of the MoBs, too.<br />
<br />
But, really, let people hyperventilate this. Let them point and screech like some B-movie screamer in pumps and lingerie getting chased by some hockey mask wearing burn victim dressing in his mother's clothes and making phone calls to his victims while roaming, wasting their daytime talk minutes, and not using T-Mobile for the nice rollover minutes. Let them think what they want. The spell is perfectly balanced as it is. The spell cost, the duration, the damage output - I can, and do, run out of mana keeping this up in groups. I only put Panther up on pets now, or I'll swap out Leopard if the tank or one of the DPS requests it so I can keep that, and my other duties, going.<br />
<br />
Until then, I'll continue to laugh at the disproprtionately small peepee syndrome people feel when they see things like this, or at Wizards twitching and shaking like Robert Downey Jr. walking into rehab.<br />
<br />
Hell. Bet I can walk into PoV on my server, find a group, sic leoparded puppy on their kill, and not get the XP at all.<br />
<br />
Matter of fact, I'll try it this weekend. Just to debunk this whole thread and make other classes feel better about their, uh, 'small' problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if this is going to get nerfed, its going to get nerfed regardless of whether or not we post about it. the devs KNOW what goes on in the game.<br />
<br />
they may not watch us killing, but they know where we are, what we're doing, and what we're killing, they have all the numbers and information in front of them. they can tell when an exploit is there because they can see unusual activity.<br />
<br />
the spell is how it is for the time being, I &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;don't&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; see this being nerfed because newer content goes alot like older content with this spell line. the mobs have alot of HP. you may seem to think they don't, try going a few fights without leopad/panther. you'll see a big difference.<br />
<br />
so it's trivializing older content. same thing thats been happening for years. any 65+ in the right bazaar gear can solo Gore. and Gore wasn't trivial content when Kunark first came out.<br />
<br />
the limits of the spell come with its duration and mana cost. of course a higher-end shaman can keep this up on several targets at once, an average/casual shaman may not.<br />
<br />
the point is, if it were going to be nerfed, it probably would have been already.<br />
<br />
oh....and I've out-DPS'd entire groups. before DoN, before OoW. I was a lvl 60 doing PoJ trials if that gives you an idea.. a nerf will come if they see it as unbalancing. I think that they view this spell as not pure shaman DPS, but a shared DPS, a group utility. sure it helps Solo ability with a pet, but that really only works with mobs you can tank. (and don't kid yourself, if you're putting this on your pet solo, you're tanking, you tank MUCH better than your pet does.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have to agree with XO here.<br />
<br />
Those of you who can keep this on 6 melee/pet types every pull are just as relatively strong in gear and AAs.<br />
<br />
For those of us who can only slow and keep this up on two toons every other pull, it's great, but not unbalancing. It's better than dotting, because when they switch targets, the power goes with them. That's the real bonus.</div></div><hr />
