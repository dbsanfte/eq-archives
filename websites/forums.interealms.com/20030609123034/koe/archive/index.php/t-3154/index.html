<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I was just thinking of this.  Why don't I go ahead and get a group or two together (a group of 50's could easily do it) and kill the pops for my burning embers off of the named wurm (nebekezenar?) while I can get great exp off of them?  In fact, basically I'm just forming an experience group in Burning Woods, but I want to be killing the 90 second spawn for a few hours to see if we can get a burning ember to drop.  So half and half, exp and loot, but if you are around level 50, feel free to join me for exp/loot in Burning woods!<br />
Why wait until level 55 when I'd barely get exp :p<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not going to do this without a cleric.  We can still kill for exp, but I don't want to try the epic mob because with adds and everything a cleric is imperative (also for rezzes, lol).  Speaking of which, I wouldn't mind having an enchanter for the adds either, but it's not as imperative.  Thanks!<br />
<br />
I'd like to be killing on Saturday the 29th earlier in the day, perhaps noon.  I'll say between 11 am and 12 pm EST because I have stuff to do later that day. <br />
