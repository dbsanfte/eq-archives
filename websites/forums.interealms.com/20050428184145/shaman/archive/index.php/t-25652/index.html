<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rezzo Excelion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
Does anyone remember exactly what percent AA per solo kill you were receiving at lvl 62 while killing PoV Golems?<br />
<br />
I'm currently lvl 61 and can make lvl 62 within a few kills, but don't see the point in lvling to 62 if it means a big drop in the percent per kill on the Golems.  I am personally in no real hurry to reach 70 and I am presently having fun working on AAs.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cant say for sure about 62, but at 65 I got 6% per kill.  Since you get full xp +/- 5 levels (correct me if I'm mistaken), it should be pretty much the same to around 67ish.  Golems are 62 if I recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rezzo Excelion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well if that is the case, then I think I will go ahead and lvl to 62...and possibly further.  I just didn't want to hurt, what I consider, decent AA exp per kill.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not entirely correct.  The higher your level, the less xp you will get per kill.  The +/-5 lvl rule is that if a mob is that much greater or less then your level, the xp is siginificantly diminished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rezzo Excelion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There never seems to be a simple answer for anything.  <br />
<br />
Oh well, I appreciate the input from everyone.  I think I will just continue to lvl on and see how it goes.  <br />
<br />
I could always de-lvl if exp slows down too much. :P<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Airwhale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I get around 8% as a level 61 froglock per kill... takes about 10 minutes of work with click root and VP.<br />
<br />
I've decided that it is not really worth it, I'll be able to kill them so much faster with my new dots at 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rezzo Excelion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's interesting, but you seem to be getting a bit more exp per kill then I do, or did, at 61.  I was averaging around 6.5% per kill.  <br />
<br />
Yeah it kind of sucks taking 10 mins per kill, but for me it's worth it.  (BTW I also use ornate click root and VP 1.)    I solo nearly 100% of the time and considering the risk involved I think 6% AA per kill is OK.  I don't do groups and finding decent solo spots for a so-so geared shaman is a bit challenging.<br />
<br />
---They are going tons faster now that I have the Canni AA, but I also agree that getting our non root-breaking dots at 64/65 will speed things up even more.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.</div></div><hr />
