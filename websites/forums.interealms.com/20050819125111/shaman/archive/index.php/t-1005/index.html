I have started loading both Torgor's and Turgur's during raids.  It seems that Torgor's has a much (and I mean MUCH) lower taunt than Turgur's.  What I am doing now is opening with Torgor's and, with slight difference in slow %, casting Turgur's if necessary.  Even if I bounce a Turgur's the mob is already slowed and less apt to try to beat the living **** out of me.<br />
<br />
If the mob is going rapidly and the tanks are not getting clobbered, I just let Torgor's sit there.  Saves a little bit of mana for me.<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice the drastic difference between the taunt levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no you're not seeing things...togors has always had a much lower taunt that turgurs.</div></div><hr />

Lower agro, easier to land, lower mana cost...<br />
...shorter duration time, longer cast time, lower slow percentage.<br />
<br />
There are many times like one you illustrated where using the lower level slows is beneficial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">More mana (250 vs 175), tougher to land, and more taunt...   for 5% more slowing.<br />
<br />
I'm only level 47 so I can't only speak from firsthand experience, but that sure doesn't sound like much of an improvement to me (unless I need to get it off in a hurry, or if a fight is going to last longer than Togors'.) <br />
<br />
Am I missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nope, superior cast time and duration, you nailed the two big advantages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are soloing then Turgurs is the way to go because the mob is going to try and beat the tar out of you either way so the extra 5% and the duration make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Togor's always was resisted much more then turgur for me.  The extra mana I saved casting Togor's instead of Turgurs was needed for all the resists I got.</div></div><hr />
