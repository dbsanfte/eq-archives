I shelled out a JB BP, regrowth of dar, and tailsman of eruption for torpor but this has to beat it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is funny, I paid (WAY) more for Tigir's than I did for Torpor.<br />
<br />
Something like coldain skin gloves and 30k for Tigir's.  Was bidding against another shaman who was pissed as hell that he didn't get it.<br />
<br />
Torpor cost me around 10k + a cleric helm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Prices on very rare items vary tremendously because the market<br />
is so limited in both the supply side and the demand side.  People who are patient and plan ahead will do just fine.<br />
<br />
I hate siting in EC and doing nothing but I just love the  new market chanel. I paid 17k for the first copy of torpor and it had been in the market for about 3 days.  Just no one to buy it.  The 30k profit baught me a lot of new gear, a nag, and I still have a nice chunk of change for when a nice price on a copy of Malo turns up.  If it gets bad I just sell the horse :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Someone was offering 60k for Torpor yesterday on Bristlebane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I paid 85k for torpor when it first came out, or the equivalent rather:  50k cash plus my fungi tunic(worth 35k, well before they nerfed the fungi drop rates).  Selling the fungi at the peak of its market value on my server would have turned that into a 150k deal.<br />
<br />
Standard pricing for torpor then was 100k if and when you could buy it, which was virtually never.  There was a big backlog of shamans without torpor, and so they virtually always went to shamans in your guild if your guild got one, and if you weren't in a guild capable of getting one -- too bad.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness they upped the drop rate.</div></div><hr />
