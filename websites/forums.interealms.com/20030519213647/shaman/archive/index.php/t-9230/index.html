So just general opinions on this item. I got it for a steal in the bazaar and I may just resell it, but what do you think of using this when i am not meleeing. I know I know it's a book but 10% mana save on any beneficial spell over 3 seconds (no heals) is pretty good for what I paid for it. Think using this would make me into a shauid? I think even it it does I may still use it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Color me stupid, but isn't Focus of Mithanel a spell haste and not mana preservation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">focus is mana savings.<br />
<br />
Haste, quickness etc are hastes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You might want to hold onto it and use it in primary till you get your epic finished.  If you like the focus effect enough to dump your shield post-epic then keep the Writ.  Trading out a few hp and ~20 AC for a 10% mana savings is not all that bad a deal depending on your playstyle and how you view your character.<br />
<br />
I personally would sell it for gross amounts of money to a druid and use the cash towards something else. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks for the opinions guys i think i'm going to keep it. i am so lazy when it comes to my epic, i'm really not sure why i am not working on it =) i only paid 5k for the writ so i'm sure i can always sell it for craploads if i ever finish my epic up</div></div><hr />

No, in a month or two, it won't be worth craploads but rather a few hundred plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">youd be surprised what people pay for in the bazaar. i regularly overprice items by a fair amount and leave them on trader and they -always- sell. hell people are buying stacks at a time of celestial essences from us at 10p each, and they cost what, 3p to make? never underestimate people's laziness and lack of reseach =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I also scored a Writ of Wisdom for 5k in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Somedays i have it in secondary and some days I use it in primary and bag Epic.<br />
<br />
Depends whether mobs are dying too fast for epic to be of any use or whether I am getting beaten on alot and think the extra AC will help.<br />
<br />
REAL handy effect though. Between that Writ and a Sharp-Clawed Ahlspiess (Affliction Eff IV) I pretty much save mana on everything except Nukes.<br />
<br />
WTB Mana Pres 4 item $$</div></div><hr />

<br />
What benifitial spells do I cast that are over 3 seconds? Remember, this rules out Torpor... let's see... BUFFS! Well, honestly, I buff once an hour and a half, if that. I'm on SCR2, working on SCRM, so then it'll be closer to every two hours. <br />
<br />
Saving mana on buffs really isn't worth it to me. There's better items out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">for me its great because it takes off mana for chloroblast. and i buff alot it seems and i am noticably saving gobs of mana and gives me less downtime to be back and ready to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Now I thought it was said earlier it only works on spells that are over 3 minutes? So it owuld not work on chloroblast. Maybe regrowth, but I never bother with that except on myself.</div></div><hr />

Epic DOT sucks in POP. Takes way too long to cast and only does like 1200 or so damage? I can get off a couple of Velium Strikes and double that. I'll still use the epic if I solo but in normal exp groups it sucks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">But if I took away my epic, people would think I'm a beastlord again!<br />
<br />
Auuughhh.<br />
<br />
I haven't been mistaken since I got my epic. <br />
<br />
Last night, waiting for a raid to start at greig's end (waiting in DSP), I got annoyed over and over for buffs. I pulled out my 6th cudgel, and whala, people quit asking me for buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">focus of mithanel (or however you spell it) works on all spells with a cast time of 3 seconds and over that are beneficial and aren't cheals or % heals. so it does work on chloroblast =) it goes off every time i cast it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Affliction Efficiency IV &gt;&gt; Mana Preservation IV<br />
<br />
I recently got sharp claw asspiece, and between that, torpor and canni (and I don't even have canni 5), I never ever ever have mana problems.  I usually have too much mana (after malosini, slow, bane, and ebolt), and load blast of poison and shoot it once or twice or CB a melee or something.<br />
<br />
I dunno, 10% off of beneficial spells only seems even less worth losing a good ac/hp slot.</div></div><hr />
