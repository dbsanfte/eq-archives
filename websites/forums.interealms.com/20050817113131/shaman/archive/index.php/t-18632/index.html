<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd be happy to add another forum for WoW shaman, will bring it up with the head honcho and rest of the mod staff and see what we can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Ranger's Glade already has their own WoW forum for Hunters (http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/forumdisplay.php?forumid=26), so I don't see why we couldn't have one for Shaman.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see the EQOA Shaman boards reinstated, too. It's really picked up in popularity since Frontiers' release, but there really isn't a lot of good information for Shaman because it's not a widely played class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">awesome. Now we just need WoW to come out :(</div></div><hr />

I myself and most people I know love our game &quot;everquest&quot; and will continue doing our thing in norrath no matter how many &quot;MMORPG_002&quot; products come on the market .<br />
Everquest 2 , WoW ... Im just not interested .<br />
Four years &quot;nearly&quot; of great entertainment and 65 levels and pushing 300aa .. Everquest has been and continues too be a blast . I seriously doupt WoW has a dramatic effect on EQ or these boards .</div></div><hr />

There comes a point at which people get sick of a certain game. Eq has been irreversably destroyed in the eyes of some players. Sure there are now hardcore players who for example still play quake 1. But they are few. Some will stay with EQ however a lot of ppl will at least *TRY* wow because it promises to be the game eq once was and even better.<br />
Blizzard is also making it and they never go wrong with their games. They take the time and they actually PLAY their games and LISTEN to players. So the release of WOW is a lot more bigger than u think. SOE knows this and their legs are beginning to shake. A lot of ppl will never play another SOE game cause they are fed up with the way the company is run. Blizzard on the other hand has an excellent reputation.<br />
<br />
But time will tell....<br />

/em goes back to lurking.<br />

*cough* Diablo2 Expansion *cough*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Diablo 2: LoD was and continues to be quite a success and enjoyment for many, many people.<br />
<br />
Of course, WoW won't be out until some time in 2010, but it will still be --at least-- a decent game =-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No one is talking about the forum dying or everyone must leave EQ when WoW or EQ2 comes out. My angle was more to the point of if we were going to make a shaman section or allow shaman info to be exchanged here regardless of the game it related too.  <br />
<br />
I think its a good idea to give it a separate section though, it would get jumbled up if it was all in one spot and then there are the people that would never stop complaining how WoW shaman suck cause in EQ you can do this or how EQ sucked cause shaman in WoW get a rez. Thats a head ache no one wants i think.<br />
<br />
Anyway, EQ was a great game and like soul said, there is some people that are happy with things and never need to change. There are quake1 hardcore players, there is SiN hardcore players, there is tetris hardcore players, doesnt matter what it is, there usualy is a community hanging on to it and enjoying it. I used to be one of them infact. But these days i find it better to move on a certain point and EQ is just at that point for me. No reflection of the game itself, just time to roll on is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree , im sure a lot of people have played EQ in the past and have moved on too outher games . Im sure that a lot of people will continue too move on too WoW and outher games still .<br />
Im also sure some people have moved on from EQ only too return too EQ at a later time .<br />
My point is this .. after four years I have heard about the &quot;EQ killers&quot; so much that I dont really belive they exist . EQ is a good game , a LOT of people really love too log on and play every day . EQ isnt going anywhere IMO for a long time if ever .<br />
As far as adding forums for outher games , ect . I think thats really cool . I might even play WoW a bit like I did DAoC and SWG . But when I play outher games its as a diversion I know inside I will ALLWAYS come home too norrath . I think there are a lot of people that feel that way .</div></div><hr />
