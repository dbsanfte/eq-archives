<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious what kind of ratio there is of people who bought Gates of Discord to people who didn't.  Ok, I figured out how to post a poll :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bought it and love it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What he said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NharviSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bought it.. and soon realized.. this expasion isn't made for ppl who likes to solo or duo either =(<br />
<br />
I rarely play in full groups, I rather duo with a good friend or two and have a fun time, than being in a group with retards (as is the case on my server). /sigh.. o well.. maby next expansion will hold something for me.. /shrug<br />
<br />
I could live without GoD to be honest. And as a side-note, the mobs are ugly! Very dissapointing in the way they have made them... we are basically back in Kunark imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bought it because I got it for $20 and I'm sure my guild will raid there at some point. So far the only thing I've seen that I actually like is the tribute system. Haven't had time to really check out the zones though and everyone already knows my opinions on the spells and AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Didn't buy it, haven't missed anything because I didn't have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Didn't buy it and then I quit before anyone else managed to buy it for me.  Pressing the end billing button was almost a relief.  Keeping in touch with my friends through boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">didnt buy it, pop still best exp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got it due mostly to the Guild will be doing it but thats really it.  I thought there was going to be a new Graphic engine but thats coming &quot;soon&quot; and not a part of God.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bought, love it!  It's hard, which is a good thing.<br />
<br />
And as a shaman, there are actually quite a few places to solo for decent exp.  I got an AA in just under an hour in Riwwi for example, which is actually about the same as solo in PoFire.  Mobs are easy to single pull, and die in about 90 seconds, and give about 3% exp per kill.  Not a lot of HPs.  Can solo in Barindu as well.  Ferubi no way, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bought it even though I certainly wasnt impressed with how the spells looked before release. The dreaded NDA meant that I didnt know much about what else was there but on the official site it says:<br />
<br />
&quot;The new combat zones are for characters level 50 and over.&quot;<br />
<br />
So that must mean that if you are well over 50 (65) then you can have fun in all the new combat zones? Right? Right? Wrong!!<br />
<br />
After release it has become painfully clear that the people that are able to enjoy the combat zones are from the top-end guilds.<br />
<br />
So until now until 2 good things about this expansion in my view:<br />
<br />
1. I now have an alchemy skill of 200.<br />
2. Its now completely certain that I will stop playing EQ when WoW comes out. There is no way Blizzard will treat its customers as badly as SOE does.<br />
<br />
PS. Im not bitter just disappointed since I really do enjoy some of EQ but lately all the new fun stuff has been exclusively for uberguilds or people that play way way more than I do.</div></div><hr />

Although I'm pissed about this expansion and horrible SoE CS (a large factor in me pressing the end billing button), I have to totally disagree with this statement.  LoY and LDoN did very little for the raid guilds and a ton for the casual/small guilds of Norrath.  The small guild I was in did some pretty fun stuff and all of our magelo profiles started to get fat on more accessable PoP and LDoN items.  GoD was bone to the raid guilds for sure, but from what I see, near VT type of rewards are available for one group encounters and less than time geared peeps.<br />
<br />
I have no love for SoE and I was never in a full time raid guild, but let's stay realistic and focused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bhone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">bought it.  i'd be a nice expansion, if it had actually been tested JUST A LITTLE.  between the 1017s and the horrid lag, i wonder if we can even call this an alpha product.   most developers would be ashamed of this quality of a product</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I bought it primarily because I'm in a powerful raiding guild and GoD will be part of our progression. I don't exp much these days, so that was never a concern. The lag/bugs are cause for concern but hopefully they will be worked out soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grumbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm very disappointed as I'm not a raiding Shaman. Now finding out that the shamy spells are NO DROP off of mobs and that it requires a raid to kill the mobs just infuriates me.  If you know different post it, as there isn't much information except peeps stating their NO DROP off mobs and mobs aren't soloable.<br />
<br />
In addition, my brief travel to the zones via boat was just a time killer. Takes forever to get anywhere (Guess I've been spoiled with POP).<br />
<br />
I will explore further and take a firm stance later, but my statements come from my initial impression.<br />
<br />
I'm a little upset that they made the mobs difficult to solo and buffed up the resists.<br />

Hehe, Ya, I bought it.<br />

IF the canni spell is obtainable by me, i might buy it and actually log on.  I have no guild, and all my friends have quit.  So if i cant get the new spells, why bother.<br />
<br />
But hey i can go farm droga right?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I bought it, as I have all the other expansions.  It has to be the expansion I am the most disappointed with, and the only one I truly regret buying.  <br />
<br />
I don't raid, and other than new tradeskill recipies I see absolutely nothing in this expansion for me - maybe in a couple expansion's time I will have something to do there, but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
I don't consider PITA CR's to be &quot;fun&quot; - for those that do, more power to you - but this isn't the expansion for me, methinks.<br />

Fortunately I can still have fun in LDON:)</div></div><hr />

hahahahahha, used to having a safe GY are you?  Must not have experienced the days when you got lucky if you got your corpse back in a zone without dying another 4 times in the process.<br />
<br />
It's been said by &quot;some&quot; that PoP made too many people get levels so easy that they didn't learn how to play.  GoD to means seems pretty difficult, and I think that it shows who knows how to play, and who just leveled their character without learning what you can and can't do.<br />
<br />
me.. i'm loving every minute of it.  Even after spending the last two days having wiped to the same guy in a one group trial 25+ times, I can still say.. this is some fun stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I hope you're kidding about the 25+ times.  If not, at least you're getting some great exp in the process!!  :)</div></div><hr />

I just dont get the new speed AA top speed it +50% run.  Sow is +55%.   I just dont get it why we never got a viable Sow upgrade.  Oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually, I did experience those days, as I've played since 2000.  And I didn't like those days, and don't intend to return to them.    I'm not sure I am &quot;used&quot; to having a safe graveyard, but I sure do like it as I have lived the alternative:).  I never bought into Brad's &quot;It's fun to be a victim&quot; speech.  Perhaps others did.<br />
<br />
Like I said, lengthy CRs and repeated deaths are not fun to me.  They were not fun to me when Vox and Naggy were the end game targets.  They are not fun to me now. I see no reason to believe they will ever be fun to me in the future.   Who knows I could be wrong, but I doubt it.  <br />
<br />
That doesn't mean I begrudge other people their fun.  If wiping to the same target 25, 50, or 100 times is fun to you, go for it.  It isn't fun to me, therefore I don't participate - and we can still both have fun playing Everquest.  Go figure:).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">actually, no i was serious about wiping 25 times.  This is in the first ikkinz trial on the final boss.  The beauty of the event is that at least there is no repops, so we just rez up and try it again.  Problem with it is that we haven't figured out the exact technique for the win yet.  Well, I can't say that we haven't, we have, but we haven't executed.  Just stupid things always went wrong and we've failed.  And.. by 25 times, I mean, that not the full group has wiped.  It's usually just one person, with the tank and/or rogue being just them the majority.<br />
<br />
and.. wiping that many times isn't just fun, it's the fact that we know this is difficult, but it's doable.  That's what makes it fun.  We know that we just can't come in and wipe the place the first time and own everything.  It's going to be a challenge and that's why this is fun.  LDoN hard was fun for most of the time for the same reasons.  Even in the perfect group you still had the X factor that you could wipe at any time if somethingn goes wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I just wanna end this for me with this.<br />
<br />
20 HP slot 7 aug's that a 65 shaman can solo if they stay alert.<br />
<br />
I can easily upgrade 100+ hp camping a fully slowable mob that you cant root, but doesnt run.<br />
<br />
Im very happy that my ring of the shissar is now a 110 hp item with enhancment haste 3. A non-guilded player cant bitch about that, cause at the level im at i cant really upgrade anything unless its in a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I completley agree with you there, I started over a year before pop came out and I expreienced boats, and horribly multi hour corpse runs in PoHate, Lower Guk, HS, AR. I hate both. Spending a lot of time traveling in a game is just a horrible, mindless timesink (even worse then most). Spending 3 hours trying to get your corpse back after a mistake is just frustrating mostly.  Definately not fun at all. Only time I ever really rely on GY's is on raids anyways, if I'm exp'n and die I'll invis and drag to a safe spot and res if theres any possibility of doing that. Long CR's suck, they take time away from actually playing the friggen game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I bought it but have yet to goto any zones.  Been busy n LDON and BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I bought it, and i love it, definitely a challenge.  Now, to everyone that's saying you NEED to be part of some kind of uberguild, or even that you have to raid at all, that is BS.  Any reasonable group of 65's (ie, 50ish + aa) in bazaar gear can handle the first 4 trials, and a lot of the rest of the zone.  Maybe you won't be WINNING there, but you can get some nice exp and drops, this is what the &quot;nonflag&quot; versions of the dungeons are for.  With the gear from those instances, LDoN gear, easily available/campable gear from PoP, you'll have gear better than that of several groups i've seen beat all 4 trials...it just takes some work and some skill.  You CAN gear up to the equipment level needed to beat these first four trials with a single group of bazaar geared characters, and with some of the drops from the next tier of zones, you stand a good chance at progressing beyond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Long, highly challenging corpse runs are a pain in the ass.  But at this level of the game, the miniscule experience loss (after rez, or even without rez) is not enough of a deterrent from dying.  Death should carry a penalty so that it means more than it has lately.  Up until now, dying was just an inconvenience at worst.  Where's the roleplaying in that?  (Ya, ya I know, this isn't a role playing game!)<br />
<br />
Right now my frustration with the expansion is the server performance.  (Not that this is any great shock. . . )  I can only assume my server is not the only one having mass zoning crashes followed by 30-90 minute 1017 errors.  Needless to say being unable to zone makes the game unplayable, and dwarfs ANY complaints about class balance, corpse runs, and useless new AAs.<br />
<br />
Fix this please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">After all that complaining most people just went out and bought it. No wonder SoE keeps on going the way it does. Think about all that money they made. :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I guess I should have noted that I didn't buy it.  At level 55 I haven't really seen or heard of anything that will make me want to buy the expansion pack.  I have about 2-3 hours per night to play at most, I don't have time for time sinks and long CR's, and I have a feeling that the only things I would be killing at level 55 are yard trash at the zone-in's of the easy zones.  <br />
<br />
LDON and grouping with my friends in the Planes have been the best thing that happened to me as far as EQ goes, they are why I reactivated my account and started playing again.  I will not be directly purchasing Gates of Discord, I will only install it if it is included with the next expansion pack or if someone gives it to me as a gift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Between my girlfriend and myself we have five accounts that we have not and most likely will not buy this expansion for and admit I am basing my opinion on what I have read and been told.  While raising alchemy for cheap would be nice, the new AA's are an insult, but not as much of an insult as the availability of the new canni and the piss-poor % upgrade to Q.  On just the fact that it was not made easily obtainable since it is NOT AN UPGRADE TO MANA REGEN, I refuse to buy the expansion until I know more about the spell drops.<br />
<br />
Nothing that I see for a casual gamer, but I am also still very happy with the rest of the game I haven't experienced yet so no need for another expansion.<br />
<br />
What has really disappointed me are stealth nerfs to get people into the new expansion.  LDoN has been hit very hard with cash and xp nerfs, in addition pacify has had it's resist rate significantly increased and mob aggro radius increase in LDoN ONLY, on apparently the eve of the GoD release.  It would be nice for SoE to mention major gameplay changes over changing the way a door swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I bought it, intending to hate it due to all the &quot;It's only for time geared players!!!111&quot; hype.  So far, I'm loving it.  I haven't sailed through the trials like I do through normal LDoN, and you know what?  That's why it's so much fun.  <br />
<br />
In a good group of compotent friends, we do pretty dang well.  Even though most of us aren't guilded and none of us have VT/EP/Time gear.  We manage pretty well.  The named are tough as hell, but possible.<br />
<br />
So far so good, I'm liking it.  Yes, there's lots of it I'll never see...just like Time and maybe even the EPS (/rude RZ!!), but the parts I can see, I'm enjoying so far.<br />
<br />
It's a great change.  A big challenge, with big rewards.  Good times for all :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I didn't buy it.  LDoN was imho a huge mistake and boring as @#$%.  I enjoyed LDoN for all of one day before i found it so ungodly boring i've essentially never gone back (no respawn, wow, exciting crawl and such risk!!), not even enough points to buy the curse line of spells.  GoD offered nothing for shaman, and now that i see the drops and read about the fun?  I'm still not gonna buy it.  It never ends in this game, as the name fully implies.  But it will for everyone who plays sometime, and that time (i truly hope for myself) is fast approaching.  I'd put a lot of pp up to say that the percentage of 45 atm who didn't buy GoD will be more like 15% within a few months.  Everyone (and myself included cuz i'm still playing this game) is weak, we are addicted.  Most will buy this expansion soon i'm sure.  Enjoy it all, and although atm i'm holding strong, if i get weak (i hope not), you may even see me there.  If i stay stong, i will probably see PoTime and consider that end game for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Didn't buy it, the description it was given - 'PoP with instances' had a large part in my decision to cancel my EQ accounts instead.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of other MMORPGs out there and nows the time to try a few of them before WoW comes out.  I'm having a lot more fun now than I was logging into EQ, and spending maybe an hour just getting a group together for yet another LDoN borefest.</div></div><hr />
