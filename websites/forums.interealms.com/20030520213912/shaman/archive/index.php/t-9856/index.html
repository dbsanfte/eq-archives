<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torquil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Getting very frustrated with trying to pass the Trials.  Our Guild's core Group is :<br />
<br />
60 Warrior<br />
60 Magician<br />
61 Necromancer<br />
62 Wizard<br />
61 Cleric<br />
62 Enchanter<br />
<br />
This team has succesfully pass the Trials, other members include :<br />
<br />
61 Ranger<br />
60 ShadowKnight<br />
62 Rogue<br />
62 Monk<br />
61 Shaman ( me )<br />
<br />
We can get to the Boss with almost any combination of the above, except when I'm added to the group.<br />
<br />
Can anyone make any suggestions on what the best group would be for me to go in with ?<br />
<br />
Thankyou for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nruter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have had the best luck with a melee heavy group, (warrior, ranger, rogue, monk in your case) add cleric and you.<br />
<br />
Damage Shields help a ton, use potion for anyone that will get hit, and get a mage/druid to group DS right before you start.<br />
<br />
Best tactic I found was to cast AE slow once and you can torpor tank the three not  being killed by melees. <br />
<br />
If your group is working well together I would suggest casting BoN on one of the last mobs, of each wave, that is going to be killed.  It will go full duration so best use of your mana for DPS.  Judge what other nukes/ damage is needed based on mana and speed of the melees in killing.<br />
<br />
Chanters and shaman in same group tend to reduce DPS too much unless the enchanter has either a lot of AAXP or sufficient levels and is nuking heavily.<br />
<br />
Damage Shields will allow you to get a head start on the mobs after the first and at 61 it should be just over 70 points per hit with just potion and mage.<br />
<br />
Only time the cleric ever needs to heal me is if the boss aggros prior to slow landing (700 a hit adds up fast) and very very rarely if a torpor is interupted (keep it up on you all the time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kept trying the AE approach myself, 43 failed attempts. The group that was successful was:<br />
<br />
60 rogue<br />
61 rogue<br />
60 cleric<br />
60 warrior<br />
65 Ench (AE stun)<br />
63 Shaman<br />
<br />
This was my first attempt outside of the AE type of group. The level of the enchanter was huge. This was very close fight, exe down to 20% one rogue and ench dead, warrior kiting exe while I crunched for patch heals as the cleric medded, cleric finally got off a CH on the warrior and we did win this fight. The enchanter's stuns made all the difference in the world and having a MA that could change targets quickly.<br />
<br />
Think outside the box!<br />
<br />
Remember one mistake on anyone's part and you done, packet loss or ld on anyones part and you done. Takes a bit of luck to even have a chance to succeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edited because I cant spell .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">During the above mentioned successful attempt I used only spear of torment on the waves of mobs. DS potions and either Druid or Mage DS on melee, with the AE stun agro was not a problem. We tried this with a lower level ench 60 or 61 the  AE stuns were resisted too often and the attempts ended quickly. <br />
<br />
When the Exe spawned I put my butt up against the wall you zone into and cast malo then slow (turgurs landed first try), I think I got epic in on exe but mostly canni and spot heals.<br />
<br />
Hpe this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Out of the pool you have there I'd go with:<br />
<br />
You<br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Wizard (wizard ideally has Sunstrike)<br />
Mage (mage ideally has Banish)<br />
Rogue<br />
<br />
If thats not working or the wiz/mage don't have the spells, go with melee heavy:<br />
<br />
You<br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Rogue<br />
Monk<br />
Ranger</div></div><hr />
