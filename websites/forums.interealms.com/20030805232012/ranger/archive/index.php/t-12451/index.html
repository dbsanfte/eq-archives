<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is for the peeps that think they can peel better than a Paladin..What makes you think this? A Ranger's root breaks mez while a Paladins root does not. When a mob gets on a healer you try to taunt while the Paladin stuns,see who gets the aggro. You think you deal more damage? Maybe if you are really set up with uber weapons/both epics but then you still aint gonna be that far ahead. A paladin wont have to have a Uber weapon either.Now if you think you have outdamaged Paladi ns by a huge margin then you haven't played with the right Paladins. Now, what else are you going to do for my group? We are in a Dungeon so sow is pointless. Besides the druid in our group can cast the spells you do a lot easier since you just have the lower versions of what they got. We are outside of a dungeon now, what? Your Harmony is about as good as a lull spell? No Thank You, we will take that Monk or Paladin LFG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taolil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Uh.<br />
<br />
Well, if you really feel that way, go roll a 'gimped' Monk or a Pally.<br />
<br />
I handled pulling duties in Sebilis for a good chunk of my time while exping in there...granted I couldn't break a spawn (usually) I was pretty good at 'staggering' pulls enough so that exp was pretty constant for my group. <br />
<br />
Just because Harmony is gone doesn't mean we're completely gimped. Aiya. Why do people keep acting like they've given rangers 140 Defense and the ATK of a_moss_snake? <br />
<br />
Groups enjoy having snarers, rangers can still do that.<br />
Groups still enjoy having our utility buffs, rangers can still do that.<br />
Rangers can still level and root pull.<br />
So we can't break a 6 mob spawn in KC anymore. Whoopity doo. Harmony was a nice spell but it's not something that's going to BREAK us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And to be honest I look forward to leveling them,not so with the Ranger. The reasons were not that good that you mentioned. What is that Ranger going to cast that my group really needs that the druid cant? No the Harmony nerf didn't breaks the Ranger but it sure hurt them a lot.WHY WOULD A GROUP WANT A RANGER? Paladins get better roots,heals,and Lull's.And a level 60 Paladin can rez for 90% experience. Isnt the highest level Cleric rez 90%? It isnt much higher if it is. I can tell you from haveing a Monk,Ranger,Paladin, and Beastlord that the Ranger is the only one I don't look forward too leveling. FD works most of the time,in fact I cant remember when it has even failed but few times and thats at 47.History speaks for itself on how VI treats the Ranger. Just take a look at all the upgrades other classes are getting,have gotten,and will still get compared to the Ranger. The spell upgrades we do get are not in line with the way other Hybrids get thiers. Paladins get Improved Invis to undead,any normal person would thus say that Rangers get improved superior camo but not according to VI. Rangers can say I can still do blah and blah but the fact speak for themselves. Your not needed anymore except for fluff buffs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frayja Arres</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">omg I read this and was laughing my tushie off .. this is funny stuff ...<br />
<br />
btw thats the name of the paint chips your licking (smoking) ?<br />
<br />
lets see I am in a group .. something is beating on the cleric .. oh ya I will waste time with taunt .. :rolleyes:  ya I dont think so .. called cast snare .. even if it is resisted you still get agro .. HELLO ... oh ya and then when the tank is done with the 1st mob  .. umm cast cinder jolt .. and turn off attack so he can get the argo needed for the rest of the fight then umm turn attack back on once 5 seconds is up <br />
<br />
as for harmony .. well as I am lvl 60 I DONT have a prob single pulling .. and if I do get adds .. umm called group make up .. lets see either we muti tank or oh ya whats that class called again .. OH  .. have the chanter  umm MEZ it .. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
oh umm btw might wanna see bout getting a cleric rez tis a 96% rez FYI ...<br />
<br />
All you are saying to me is that yer a crapy ranjur .. /shrug but thats IMO .. if you dont like the class dont play it .. if you dont like the buffies OMG shocking thought DONT TAKE IT <br />
<br />
CoP a fluff buff .. CoE a fluff buff ... CoN  a fluff buff ... well I will have to tell all the main tanks on our raids that they dont really want that buffs for they are fluff buffs<br />
<br />
btw must be nice to have a pocket druid for your every group,not everyone has that option .. <br />
<br />
BUT lets see now WHEN was the last time you seen a monk/pally/BST do a 3k+ crit on a single hit .. .. *thinks for a monment * .. oh ya but a pally can out damgae a ranjur any day <br />
:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Might wanna read up on the class or learn how to play it before ya flame it ..<br />
<br />
BUT thats  just my thougths ...:eek:<br />
<br />
:::EDIT::: as your a Pally or as it looks to be from your post .. <br />
<br />
lets see why would I want you in my group .. why a pally as a hybrid class .. I would take a cleric over you anyday .. your spells are just a lower  lvl then a cleric .. <br />
IF I need damage lets see ranjur/monk/rogue ... need a tank .. nope not a pally  I would say HI mr. warr ...if I needed a port sure as hell would not get a pally .. oh ya you dont get that do you ..DUH <br />
so tell me again WHY I would want a pally yer buffes are NOT all that ... I can do better with my own/shammy/cleric than with your fluff buffs <br />
so a perfect make up for a group IMHO you dont belong ..  but then I would group with a good pally but seems to me your not one of them either .. for a good pally would NOT feel the need to come to a ranjur site to flame them .. <br />
Ubber is not what gear you have its not what you say but tis what you do with your actions ..to me your actions are not even honorable ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is hilarious.<br />
<br />
My in-game husband (RL fiance) is a paladin. I am a ranger. He is absolutely green at how much damage I can deal out. I can out-taunt him on a whim if I choose to. He has aggro because I let him, because it is better for the group that he tank. However, I am the puller. Where I grind you don't need harmony in any form to pull steadily and successfully. Groups want rangers and always will because rangers get the job done. <br />
<br />
CoP a fluff buff? Oh, please. Shows how little you really know about the class you are trashing.<br />
<br />
Pal, if you're going to do nothing useful and just knock the class, you're better off going elsewhere. I'm saying this nicely before more people read this bull**** and decide not to be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I love this kind of thread. For one, Frayja,a crit for 3k? Hmm you are level 60 plus have AA,so your telling me that you have to have AA and be lvl 101 to do that. And I have played the classes, I will admit not to 60 but I shouldn't have to. A 90% rez may not be the best you can get but it sure comes pretty dam close, and for some of us that don't have a Cleric around or easily obtained it can be a problem. And as I remember to get a Cleric to come rez you takes pp and some time.And I can bet you can look around and see that a sub par Pallie rivals a Epic Ranger,and if the Ranger is sub par then the Pally will come out on top with damage.I can solo a yellow with my Druid easily and even with my Beastlord,can you do that? I see you are 60 so you are just doing AA's on light blues no doubt. And I can play every class I have effectively. Don't flatter yourself,just because I say this and that doesn't mean I don't know how to play.Take a look on the servers on what class is played the most, I can remember guilds turning down Paladins as they were over populated with them.Oh and yes you cast snare,or even tangleing roots,then flame lick to try and draw aggro,but your roots are going to last less and break aggro.But try that with a Pally stunning.You will see that stunning pisses off the mob more than snare and such. I have gotten aggro just from chain stunning a mob and took it from a group with a Ranger and a Warrior in it.Now I may only have made it to 56 with my Paladin and a bit lower with my other classes but nm. The point is that Rangers are less desireable in a group now,btw isn't CoP,CoE, and CoN dropped spells? Not all Rangers would have the benefit of haveing those spells(maybe you can do a quest to give all the Rangers on every server those spells,that would fit in your &quot;noble&quot; portrait). Now those Ranger buffs are pretty good,but wont make or break a group. And unless you are in a Uber guild rezzez are not so easy to come by or obtained cheap. Remember EQ has 90% greedy,selfish aholes, 10% truly nice people. But to top it off there is a reason more people play a Paladin,due to playstyles I have seen some really stupid Pallies that do the damage of a Fire Beetle.But VI favors to the majority apearently.I agree with you on the Uber part,unfortuneatly the rest of EQ doesn't. Why do you think people are dicks to everyone(unless it is to thier benefit) and are Ninja looters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can we please try useing a regular Ranger and not a super equipped one? Why is it when a Ranger says he can outdo a Paladin and such he is stacked to the ass in equipment and his epics? I guess that's what it takes to pull that little bit ahead.But the majority of the Rangers dont have the benefit of stuff like that. A lot of these stacked to the hilt Rangers are the exception,most Rangers arent set up like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ticharary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pal, true that Paladins may be a fun class but you will never ever see a group shout /LF Paladin. I don't feel that paladins benefit groups at all, considering you are most likely gonna have a druid/cleric to heal, maybe a shaman. Any of their buffs are IMO 10x better than anything a Pally can offer. <br />
   As for the Stun taking aggro, I don't think so. My 52 Ranger does not have epics, and is only mediocrely equipped, but was killing nobles with a pally in Highkeep and I took all aggro, even though he chain stunned. Scenario went like this : I cast harmony on the Nobles, select near one, cast Immolate, and run to stairs, no attack on at all. Then Pally starts attacking and stunning, I hit attack one time, then snare, poof...I'm getting nailed. The Noble would turn to him for a sec, but soon after was back on me as my Call of Sky proc seemed to piss em off. I'm DWing a Centi LS and Lammy and the Pally has some uber ass hammer thats doing 200+ a whack, but yet I'm taking aggro. Take me to any zone with ya. I'll be in a group long before you. I am utility class with buffs that NO OTHER class can give. You are a dmg dealing, oh we can't get a war; might as well take that Pally thats been shouting for an hour, NO BUFFING piece of crap =p.<br />
Go brag on a pally board if you think you are sweet. Oh wait, do they make a Pally board? Prolly not, coz no one cares what they have to say anyways.</div></div><hr />

I dont know what kinda group make up you have but daydum if you took argo from the tank and the war in question .. I was just wondering if they where both afk .. or if they just let you have agro to help your oh so small ego .. <br />

What server are you on for on my server this is not the norm .. Could you pls tell me the sever your on so I can advoid it  I cant rember the last time I had to pay for a exp rez I offer it when tis not the cleric in my group and 99% of the time it is rejected ... <br />
<br />
so all in all to sum this up not only are you a crapy ranjur your a crapy pally to boot .. for if you where in my group I would disband you for &quot;takeing&quot; agro from my war consentally (sp) for your job is NOT to tank ...but hey that just MHO that being all said ... <br />
<br />
People demand freedom of speech to make up for the freedom of thought which they avoid.  pretty much sums you up ... have a nice day be well .. learn your class .. play hard .. but do us all a favor and go away .. for you are one of the few that will make ppl think twice bout takeing a GOOD ranjur in there group .. :mad: <br />
<br />
as for the rest of your posts all i can say is OMFG what game to you playing for all your info is just sooo wrong .. are you sure your 50+ <br />

thanks for your time and the laughs I need this ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Taolil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm curious...<br />
<br />
did you have a monk before or after the defense nerfs happened? Welcome to the real world where no class is an 'uber' class. And...I dunno. With a LSoEE and a Centi LS, I was outdamaging a couple of pallies that I'd group with. My equipment was average, for the most part. ;)<br />
<br />
You talk about how paladins can rez when clerics are around...well, gee, stupid....what do you think rangers can do when druids aren't around? <br />
<br />
The spell upgrades we do get are not in line with the way other Hybrids get thiers. Paladins get Improved Invis to undead,any normal person would thus say that Rangers get improved superior camo but not according to VI. Rangers can say I can still do blah and blah but the fact speak for themselves. Your not needed anymore except for fluff buffs. <br />
<br />
How is that, exactly? It seems that we've been getting buffs and such that scale upwards, as well as getting spells which increase our DPS and the such. I don't see Paladins with any aggro reducing spells. Looks like Paladins get the short end of the stick there. <br />
<br />
If you're so concerned about the fact that rangers don't get the much needed, and much desired IMPROVED SUPERIOR CAMO spell, perhaps you should start a thread in the General forum and try to get Verant to look at this GLARING oversight/problem. ;)<br />
<br />
Besides, clerics have better buffs, heals, etc than Paladins do. Why would anyone bother with playing a paladin when you could just get a cleric?<br />
<br />
If you want spells so damn badly, go roll a caster.<br />
If you want melee abilities so damn badly, go roll a pure melee.<br />
<br />
If you want a mix of both and realize that you're not going to be getting the best of both worlds....go roll a hybrid. Rangers are the only class I know of beyond maybe warriors that get a good OFFENSIVE and DEFENSIVE discipline. Rangers, like Paladins, have several good buffs...as evidence of this, I show you one Furor Planedefiler, perhaps you've heard of him... ;)<br />
<br />
http://fohguild.org/news/Vhaksiz.jpg<br />
<br />
Note how he's got both CoP and Brell's cast on him. Boy, rangers buffs sure suck. /cry<br />
<br />
Kindly don't use terms like 'we' when describing the ranger class, cause it's quite obvious you've never cared a whit for it. ;) I hear Wizards are pretty ub3r, though...maybe you should go and take your class envy to Graffe's or go back to Monkly Business. The uber-god-class you're looking for isn't here, nor does it exist.<br />
<br />
Additionally.....if you haven't played to 60 and experienced all that a class can do and what a class has available for them then you really are in NO position to be critiquing them at all. Oh, and paragraphs are your friend. Learn to use them.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry, these mean old people will disappear so you can go back to casting Brell's and making up false statements and trolling other forums. (I swear, people like him must get off on this kind of stuff...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was just playing around guys,some of you are just getting all bent out of shape.I'm sorry I should have just not said anything.Taolil, I do know how to use paragraphs, I just choose not too. How a person writes does not make them more intellegent.It may make people think they are but does not mean it is so. <br />
  Now it is true I haven't played to level 60, too much going on in real life, I divide my time up and have a great life and MANY friends. See, I don't instantly start cutting people down in general, to say about a class is one thing...to direct it towards a specific person is another. <br />
  Just because you may do good on EQ doesn't mean you are too smart. I know a 12 year old kid that is failing in school(all F's) and he does real good in EQ.<br />
   Yes I do play all of the classes I talk about and I do solo most of the time and VERY rarely die.I have many friends in and out of EQ. If I can't normally get a group because of my class my reputation ALWAYS gets me the group.A caster doesn't die unless I am already dead.I need to somehow get to  60 before I post about this again,I obviously can't joke around at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Phoenex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Are rangers better than paladins? Or are paladins better than rangers? The answer is that it depends on the situation. Both are very valuable in a group. They are both utility classes that can heal, can do significant melee damage, can pull aggro when needed, and can tank when needed. For damage, rangers with equal gear WILL do significantly more damage than a paladin, but not a huge amount more. A paladin in most cases tanks significanty better than rangers, but the difference is not huge most of the time.<br />
The key point that I'm trying to make here is that the &quot;best class&quot; discussions are pointless. All classes are valuable, and are good at their jobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Taolil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Proper spelling, grammar and the such helps too, Pal. ;) I'm sure an 'intellegent' person like yourself knows that, though.<br />
<br />
All I was doing was pointing out the major flaws in your arguments...you say Paladins can do all that a cleric can do, so they're more desirable, yet Rangers aren't because druids can do all that a ranger can do, only better. Well, what if there are no druids around? Like....exercise some thought besides just negatively bashing a class because ONE spell has changes made to it.<br />
<br />
And I'm curious...does the fact that I, in your opinion, 'do good in EQ' make me lacking a life or make me stupid? Because I can assure you I'm neither. Debate or discussion about things I don't think anyone will tell you to shut up about, but going onto a ranger board and effectively telling people that their class == teh suck isn't a great way to foster debate. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Pal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I will have to be better selective on what I talk about on here,yes I shouldn't have came off that way. It is my bad and I'm sorry. Phoenex did state exactly the way (imo) it should be in the game.<br />
   I know you are not stupid either, believe it or not I made all  A's (except Phsycology B =( in College and was on the Presidents list every semester. College English was easy and so was Advanced Math. I still can't type for the life of me or spell. I guess I got too used to spell checker.=P All I was saying Taolil is that bad grammer doesn't make you stupid like some rare peeps on these boards seem to think.<br />
    No I don't mean you don't have a life, to get to level 60 takes a long time,I would have to see your equipment and time played to even guess.And with family,work, and volunteer time I get few hours to play like I would want. If a person has a couple months in,and is 60 I don't see how,unless they are on all the time.I have watched certain people that anytime you log on &quot;poof&quot; there they are. I don't see how people can spend that much time on the game and have a life.I divide my time best I can with what I have going on,I guess most of the peeps that are on constantly are jobless/or part time,no family, or have enough money to not have to work.There just is not enough time for a person to work 40+ hours,sleep,eat,and be with your family(the way you should be), yet play 5 hours a day every day and all day on week-ends.Well, if your character is quite old then maybe it was done over time.You have to group in this game to be the best you can be in equipment.,you can't get Epics solo.<br />
   A life has different meanings for everyone I guess.I really can't complain because the more people are online the more money I make as things break from useage and such.I have a 40+ week job,run two money makeing jobs on the side,am a single parent of 2 children from birth(12 @ 14 now),and a soon to be wife.I even volenteer a few hours a week to the community center. I still have managed to have three characters to level 50 and one to 56.So yea I think I do pretty dam good. <br />
   As for my arguement, I'll be honest that I was just mad about the nerf. I was also mad as my Ranger has 2 lammies and some Silver Chitin Handwraps yet Paladins still outdo him and my Paladin outdoes my Ranger even. I can cast call of sky and even tho I am duel weilding with 2 fast weapons and 140 dex they still proc divine might a lot more than I do Call Of Sky...I mean a lot.To play a Ranger or Paladin good is rather easy,at least to level 50ish. I just blurted out things without thinking like I should have. I will have to think a lot more on my argument/debate next time.</div></div><hr />

It was an analogy.  You may be a genius for all I know, but if you make posts with horrible grammer and spelling, it gives the impression that you aren't very bright.  I don't know you IRL.  All I have to make my opinion of you are your posts.<br />

If you were applying for a job and you misspelled everything on your resumé, they wouldn't sit there and think, &quot;Well, he can't spell or use proper grammer, but I'm sure he's a very smart person.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Paladins and Rangers together make a nice combination. I have a Paladin friend, and we usually roll in the same group. He knows I do more damage than he does, and my weapons aren't the best. They are low delay, however, and I have superb DPS (Do not ask me why the random generator loves me that much because I don't know). I sttack usually three times before does, which, with dual wield and double attack is up to 12 slashes to his one, or, possibly, two. I took aggro from him today accidentally, and gave it back by moving backwards, and letting him reanger the mob. However, he can tank much better than me. I also have a Shadowknight friend, and there is nothing scarier than Two paladins, a Shadowknight, a Shaman, a Ranger, and a Cleric, walking down in and eating alive the spawns. I pulkl, they tank. I draw aggro from the mob if it goes after the healer UNTIL one of the other three gets to it. <br />
<br />
It all boils down to how you use each class. Indoor dungeon? I still pull, and I am STILL the better puller of the four of us. They know this, and I know this. It's not that we brag about it, we just let it fall into place. <br />
<br />
If you think Rangers suck so badly, why don't you just run around in game shouting &quot;Ranjah Down&quot; like you probably would want to be doing all over these boards, but, if all you are going to do is come in here and say how a Paladin is so much better than a Ranger, then you're wasting your life. <br />
<br />
Paladins and Rangers are NO comparison. It's like comparing Clerics and Warriors. The only thing Clerics and Warriors have in common is that most are siamese twinned to the other.<br />
<br />
You cannot compare a Paladin, who is made to be anti-undead, to a ranger, who is the god of outdoor soloing. (Yes, I say that we solo outdoor better than druids. I don't care the arguement, but I come out of fear kiting a griffon with more health and mana than my druidess friend, and this is meant to poke fun at her should she read it.)<br />
<br />
Paladins are useful for Tanking, Healing, and Rezzes only if a MUST need. Note the Must? You will never hear someone shout &quot;Is there a pally here that can rez me?&quot; Just like you don't see people go, &quot;Is there a Ranger here that I can get a sow from?&quot; They don't think about you being able to do that.<br />
<br />
Just remember that, you have your job as a paladin, and Rangers have their job also. Some of our buffs are Ranger only. Ask a Druid to cast Feet Like Cat on you at level 15. Shamans get it, Druids don't. That means they CAN'T cast it on you. Druids use snare like Rangers, yes, but can a druid withstand the aggro that casting snare gets? No. So, it's a solo kiting spell for druids mainly. The Harmony nerf was, is, and always will be, crap, but at least it doesn't aggro the mob like a Paladin's lulls.<br />
<br />
Next, Riftwind's Protection, and Call of Earth (That line, dunno the rest of the spells) stack with literally everything but one another I think. In all of the buffs I have cast, that sticks no matter what else the person has on. Fluff Buff? Then how come a Paladin (Yes PALADIN) came running up to me in the Scarlet Desert and ASKED for that buff again after I cast it on him in trade for him casting an extra heal on me while I was in a tell conversation with my other paladin friend, who also loves that spell that I cast on him constantly? Fluff Buff, but your class begs me for it. <br />
<br />
Remember the points I'm making here are on both sides. I like Paladins to buff me rather than our cleric. She can save more of her mana to melee with us that way. And we have less down time of her sitting on her butt.  Also remember that Paladins and Rangers are of no comparison, and every Hybrid can be trrashed for their lack of the parent class' spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways, some ranger must have burned you bad to get you so hyped up about us, sorry you got screwed.  I'd suggest, however, looking at the skill level of yourself personally as compared to the person who owned you, instead of using class as an excuse.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Pal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I already said I was sorry for posting the way I did,which I apologized over and over,but can you lay off now? I just went from my experiences,and I apearently grouped with bad players.I can't help it I aquired all of my things from haveing to solo most of my 53 levels as a Ranger and 56 as a Paladin(the Paladin rarely soloed).And for my Ranger to have ac of 1002 is pretty good don't ya think?<br />
  <br />
  The only difference is I didn't have to get a group to do that, to solo also takes talent. And I am not talking about just animals.I constantly solo high blue NPC's also.So my arguement was stupid, but my playing is superb.<br />
  <br />
   I will have to get a group/Guild for my Epics,this I know.I may not be able to argue very well but my playing style rivals anyone in EQ, period.I am just lacked for time is all.<br />
   <br />
   Now as for a Ranger outdoing a Paladin,yes they usually do in a lot of circumstances.But there are so many factors that come into play,we all know that. Now my Ranger only has 23% haste and non uber stuff so it is easy to see why a smart Paladin can outdo him for the most part against a mob.I can cast my DD's/Buff and such but constant pulling only leaves so much mana.Then again if you can get a Clarity2 or such it is much easier to keep up.<br />
   <br />
  I am tired of this discussion,I have said I was wrong and really stupid for blurting out  without thinking.But of course some people just keep flattering themselves thinking they are super Ranger and insulting others by thinking they have better play styles or skills.I can assure you that I am a good player and have played more online,high level characters(and liked) than a lot of people. I may not be 60 but I will be someday and I am sure I will learn even more,but I guess we shall see.<br />

<br />
The reason you got whomped was because you came to a Ranger board and touted the uselessness of Rangers.  My respect for Paladins means that when I visit their boards (which is often) or when I post (which is not) I try to make sure that I am not talking about stuff that I don't have the background for.  And I certainly don't tell them how badly they suck at various things.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I stopped reading your threads after the third reply by you, and posted in respect to that.  We fought hard for our class, just like you did for yours, and if you are going to attack Ranger merits on a Ranger board, expect to catch some feedback on it.<br />
<br />
Keep posting, and keep visiting, by all means.  The Glade has always welcomed visitors from other boards and classes; it makes the dialogue a lot better for all :)</div></div><hr />

I have no problem debating on classes .. there is a up and a down side to every class for if there was not there would be only one class ..or everyone would be playing that class as this is not the case we all have our own thoughts on what is the best and worst class .. for soloing ... grouping ...raiding ...etc <br />

There is a notorious Pally on our server - as soon as he joins a group he starts pulling and tanking, never checks whether those roles were already assigned and whether we were on a MED BREAK, always wants to head into the next tougher zone, insisting that he will somehow keep the entire party alive because he has LoH up...<br />

An employer may look at your grammar in the overall scheme of the Interview process,but to decide on just that alone makes  him/her a very poor employer.<br />

<br />
You bring up a few valid points, but that won't change the fact that you sir, are a complete ****tard.  I base this off of the following:<br />
<br />
1)  You come to a board called &quot;The Ranger's Glade&quot;, then procede to claim Rangers are basically useless in a grouping situation (a claim you attempt to support, but fail miserably at)<br />
<br />
2)  After a few other people bring up points contrary to yours, you begin to spout off large doses of nonsensical (sp?) psycho-babble.  This leads to the token grammar flames.<br />
<br />
3)  In defense of the grammar flames,   you basically say that a grasp of one's primary language isn't indicative of one's general level of intelligence.  I speak 3 languages fluently, and can translate a good bit of Latin and Greek, so I'm a bit bias when it comes to the &quot;I r smrtest most dood&quot; view.<br />
<br />
4)  You claim to be level 56, yet you don't know what the highest percentage cleric rez is.  I have but one response to this....ebay much junior?<br />
<br />
I'll admit that you bring up a good question, one that I can't answer in all certainty.  I do know that earlier today, I held aggro in the Hole over a 47 and 49 pally without a whole lot of trouble (we all have similar gear, and roughly the same haste percentage)  The defense of your argument has holes in it, and we called you on them...Deal with it.<br />

For a ranger i am a bit above average with my equip. I have yet to get into a group with a pally that can out-taunt me. If a pally is main, i have to stop kicking and stop attacking most, or rott the mob, so i don't get agro. If you think you can peel better than me cause you got stun, your mistaken. Sure, ranger class has its flaws, but so does the pally class. Every class does, just a shame you are too much of a fool to realise. Anyway, have a good life and i pray to tunare you don't play on The Namless, we already have enough fools.<br />

Go back to Karnors :P  To play a ranger you need to have some semblance of a brain at lower levels if you aren't twinked :P  We can't just waltz up to something with celestial cleansing on and beat the snot out of it refreshing cc and stuns :P  No, we cant 6k crit undead.  No, we can't tank as well as plate classes no matter how many hitpoints we have.  <br />
<br />
We CAN however, hit the broadside of a barn, and make silly knights like yourself at least deal a bit more damage when you manage to hit something with our &quot;useless&quot; atk buffs=)P  At the top of our game, we can also rootpark with or without damage, buff hitpoints/atk/regeneration rate/runspeed rate/levi/EB/resist fire/cold, snare, TAUNT (yes, weeds, lick, weeds owns a couple stuns :P) if we have our epics 50 percent slow, control active mob agro with root, jolt, and the taunt spells mentioned above, and best of all, we can do it at 100+ dps :P<br />
<br />

Invariably, I am forced to stop attacking and cast jolt to keep the mob on the pally. It's annoying, to put it mildly. I don't like grouping with paladins for that reason, as many of them seem to erroneously think they are effortlessly maintaining aggro.<br />
<br />
However, I will add that I think each class has its benefits, even paladins. The other side of that coin, however, is that each class also has its weaknesses--which includes you. Thus, the concept of grouping.<br />

Pallies in general are excellent taunt keepers and I fully respect every class player that is ahead of their game, dunno why you need to flame rangers 'Pal', but if you lost taunt in the first place, someone in your group wasnt playing their char right.<br />
<br />
But if you think you can out taunt a Ranger, have a Ranger load up and chain cast 'Flame lick' (lvl 9 AC debuff), a couple of times. Now keep trying to out taunt that Ranger Pal, good luck.<br />
<br />
Dual Wield is more of a taunt than 2HS, which is why you need taunt/stuns right? its also why Rangers had a bad rep for getting killed a lot in the days of Kunark.<br />
<br />
As a general rule, when Im in a group and we need a plate class, I request Paladin over other class, because of the group heal (agro hold) and extra buffs, also that we have a rezzer, specially if a dru / sha is doing the heals, LoH is a blast too (tho some Pallies still think that LoH is for them only).<br />
<br />
As for your comment on Paladin out damaging a Ranger, well too many things come into the equation for that to hold any real merit.<br />
