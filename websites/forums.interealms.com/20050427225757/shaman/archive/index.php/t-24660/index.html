<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A few suggestions<br />
<br />
Nurga:  easy in here mobs come in pulls of 2 and 3.  Casters are in their midst though - so take heed of that fact.  Good ZEM bonus<br />
pro: easy pulls <br />
con: casters - you may want to put up resist buffs or just heal your way through them.  If you get in toward the back though keep in the the wizzies will have Ice Comet in their repetoire...<br />
<br />
Dulak:  Now with the stone to click on - much easier run to the harbour.  I'd stick with Stormwave boat, maybe Lady D but nothing higher than that until you level some.  You could (while yer there) get the drunken pirate drop for your shammy too...<br />
pro: good exp, no casters.<br />
con: cleric will need to be invised to the boats and through Gulf tunnel<br />
<br />
SolB: Bats and Bugs.  Still a great spot for low to mid 50's.  Low hit point mobs, bat's stun doesn't seem to do much these days....and even if you got the occasional LDC or death beetle etc. you'd be fine with the Cleric.  lvl 51 will generate agro in here though i.e. you'll be dealing with 2-3 bats on each pull until its broken.<br />
pro: old world HP on mobs - hit like 6 year olds.<br />
Con: bats run - have that root ready. large old world agro radius<br />
<br />
Karnor's Castle:  I know I know...people **** on this zone but its no longer train central and the pulls are easy and steady.  Often I find I'm the only one in the zone.  Keep stun on cleric loaded for when you encounter those CH ghosts<br />
pro: seldom do mobs resist - fairly low HP on mobs<br />
con: get away from zoneline.<br />
<br />
City of Mist:  Of any of the above suggestions - this would be your best bet me thinks.  Fairly easy pulls - won't get more than 3 mobs.  Occasional named just for kicks.  GREAT exp for relatively wimpy mobs. <br />
con: a bit of a run to get there<br />
pro: very few (if any) casters.  great ZEM<br />
