<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antmf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wat is the main difference and is it noticable I am kind of dissapointed in the 55 pet seems low HP and does not do great damage. Please let me know so i can decide as to whether or not to get 61 or stay at 60 and work AA. Thanks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>libeck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Alpha 55 pet with Haste and IoS does some pretty good damage.  Not sure if you alpha and haste your pet but mine does way more damage if I give it some stuff to work with.<br />
<br />
Soullous</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 61 pet is an amazing improvement over the 55 pet.<br />
<br />
The 55 pet is (i believe) level 37, whereas the 61 pet is level 58.  The 61 pet has a lot more HP too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">61 pet has noticibly more hp, enrages, parses 30-40 DPS with 2 weapons and haste, depending on what you're fighting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No kidding, the jump is huge.  At 60, everything you fight is deep red to your pet.<br />
<br />
At 61, stuff you'll fight will probably be blue to your pet.  It's a big, big difference.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Huge difference... the 61 pet is what I wished for from the beginning...  Its not a mage pet or a necro pet, but its a viable pet as opposed to a portable dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">61 pet is actually level 59, not 58..and quads for 60 in addition to being able to proc the good pet weapons.<br />
<br />
I have to be honest though, I didn't think the 55 pet was half bad. Only big complaint was the aggro it caused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pet is 58 sir.   At least it was level 58 when I first got it and had someone con it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Have to add my 2cp  :) .  The only reason i hit 61 was to get the pet, and it was well worth it.  It can actually tank fairly well once mob is slowed (have tanked many tier 1 mobs), i would have not said as much for our earlier pets.  Buffed and equipped with mage summoned items and you have quite a beast (as our pets go).  Regarding staying at 60 for the express purpose of AA'ing, the community seems to be of the opinion that level&gt;&gt;aa.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">61 pet is the first puppy you can be proud of. It is level 58, not 59 from what I had peeps con when I first got it. It has approximately 2100hp unbuffed. With FoS + 2 ixi fists + belt of magi the pet pushes 3khp and 70pct hasted with SLTW and the 10pct from the belt. It's still low-end compared to a beastlord, mage and necro pet but 1000x better than our 55 pet. It regens insanely fast after battle.<br />
<br />
I'd defintely get 61 and then AA, you have so many more options available to you with the 61 pet. He's a good doggy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I reckon the 55 pet is not half bad.<br />
<br />
He quads for 50 once in a while with weapons, and is mana free damage once you cast him. <br />
<br />
The best thing about him is that he will off tank adds for about 40 secs before he dies, so that they aren't beating on you.<br />
<br />
The worst thing about him is that he is only level 37, so he usually causes the abovementioned adds.<br />
<br />
Get the level 61 dog :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">AFAIK, the mage summoned pet belt has no haste, but their Muzzle of Mardu has ~11% haste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oops, yea my bad. Muzzle has the haste, belt has the HPs and stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">55 pet is a sick, sad joke - he was very useful for farming greens.  The 61 pet is dark blue still at 65.  Much better than I expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mrwallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wouldn't know, and have no way to verify...but where did this information come from?  Is the 55 pet a downgrade from the 49 pet?<br />
My 49 dog cons light blue to me at 51 fully buffed.  What lvl is the 49 pet then?  I assumed (I know:) the pet was a level or 2 under the level at which we get them...not true?<br />
<br />
Flame away...I deserve it:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I’m very much looking forward to hitting level 61 and meming my new puppy spell.  I took the time to get run three at about level 52.  But after that I decided to wait until level 61 before I earned another AA.  It’s been hard watching my friends call out AA after AA, but I’m slowly heading in the right direction.  I’m 20% into 59 so I can just make out the light at the end of the tunnel.  With the vast difference is level; I expect the wait will be well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Really? The people I had con it said it was yellow at 58.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The level 61 spell True Spirit summons a level 58 pet.   The level 55 spell Spirit of the Howler summons a level 40 pet.<br />
<br />
A level 58 mob is much more likely to hit another level 58 mob for full damage whereas a level 40 mob is unlikely to hit a level 58 mob for much damage at all.  That is the difference you can expect to see.  Of course, if you are fighting a level 62 mob such as the Crystalline Golems in PoV, neither is likely to be all that effective but the level 58 pet will live longer.<br />
<br />
What gets me is that beastlords get a level 61 pet, Bah !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Then I think your people were either lying about the con or about their level.<br />
<br />
I can verify, that pet's level 58.</div></div><hr />
