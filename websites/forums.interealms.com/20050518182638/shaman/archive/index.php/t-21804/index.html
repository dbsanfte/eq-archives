<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I had a GREAT time at the summit.<br />
<br />
I'm going to have to ask your patience for an update (although I see that the word is already getting out!)<br />
<br />
I had a late return flight so I could spend some extra time in San Diego and my flight was delayed by a few hours. It's now 2:36 am, I just got home and I have to present stuff at an 8:00 am meeting.<br />
<br />
I won't have a chance to fill you in with my experience until later Monday afternoon.<br />
<br />
Sorry!<br />
<br />
*************<br />
<br />
Added my update to the first post!<br />
<br />
I'm so sorry I haven't been able to get away today for a longer update. Work is just crazy for me right now, I was in non stop meetings. With the late flight in last night and work pressure, I've been a total zombie today. <br />
<br />
Since I'm late posting a summary, there will be a lot of duplicate information from the other attendees, apologies.<br />
<br />
First off, as many of the other attendees have said, it was very difficult to talk about class issues. The main focus of the meeting was pretty much major game issues. I was also very disappointed not to get a chance to talk very much to the spell and AA guys who weren't present in the round table meetings I attended (although I did talk to both briefly at the baseball game).<br />
<br />
I did take a lot of notes so here we go:<br />
<br />
Guild Summit Notes <br />
<br />
1. Developers <br />
First and most importantly, it was great to talk to all the developers and see how much they loved the game too. There was a lot of passion and excitement about Everquest. Everyone was extremely nice, they seemed genuinely glad to have us there and very interested in our opinions about the game. They definitely brought us there to hear our ideas on how to fix things.<br />
<br />
2. Representation <br />
I was expecting the guild summit to be 100% uber guild representation with a handful of class representation sprinkled in. I was very surprised to see there was a representative from the Roleplayers invited as well as someone from EQtraders.com. There was definitely a voice for players of all levels. The mage representative (Lumenus) and the enchanter representative (Juwel) who were in my roundtable group did a great job of asking questions about all player types. <br />
<br />
I confess to a few moments of &quot;eq groupieness&quot; when I met Woody and Baelish. I also had to laugh, the RZ guy from Ascending Dawn was SO NICE and really cute in a blonde, preppy way. Definitely did not match my pre-conceptions of a PVP player! (still bitter about level 3 mage that killed my level 1 cleric and looted her newbie tunic). I really really enjoyed meeting Chenier from the Druid's Grove, she is awesome!<br />
<br />
3. Revamp of the Guide program <br />
According to Michael Woods, the CS representative who spoke at my roundtable, they have big changes planned for the guide program. Guides will no longer answer &quot;regular&quot; petitions. They will have their own petition line and will handle more &quot;community&quot; issues. They will provide over weddings and name changes. They will also run quests (they will be able to create NCPs, etc). I thought this sounded awesome!<br />
<br />
4. Revamp of the Customer Service tool <br />
SOE was really excited about their new system to answer petitions. It was a little technical to me, but I was impressed by their new goal - they hope to lower response time to 1-2 hours. They said in the past, the main reason their response times were so long was because they had to wait for the player to be online. They now have a lot more capability to answer petitions offline (such as item reimbursal). <br />
<br />
Players will also have the ability to &quot;amend&quot; petitions without deleting and resubmitting. IIRC, players will also be able to see their petition's status in the queue. They also said they have recently added to their numbers of GMs, it was all very positive and I have high hopes for long petition times!<br />
<br />
They are also piloting a program for a special queue for guild leader petitions. They passed out a form for the guild leaders present at the summit and they plan to expand the program to other guild leaders if it is successful. I'm sure this has been discussed everyplace, so I'll just mention it here, if you have any more questions, let me know.<br />
<br />
Fun fact - I got a chance to peek at server populations:<br />
<br />
Erollisi Marr - 1670<br />
Stormhammer - 600 something<br />
Sullon Zek - 500<br />
<br />
I was surprised to see FV with over 1600 people!<br />
<br />
5. Automatic consent for corpse dragging <br />
All kinds of cool things about corpse dragging:<br />
* Corpse would be &quot;carried&quot; so no need to spam the button<br />
* Add the ability to drag multiple corpses<br />
* Radius expanded<br />
* Guild wide consent<br />
<br />
6. Better testing of expansions <br />
There was a lot of discussion about why GoD testing wasn't successful.  Expecting individuals who weren't raid savvy to test high level raid content with strangers was probably the most common complaint. One of the proposals was to offer Beta testing to an entire guild of high level players who were used to raiding together. In order to further entice these players to thoroughly test the content, they talked about various incentive programs (tokens etc.) <br />
<br />
As was noted on other sites, SOE stepped up to take the blame for the lack of testing and said they were committed to avoiding a repeat in the future.<br />
<br />
7. Everquest 2 demo <br />
Okay, this probably should be farther down on the list, but dammit, I was blown away. I got a chance to see the &quot;new&quot; Cazic Thule with lizardmen who ripped out their eyes due to their God. I got to see the beautiful new water and a gorgeous evil Bixie. I was all goo goo eyed over the character creation of a female wood elf - at least TWENTY hair styles including an amazing crown of flowers (I was also amused by a female troll model who had nails down her head). Everyone will be able to toggle helm graphics on and off.<br />
<br />
Apparently, you can customize nearly everything: lip size, nose size, eyes, etc.<br />
<br />
I was a little disappointed that the Everquest 2 elf models were a little &quot;stocky.&quot; I always thought elves should be tall and willowy. Still, it was absolutely amazing, such a pretty game! (have no idea if my current computer could play it).<br />
<br />
8. Guild Banker <br />
There was some discussion around a guild banker. They were still kicking around some ideas of implementation: should it be all guild members who have access, should guild leaders be able to grant access to certain individuals, should there be a log of what was put it in and what was taken out? <br />
<br />
9. Raid Stuff <br />
Improved raid exp was a hot topic as well as a raid message of the day (which was very popular and mentioned by multiple people). There was also discussion about ways to kick guild members who are afk in other zones. One of the most intriguing ideas was concept of &quot;drag and drop&quot; group formation where the raid leader would be able to easily switch raid members between groups. I wasn't there, but Trapper from Magister told me he raised the issue about raid leader points staying with a guild since it tends to be a guild that really earns the points for an individual. I don't know where that discussion went, but I know the issue was raised!<br />
<br />
10. Re-using augments<br />
SOE is definitely considering ways for augments to be re-usable. One of their ideas is an alchemy created solvent! (although several people in my round table meeting booed the idea). They appear to be considering the following solvent options: alchemy made, tradeskill made from drops to allow lower level players a chance to make something they can sell to higher level players and vendor purchased solvents.<br />
<br />
They are also considering &quot;tiers&quot; of solvent. For example, if you wanted to get a nice level 8 Time caliber augment off your gear, you would need a more powerful (expensive, harder to get) solvent.<br />
<br />
11. Focus items<br />
I brought up the focus items (sorry, it's a pet peeve of mine!) and they are considering having focus items have a reduction in power for higher level spells rather than being completely useless. So, if your high level focus item saved 25% mana on a level 65 spell, it would save 20% mana on a level 70 spell.<br />
<br />
Of course, I would prefer level 4 and up focus to just keep working until level 70, but that is actually a decent compromise.<br />
<br />
12. Full instancing of Time .<br />
Everybody wants it, it was mentioned A LOT.<br />
<br />
13. Buff/debuff real estate <br />
Very exciting to think of more debuff/buff slots. They are considering having extra buff slots cost AAs, but I firmly told them they should be FREE. Let's see if they listen to me! :)<br />
<br />
14. Backflagging <br />
The heartache of having to constantly back flag as members leave/retire was raised in several meetings I attended. There were some far out suggestions, like raid mobs that would drop tokens that raid leaders could pass out for flags. There was also a suggestion that killing a boss mob of a zone would flag the raider for the zone (for example, killing Fennin Ro would flag the raid attendee for Fire). There was also a plea for an improvement of the &quot;piggyback 15%&quot; system, where the raid leader would know exactly the number of flagged members currently in the raid and exactly the number of non flagged members who could be invited and successfully enter the zone.<br />
<br />
15. Sounds <br />
There was a very intriguing discussion about the ability for a raid leader to trigger sounds. Like &quot;Time to Move.&quot;  There was discussion that a lot of people didn't play with sound on and how could they keep people from griefing with sound. Several people present in my round table group talked about a better integration of Team Speak into the game. There was a lot of note taking on both sides during this discussion and I hope something pans out. <br />
<br />
16. Lore <br />
The more casual player types would have been amazed at the all the uber raider types begging for more &quot;Norrathian&quot; content. There was a lot of dissatisfaction for the Wayfarer guild and zone names you can't pronounce and aliens and weird mobs. Players begged for gnolls and dragons and a chance to see unseen EQ gods like Prexus and Quellious or the evil King and Queen of Neriak. There was a huge demand for the current game lore to be fleshed out. (one of the developers casually mentioned a level 20ish Bixie dungeon, I hope this gets implemented!!) This was the overwhelming response from nearly everyone present.<br />
<br />
Fun fact -<br />
While even on this board, Velious was a huge fan favorite, according to one of the developers it is the &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; of EQ - the fan favorite that is the lowest performer.<br />
<br />
17. Level advancement tied to AAs <br />
A myth. Completely dispelled.<br />
<br />
18. Epic 2.0 <br />
These are going to be TOUGH, you should consider epic 2.0 to be two times as hard as epic 1.0. They are going to be earned with some solo work, some group work and DEFINITELY a raid for the final fight. There was assurance that if you get a raid together, the piece you need WILL DROP (so, no more 20 Phinny fights to get a lousy wizzie epic piece). Holly the developer (ha, one of the FEW names I remember) says that each of the quest scripts is pages and pages long.  Holly also said: <br />
<br />
* They took great care to make the difficulty comparable between classes (no more mage epic vs. rogue epic)  <br />
* There would be incremental rewards a la shaman sow boots<br />
* There would be no difficulties with faction (no one has to worry about wrecked home town faction).<br />
<br />
I got a chance to see the concept drawings for a lot of the epics and they are all beautiful art. I still think the shaman epic is the UGLIEST, though. I was really impressed by the rogue epic and the wizard epic.<br />
<br />
19. FT cap <br />
There is some talk about raising the FT cap. Of course, all the power players in my round table group said it wasn't necessary, they never run out of mana :(  I said I was definitely in favor of raising the cap!<br />
<br />
20. New class titles <br />
New incremental class titles can be based on class, race, tradeskill (the tradeskill class title would be based on actual skill level). You can only pick one title. I begged, but Holly was a tough nut and wouldn't give me any examples.<br />
<br />
21. Vext/Tipt time length <br />
A 6 hour Vext/Tipt raid is a mistake, it was never intended to take that long (straight from the dev's mouth!). He said it will be retuned.<br />
<br />
22. Stackable Spells <br />
Sadly, no. Coding won't let spell scrolls stack.<br />
<br />
23. Racial AAs <br />
The developer was pretty anti racial AAs. He said he didn't want anyone to feel punished for a race decision they made 5 years ago.<br />
<br />
24. Tribute <br />
1. Guild tribute will stack with regular tribute (hitpoints, mana etc).<br />
2. No plans to make no drop items tribute-able (is that a word?) since there would be no reason to tribute droppable items<br />
<br />
25. Uber guilds and money issues <br />
*cough* I'm just reporting here, people, don't shoot the messenger. There was complaint that GoD was bankrupting large raid guilds since they had no real way to make money (no droppable spells, little droppable loot, no tradeskill items worth any money).<br />
<br />
26. Raid Size <br />
I complained that the constant fluctuation of acceptable raid size was detrimental to my guild. We recruited for the 72 limit for POP and we might be forced to send people away for a 54 person GoD instance. The developers said that it was a mistake to make the number so variable but there would be instancing in OoW that would require limit the number of attendees. The developer also said there would be outside zones which would have no limit to the number of people who could help with the fight.<br />
<br />
27. Holy Trinity <br />
I was lucky enough to have the Gilfalas (Paladins of Norrath) attend my round table meetings. He was quite vocal that some classes were marginalized by GoD and raised a lot of good points. The few times he stopped to take a breath, I mentioned the fact that there were few reasons to take a shaman, when so many other classes could fulfill the slowing role while adding other benefits to the party. The devs pretty much said this was a tuning issue, events should not be tuned so hard that only a warrior could tank or a cleric could heal.<br />
<br />
28. Shaman Issues <br />
Okay guys, to be honest, there just wasn't a lot of opportunity to talk about shaman issues. The round table issues were intended for general game issues. I did manage to corner Ryan (the spell guy) and the AA guy (I wish I could remember his name, he was really nice) at the Padres game. It was hard to have a discussion over the roar of the crowd, but this is what we talked about:<br />
<br />
1. We will be getting an improved Cripple with OoW which should really do something, especially on raid targets<br />
<br />
2. Ryan is very interested in something he calls a &quot;chain lightning&quot; effect. Spells would bounce from target to target. If you healed a person in your raid, the heal spell would travel to any people close by. Shaman might also have this ability to debuff. Ryan called it an infection which would spread from mob to mob. I did bring up concerns about stackability, so hopefully he will take that into consideration.<br />
<br />
3. I did my best to convince Ryan that stat buffs were marginally effective at best, but he wasn't convinced. On a positive, we are going to gain the ability to buff OVER the cap limit. Say a warrior is capped at the new limit of 330. Our 70+ (or whatever) sta buff will raise him to 400+. I did point out the stat returns are increasingly minimal after a certain level, but Ryan insisted that it would help.<br />
<br />
4. I talked about cannabalize and passive mana regen, but I don't think we're going to be getting any sort of passive mana regen. Ryan was agreeable to the idea of a cannabilize that would match the percentage that can 5 USED to do, back when players had mana pools of 3K instead of 6K. Ryan had concern that we would mem the new spell with can 4 and alternate them. I tried to give him the innocent look, but he wasn't buying it. He is looking into the spell timers so the two spells could not be used concurrently.<br />
<br />
5. Crit affliction causing aggro - All the devs agreed that poison did a freaky, unintended amount of aggro. Ryan said he had heard that crit affliction was doing untoward aggro and had run some testing on his own that didn't show that it was. So, all of you number crunchers out there, we need some documented evidence that we are getting weird aggro on critical affliction.<br />
<br />
6. Shrinkable bear form - Ryan was surprised that bear form doesn't get super tiny. When we were talking about spells to get excited about, I mentioned that bear form was the big spell for me in Velious. I told him that we were definitely looking for something with a big cool factor for OoW.<br />
<br />
7. We are not getting a pet bixie :(  We are also not getting winged courier :(<br />
<br />
8. Doing things faster in order to better adapt to a fast paced world. Ryan seems to think that the faster slow solved this issue, no amount of pleading on my part could budge him. When I said that we spent more than half the fight malosing and slowing, he said that slow was a huge effect, even if it only lasted the last 10 seconds of a 30 second fight. I really really tried on this one.<br />
<br />
In closing, apologies for not getting more of an opportunity to raise shaman issues. I thought I would get more of an opportunity to talk to the spell/AA developers during the round table meetings. <br />
<br />
Okay, I'm losing my caffeine buzz and it's 7:09 pm and I'm STILL at work! Please feel free to post questions and ask for clarification on any issue. If I think of anything else, I will post more.<br />
<br />
I had an absolute blast, it was great meeting some of the other shaman there, like Ulver and Drydan (super lurker with a big 11 posts on the Crucible).</div></div><hr />

Im sick and tired of bull**** dialogue!  Give us some changes for Christ's sake!  And I am not talking about being able to shrink my pet.  All the communication we've had and the first solution is to fix the pet shrink issue.  Gimme a break - this rhetoric is starting to finally piss me off.  Don't talk about changes - actually make some!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tickmunki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just reminder people form what l read across the internet is that they reallly did not talk about class, thats much, this was more of a &quot;over all summit of the game&quot; anything as to class was minor, So in all SoE is trying to change their ways. I am still in the wait and see mind set. My advise is to go over to another class boards and read up. WHY? because not everyone was in the same meeting. 10 to 12 people per group or 5 or 6 and every one of them was different. From what l read online from another class boards. So dont get mad YET!..... It was just all about the high end of the game and how to make it better. Sound like there first target is the upper class then the mid-level and below. So. in the end just read up, Watch what SOE does, and then say what you will... <br />
<br />
<br />
Peace out</div></div><hr />

holy crap ! there is an upper and middle class to EQ ?<br />
so who are the poor bastards ? the casual non-raiders ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">8. Doing things faster in order to better adapt to a fast paced world. Ryan seems to think that the faster slow solved this issue, no amount of pleading on my part could budge him. When I said that we spent more than half the fight malosing and slowing, he said that slow was a huge effect, even if it only lasted the last 10 seconds of a 30 second fight. I really really tried on this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This part is extremely discouraging.  How in the world can anyone that knows anything about playing a shaman be so steadfast in thinking that a quicker slow solves our problem with super short fights?  I guess Ryan thinks all a shaman is good for is slow, and as long as it lasts at least 10 secs before the mob dies everything is fine.<br />
<br />
What a load of BS.  Sorry, but I don't pay $12.95 a month and play a game for hundreds (if not thousands) of hours in order to cast one spell per mob.  Certainly no reason to take a shaman, a BST or chanter can do the job and then some.<br />
<br />
Unbelieveable.<br />

Wing, when you said all &quot;their&quot; email addresses, do you mean the participants or the developers? I did get a list of the participants email addresses (I don't think that's a big secret) but I didn't get any developer email addresses.</div></div><hr />

Number 8 under the shaman issues section of your report was fairly irritating, to say the least. I liked most of what I read in your report, honestly. But there's a lot to digest ... wow. <br />

However 1 and 2 under 28 looks quite interesting to me, and sets a positive note.  For not getting too much time to talk with them about our class (since it was mainly for the game itself), it looks like you did quite well getting some insight for our class. :)</div></div><hr />

I have a question about the &quot;over all feeling&quot; or &quot;vibe&quot; that you got from the summit concerning our class ...<br />
Did you get the feeling that the developers are going too continue with the &quot;Short fight&quot; mentality into the future of everquest ?<br />
If you did get the feeling that the current &quot;SPEED is all that matters&quot; style of play , did you get any hope at all that the slower paced classes &quot;Shaman&quot; might be helped a little too compete in this world of speed ?<br />

<br />
That's an interesting question. There really wasnt a slow fight vs. long fight vibe at all.<br />
<br />
While solo isn't terribly fun for everyone, it is something that shaman tend to excel at. In my afternoon roundtable meeting, Holly the developer said there should be soloable content in OoW.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry I didn't do a better job of getting an answer to this important question, I really took notes with me!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">13. Buff/debuff real estate <br />
Very exciting to think of more debuff/buff slots. They are considering having extra buff slots cost AAs, but I firmly told them they should be FREE. Let's see if they listen to me! :)<br />
<br />
Yipee, more work for the buffbot.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. I did my best to convince Ryan that stat buffs were marginally effective at best, but he wasn't convinced. On a positive, we are going to gain the ability to buff OVER the cap limit. Say a warrior is capped at the new limit of 330. Our 70+ (or whatever) sta buff will raise him to 400+. I did point out the stat returns are increasingly minimal after a certain level, but Ryan insisted that it would help.<br />
<br />
Deep down, I never really believed that the EQ designers were utterly clueless about the game.  Looks like I was wrong.  Everyone who has put even a tiny amount of effort into checking has known that stat buffs are very, very, very marginal at best.  This was conventional wisdom (backed with hard data) on this board when I first came here, and that was during Kunark for chrissake.<br />
<br />
Really, that's amazing that you can be the spell guy at EQ and not have any clue how EQ works.  But I guess <br />
<br />
Doing things faster in order to better adapt to a fast paced world. Ryan seems to think that the faster slow solved this issue, no amount of pleading on my part could budge him. When I said that we spent more than half the fight malosing and slowing, he said that slow was a huge effect, even if it only lasted the last 10 seconds of a 30 second fight. I really really tried on this one.<br />
<br />
hahah, really?  He really said that?  That's pretty much insurmountable proof that any improvement for our class would have to begin with this guy's reassignment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like you have just confirmed that all the serious problems will remain serious problems.  I am glad to hear that the people who have destroyed the game are very friendly in person, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Thank you very much, Groli.<br />
You tried hard to convince.<br />
Unfortunately Dev team's opinion is different from ours.<br />
And they never changed their mind.<br />
<br />
we have great heal lesser than 58lvl druid.<br />
But it is enough not for our friend but for Dev team.<br />
Our buff is seemed to be great not for our friends but for Dev team.<br />
<br />
What should we do?<br />
We should Group with Dev team guys instead of our friend?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Oh to add, I also mentioned our proposed Ward refund. There is a current revamp of the AA system going on, they will be able to provide refunds after it is complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Oh, I just saw this write up from Thornsong (The Relentless) over on Druid's Grove. I hope he won't mind me cross posting it here, since he mentioned some things I forgot to mention (like the cool Chimera). He also gives a good description of the server room, which was totally cool looking but I'm a technical moron and wouldn't have known how to explain. Considering we broke into 4 groups for the round table discussions, some of this stuff is new to me too!<br />
<br />
*************<br />
Ok, where to begin. This was a total 180 from all other experiences I have had with Sony. IMO, they are scared. As Chris, the EQ project manager, said to me in private, this is the first time when people leave, they have an alternative of somewhere else to go, in their opinion.<br />
<br />
The event was extravagant. They flew us all in, had free beer on the bus on the way to the game and hotel, everything in the hotel was free, meals, room service, the bar, movies, long distance, internet access, everything. They took us to the Padre game where we had the most expensive seats and even had the billboard welcome us during the 6th inning. We came back from the game to find a gift packet in our room with a Zboard Gaming Keyboard with EQ overlay and a bunch of other cool gifts, including a free CD key of Omens of War. Don't be too jealous of me =). <br />
<br />
The next day we took a bus to SOE after breakfast with the developers where they had a tent set up in the parking lot for a meeting. Smedley opened up with a speech that began. GoD was our biggest f-up yet, we are sorry and vow never to make that mistake again. Then the guy over GoD got up and apologized and said hate me. It's my fault and it will never happen again. They then answered a bunch of questions about various things, before breaking us up into tour groups. Smedley led my group and we went first to customer service where we toured the facility and walked around looking over GMs shoulders as they helped petitions. They explained how they have just instituted new software that should speed up customer service - we basically said we would believe it when we see it. There was a board up that said 55,355 people were playing EQ, 2,912 in Planetside and 35,000 something in SWG. <br />
<br />
We then went to Ops where we saw the guys who reboot the server before touring the server room. For you geek types, EQ is on Windows NT from 8 years ago while EQ2 and all the other games are on Linux. <br />
<br />
The server room is cool. Old servers were about 2 1/2 racks currently. Each server handles around 5 zones and with 300 zones in game, its cumbersome. They are currently installing Bladestrike servers which will shrink EQ servers down a ton. Only one server is currently on that now. They also have a backup diesel generator to keep the game going during power outages. Some of the servers are in a remote location so that if they go down someone has to drive over to that location to reboot them. The Bladestrikes will solve that issue.<br />
<br />
Next we went to the developers area. They had all the Epic artwork on the wall. One senior animator was working on a Chimera model that rocked and he showed us some of the Omens of War models. Smedley mentioned to us that they are going to start outsourcing a lot of the artwork so that they can concentrate more on content rather than art, as that takes up the bulk of their time.<br />
<br />
We also saw the developer's schedule. One of them is doing the druid epic tuning next week, another is working on the guild tribute system for OOW. They also are adding a new AA structure to the backbone which will make it so that they can add AAs much much easier. That just got finished so we should expect new AAs before OOW that are free.<br />
<br />
After that we broke off into 10-15 man groups for development discussions. They said who wants to go first and I opened up and said my peace first. Smedley, Travis (designed the final zone of GoD and Yxtta (who said he would change the BiC quest pieces off the primals), Shaun Lord (a developer), and Alan (brenlo) were in our group.<br />
<br />
I said first thing they need to fix is making it so a guild can raid together. They seemed to like my 85/15 rule with keys dropping off the end game bosses. They also mentioned wanting to create the guild as an identity. I explained that people come back and can't raid with the guild so they lose interest and disappear and they said they will fix this somehow guaranteed. Their precise way of doing it will be worked out in the future.<br />
<br />
I also mentioned with the lvl 70 cap they need to instance time cause it will be a nightmare. Smedley said, Can that be done to the developers. They said yes, he said ok. We will look into it. Lots of other ideas happened as well. Some they liked, some they didn't. I suggested epic mount quests like dragons and underwater mounts, but they said they have issues with the global file. They also said they can't fly cause of the geometry of the engine. Brenlo pushed for halfling bards.<br />
<br />
After that we did lunch, I did the EQ2 demo instead. EQ2 is eye candy, wood elf girls have like 20 different hair models, even choosing flowers or butterflys in their hair. Personally, I wasn't impressed. You make furniture and stuff although the mirror was really cool in your house. It actually worked and had reflections as well.<br />
<br />
Back to customer service sessions where they explained their new customer service plan. I asked if they were swamped and he said yes. Average resolve time is like 33 hours but their new system will shrink that hopefully. They also said they are instituting new software which will speed that up. There is a red flag that pops up on an account that gets over a certain amount of plat or has a lot of plat pass through it. They wouldn't give us the exact numbers for obvious reasons. These accounts are checked to see if they are legit. One thing to note is that you no longer have to stay online to get a petition answered. They are saved now as instant messages.<br />
<br />
Next another development meeting, this time Chris the project manager and Hobart, one of the head programmers, replaced Smedley and Travis.<br />
<br />
Hobart asked us if we would be interested in a DKP-type table next to the guild management tool that would allow us to keep track of attendance for everyone automatically. Everyone said yes. They asked us if we wanted housing. Most people said no. I suggested to Chris a guild banker where you could turn in items and withdraw tradeskill stuff and such. He liked that idea. They want to add a trophy house for guilds which shows which mobs each guild has killed. Lots of other ideas went around as well.<br />
<br />
After that we went to dinner at a bar where practically everyone but me got plastered and they handed out a paper with a lot of immediate fixes and a lot of promises to look at other suggestions. <br />
<br />
Almost everyone came out of there very happy, including me, which was suprising as I was pretty cynical heading in. <br />
<br />
Other items of note:<br />
<br />
They promised to not go up and down with raid sizes.<br />
<br />
I talked to a dev who went through an Ikkinz trial last week with a paladin tanking. After the paladin went splat, he looked into it. He told me he spent the last four days retuning them so a paladin can tank it.<br />
<br />
They said they are changing spell drops so that you can quest every one. They will still drop randomly but they are adding a quest for each individual spell. One good suggestion someone made that they liked is making it so that in instanced zones, only spells of those present can drop.<br />
<br />
New melee animations and new player models will be coming out by the end of the year. The DX9 collision crap was done cause they upgraded the engine so they can make better looking zones. They are also mentioned hiring an outside company to go back and redo all the old zones to bring them up to the new engine.<br />
<br />
They are adding solo LDON expeditions for every class so that people who only have an hour can log on and do experience immediately. <br />
<br />
They are considering adding a whole other line of abilities for clerics, like making them nuke for 6k on undead or stuff or make them turn into a warriortype when fighting undead so that more people will play clerics, but they had no definitive answers for that.<br />
<br />
One of the things people said is they want expansions to use old lore, we don't need new aliens and stuff, building storylines and flush out the current lore. They said ok.<br />
<br />
Smedley asked us if we wanted to see numbers of mana and experience and he said they would consider adding it as an option you can turn on. They also said they would add it so you can see how much mana each person in the group has.<br />
<br />
They admitted this summit should have happened two years ago and they are now learning that they need more interaction with the players since we are the real power. They said they want to start doing a summit like this every six months or so. Another big fubar they mentioned is Uqua was finished. The problem is that it was designed for level 70. Originally they planned on adding two levels on the 5th anniversary of EQ and then 3 more in OOW. The developers then killed this idea. They said future expansions will have every encounter tuned by uber guilds rather than beta buffed randoms so they are ready when the expansion goes live.<br />
<br />
They admitted LoY was a rush job. One thing they are doing is adding a portal in PoK to LoY. That's how rushed it was, it didn't even get a portal (an obvious bug). <br />
<br />
Also one thing to note is that Omens of War only has one flagged zone, the rest is like Kunark where everyone can go everywhere.<br />
<br />
As far as GM events, they will be coming back. Test of Tactics, Best of the Best and other events will happen again for sure. They also are coming up with a more advanced Guild War system, including a specific zone for it. Hobart also mentioned a complete makeover of it with all kinds of events. I told him about the one we did with EOD where we had to kill the other guys GM, and he said &quot;regicide, that's one I hadn't thought of, will make sure it gets in.&quot;<br />
<br />
They asked alot of opinions. A company has contacted Sony about developing a Magic The Gathering-type card game for EQ and since I was wearing a MTG shirt on Smedley asked my opinion. The common cards will be bought at vendors and rare cards will drop off of different mobs. This game can be played against people while in EQ waiting for raids and such.<br />
<br />
One suggestion Rich from Talisman made that they liked was a raid leader being able to move groups around from the raid window. Murphy from BOTS had a good suggestion to combine the expedition and raid window so that you can see who logged without quitting expeditions.<br />
<br />
There was a ton more suggestions made and I thought it was worthwhile. They seemed genuine anyway.<br />

<br />
  Smedley, Travis (designed the final zone of GoD and Yxtta (who said he would change the BiC quest pieces off the primals), Shaun Lord (a developer), and Alan (brenlo) were in our group. <br />
<br />
This part has me a bit happy.. since right now I'm stuck needing two pieces from the Primal Spider and Insect to finish up Yxtta and get my 3 - 5th augments.  <br />
<br />
And on that note.. Rashere was the developer who created and designed Txevu.. and when he described it to me, he told me in these exact words &quot;Txevu isn't instanced and it's the final end game zone&quot;.  I think that he mentioned he also developed Yxtta.. but i'm not totally sure if he said that, or maybe Tipt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Hats of to you Gloriana for really trying to enlighten them a little about shaman issues. But sadly it sounds like they didnt understand.<br />
<br />
Most of the other things mentioned are fine and all but on the other hand it wont make or break the game.<br />
<br />
Specifically targetting spells I dont see any information about if they are changing the way spells are gotten in the future or are they perfectly happy with super rare spells off random mobs in highend zones? Because if they continue with that system then most of the discussion about new spells is a complete waste of time. A +100 CHA spell that I will probably never be able to get wont make me a better shaman ;-)<br />
<br />
I have a nagging feeling that SOE knew about most of these issues already and just held this summit to be able to say &quot;Look! We are trying to improve. We really do care!&quot;. And then you hear the head spelldesigner insists that 10 seconds of slow at the end of a fight is a monumental effect and that stat buffs make a big difference.<br />
<br />
Lets see what happens and when but I am not holding my breath for any truly positive changes after this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">i am not going to even read any of this.  not a single line.<br />
<br />
the addicts to the game and the raiders act like Sony is doing something.<br />
<br />
can you shrink your pet yet?<br />
<br />
for the love of god folks.  pet shrink is the only problem that has been identified by Sony as even a shaman PROBLEM, and it is not fixed.<br />
<br />
they talked.<br />
<br />
and you believe them.<br />
<br />
by and large, i think believing them is misguided at the least.<br />
<br />
how many times do you have to be screwed over before you realize you are being bent over?<br />
<br />
please let us wait till they actually fix something.  <br />
<br />
and from their past history, i would plat they never &quot;fix&quot; it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Great work, Glori, we all appreciate it, but it really seems to me that they not only want to give us the shaft, they want to make us spin on it, too. &quot;Buffs really work!&quot;, c'mon! And no passive mana regen? How about cutting all our cast times in half so we can squeeze off a spell between clicking cannibalize?<br />
<br />
One Kudos to the team, though - No more goddamned alien mobs. Hopefully they'll look to Velious. Everything in that expansion was familiar to someone who's into fantasy, but as used in a fresh way. Kunark was pretty damned good in that way, too, though they tried to pack a little too much in, if you ask me.<br />
<br />
One peeve - No more &quot;lost&quot; continents . dungeons / planes, PLEASE? Expand  on what's already there. Odus and Faydwer are so small! Are there more places on Broken Skull Rock, perhaps a truely outdoor zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Ok, just saw Thornsongs writeup and that mentions an alternate way to get spells. That might work depending on how its implemented. Only having spells drop in an instanced dungeon that will be usable by people in that instance is a very good idea!<br />
<br />
Another thing from that writeup:<br />
<br />
&quot;with the lvl 70 cap they need to instance time cause it will be a nightmare&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmmm, wont the level 70 cap make lots of other places nightmares too?</div></div><hr />

What was your impression of the response to this by SOE?  Did they act like it's something they are sick of being asked about and aren't sure what is going to happen or were they receptive with some hints at it going this way in the near future?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They acted like it's not a simple thing to do. Something about the phases and the ability to complete a phase and come back the next day making it difficult. They were generally receptive to it, though. They didn't completely shut anyone down like Ryan and my genius idea of a Bixie pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">To Bonestomper,<br />
I think, the reason why they do not fix is that they do not think our problems as a real problem.<br />
So they took our idea as a stupid trash and never heard Glori's saying.<br />

In sum: none of our issues, are issues; stat buffs are effective (despite what parsing shows); slow is still powerful even if it only effects the last 10sec's of a 30sec fight<br />
<br />
The message is: We are old content therefore need no fixing...old content is...well old</div></div><hr />

First changes from the Guild Summit<br />
<br />
Hey folks,<br />
<br />
We have tackled two of the quicker issues and are pushing them to Test for your perusal.  Remember that these are the first of many changes and they are concurrent to, not superceding the feedback changes we started last week.  We will have more updates from both lists later this week.<br />
<br />
- The Plane of Time will now shut down unused and empty instances.<br />
<br />
- A portal stone has been added to the Plane of Knowledge to take adventurers to Gunthak.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to discuss these changes on the EQ Forums at EQforums.station.sony.com.<br />
<br />
Thanks all!<br />
<br />

Already adding Pok stones to Loy on test.Glad to see this. still like play around there and this will make that run so much less painful.I dont mind running a few zones but always hated that run throught the warrens.</div></div><hr />

They dont recognise that our buffs mean ABSOULTELY nothing on the outcome of a fight. A group or raid will win (or lose) against a certain encounter without our buffs without even a noticeable (for that matter even a parseable) change in difficulty.<br />
<br />
They dont care if our slow even matters in the bottom line. The simple fact that we can cast it (whether it lands and effects the fight for a few seconds or not) will forever doom the shaman. Shaman slow is best used soloing. Fact...<br />
<br />
Given the fact that everyone that attended the summit says they rarely got a chance to talk about what REALLY mattered to them, was flying a few loudmouths to Cali even necessary? This &quot;new&quot; information could easily been put up on the &quot;upcoming changes&quot; page on the EQ website. Did they need to fly them there to get feedback?  Hell no, not a single thing mentioned by anyone was groundbreaking, all have been mentioned on millions of EQ related boards around the Net. <br />
<br />
It was fluff... Spend $10k, appease the sheep for a while.<br />

Was Glori's report a groundbreaking achievement for shaman? NOPE.<br />

The event was extravagant. They flew us all in, had free beer on the bus on the way to the game and hotel, everything in the hotel was free, meals, room service, the bar, movies, long distance, internet access, everything. They took us to the Padre game where we had the most expensive seats and even had the billboard welcome us during the 6th inning. We came back from the game to find a gift packet in our room with a Zboard Gaming Keyboard with EQ overlay and a bunch of other cool gifts, including a free CD key of Omens of War. Don't be too jealous of me =). <br />

Dang come on there are 2 another class that slow and be more helpfull in a group. His words alone make want to delate my shaman and start hole new class. The game issuses to me are like &quot;ok lets wait and see what gets done&quot; then complain about it later. It just upsett me, a long time shaman player to the complete lack of respect shaman's get. There some light in all the angry. The stat buff idea or 28 sub listing 3 is a good idea, and hope that only shaman get this ablity. Let me think about this, I sit in POK buff toons for plat any ways why not sit there longer and get tell hammered for this ablity. Nice idea,for money making side of the class, but l believe in my opinion that its what l will see more of, and less and less people wanting shaman in there group. I did post the Thread about the new EQ2 trailer, its like neverend LOTR Sony style that is. I just waiting till that games comes out then start a new class and delate my EQ1 account alltogethor the total lack or respect for shaman is stupid heck the Rogues did have much to say another then the drag corpse issuse but they were soo into fixing that idea faster. In the end, l just wait and see what change the games makes. OH yea, another note NO MORE STUPID WERID  NPC from Star wars. When did EQ start to look like the Star Wars game then the Game got 5 years agoo. Why  delate those stupid mobs in PC &quot; lack of truly know the mobs in my major weekness and SPELLING them let allone&quot; and replace them with goblens or something l can reminder from &quot;OLD SCHOOL EQ&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">4. I talked about cannabalize and passive mana regen, but I don't think we're going to be getting any sort of passive mana regen. Ryan was agreeable to the idea of a cannabilize that would match the percentage that can 5 USED to do, back when players had mana pools of 3K instead of 6K. Ryan had concern that we would mem the new spell with can 4 and alternate them. I tried to give him the innocent look, but he wasn't buying it. He is looking into the spell timers so the two spells could not be used concurrently. <br />
<br />
This is easy to fix. They already have the code to do it in mod rods.<br />
<br />
Mod rods have a timer... The new Can spells can have a timer too...<br />
Cast the new can and no other Can spell (would say except Can5) can be cast in the time it take the cast spells gem to repop.<br />
<br />
There is even 2 ways to do it.<br />
A timer like mod rods or simply all Can spells grey out for the duration.<br />
<br />
Likely easier to make Can a mod rod with a spell gem...<br />
<br />
And speaking of which would be damn nice if they told us how much time we had before we could use a mod rod again when we use it and if we tried to use another too soon like our aa abilities.<br />
How hard can it be to display the timer when they already have it calculated?</div></div><hr />

 :rolleyes: So lets see, they got a free Omens key, something to eat and a keyboard - in exchange for trying to communicate a lot of ideas to some developers and for a lot of personal time lost.<br />
<br />
And you actually complain about that? You even have the nerve to compare this to &quot;the business world&quot;? You might have a point<br />
- if we had paid these people<br />
- if they had agreed to doing anything but present our issues (which they did)<br />
<br />
I wish a lot more had come from this meeting. I wish class issues had been adressed, for all classes. But I am not going to blame it on those who sacrificed their time to present my issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Fantastic writeups from all those that went. As strange as it was, it was exciting reading those 2 reports. They sound very encouraging. Especially with the prospects of perhaps some new aa's without expansions and GM events!! Loy portal been a long time waiting for that, but that will be well received.<br />
<br />
&quot;bixie dungeon&quot; sounds exciting.<br />
<br />
Its cool about cripple and some of the ideas they were toying with. The stat buffs, its what is needed I think, but its still questionable how much effect the increased stats will do. I mean 400 dex? is that really going to be better than 200 dex? Hopefully they will tie in those modifiers.<br />
<br />
The solo Ldon is good but I would have preferred they looked at a medium option ldon setting. Solo could be bad in a few ways, could lead to farming of the items, but would be nice for a change.<br />
<br />
Also an addition to the epic bit, apparently on mobhunter, there are plans for an epic 1.5 and an epic 2.0. With epic 2.0 only being available to the &quot;uberest of players&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elemental gear on Ldon&quot; Just as another note, this is good in a respect but I still would have preferred hard being toned down or a medium option so people can get them via drops rather than the intensive mindnumbing grinding. Or some other way.<br />
<br />
Lastly, what a good chance SoE used to advertise EQ2 lol- showing it to all the guildleaders and community spokespeople.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Gloriana thank you for being our voice. <br />
<br />
Number 8, in addition to making me want to drop kick Ryan, shows just how much of an understanding of our class. Ryan really needs to to play the number 2 or 3 shaman on a raid. I say this because then he would be confronted with the fact that besides buff bot we are a one trick pony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Thanks for the effort Glori. Overall the news for EQ players looks very encouraging. For shaman though, it's really not looking good. They aren't acknowledging any of our key issues:<br />
<br />
Raw stat buffs of limited effect<br />
The over-buffs will help, but other than stamina these still don't make a huge difference. I'd like to see more of the % ability buffs like strike-through.<br />
<br />
Fast paced play<br />
Perhaps more worrying still, they see no issue with us just casting malos+slow. So long as we can't contribute some reasonable dps, beastlords and chanters will always take preference as slowers. Only exception to this is where malos is required.<br />
<br />
Well, back to the bard alt for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">this just confirms my veiw of ryan as someone who doesnt know his arse from his mouth. he should be sacked and fast. he is obviuosly clueless and where most of shaman problems stem from. i was blameing smedley but it is now apparently clear that its the spell dev ryan firmly to blame, oh wait i can blame smedley for still employing this fool.<br />
<br />
i think as a whole we should ask from someone esle to look at shaman, i think without ryan there we might actually get some balance back but with him there we are screwed as he will obviuosly never see sense.<br />
<br />
i would like to say thanks to glori , you did try. and the stuff not shaman related had soem good points, but it doid also show ryan in his true light.</div></div><hr />

<br />
5. Crit affliction causing aggro - All the devs agreed that poison did a freaky, unintended amount of aggro. Ryan said he had heard that crit affliction was doing untoward aggro and had run some testing on his own that didn't show that it was. So, all of you number crunchers out there, we need some documented evidence that we are getting weird aggro on critical affliction.<br />
<br />
<br />
8. Doing things faster in order to better adapt to a fast paced world. Ryan seems to think that the faster slow solved this issue, no amount of pleading on my part could budge him. When I said that we spent more than half the fight malosing and slowing, he said that slow was a huge effect, even if it only lasted the last 10 seconds of a 30 second fight. I really really tried on this one.<br />
<br />
QUOTE]<br />
<br />
<br />
I cant believe my eyes.  They are still a bit blurry from all of the crying I did after reading this.  These two points leave me to believe that someone has no clue what a Shaman is.  We have no healing ability because we have slow.  We have no direct damage because we have dots.  The worst part is that they actually think its ok for a shaman to spend the entire encounter trying to slow a mob.  I dont understand if malosing a mob is so important why do they give classes a neg resist check on spells greater than shamans or mages can debuff?  All the changes they are making are cosmetic to the game and not dealing with class issues.   Thanks Gloriana for trying to help us out.  We all know that some class has to be the gimp stepchild of EQ and thank our lucky stars we won that battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Raw stat buffs of limited effect<br />

Stats past 200 are generally worth half of what they are worth before that. Past 250 that number is halved again. If that pattern holds true our 75 sta buff will have the effect of:<br />
305 to 350 sta -&gt; equivalent to 45/8 = 5.5 sta<br />
350 to 380 sta -&gt; equivalent to 30/16 = 2 sta<br />
for a grand total of less then 8 sta. Each point of stamina for a level 70 warrior brings, what, 16 HPs? For a whopping 128 HPs.<br />
<br />
Sure, that is better then nothing. But a lot of times it will not be worth a buff slot. And it certainly does nothing for focus having so few HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">23. Racial AAs <br />
The developer was pretty anti racial AAs. He said he didn't want anyone to feel punished for a race decision they made 5 years ago.<br />
<br />
Oh wait - can I answer this one?<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's not view this as those who chose a certain race being punished, but as those who chose a certain race getting lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm glad you had a good time Glori - but heck, you were wined and dined on the company card.  Who wouldn't want to head to California, the beaches et al?<br />
<br />
(BTW - How many of the EQ folks actually had a tan?)<br />
<br />
Honestly?  I applaud the fact that Smed manned up and took the hit on GoD vis-a-vis the level thing. (Something postulated on this board).<br />
<br />
But other than that?  Sounds like a PR attempt from a division of a conglomerate that is WAAAY out of touch with their userbase and sees the Sword of Damocles (WoW) on the horizon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Overall there are some good things coming for EQ it seems.<br />

Really sad that Shamans are mostly left out of this just because the spell guy does not know anything about how the game works. I can only hope that someone else at EQ is smarter than him and kicks him squarely in the nuts.</div></div><hr />

The last time there was big talks about class balance, they swept the entire thing under the rug by pushing out another expansion which made everyone 'forget' about the issues that have been building.<br />
<br />
This time however, they've had to contend with falling subscription numbers... something that has never happened before when they've released a new expansion (in this case GOD).  <br />
<br />
With a bit of glitz and fanfare, bringing out representatives from each of the classes and all the major guilds and reporting fansites, they flew everyone out there on their terms, controlled the discussions of problems they intended to address anyway, and packaged it all up nice and pretty for everyone to digest.   And very neatly, class discussions fell to the wayside because there simply wasn't enough time to cover it.  (I'm sure the hours spent at the Padres game was well spent indeed. &lt;eye roll&gt;)<br />
<br />
A hell of a lot of smoke and mirrors this time.  But to you, Glori, thanks for trying anyways.  &lt;bearhugs&gt;<br />

I'm sure the game will improve overall for the average player but I'm afraid that our beloved class will go the way of the many endangered species.  Time to face the fact that the game evolved, and we didn't. <br />

<br />
I'm generally a bitter person about EQ these days... and I'd have to say that as far as faith goes in a company, my faith in SoE is pretty low.    <br />
<br />
Was this summit just smoke and mirrors to shut people up for awhile?  Maybe... but it seems like some things will change for the better.    Most of those changes may be raid focused... but we've already admitted that raiding is now the primary direction of EQ.    Changes there, and some changes to all levels, are not bad.<br />
<br />
Class Balance... is something that will probably never make people happy.    I know there are issues with certain classes, I've played a few.   I'm also tired of SoE saying &quot;It takes time, we're working on it&quot; for the last 50 years... I'd love to see more changes in the balance dept for all classes.    <br />
<br />
The fact still remains that the focus of this summit wasn't class balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I will continue to boycott the new expansion(s) until Shaman are fixed.  I'm not going to play an alt and start all over again, screw that, this game is not that good.  <br />
<br />
Make us a valuable member of a group in a short fight scenario, period.  Make us stack better in raids, period.<br />
<br />
- Slowing for the last 10 seconds of a fight does not meet this requirement.  <br />
- Giving everyone an extra 10-20 stat points does not meet this requirement.<br />
- Casting 2 poison dots and pulling aggro does not meet this requirement.  <br />
- Casting canni endlessly to keep up with the fast pace of the game, and not being able to do anything else, does not meet this requirement.<br />
<br />
If you insist on short fights, re-align shaman to be effective, or just remove the class.<br />
<br />
I'm only level 58, but why in the world would I keep playing my main character knowing that I will continue to become less and less valuable as I &quot;progress&quot; in levels and content?  Can you really call that progress?  <br />
<br />
It is really very simple, give me a reason to keep playing my Shaman into the higher end of the game and I will gladly pay to play for the next 5 years.  If not, I have other options, and soon will have even more.  So, at least in my case, time is running out for EQ, very quickly.<br />

This ****ing sucks.  Thanks for trying, but nothing got done.  Absolutely nothing of importance was addressed.  <br />
<br />
Not one thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heres what SoE did to you:<br />
<br />
Brought you out there, under the guise of saying they wanted to hear your input.  You went, feeling that they actually cared.  You got a great meal, saw a baseball game, got a great tour.  They told you some things that you wanted to hear, but did nothing, and yet you left with a feeling of hope.   It was a brillaint move by SoE to make threats of boycotts go away.  You were conned.  I hope that when you woke up you got your mint off the nite stand.<br />
<br />
But in reality its the same company with the same motives.  You just got taken.<br />
<br />
If you honesly believe SoE thought about our class, just go check out the &quot;revamped&quot; OoW spells.  More of the same bull**** we have been fed time and time again.  Not one damn thing has changed.<br />
<br />
Yes I am irate over this.  And for all you treehugging wanna be touchy feeling mother ****ers blah blah blah about how a ****ing guild bank or small size bear are improvements we asked for.  Pull your head out of your ass.  We just got ****ed.....not fixed.  Our class is on life support, if not dead all ready.<br />
<br />
When you were sitting at that table getting drowned out by the paladin, that was your time.  It sounds like they went there determined to get their needs addressed.  It sounds like you were steamrolled.<br />
<br />
Its bad enough to bring a knife to a gunfight, sounds like you went in there with flowers.<br />
<br />
You were supposed to go there and champion our causes and our concerns.  **** the rest of them.  I could give a **** about instanced Time.<br />
<br />
Previous poster was correct.  If this was the business world, you would have been fired for this.  My class is still as broken as before the summit.  It looks like its now going to continue to be broken for the future.  You were supposed to make them listen.  You failed.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and ban me.  I could care less.  This place is no longer a valid avenue for Shaman to get anything positive accomplished anymore.  As you can see this is my 3rd or 4th post on these boards.  I did quite fine without you before.  I will continue to do fine without you again.  My actions and accomplishements on my server speak for themselves.  Any statement you make against my post contains about as much weight with me as you did with SoE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">I think the majority of the Shamans are nearing the breaking point.  I believe its because of being set of for failure time and time again.  SoE keeps saying we are going to look into this and that but magically make comments that make the shock and awe campaign in the Middle East pail in comparison.  Do they really believe what they are saying?  For a company that cares so much about it customers how do you explain the thousands of post of people not only telling you whats wrong but also how to fix it?  It just makes most of us sick to see our once proud and strong community turn to rubble because you cant read or maybe you dont care not sure anymore.  Go back on the boards and you will see since the release of PoP the boards have become angry and less productive.  This is probably because even when we come together for a problem SoE accomplishes nothing.  Dont really know what to say still upset sorry for the rant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After pondering a bit, I can see what happened.<br />
<br />
I can't believe that someone hasn't said it, I can't believe one of the summit attendees hasn't already said it.<br />
<br />
We, the community, were told that this &quot;summit&quot; was an opportunity to be heard.  Unfortunately, it was SOE that was doing all the talking.  Telling us what they had planned.  Showing EQ2.  Explaining past mistakes.<br />
<br />
Way off target.<br />
<br />
If SOE wants to do it right, they need to bring people there and do it with NO agenda.  Completely open meetings and groups with no &quot;presentations&quot; or baseball games.<br />
<br />
Wanna talk about spells?  Great, spells are being discussed in Room 101.  Wanna talk Shaman specific?  Wonderful, Room 205.  Tradeskills?  Room 211.<br />
<br />
The more I read about this &quot;summit&quot; the less impressed I am.  It was nothing we haven't seen before, wrapped in a &quot;nice&quot; package.<br />
<br />
The heat that is coming back against the attendees is mainly due to the seeming unwillingness of those attendees to call BS when it is so obviously just that.</div></div><hr />

Ok disclaimer done<br />
<br />
A poster above mentioned he was 58 and disheartened to know he was playing a deadend class ( paraphrased). I feel the same way. <br />
Shaman was my first class and the only one I have played over 60. WHY should I be forced to choose between being &quot;carried&quot; as deadweight just on the strength of friendship of my guildies or roll another class? <br />
How the HELL can anyone not see the imbalance, nay the injustice of a parent class being taken over by their hybrid child class? Warriors didn't stand for it, why should we? Those treehuggers over at the Grove would scream murder if Rangers got good heals and a port series of spells, but we are supposed to suck it up and LIKE it? <br />

When Druids couldn't get a group, they got fixed. <br />
Where's our fix? Must be in another game, cause this one obviously doesn't have it and isn't going to have it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">28. Shaman Issues <br />
Okay guys, to be honest, there just wasn't a lot of opportunity to talk about shaman issues. The round table issues were intended for general game issues. I did manage to corner Ryan (the spell guy) and the AA guy (I wish I could remember his name, he was really nice) at the Padres game. It was hard to have a discussion over the roar of the crowd, but this is what we talked about:<br />
<br />
1. We will be getting an improved Cripple with OoW which should really do something, especially on raid targets<br />
<br />
2. Ryan is very interested in something he calls a &quot;chain lightning&quot; effect. Spells would bounce from target to target. If you healed a person in your raid, the heal spell would travel to any people close by. Shaman might also have this ability to debuff. Ryan called it an infection which would spread from mob to mob. I did bring up concerns about stackability, so hopefully he will take that into consideration.<br />
<br />
3. I did my best to convince Ryan that stat buffs were marginally effective at best, but he wasn't convinced. On a positive, we are going to gain the ability to buff OVER the cap limit. Say a warrior is capped at the new limit of 330. Our 70+ (or whatever) sta buff will raise him to 400+. I did point out the stat returns are increasingly minimal after a certain level, but Ryan insisted that it would help.<br />
<br />
4. I talked about cannabalize and passive mana regen, but I don't think we're going to be getting any sort of passive mana regen. Ryan was agreeable to the idea of a cannabilize that would match the percentage that can 5 USED to do, back when players had mana pools of 3K instead of 6K. Ryan had concern that we would mem the new spell with can 4 and alternate them. I tried to give him the innocent look, but he wasn't buying it. He is looking into the spell timers so the two spells could not be used concurrently.<br />
<br />
5. Crit affliction causing aggro - All the devs agreed that poison did a freaky, unintended amount of aggro. Ryan said he had heard that crit affliction was doing untoward aggro and had run some testing on his own that didn't show that it was. So, all of you number crunchers out there, we need some documented evidence that we are getting weird aggro on critical affliction.<br />
<br />
6. Shrinkable bear form - Ryan was surprised that bear form doesn't get super tiny. When we were talking about spells to get excited about, I mentioned that bear form was the big spell for me in Velious. I told him that we were definitely looking for something with a big cool factor for OoW.<br />
<br />
7. We are not getting a pet bixie :(  We are also not getting winged courier :(<br />
<br />
8. Doing things faster in order to better adapt to a fast paced world. Ryan seems to think that the faster slow solved this issue, no amount of pleading on my part could budge him. When I said that we spent more than half the fight malosing and slowing, he said that slow was a huge effect, even if it only lasted the last 10 seconds of a 30 second fight. I really really tried on this one.<br />
<br />
In closing, apologies for not getting more of an opportunity to raise shaman issues. I thought I would get more of an opportunity to talk to the spell/AA developers during the round table meetings. <br />
<br />
Okay, I'm losing my caffeine buzz and it's 7:09 pm and I'm STILL at work! Please feel free to post questions and ask for clarification on any issue. If I think of anything else, I will post more.<br />
<br />
I had an absolute blast, it was great meeting some of the other shaman there, like Ulver and Drydan (super lurker with a big 11 posts on the Crucible).<br />
<br />
It does not look good on the home front.  This tells me the issues we are concerned with will NOT be addressed.<br />
<br />
The End is Near.</div></div><hr />

When you were sitting at that table getting drowned out by the paladin, that was your time. It sounds like they went there determined to get their needs addressed. It sounds like you were steamrolled.<br />
<br />
We weren't steamrolled by anyone at the table. Hell, they had to get me to shut up more than some damn dorf who was having his time. Class issues weren't the focus of our group. The groups and who the groups saw were picked out randomly. It was more of a matter of what developers were in front of us. Nobody in our particular breakout session was going to do much about class balance. We simply didn't have the correct SoE folks in front of us. That was a matter of hunting them down at the event. We were not a forgotton class. Everyone was victims of a first time event.<br />
<br />
I almost feel bad seeing the attacks that people have posted on the board that I printed out some links to the things you guys have here and I handed it to people to look over.<br />
<br />
Yes, I spoke to Vannoth and he agreed that they could have done the summit differently and had more time for folks to talk about class issues. He also was going to be getting back to me with some email addresses about who to bring them to. If you guys would rather we just post supervisior emails, we could do that as well.<br />

Sure you will loose a few hps, but the loss of the entire shaman community in high end raiding will make virtually ZERO impact to this game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">In my opinion, this is what is going on:<br />
<br />
WoW beta was very successful in attracting players away from EQ.  Additionally, CoH has been doing the same.  EQ player base is diminishing - maybe accounts are still active, but Sony knows it's only a matter of time before inactive accounts are ended.<br />
<br />
So, to combat this, they have delayed the increase to the level cap as well as OoW.  They do this because they know not everyone has access to WoW now - but when WoW is released, everyone will.  By holding the release of the level cap increase till then, what it accomplishes is to embroil the player base into a grind for exp right when WoW hits the streets.  The players will be hell-bent on getting to level 70 and won't have the time (for the most part) to play WoW.  WoW then posts lack-luster sales in the first month and the &quot;splash&quot; is marginalized causing the player base to remark that it &quot;didn't live up to the hype&quot;.  Fewer people then go to try it out because of the herd mentality.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, however, Sony still has to pay the bills.  They have accomplished a marketing strategy to combat WoW - but they still need to worry about the months between now and then.  So they create a stalling tactic... the Summit.<br />
<br />
Now what the summit accomplishes is a lot of smoke and mirrors.  There is a perception created for most people that Sony cares about our concerns and desires.  They will release a couple of quick fixes to some very minor issues (see the port stone to Gunthak?) so that people will say &quot;Hey!  They're acting on our suggestions!  We'll see Time-fixes and spells and class-balancing soon too!&quot;  when in reality it's just a very small bone to makes appearances.  Players will be artificially inflated with hope and right when they come to realize it was all a ruse, OoW will be released and they'll forget about the promises due to being immersed in the exp grind again.<br />
<br />
Sony has some very clever marketing folks... but at the end of the day, they're not a public relations firm - they're a for-profit corporation that is in the business to make money, not friends.<br />
<br />
My timetable:<br />
<br />
June: Summit and some minor fixes<br />
July: One or two moderate &quot;splash fixes&quot; - maybe Time instancing fixed, maybe something else... nothing HUGE but enough to get attention<br />
August: Announcement that Sony is &quot;working on some of the other outstanding issues and some new content to be released mid-expansion!&quot;<br />
September: Announcements that something &quot;new&quot; is in the works... a new storyline added that says something like &quot;Morden Rasp has determined that there is an underground of evil people that we need to destroy... but only one person is able to accomplish this...&quot;<br />
October: Soloable LDON zone is released in a patch.  It will be horribly implemented and only work effectively for the typical &quot;soloist&quot; classes, which is perfectly acceptable to Sony since they have stated time after time that they're not interested in making EQ a soloer's game.<br />
November: Announcements of OoW coming soon!  The flood of new storyline files being downloaded and the pre-release file downloads begin.<br />
December (in time for Christmas): OoW is released.<br />
<br />
That's my guess.  I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Ok, where to begin. This was a total 180 from all other experiences I have had with Sony. IMO, they are scared. As Chris, the EQ project manager, said to me in private, this is the first time when people leave, they have an alternative of somewhere else to go, in their opinion.<br />
<br />
I love competition.<br />
<br />
<br />
There was a board up that said 55,355 people were playing EQ, 2,912 in Planetside and 35,000 something in SWG. <br />
<br />
Holy crap! What time of day was this?  This is the first time we've had any &quot;hard&quot; numbers on the online population in years.  Yes, I realize this isn't the total number of subscribers but depending on the time of day it's not hard to draw conclusions.  For instance, there were 75K people playing Diablo 2 last night.  This, more than anything else, surprised me in the post.  55k!  Let me repeat: 55k!  I hope this was at like 6:00 am EST...<br />
<br />
<br />
They are adding solo LDON expeditions for every class so that people who only have an hour can log on and do experience immediately. <br />
<br />
Does this mean after, I don't know, nearly 2 years monks will be able to solo again for some decent exp?  I can't begin to imagine how they would balance these dungeons considering the huge disparity in how well some classes can solo over others.<br />
<br />
<br />
They are considering adding a whole other line of abilities for clerics, like making them nuke for 6k on undead or stuff or make them turn into a warriortype when fighting undead so that more people will play clerics, but they had no definitive answers for that.<br />
<br />
But apparently they're not concerned if no one wants to play shaman or knights?<br />
<br />
Smedley asked us if we wanted to see numbers of mana and experience and he said they would consider adding it as an option you can turn on.<br />
How about server populations again, eh Smed?<br />
<br />
They said future expansions will have every encounter tuned by uber guilds rather than beta buffed randoms so they are ready when the expansion goes live.<br />
<br />
I read this as &quot;we plan on mudflation being our only long term balancing tool between the raider and non-raider as we have no idea how to design this otherwise&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also one thing to note is that Omens of War only has one flagged zone, the rest is like Kunark where everyone can go everywhere.<br />
<br />
If I hadn't already spit out my wine after seeing 55k (55k!!!) players online, I would have certainly done so after reading this. Flagging was a great idea, though, right?<br />
<br />
Awesome post, made an excellent read.  Congrats to those lucky enough to get flown out to CA.  :)  Nothing of much note other than the lack of flagged zones for the non-raider, but wasn't expecting much when the only people invited were raiders.  /shrug<br />

I don't like to be negative but this may be hardly class defining, if I remember correctly Enchanters get the same line of spells at the same level don't they? So would this be another reason for someone to say, nah, I think i would rather have a chanter in group(again) and obviously you can't stack this spell so where would the incentive be to yet still have more then 2-3 shaman on a raid?<br />

<br />
As far as the rest of the developers, I felt VERY listened to. In the small group round tables, they pretty much  just opened the floor and let the players speak and ask questions. They listened, they took notes, if an idea were feasible, they said so, if it was not feasible, they said so, and they said why (for example, the guy that talked about why he wouldn't make no drop loot eligible for tribute or why he wouldn't create any racial AAs).<br />
<br />
As Ulver mentioned earlier, the developers present at the round table was just random chance. The people we had, just weren't the people to ask questions about shaman improvements. For example, in the afternoon session, we had the guy who created tributes and did a lot of GoD zones as well as Holly who was working on the 2.0 epics.</div></div><hr />

In other words, you're happy because he has no intention whatsoever of doing ANYTHING about the issues that have been brought up, because he told you straight up you can take a flying leap off a skyskraper.

If not the beast I will take chanter slow for the chanter charm either are expectable to me.  Then there could be none of the crud about our slow being too powerful anymore.  I might even consider taking a beast with half the AAs as long as I got to keep my equipment.  But I have way to many days played to let someone who a large majority of the community thinks is full of something tell me my character is balanced.

You guys are right that SoE has put together a big list to do, but none of it balances shaman.  The question is that there is currently competition to EQ, so SoE is now trying to get us to play and trying to get on our good side, what happens if this competition goes away?  It's clear they're just buying time till they release EQ2.  Thanks, but no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild is one of the ones now tagged to help them beta test.  Both the remainder of GoD and upcoming OoW.<br />
<br />
I now have a decision to make, and quite honestly I am divided with respect to my loyalty to my guild and my loyalty to my class.<br />
<br />
1.  Beta test the new content, providing feedback to help make a better game in hopes that by doing that I can provide documented feedback on the failings of our class in the high end game.<br />
<br />
2.  Telling SoE to kiss my ****ing ass.  I have followed the carrot long enough.  <br />
<br />
#1 is the right thing to do.  No questions asked.  But does anyone here honestly believe that they have any intention of listening to any valid input or feedback.  We have already provided them with volumes with no effect.  Additional data is meaningless at this point.  We had people onsite at SoE to state our case.  Didn't happen.  Our voice was not heard.<br />
<br />
To me this whole summit was a snow job for the average person, and to some extent, the classes most needing change.  They patronized us and for the most part were successful.<br />
<br />
The only people who got addressed were the uber guilds, who I am admittedly a member of.  I do think those changes will help my guild.  They wont, however help me or my class.<br />

I'm not trying to put you down Gloriana, but how do those things there help the shaman class?

Gloriana allot of this is nice.  But there are allot of issues that are much larger and need fixed first don't you think?  We have given them every chance in the world to fix our class and suggestions on what might work for nothing.  I don't really believe that they thought this list would make people come back again.  If I called my friend and said it's time to come back they fixed this (insert list here) he would probably potty him self-laughing at me.  <br />

<br />
Gloriana, we all appreciate the time you took from your life to represent Shaman at the &quot;summit&quot;.  We've heard your report.  Many of us feel that it does not go *nearly* far enough toward addressing the needs of Shaman, or really EQ balance in general.<br />
<br />
Given your experiences at the &quot;summit&quot;, what do you forsee for our class?  Please tell us why you feel the way you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">In my opinion, this is what is going on:<br />
<br />
WoW beta was very successful in attracting players away from EQ.  Additionally, CoH has been doing the same.  EQ player base is diminishing - maybe accounts are still active, but Sony knows it's only a matter of time before inactive accounts are ended.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've disagreed with you a lot in the past UgZug, but I am in total agreement this time.<br />
<br />
Interesting too that the people that have the biggest forums and venues to get their thoughts seen and heard (board mods and uber guild leaders) were wined and dined and giving FREE OoW keys and demos of EQ2.  Takes nothing now for these folks to play OoW and put out the good word instead of saying they'll never waste their money on the expansion.<br />
<br />
Nothing but a marketing ploy, nothing substantial addressed for the majority of the players.  But hey, I got dinged a bunch of rep points for calling out BS on my original post.  Then this whole thread essentially supports me.  Oh well, life and EQ aren't fair.<br />

Not even to mention the fact that it bogus to think it balances us.  I already see my diminishing effect as a shaman in Tactics and Hard LDoNs, so I can imagine what other players in EP, Time and Gates trials are experiencing.  I'm near the twilight of my EQ career anyway, so maybe it's a good thing.<br />

You are playing a game, with someone elses concept of what a shaman is and should be.  If you don't like it, make your own game with your concept and thoughts of what a shaman is.  Simple as that.<br />
<br />
Gloriana,<br />
<br />
Just as many have thanked you for your commitment to EQ, to the members of this board, and the shaman class, I thank you as well.  Even though you weren't able to talk about our class concerns as much as you wanted to, you were able to give more of an actual voice to them than we have had in the past.<br />
<br />
As for the people putting you down for not forcing more of an issue with problems, ramming the problems down SOE's throat and demanding answers, just how much would SOE be willing to talk and consider possible solutions if they are instantly put on the defensive?  Things take time, yes some are tired of waiting, some are saying they are finished because SOE isn't changing fast enough or giving the exact answer that they want.  Well, simple answer, leave.<br />
<br />
There's really no need to carry about a 40'x40' flashing neon sign stating you are leaving because you played a game created by someone else, with thoughts and plans of their own for how the game was to be played and you didn't like it when your opinions of what a shaman should do differed from theirs.<br />

Screw the reputation point system... it's a tool to discourage people from having an opinion.  If you speak out against the majority, the sheep will ding you ever time... it doesn't matter how rational, clear, concise, or polite you are - they will decrease your rep because you disagree with them.<br />

If SOE shared your sentiment and communicated it as such, I would have no problem with any of this.  But SOE continues to put on a pretense of caring about player issues, all the while doing nothing of substance to address them.  This sham of a PR event was nothing more than a psychological pacifier shoved into some of the most visible mouths of the EQ community in a patently-transparent attempt to hold on to subscribers.  The EQ ship is sinking rapidly and this was just a 12th-hour attempt to stem the tide of player defections.  <br />
<br />
Your message may well be &quot;If you don't like it, go ahead and quit, because it's not going to change.&quot;  But that certainly isn't Sony's.  If only they would be so honest with us.<br />

I am a shaman. Class reps were invited because 1) they didn't want it to seem they were focusing on end-game guilds only 2) class board representatives have usually played the game for a while and would love to see it fixed and improved in general.  They invited EQInterface, EQTraders and EQroleplayers boards too.  Is roleplaying broken in EQ?  No, they wanted a diverse set of opinions.  They didn't invite class people there to fix classes.</div></div><hr />

The same people responsible for EQ 1, are alot of the folks that have been shuffled up to EQ2. The ones that remain, will be moved along to EQ2 or other projects they have in the works. Though the same exact problems may not remain, similiar ones will persist. The same blind-eye treatment, the same stall tactics, the same over all responses to the player base, the same catering.<br />
<br />
As pretty as the packaging may be, beauty is only skin deep, and I honestly feel that statement applies more about EQ2, than any of the Ex's in my life (demon seed, each and every one of them!! but that's another issue).<br />
<br />
With the idea of the problems and issues surrounding their pilot and money source of EQ, I simply can't concieve of EQ2 being anything more than window dressing hiding the same rotten core.<br />

<br />
Their response time to petitions is around 33 hours now on average.  The new tools help them classify the nature of the petitions so they can address each one with a priority.  You don't have to be online anymore for a GM to answer your petition and you don't have to be online for a GM to replace lost items.  Those two things are improvements and they cut down response times a great deal.  They said their goal was to get response times down to 2 hours for general petitions.  They also made a guild petition method (only those who went to the summit now how to access it) to help guilds resolve disputes over spawns, retrieve progression quest items eaten by NPCs and the like.  They hope the guild petitions will be answered in under 30 minutes, because you're usually wasting 50-100 players' time when those kinds of problems come up.</div></div><hr />

All part of the smoke and mirrors.  Please explain to me how any of that list would even begin to justify having a summit?   Nothing on that list is anything we would have to gather guild representatives and class leadership for to come to those &quot;improvements&quot;.

<br />
They invited Guild leadership out there ................and LISTENED.<br />

<br />
Dont use the Shaman community to affect change, use my guild leader.<br />

<br />
All part of the smoke and mirrors.  Please explain to me how any of that list would even begin to justify having a summit?   Nothing on that list is anything we would have to gather guild representatives and class leadership for to come to those &quot;improvements&quot;.  If they needed to fly out people and spend that amount of money to arrive at those conclusions, they need to rename SoE to Enron.<br />
<br />
My point is:  They invited our class leadership out there, and did NOTHING.<br />
<br />
They invited Guild leadership out there ................and LISTENED.<br />
<br />
Now what have I learned from this?  <br />
<br />
Dont use the Shaman community to affect change, use my guild leader.<br />
<br />
At least SoE is willing to listen to what big guilds have to say.  They are done listening to us via this avenue.  That much is clear.<br />
<br />
If they had just opened up a public board for suggestions it would have turned out pretty much like this thread and all the threads we have on shaman balancing.  Someone will post something that someone disagrees with and a huge fight breaks out.  It would also be half-hearted to just open a message board to solicit responses.  <br />
<br />
They spent at least a good $200k on bringing all those people people out there.  You don't blow hundreds of thousands of dollars to placate 60 people.  That just doesn't make any business sense, or any sense at all.  If you want to see if they're genuine about extending the olive branch, then wait for the next few patches and see if they correct what they promised in their short-term fixes.  <br />
<br />
Also, if you were running a business (SoE is a business, they're not your slaves) would you fix something that affected 50% of your customers first?  Or would you fix something that affected less than 10% of your customers first?  About half of the short-term fixes will affect everyone in the game.  The other half fixes things for guilds who raid.  One item affects high end guilds.<br />
<br />
Two days after the summit is over and people are tearing them apart already.  They haven't had a chance to prioritize fixes yet.  I wish people would quit expecting instant gratification, since that only leads to more problems.</div></div><hr />

This is the first time we've had any &quot;hard&quot; numbers on the online population in years.  Yes, I realize this isn't the total number of subscribers but depending on the time of day it's not hard to draw conclusions.  For instance, there were 75K people playing Diablo 2 last night.  This, more than anything else, surprised me in the post.  55k!  Let me repeat: 55k!  I hope this was at like 6:00 am EST....<br />
Honestly Iz, why do you continute to compare Diablo 2's numbers to EQs? For one thing, those 55K playing EQ were PAYING 13 BUCKS A MONTH! How many of the 75K on Diablo were? Oh yeah, NONE. They PAID the 25 bucks for the Diablo Battle Chest Package and now they play free.

We need someone with an open mind that is willing to look at the issues to be handling spells. Ryan never has been this person. And apparently, never will be.<br />
<br />
My shaman's account is inactive. Nearly all shaman I used to play and chat with are long gone. I recieved a tell from a person that I have known for 9 years now the other night. He too has given up on his shaman. And has started a rogue.<br />
<br />
Im quite disappointed with Ryan. Everything else I have heard about the summit seems to be relatively positive, and I hope they stick with things, and seriously continue the ongoing effort to fix the things that are broken and unbalanced in this game. On the flip side, if they dont, they will all be looking for new jobs in about a year.</div></div><hr />

Stats matter. Seriously. He said it. It has to be true. <br />
<br />
Slow is the greatest ability in the game, even when mitigated by half and cast 20 seconds into a 30 second fight. <br />
<br />
We are the best class in long fights, even though there are no plans to develop long fight content because no one likes long fights.<br />

We are very effective in trivial content.<br />

<br />
First off, I do run a rather large business. Its my own small slice of the DoD and DoN.  And guess what, 200k (and I am sure they spent more than that) is a drop in the bucket considering their revenue and tax write off possibilites.  The money spent on that event was worth its weight in gold, even given the outcome for us.<br />
<br />
But thats not the point.  You failed to grasp it.  They placated us.  Its a proven CS technique.  Its how you calm down the angry mob or the irritated customer.  Tell the customer that you understand they are angry, work with them to jot down their concerns and issues, tell them you will work on it later, give them something of zero value with the issue at hand to show you are sincere.  Tell them you will get back to them.  This sadly handles about 3 out of 4 disgruntled people.<br />
<br />
None of the immediate 50% impact issues that have been &quot;awarded to us via the summit&quot; needed body one to get on a jet.  It is funny that some of you believe that these things are a result of the summit.  It only proves the tactic works.  <br />
<br />
And Gloriana, my first post was surely made in anger.  I dont know you as a person or as a player, so there is no attempt to make it personal.  If you were personally offened I apologize.  But I stand behind my posts.  You were our &quot;chosen&quot; Class represenative.  I feel you failed to get our point across, and thus failed me.  I have every right to express my disappointment with that.<br />
<br />
I am glad you did have a good time.  Your work here keeping these boards deserves some reward.  You shouldnt feel sorry for that recognition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">There's really no need to carry about a 40'x40' flashing neon sign stating you are leaving because you played a game created by someone else, with thoughts and plans of their own for how the game was to be played and you didn't like it when your opinions of what a shaman should do differed from theirs.<br />
<br />
<br />
I did agree with what the idea of a shaman was for a long time.  They changed it (shamans no longer can heal the exact same as druids as they could for years!), nerfed it (mitigate that slow!), changed the game mechanics (everyone you play with has max stat so no one gives a darn about your buffs anymore!), and made it where our class had nothing to offer(chanters and beastlords slow almost as well and can do a lot more useful than my class!).  They changed it, I'm the customer, I object to it.<br />
<br />
And uh, by the way, I am paying for this game.  Multiple accounts, all expansions (when they were expensive, BAH Evolutions), many years.  I pay far less for a good steak dinner, but if they cook my steak wrong I send it back.  Why is it seen as any different for me to complain about them nerfing my class in a game I have a lot of time and money invested in?  I personally think if someone is displeased with their service, they are crazy not to complain!<br />
<br />
We're not complaining just to complain.  I didn't complain when I first started reading the Crucible because I felt there was little to complain about.  Now I complain a lot because the game is broken.  That's why players are leaving, as you suggested, in droves.<br />
<br />
I have loved this game and I love my character, and don't want to leave them, so I am fighting to be given a reason to stay.  If you don't like it, don't read it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u156"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p156">For the purposes of research they should force some of their staffers (didn't I read somewhere in the summit reviews that part of the staff appraisal consists of leveling your char 10 levels?) to play ENC, BST and SHM and measure the results. Preferably Ryan should play the shammy since he's evidently is quite comfortable with the class. Would be curious to see the results.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that minor rant aside, I do think this little bit of PR was a good idea and a smart move. Look at the amount of posts (good or bad, its all huge publicity for EQ) across the vast amounts of boards. Suddenly we've got a glimpse of the &quot;Vision&quot;. Whether it turns out as good as they say or not is essentially irrelevant. The exercise has put a nice bit of life back into the old beast. <br />
<br />
As for the new games coming on the market, what's so odd about SOE making ready for war to defend their (admittedly huge) piece of the turf? I think Ugzug took it a bit far, but the basic business strategy is sound. You know your competitor's got a tempting product coming out, you work damn hard to make sure your consumers remember the long hard (but fun) years they've invested, promise them loads more and ride it out.<br />
<br />
To Glor and the lucky buggers who got to go to the summit, great job. Working for a pretty big organisation myself, events like this one have a huge chance of influencing product offering. Let's face it - it can only get better.</div></div><hr />

You most certainly would if your own internal numbers show massive account cancellations, an increasingly-competitive marketplace, and a player base more frustrated and angry than at any point in your game's 5-year history.<br />
<br />
You most certainly would if you'd just released both GoD, an abysmal failure of an expansion, and the buggiest graphics update in the game's 5-year history, which rendered the game unplayable for a significant portion of your player population.<br />
<br />
You most certainly would if those 60 people held some of the most visible positions in your customers' communities.  They didn't pick 60 random players, or even 60 random level-65 players, or even 60 random level-65 players who've had active accounts for 4+ years.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>Fandur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">Wow, that 55K users number is rather telling.  If I recall correctly, shortly after the trader functionality was put into the Bazaar Sony made an announcement about breaking the 100K concurrent user mark.<br />
<br />
Of course, we all knew that number was in flated by traders.  Well, we still have a friggin ton of traders in the Bazaar(s).  Thus, if the traders number is consistent then that means the toal server population has almost been halved!<br />
<br />
I can see why SOE is undertaking this huge PR push.  With WoW being released in a couple of months I can only imagine it getting worse.  EQ2 will undoubtedly take some people away, too (they may keep their EQ accounts, though).<br />
<br />
I guess only time will tell if SOE actually follows through and acts on what they have heard and have been being told for a LONG time.  The proof will ultimately be in their bottom line.<br />

<br />
Ahh, Shadrak saved me making a much bigger post since this is very much what I sense went on. Its exactly the fact that they handpicked the people in charge of the biggest guilds and the people running the biggest messageboards that gives it away. If they truly wanted to hear about the players concerns there is absolutely no reason to pick people like that. They could have easily made a random pick script to go thru their customer database and choose a far more relevant distribution of players.<br />
<br />
Going for the big names in the guilds and communities is primarily because this maximizes SOEs reward-to-expense ratio. If they can convince most of the high-end guild leaders and messageboard administrators that EQ truly will be changing then those people will probably do their utmost to convince all their underlings. Its good business sense --- atleast in the short run.<br />
<br />
Only a few things went wrong at the summit and one of them was Ryan being forced (by Gloriana - you go girl!) to say that he thinks stat buffs truly matters a lot and that a few seconds of slow at the end of a fight is a massive benefit. This was clearly not intended by Smedly and gang and I bet they are upset Ryan said it publicly.<br />
<br />
And just look at them dragging their feet implementing obvious things like a PoK stone to LoY. This is first going to be implemented on Test so people can tell SOE what they think about it!! Hellooooo, anybody anywhere that wants to argue that this shouldnt have been implemented at the time that LoY went live? I bet that even for a junior programmer at SOE it would take less than 5 minutes to put an extra stone in PoK and one in Gunthak somewhere resonably safe and make sure these two are connected. There is absolutely no reason other than total disregard for their customers that this hasnt been implemented long long ago.<br />
<br />
Gloriana is doing a great job but I fear she is also being used by SOE.</div></div><hr />

Second, Gloriana isn't the enemy, she's just the messenger of what SOE plans over the next few months.  I firmly believe she's on our side, NOT theirs so it serves no on to browbeat her until she's fed up.  <br />
<br />
Third, the point we are at is, if we are decided that SOE is trying to brush us off again, we need to decide just ONE of two things.  <br />
- Either we decide how to make our &quot;One Voice&quot; heard again or<br />
- We decide to throw in our chips and fold which is tantamount to a surrender and accepting whatever bones and scraps get sent our way.  <br />

You can see it by the petty bickering that is beginning to happen, we're backbiting each other, calling each other stupid, and altogether being unconstructive with our time which is exactly what you are trying to accomplish when trying to break a Union.  <br />

You have some good points but that &quot;One Voice&quot; thing never resulted in anything worthwhile and I dont see why that will change in the future.<br />

One could maybe even argue that its you that is breaking a &quot;union&quot; by telling us not to voice our unhappiness. Because one of the things SOE respects the most is without a doubt people cancelling their accounts because they are unhappy about the direction of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">I originally viewed the summit as a good thing, alot of people viewed it badly as a way of exploiting trust, etc... I wasnt one of them, but I did notice some discrepancies. My walkout comment was a joke (I editted the post to have a smiley on so it should be clearer) but the fact alot took it seriously means something.<br />
I am also glad for what you are trying Gloriana. I know that squabling amongst ourselves is what got is into this state in the first place. Before we got so bad I remember the fact that if you put two shaman in the same room, they'd disagree on what colour the sky is. The One Voice post, and the Summit brought us together to summerise what we as a whole want. And for shaman to give out a unified opinion is an amazing thing in itsef, but the resulting outcome wasn't what alot of people wanted. They wanted clear information. That demoralised the community and we decended back into the anarchy of before the One Voice.<br />
Those of you giving Glori a hard time, stop and think a second. She effectivly runs a massive community of heated individuals in her spare time. Can any of you say the same thing? Cut her some slack! I used to run the Shaman of Justice website on PlanetEQ, I tried to keep that website and it's community alive, but I couldn't, and I thought I was good at organising things like that. What Glori does for us is great.<br />
Finally, those of you quitting EQ to go play another game, do so. If you dont like EQ sure, go. I promise you that even though you are sick of EQ, you will regret leaving. I left for 6 months to play FFXI, and it wasn't the quality of the game that drew me back. FFXI is a near complete game without many bugs, and the quests actually WORK! The thing that drew me back to EQ was the passion. The players who play it, play it with so much passion that it feeds the game and the community. If some proposed changes not matching with what a community feels is needed can cause THIS much backlash, that just proves my point.<br />
Glori, I know I've said this in this post about 3 or 4 times already, but what you are doing for us IS appreciated muchly, even if people are quicker to flame than to thank.</div></div><hr />

The only measure of our resolve left is to cancel or delete outright.  And I am giving that option serious merit.<br />

Shaman -- &quot;Hey you want to talk about Shaman balance issues&quot;<br />
SoE (Wave of the hand) -- &quot;You dont want to talk about Shaman balance issues&quot;<br />
Shaman --  &quot;I dont want to talk about Shaman balance issues....&quot;<br />
SoE (Wave of the hand) --  &quot;You want to go home and think about how that new 2.1min dot and buffs above the caps will rock your world!&quot;<br />
Shaman --  &quot;I want to go home and think about how that new 2.1min dot and buffs above the caps will rock my world!&quot;<br />

As ****ed up as that sounds....it just happened.</div></div><hr />

1. We never talked about any long dots. The only time I mentioned a disease dot was to thank him for ditching the crappy one we originally had in GoD.<br />
<br />
2. When Ryan mentioned that our buffs would buff over the stat cap, I said that was interesting, but I told him that stat caps had diminished returns and I didn't think it would be valuable. At no time did I say THAT'S GREAT, EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">Well, Spiritblood and Khrogre, that does remain to be seen.... maybe One Voice part 2 will work, and maybe it won't.... but as I've said on other threads, bashing each other and being unconstructive won't accomplish much except to achieve what SOE would very much want the most, to see the entire issues of class balance just swept under the rug.  <br />
<br />
I'm really merely pointing out that people are losing focus but if people are just simply resolved to infighting and quitting and simply complaining for the sake of it, SOE has won.  We won't get organized again and we won't be strong enough to be heard again.  <br />
<br />
If that's the case, go ahead, give up.  *shrugs*  But the fact that you even bothered to post here indicates that you do care, even if it's just a little.  I'm posting now, because I do care... I do care about the future of EQ and the Shaman.   Even though I've quietly sat on the sidelines for the past 5 months, I've silently cheered the progress &quot;One Voice&quot; made.   <br />
<br />
Think of what happened, we did get them to listen... SOE would have been foolish not to.  People said we won't make an impact but the fact they held this Summit was proof that we did though obviously it wasn't just us, it was everyone across the board.   <br />
<br />
I believe we can certainly continue to make a difference if we choose to.  Whether you believe it or not is up to you, but the first step is to acknowledge the problem and then to take unified action towards solving it.  But it doesn't start by turning on each other.  <br />

<br />
I mean really, a few passionate players that would tell them they can shove that 2 minute dot and the stat buffs up their asses would have probably have driven the point home more than 'interesting'.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">Honestly Iz, why do you continute to compare Diablo 2's numbers to EQs? For one thing, those 55K playing EQ were PAYING 13 BUCKS A MONTH! How many of the 75K on Diablo were? Oh yeah, NONE. They PAID the 25 bucks for the Diablo Battle Chest Package and now they play free. Sorry man, but I could honeslty care less how many 16 year old snot-nosed punks are playing (and hacking and cheating and duping and PKing) in Diablo 2 each night.<br />
Your typical stereotyping aside, this is big news and you're missing the point.  I ran the numbers (debating starting a thread on this) and if my calcs are correct, based on that 55k figure EQ has lost roughly 20-25% of its playerbase, putting it at the ~300K mark.  For those keeping score, that is a revenue loss of $1,300,000 a month from the 400K they announced over a year ago.<br />
<br />
EQ is still very profitable, but even the most clueless accountant has to be getting on the phone when your gross revenue drops by $15,600,000 in a little over a year.<br />
<br />
So no, spending $200K+ on a summit to try and preserve what you can of your playerbase is not a bad idea.  They just need to get a much broader spectrum of their playerbase in the future.</div></div><hr />

Hey Brenlo, don't forget to mention to Ryan that although Bear Form is a cool spell (I was really talking to him about Bear Form in the context of cool spells to look forward to) the fact that it can't be shrunk super tiny will make it unusable in many raid situtations.</div></div><hr />

Actuall, Brenly, we aren't pissed at Glori, we are pissed at your boss, SOE.  Do you understand that people are mad because Glori wasn't pissed ENOUGH at you guys.  That shows how messed up things are.  We aren't mad at Glori, we are mad at SOE. We appreciate Glori, but are really frustrated at how useless the Summit looks to be.<br />
<br />
Now you come here and tell us how our community is supposed to act.  WHAT NERVE.  Do you think we would be upset if SOE gave one crap about our class?  Pull together my ass, we did that, we made the lists, we got behind what we needed, and it got us nothing.  It actually got us less than nothing, it got us some wave of the hand upgrades that are worse than nothing.  The reason they are worse than nothing is that YOU/SOE can say, why are you complaining, we gave you xxxxx.  An upgrade that doesn't address the issue is not an upgrade.<br />
<br />
You go run off to talk to Rytan, I think Glori already posted what he had to say, and we really don't want to hear it.  I have never, and I mean never, seen CS as poor as SOE.  NEVER.  Flying a few people to your HQ and showing them a good time/promoting new products doesn't = good CS.  <br />
<br />
Until we hear that we are getting a meaningful upgrade to healing and short fight DPS, you might as well be farting in our faces.<br />

Welcome to the real world.  Welcome to responsibility.  I am going to enlighten you on a few things about it though, so bear with me.<br />
<br />
The world is not fair.  People cheat like mad.  Big business will say and do anything to make you think you are happy.   Darwin was right.<br />
<br />
You were invited to the Summit as a representative of the Shaman community with due respect to your affiliation with these boards.  You attended and had a great time.  I think everyone here will gladly give you and A+ for that effort.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, real life, and most certainly big business, does not reward you for effort.  It rewards you for success.<br />
<br />
That did not happen in San Diego.  Please take this personally.  The weight of this is on your shoulders, not mine.  I did not attend.<br />
<br />
But if all of this &quot;Summit Gate&quot; does generate more action on SoE's part with respect to our class.  I would suggest to you that you not attend if asked.<br />
<br />
Lets send someone else next time.  You have had your chance.  And failed.  Please step aside.<br />
<br />
But there is a bright side.  You got the chance to learn about having a massive responsibility, and failing, without any real life penalty.  I mean the worst that is happening is just words, and criticism of you.  Maybe a hurt feeling or two.<br />
<br />
Be lucky this wasnt combat, and that responsibility you failed with didnt have the chance to get anyone killed.  I dont know if you can speak about that.  I certainly can.  Thank god its only a game.<br />

Taking this a tad bit too serious? it was a social gathering to address game issues that weren't class specific, should she have jumped on the table and screamed at people? Perhaps put a gun to someones head to force them to listen? Heh....<br />
<br />
Whatever the true reasons for the summit, a PR ploy or a sincere effort to gather information on what players want, Glori's effort at addressing shaman issues was outside the scope of the summit and she should be recommended for trying to find out information. By her write-up anyone should be able to see that SoE really didn't want to address class-specific issues in-depth. That is why there are casual comments about this and that. Had it been about Shaman related issues, perhaps more and better information had been forthcoming. However, since it was not why the backlash against Glori? Settle down, seriously.<br />

Brenlo,<br />
<br />
We have pages of constructive dialogue with you and SoE already.  There is nothing new to say.  We have stated our case quite plainly.  I along with many other people, dont wish to talk about talking about it again.  All that happens with that is continued delay and false hope of change.<br />
<br />
Simply...address our concerns.  Enough talk.  Action.  We dont need to make you a believer, or chat some more, or take another poll.<br />

Gloriana is the second Nicest player I have ever met on E marr. (The first is Breckeridge Thunderbottoms A dwarf cleric. Dwarves are &quot;Special&quot;)<br />
<br />
Please folks stop chewing on her. It is uncalled for. She went there and tried.  It was all she could do. I mena she waylaid him at the baseball game. She could have been having a beer and a dog. and instead talked about all of us. <br />
<br />
As for us taking the blame for the state of the shaman class due to bickering and infighting. I call bull****. The fights, discussions, and flames are not the cause of the shamans decline in EQ. That is soly laid at the feet of the Developers. They thoguht were were fine due to large numbers. And no concerted voice. Well We have a one voice up there. Been up there for many months. No changes. Even after large numbers are going away. <br />
<br />
Do I like Rytan. Personally Never met the guy. I probably would like him personally. But Professionally as a consumer of a product  that his company makes and specificly as a user of the spells that he has helped design. I really really think he is shortsighted and way in over his head. <br />
<br />
If he is the spell guy and the buck stops with him. then it has to stop with him. Shaman are not happy with the spell selection and choices for the last what. 3 expansions? Hmm. GoD. Bad. LDON Timesink/ Bad. Pop  Rote upgrades with no inspiring choices at all. Majorly mistuned for the increase in DPS and shortened Fights. LoY. Did we get a spell besides pure blood? (Which was revised a few times) Before that was Luclin. Was Rytan the Spell guy for Luclin? Because pretty much they were inadaquite as well but the fight length masked it. (Casue we shined in those fights)<br />
<br />
So make it 4 expansions. Are not expansions supposed to enrich the game? Because despite growing in Loot my gameplay has deminished in enjoyment since Mid Luclin. (After the bugs got worked out of course.)<br />
<br />
You wanted Ideas we gave em to you. You said Nah Too powerful. Then left. You gave us a stated Bone cause it doesnt matter anyways. (HoT) then come back and tell us yeah it really doesnt mean anything anyways as well. So we are supposed to like/ trust you.  Take a long look at the one voice post. Read every name. Those are a small subset of your customers. And they are not happy. And that is just the vocal bit who come to the boards. I am positive there are alot more. On Every damn board that deals with EQ. <br />
<br />
I have even been in a few spats with Brenlo over issues we have already discussed and Gloriana has deleted posts of mine. I didnt feel they were bad enough to be deleted but she did. that is her right. But I for one stopped standing by when EQ got to be negitive fun for me.

<br />
Leave her alone. And if you need to spew your disatisfaction of the game. Cancle your account and feedback why you cancled it. You can still play till the Billing ends. And REup then cancle again if need be. But the only thing SoE will respect is a hit to thier numbers. <br />
<br />
Leave Glori alone She was a messenger. And a pretty damn good messenger. She cant help it if the message is crumpled up because of lack of import to the one reciving it.<br />

And here I thought I was witty.  *laugh*<br />
<br />
In any case, I think we can all forward you the unified list we came up with, but since you have already read it, and nothing has been done.. I think it would just be spam.<br />
<br />
I think I would like to request a new EQ function that has been asked for in the past..  Please consider a link next to &quot;Character name change&quot; which is &quot;Change my class from shaman to BL.&quot; I think that would make everyone happy.  I would even pay a fee similar to the fee you charge for moving char's.</div></div><hr />

Yes I know that not everyone here is being nasty.  To those of you who are upset but rational, debate this with Rytan, in a reasonable manner.  Present clear and concise points as to why he may be wrong.  <br />
<br />
Brenlo<br />

Now this is where it is getting interesting.<br />
<br />
You see my dear Brenlo. I will not be in the same place as yesterday.<br />
yesterday I was a paying EQ player.<br />
Today I am playing a different game.<br />
<br />
And the only reason why I left EQ and cancelled 5 accounts is the simple fact that you guys at SOE think that it is ok to screw arround with your customers. The shaman community has made a well writen post about what we wanted to change and the end result was 0 (yes that is a zero)<br />
Then someone flames you at the SoE boards and see there was a reaction.<br />
<br />
Then a major part of your customer base decides to cancel accounts and now you have the nerf to come here and tell US that we should not be angry.<br />
You are at the source of this anger and in my opinion seeing a topic like this must be a bad day in the life of anyone who does PR work.</div></div><hr />

I never said you shouldn't be angry, I said you shouldn't tear each other apart and blindly lash out.  <br />
<br />
If you believe Rytan is wrong, explain why.  Focus your anger and debate the issue.  Bring up valid points and arguments and let's see if you can sway his opinion.  <br />

Yah I kinda agree.. I mean.. some of the people here over-react to things and were most likely not as nice as they could be..<br />
<br />
But when you addict a bunch of people to something and then take it away....<br />
<br />
Imagine if you were a drug dealer and all of a sudden you told your &quot;clients&quot; that they could not have any more crack.  Gee.. they are all getting pissed and acting stupid.. go figure.<br />
<br />
A lot of us play this game.. WAY more than we should.. and loved doing so.  I know I pay way more money in account fee's than is normal. (more than one account on legends).<br />
<br />
That all said, it really does take nerve for a PR person to try telling us how to act and what to think.<br />
<br />
I am going to cancel my accounts also right now.. and in the feedback I am going to say why. <br />
<br />
In addition I think we should all start writing letters to the highest person we can find at sony. (might not actually get anything fixed, but at least then we will be flaming ourselves less.)</div></div><hr />

Take a long look at the one voice post. Read every name. Those are a small subset of your customers. And they are not happy. And that is just the vocal bit who come to the boards. I am positive there are alot more. On Every damn board that deals with EQ.  <br />
<br />
<br />
go look at the one voice thread, there is a shaman from drinal named rylok on there.<br />
<br />
he faught with me tooth and nail that shaman were so godly they didn't need crap. i left my guild today because eveyrone called me &quot;a whiner&quot; and &quot;greedy for power&quot; and he was one of them. he asked &quot;*** is the crucible&quot;, i almost fainted, i told him its like the shamans bible to everything EQ, and he scoffed.<br />
<br />
after seeing the forum, reading the indepth analysis of tons of shaman, he is a true believer, and he stepped up and tagged his name to that thread.<br />
he is on drinal just like me. <br />
just like flabbo, usedcar and many many others.<br />
<br />
i was never a big whiner, i hate whining, but there is little esle that i can do, other than grit my teeth.<br />
<br />
but when i can make someone see my point of view in less that 20 minutes of time, with no fights or discussion after, you know this is dire.<br />

So far, your sole advice in accomplishing better results is &quot;be angry.&quot; Yeah, I'm sure Ryan would have instantly agreed to all my suggestions if I had started screaming at him.<br />
<br />
I'm also interested if the other class representatives accomplished any more than I did. I didn't see any proposed changes for paladins, enchanters or mages (I got a chance to meet all three of those folks).<br />
Apparently they did, as I was told firmly by many how &quot;SOE discussed many class issues.&quot; Don't think anybody is mad at Glori, just at what she was told. She did a great job at reporting it to us. Yes, take a step back from all forums, I did, was really pissed in the morning and mid-day today. Unfortunatly I continued to post =\</div></div><hr />

Glori,<br />
<br />
I am stubborn, hard headed to a fault and entirely too caught up in EQ to be much use except as a voice of passion. But I still remember to this day us playing in chardok and you laughing as I went toe to toe with the sarnaks and you Dotted em down. To each thier own with that. And when your Duties as a mod require you to delete or edit me. So be it. I might get mad but it doesnt change respect and even friendship if we spent enough time together. <br />
<br />
Besides when folks I respect and like rave about you as well when you are not around.. it certainly makes an impact.  :) (Magyk, Bullmoosin, Leepew and many others.)<br />
<br />
Don't let the munchkins get to you. We all care about our class. And we want the changes to mean something. Maybe they will listen. Maybe they won't  It does not change the fact that you tried your best and that is the best we can do.<br />

<br />
Well first of all, I am not angry at anyone, I am past that.<br />
<br />
And I do not have any intentions to talk to Ryan about shaman problems anymore, you see I found out I could simply leave and have this whole issue over with.<br />
I have been sending suggestions, feedback and emails for the last 3 expansions.<br />
I have not seen any indication that doing so will help in any way, just now that your profit margings are dropping we see Soe comming in and talking to us about how things all will get better.<br />
<br />
Well I have seen that before (melee changes part 2 anyone?) and I do not intend to spend my time or money any longer on an incomplete product that does not have any form of service for the customer.<br />
<br />
I do not even miss the game it, I miss the people in it but not the actual game itself.<br />
And when I talk to other former EQ players the story they tell is much like mine.<br />
<br />
Both you know this allready because you sellected those who could see your new attitude and you planned to buy the time with this to get EQ back on track.<br />
I wish you goodluck with that and maybe you should consider talking to those here who are so vocal.<br />
They still love your game and they want to keep playing it and having fun, that is why they are so angry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u211"><b>Krohgre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p211">Hmmmm.  Brenlo.  Lemme get this right ..  you want us to:<br />

Gather our points together and make a rational argument.  Pretty sure we have already done that one.  OK CHECK.<br />
<br />
Gather our data together and present our perception of the numbers.  Pretty sure we have already done that.  OK CHECK.<br />
<br />
Sit down with us to discuss.  Pretty sure we have done that one too.  OK CHECK.<br />
<br />
Guys and gals,  I am pretty sure Gloriana is a nice person, by all accounts she appears to be.  That means jack when you sit down at the table to negotiate.<br />
<br />
As for the anger and disappointment, its being properly directed on my part.  At the person chosen by SoE to represent us, and the people she went to talk too, again SoE.<br />
<br />
I'm here for the fight.  Because now its a fight.  Does anyone here think that further chats will help us?<br />
<br />
If you want a conversation you know where to find me.  But there is absolutely nothing new to talk about.<br />
<br />
Brenlo, the only thing you can do is prove me wrong.  Make me look like the total ass and dick some of you think I am.  Prove me wrong.<br />
<br />
You were a good GM on TM.  You may not remember me, but I do remember you.  I do believe you may personally care.  But the fact of the matter is you are here doing Damage Control on these boards.  Nothing more, nothing less.<br />
<br />
Its a good talk and all, but its talk, and we have been here before.  You have asked for our time and faith and have now lost it.<br />
<br />
You have our lists and our data and our concerns.  Prove me wrong.  Please.</div></div><hr />

Yes that is true and the spell guy was not swayed by your initial argument.  So, if he is wrong, show him the error of his ways. You saw his statement, now counter it with a strong argument.  <br />

That's great.  Now just one question, when can we hear the results?  I've been reading the forums at eqlive quite a bit.  There is a good bit of fluf there, but some nice information also.  BUT the one thing, when will you be able to tell us.  I remember reading one of the posts saying that zerkers are their current focus and have been for a while.  BUT they couldn't tell anyone.<br />
<br />
I don't want something like that to happen here.  I just want to know when we can see 2 things, 1 proposes changes and 2 when they should go live.<br />
<br />
As far as not being able to live up w your current proposed changes, so you aren't displaying them.  I would like to see a toned down list of the changes that you know can be done with the current code.  I know it won't be a list of eveything, just give us something so we can see what you are working on.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Hello again Brenlo, it's nice of you to come by to defend Gloriana.  I certainly feel bad that she has to bear the brunt of this anger.   It really isnt her fault and I am glad she had a nice time at your event.  Maybe it is enough to keep EQ exciting and interesting for her, for a bit longer.<br />
<br />
For many of us, it is not.  You ask what good tearing at each other is doing.  I would say it does about the same amount good as rational, reasoned...polite discourse has got us thus far.  Which is next to nothing.  I really wish I could say differently, I did my part as a former  moderator here and as an advocate of my class over the years.  We recently achieved some minor changes (but not until AFTER people got really emotional and started flipping out) and got a lot of promises to look into things.  It was heartening at first, finally maybe they are really listening to us!  Then nothing, more bugs, more of the same old problems, lots of listening but no doing.  Even a simple AA refund is going to take 6 months to achieve, if it ever gets done.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I feel like a brickwall, a large unmovable, unsurmountable obstacle, has been placed in front of the path forward for the shaman class.  There are really only 3 reactions to give when you are faced with this brickwall, either you get angry that it is in front of you and try to smash it down, you pretend it isnt there at all, or you resign yourself to its presence and walk away.  <br />
<br />
Some people are reacting to this with anger.  Some of them are sadly directing this anger at Gloriana, it's a shame and it's inexcusable.  She's worked harder to advance shaman issues than most anyone else.  She stuck with you when Sunmoon sold us out, and I bailed.  Clearly she cares deeply about the class and community.  I can't blame people for being angry at SOE, many of us have a 5 year investment in our characters, our EQ lives..games are no fun when you change the rules in the middle, but there is no reason at all to be angry at Gloriana.  She did not do this to you and has done her best to help improve things. <br />
<br />
Some people imagine the brick wall doesnt exist, these people never test the limits and only do the safe things.  Most importantly they keep their expectations low.  It's hard to be disappointed that way!<br />
<br />
Finally there are the rest. The people who aren't expressing anger or pretending there isnt a problem.  They're just accepting the inevitable, just resigning themselves to the brick wall and drifting away, giving up on ever obtaining change and cancelling their accounts.  I've bloodied my nose on this wall enough times.  It's just not worth fighting for anymore, not for me and not for many of the people who have posted their goodbyes and their cancellation notices.<br />
<br />
Folks - please lay off Gloriana.<br />
<br />
SOE - The guild summit was a good idea to start, maybe you should actually implement some of the changes you have been soliciting from the classes, guilds and others if you want to save your game.  I believe Gloriana and she said you were nice people who clearly love EQ, so stop killing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People have been posting (for the most part) rationally about this subject for over a year here, especially since GoD.   We were just ignored.  A lot of people held out hope that you guys knew that the class was crippled by the shift from efficiency fights with high-hp/low dps mobs to fast clicking speed fights with highdps /low hp mobs, but you just hadn't figured out how you were going to fix us yet.  Now you drop the bomb that you weren't aware that we had problems.<br />
<br />
When people see that happen, your suggestion that we continue to beat our heads against the same wall for more months and hope something different happens is not going to make people happy.<br />
<br />
Really, I think that the reaction here has been shockingly mild.  Warriors were posting Absor=Iraqi Information Minister photoshops and screaming bloody murder on a daily basis, and they got what they needed. <br />
<br />
Now, I agree that the (very few) people attacking Gloriana are out of line.  But most people who are flaming SoE have just plain given up now.  Flipping the bird on the way out the door is a way to save a little dignity that was lost by begging you guys to change for months.</div></div><hr />

Yes you have posted and it has been read, Gloriana presented it to Rytan and he was not swayed.  So now present a counter argument.  If you feel he is wrong, as most of you here do, then show him why.  That is what I am saying.  <br />

<br />
We've presented this argument (that stat buffs are a waste) in the past and had our stat buffs changed.  What has changed since then?  What would make Ryan feel like stat buffs do something now, when we agreed they did not do anything at the beginning of POP.<br />
<br />
This is what breeds this frustration and anger, telling people to prove their point over and over again then to have it simply dismissed because one person disagrees.<br />
<br />
Similar to the healing problem, Ryan agreed with us that we needed a healing upgrade, after MONTHS of begging and pleading.  However, he is totally unreceptive to the idea of changing the percentages.  How could we PROVE that we need an increase in percentages.<br />
<br />
One of the things that we were promised is that we would get a clear definition of what SOEs vision for the role of the shaman class was.  Perhaps that will come sometime around when the AA refund for our ward does.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

If you wish to have constructive dialogue, then please talk about why Rytans statement would be bad for Shaman in the long term and show me data.  If you wish to avoid criticism, you can email it to me at acrosby@soe.sony.com.<br />

Sorry, but this is just getting to be a circular argument in a way.<br />
<br />
1. /petition I have a problem I need to talk to a GM about.<br />
2. Guide so and so here... how may I help you.<br />
3. Shaman sos and so explains the problem.<br />
4. Guide so and so say ok, I have escalated your problem for a GM to look at. You should be contacted by a GM in a day or two.<br />
5. Two weeks later... /petition I was supposed to be contacted by a GM almost two weeks ago, could you get a GM for me please.<br />
6. Hellow, Guide me here... What was the problem.<br />
7. Shaman so and so explains the problem again.<br />
8. Guide me tells you, OK, I have escalated your petition again. You may also want to email your server gm also.<br />
9. Shaman so and so says ok, I will do that.<br />
10. Shaman so and so emails and waits for GM response in tells or email.<br />
11. Shaman so and so received email-in-a-can stating that Shaman so and so should /petition to get the issue resolved.<br />
12. Shaman so and so beats his head against the wall...<br />
<br />
I've tried this petitioning/email thing before. While not the exact same situation, it sure seems familiar. I had items disappear from my inventory, and it took no less than 1 and a half months, just to be told that some items would not be replaced because I had no record of them on my character, and the others would be replaced by benefit of the doubt since the quest was known to have issues.<br />
<br />
Except in this situation, we are not being given the benefit of the doubt, despite years of experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u220"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p220">I don't agree with the preconceptions here. <br />
<br />
A large amount of poeple here think shaman are unwanted in groups, think shaman can't function as secondary healers, and provide the lowest dps out of any class. People feel dots are worthless in any new content, they overaggro, don't run to full duration and are less efficient thatn DDs. Those same DD's that take too long to cast and are lower than druid / cleric dd's while those two classes heal for more. People feel that heals over time are insufficient and that 3 other classes can slow close enough to where we can to make us even less wanted in groups, since we can't add anything else.<br />
There's a holy trinity here, warrior, cleric enchanter. What does a shaman bring to that .. enchanter can slow just fine .. a druid added as a 2nd healer can backup heal and damage much better. A 2nd cleric can heal better and do more damage than a shaman.<br />
<br />
SoE, Ryan, Brenlo, whomever else .. you should proceed under the novel assumption that a large number of your paying customers is right. If we are dissatisfied with the direction our class has taken and people are cancelling accounts and going to your competitors products, It is your burden to make your client base happy, not your client bases' burden to convince you of anything. Cancellations and lost revenue = convincing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, Glori.<br />
<br />
Lando -- can't make any sense out of quitting this game then starting up their next one.  Now that takes some mental convolutions to work up to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u222"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p222">&quot;Ryan had concern that we would mem the new spell with can 4 and alternate them.&quot;<br />
<br />
and even it we did what exactly would this matter?<br />
Oh no look at those pesky shaman, they went from chain casting Cani to chain casting Cani when we gave them this new spell omg WHAT WERE WE THINKING????<br />
can we just storm Soe hq and force them to play shaman for 3 days straight? is that what it would take to convince them?<br />
the higher you get in content the lower you get on the desirabilty scale and the lower your effectivness gets. period, end of story. as a solo class nothing has changed, as a group/raid class everything has changed. my old guild currently raids without a shaman at all. Does that compute? one of the Stongest (if not stackable) raid classes from day 1 until a couple expansions ago is now not even nessecary to have along even as a buffbot.<br />
<br />
its nice that soe is listening to the customer base, now stop ****ing off and listen to the shaman comunity already. we arent a bunch of people who got together at denny's to try and create random changes to shaman, this is a serverwide problem and you keep coming here and telling us we dont know our own class well enough to judge when we are broken or not. <br />
<br />
guilds raiding without shaman? hear that? its not a lie. totally dead weight.<br />
<br />
Heals, end game heals are total crap, why? Clerics and druids had OVERHEAL on their spells, this means that they could heal a tank for MORE hp than the tank had, now druids no longer have that overheal cushion, for clerics its considerably smaller thanks to massive mob dps...for shaman the overheal never existed in the first place. shaman heals have never been big enough to offer any kind of safty net at all.<br />
<br />
Dps, shaman are one of the worst dps classes in the game, our pets are dead last behind even Sk's, necros (and druids thanks to reliable dots thanks to massive resist modifiers) out dot us, damn near every class that even has a nuke can out nuke us and melee damage is laughable at best.<br />
<br />
buffs, ok heres the thing, every stat in this game has had extensive parsing done to determine its effectivness, and in spite of the long and well established FACT that all stats have diminishing returns you tell us that more stat buffs will be wonderfully efective in game, I call bull****. its already a joke that Agi even exists as a stat, its a joke that it takes 100 agi to get a 3% boost in avoidance and thats at the LOW end of the scale, I cant imagine getting more than 1% for 100 agi if you are already at the high end of the stat charts. if you dont believe the parses done by class after class and player after player then may I suggest you run some parses yourselves? you have the ability to change stats directly, to isloate them in ways the player base cant and you can create mobs/charaters with the ability to stay alive indefintly to make the parsing easier. the fact that you think stats make a difference especially at the end game makes you guys look like idiots. so instead of telling us to offer a counter argument (note its the same one thats been offered for the last 5 years) why dont YOU offer us the counter argument? you run the parses and show us what you did to come up with proof that stats are worth either jack or ****. <br />
<br />
and for being last or near last in every catagory we exist in what is our reward? a slow that is marginally (and man do I mean marginaly) better than 2 other classes in the game and situationally its worse thanks to eternal cast times on the malos/slow combo.<br />
<br />
oh yeah we also get cani, the power to regen mana at a great rate...to pay the extra mana cost of all our spells.<br />
<br />
and the ridiculous cast time on every thing we have.<br />
<br />
and the power to be usless in pvp.<br />
<br />

<br />
Brenlo<br />
<br />
<br />
So when shot down try again? When do we stop? When out of frustration we quit or yall stop coming to the boards cause all we do is reiterate the same things over and over?<br />
<br />
<br />
Customer service is at a all time high I see. The only power we have is with our credit cards. Cancling accounts. That or talk to an unresponsive person who after talking with a wonderful lady for a few minutes and seeing her passion for the game tells her &quot;Nah you are wrong they &quot;Stat buffs&quot; do some good for the class.&quot; (Paraphrased of course) <br />
<br />
This is a circular argument. We have no way of convincing Rytan. Because he already has heard all of the arguments that are easily made over a message board. And was not convinced. And has heard the quick argument from someone face to face who knows better than anyone the state of the shaman class. (Glori by the way in case you were not paying attention) Who is also pretty charming else you wouldnt be defending her. What else can we do? Where do we send the hookers and beer?<br />
<br />
In this day and age people won't keep argueing unless they are the hidebound stubborn muckitymucks. (Which I am in case you were not paying attention) but even though I care about what EQ was so damn much I spend an entire night reading over the message boards rather than playing a truly fun game (City of Heroes - Try it now all you pissed off shaman) and get told once again. Nah argument didnt work. please insert another quarter and try talking till blue in the face this time. (Again paraphrased, cause I am colorful and fun at parties when wearing lampshades on my head) <br />
<br />
Sorry Brenlo, you might be a great guy but you sir are asking too much of us. We have been arguing about spell drops and useage and such for years. And we get &quot;told try again. But keep paying. And have you seen our new expansion and game in the works.. and really I care.. We all care We care so much we are now crying over the state of  the poor puppies that died while shaman ran in terror when thier heals were too damn weak to keep anyone alive.. Think of the poor puppies. dont you care about the puppies like we do.. You Monsters!&quot; (Note to self Stop the gummi bears and Diet Code red consumption.. )<br />
<br />
I just hope enough shaman Cancle. And after I link these threads to all the boards I can find. I hope people see what the truth is. Even after the smokescreen of the &quot;summit.&quot;<br />

I will not rehash old content with you.  We have spoken clearly and concisely.<br />

You have not answered us clearly with reguard to our One Voice.<br />
<br />

You claim that stats matter.  Show us the formula.  We disagree.<br />
You claim that even with mitigation, our slow is essential.  Show us the formula.  Again we disagree.<br />
<br />
We dont need to convince you.  You need to convince us.  Uniformally we dont agree with you.<br />

We can dance this dance all you want.  But in the end we dont need to convince anyone what it is to be a shaman.  We know.  You dont.  We have tried, with the utmost professionalism and courtesy, to change your mind.  You choose not to listen to the Shaman class experts, rather thinking that you know more about us than we do.  You are wrong.<br />
<br />
Its put up or shut up time.  I just cancelled my account.  In one weeks time I will delete my account.  You now have the measure of my resolve.  The senior remaining shaman of the most powerful guild on Tarew Marr has had enough.  If you want to do something in that week, thats great.  But I for one will not rehash old content.  Too many people have already justified that body of work.  <br />
<br />
I strongly encourage that those of us who feel as strongly about this as I do, to delete as well.  Its time for us to go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u227"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p227">If we haven't convinced you (SOE) that there is a serious problem with the Shaman in the high end game, why don't you ask those high-end guild leaders that you had at the meeting? They represent the full spectrum of classes; how many Shaman members do they want on raids today? What percentage of their raid was Shaman four years ago, two years ago, and today?<br />
<br />
Or maybe more telling, what percentage of you devs and employees play a 65 Shaman for at least 10 hours a week?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u228"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p228">I don't mean to rain on your parades, but you guys are taking yourselves way too seriously.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Rytan and Brenlo aren't understanding the issues, and they are in fact wrong.  They are also allowing 3 posters to define the whole board.  That's unfair, and it's not really accurate.  <br />
<br />
I see the parallel historically to the situation just post-Kunark, just before superior heal was moved to 51 and Chloroblast was introduced.  We heal worse now than we did then in comparison to what we're fighting.  That's what people are sensing, and it's hard to quantify it.  But just because it's hard for players to measure that sort of qualitative sense based on actual years of game play (5 years now for some of us), doesn't mean it's not very real.  <br />
<br />
It's wrong to dismiss that and glibly demand &quot;data&quot;.  The data is in the declining subscriptions.<br />
<br />
I know folks have posted numbers describing the ratios of heals to mob damage from various time periods, and those numbers are simple enough for you to hunt up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi there, man. I read your posting here and really couldn't help but shake my head.<br />
<br />
First off, were's not tearing ourselves apart. So far, exactly ONE person on this board has been bitchy at anyone, really, and nobody's backing him up. We all appreciate the efforts Gloriana has put forth on this.<br />
<br />
The thing is, we're frustrated, so we post on threads like this to vent. We're not actually attacking anyone, we're simply getting complaints and sentiments off our chests, declaring them to a sympathetic audience.<br />
<br />
Like my otter-hating friend Henora stated a few posts above, we've been stating our points over and over again, in a perfectly calm and organized manner, and we didn't get the famed SoE silence, we were told by the spell developer &quot;No way&quot;. Now, I'm sure you've noticed, that upset us a little.<br />
<br />
Frankly we could argue our point to Ryan until we're blue in the face, and we, in fact, HAVE. We've presented proof, numbers, support, even done his work for him and come up with spell solutions and alternatives, right down to stacking issues in some cases! And we've been refused. There's really not much more we CAN do. <br />
<br />
Second, let me ask you about this...<br />
Will shaman as a class be better off after this? No, when all is said and done you will be in the same place you were yesterday except that you will have pissed off a lot of people, some of whom were on your side<br />
<br />
Can we get a .wav file of you saying that in a corny Italian or Bronx accent? <br />
<br />
Now, I do hope I'm reading it wrong, and if I am, I apologize beforehand, but what it looks like, to me, is you threatening &quot;be nice or you get nothing but nerf&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u233"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p233">So Brenlo thinks Rytan has solid arguments and we have &quot;behavior.&quot;  <br />
<br />

<br />
What a pill.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's hanging around Absor too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u234"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p234">Brenlo, stop wasting our time.<br />
<br />
These issues have been hashed out and discussed to death long ago.  <br />
<br />
You know it, I know it.  Rytan knows it, NOTHING IS NOT KNOWN.  <br />
<br />
Saying it's time to re-chew that cud with you yet one more time, after you've already asked us to do that so many times and some of us have gone &quot;moo&quot; too many times to remember, is disingenuous in the extreme.<br />
<br />
It's phony.<br />
<br />
I know it's your job to be that way, but please, don't expect us to like having our intelligence insulted and being condescended to.  AGAIN.<br />
<br />
It's clear you're not going to stop gassing on us because you're apparently convinced, or your superiors are, that it's still a worthwhile strategic way to deal with your customers.  It undoubtedly does still work with some of them.<br />
<br />
But the time for kid games is past.  Your gassing around telling us &quot;just a little more time to talk it over,&quot; &quot;we really need to examine these issues,&quot; or &quot;let's all work together, and especially be nice to your favorite community representative and mine, Gloriana! C'mon, let's give her a big hand guys!&quot; is the kind of thing EQ has been doing to its customers for far too long.<br />
<br />
It looks like you're stumped for what else to do, because you can't seem to come up with anything better.  Maybe wasting our time and doing nothing really IS you giving it your best shot.  Maybe this IS the best it's ever going to get?  Or at least you're doing what you get paid for, even if it is gassing around in a way no intelligent person could give credence.  It must be kind of embarassing in its way, and I'm sure not a few people feel badly for you.<br />
<br />
However, we don't pay you to do nothing but speak to us as if we're dolts.  <br />
<br />
Frankly, I think you've outlived your usefulness at this point, and feel it's with a high degree of certainty I can expect to see nothing but more dull, predictable P.R. and false assurances coming our way from you.  It's a shame doing nothing isn't an easier product to sell, I suppose.<br />
<br />
It sure gets distasteful to see it being peddled for so many months, though, as if we were somehow supposed to be such vapid dullards we hadn't even noticed.<br />
<br />
P.S. -- no dig at Gloriana; she didn't ask to be used as a sympathy-mongering device, someone just saw the opportunity.</div></div><hr />

I know a lot of people are frustrated right about now.  I am also aware that the &quot;summit&quot; did not live up to your expectations. Perhaps Glorianna was not as forceful or &quot;in your face&quot; as she could have been with the SoE crew.<br />
<br />
However, to totally dump on her or throw vitriole her way is uncalled for. In case you forgot - she plays a Shaman too.<br />

No kidding.  She doesn't have to admin these boards or go and represent our class for the enjoyment getting insults thrown at her from the mouthbreathers that are ragging on her.  Spartacus...err... Krohgre and the rest should follow suit and retire from the Cruicible since you have aparently done so to the game.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u236"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p236">Hi all,<br />
<br />
want to add my babble to the mess:<br />
<br />
1. We had like 2 peeps in the whole threat talking harsh at Glorianna. 2 of how many? You cannot please them all, we all should know that. Glorianna, thanks for trying to voice some of our concerns, I and many others are happy what you did.<br />
But, make no mistake Glori, open your eyes and look around. There is one reason administrators of major fan boards for EQ were invited. And the reason is that they have a strong voice to influence the player base. Don't get used for their cause, open your eyes and really look what they throw at us. More bones. I don't even talk about the shaman issues right now. Sure, some of the stuff in that list they gave us are nice, but do you really need to hold a summit to get this list? Most of the issues even a 12 year old playing the game could have gathered on his own.<br />
<br />
2. About the shaman related stuff:<br />
<br />
Yes that is true and the spell guy was not swayed by your initial argument.  So, if he is wrong, show him the error of his ways. You saw his statement, now counter it with a strong argument.  <br />
<br />
Alriiiiight ... let me take a breath of fresh air to calm down a bit ....<br />
<br />
Now ... what kind of argument is this? We, the players, provided raw data (hard to gather anyway, plus it takes our playing time), some historic data (how shaman have been and changed due to changed content) and some brainstorming. Now what you guys do is to say: That's nice, but we think you need nothing. And NOW you want us to do it AGAIN, just with a stronger argument?<br />
Reality check here: Do you think arguments between 2 partners work like that? One side sits their, listens, while the other does the work, and at the end you cross your arms across your chest and say: Hmmm, I am not convinced? Where is the counter argument? I have seen none! <br />
Tell us why you are not convinced. Show us raw data to back you up. Show us parsings that clearly show we would be overpowered with those changes. Whatever you think will further the discussion. But don't stand there and just tell us: We are not convinced.<br />
<br />
And you wonder why the shaman community is angry ... rofl.<br />

The fact that I and others would have to point out how wholly inadequate a 1300 pt heal (Tnargs) is on mobs that mitigate slow and do high dps just shows how out of touch SOE is with their own game.  And no, buying Gates and farming the crap out of it, hoping to get a rare NO DROP 1500 pt heal that is still wholly inadequate just so I can continue to do LDoNs and nothing else is not the answer.<br />
<br />
Absor was refreshingly honest in his recent comments vis a vis the game catering to raiders instead of non-raiders.  Why can't you do the same regarding shaman?<br />
<br />
Note to the rest complaining futilely (again): why are you still debating this when the very person responsible for fixing your spells has shot down any proposed changes? My man Absor said it best:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u239"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p239">Glori - in retrospect you shoulda headed to the beaches, put on some SPF 400 (You live in Washington and work for the Evil Empire - I figure your skin is transparent by now) and stared at that big yellow heat tab in the sky. (Army-speak for the sun).<br />
<br />
Then once the day ended, grabbed your B/F , hit the strip clubs (Those places LOVE couples - trust me on this)  and contributed to the local economy one dollar bill at a time.<br />
<br />
The next day you could've visited Sea World, watched the shows and heard big, fat mammals make unintelligible sounds.<br />
<br />
Finally you could've visited Charger central and met with one Mr. Philip Rivers and oohhhed and ahhhed over the potential of San Diego Quarterbacking.<br />
<br />
Then you could've come back and written the same report with less headache and you'd be sporting a tan:<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is sunny in San Diego, the locals are very friendly, and we were treated great.  I heard a lot of sounds which made me very happy inside.  Finally - the future looks great!&quot;<br />
<br />
Course you might've given yourself away if you raffled off a Sea World Shamu, matchbooks from the Gold Club, and an autographed # 17 Chargers jersey - but hey, beats taking crap on an internet message board about an online game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u240"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p240">Having read Brenlo's replies, im more convinced than ever that the Shaman is a dying class, and they have no ideas on how to make us viable again without making the clerics/druids go nuts.<br />
<br />
Just delete us, give me the AA, and comparable equipment option so that i can play another class, until a better game with staff that LISTENS instead of Talks at us comes along. <br />
<br />
Im very dissapointed with all this.<br />
<br />
Shamans - We need to be looked at, heres our data.<br />
<br />
SOE - No, your fine.<br />
<br />
Shamans - Seriously, most of us have quit, changed characters, we aren't happy.<br />
<br />
SOE - What are your issues.<br />
<br />
I hear the cluephone ringing, its for your Brenlo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u241"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p241">With regards to our stat buffs.... no one can logically argue that they make absolutely no difference, when people are saying that it's an exaggeration of the simple fact that they DO NOT MAKE ENOUGH OF A DIFFERENCE to cause other players (melee classes) to desire them over other more directly useful buffs.  Str/Dex/Agi/Sta and Gods help us, Cha are 2 to 5 buff slots that no sane melee will take in preference to Call of the Predator, Ferocity, Speed of Vallon, Symbol, Protection of the Nine, Brells, Resist Magic, Focus, and the sheer multitude of BETTER buff spells available to other classes.  <br />
<br />
One of the original reasons we we called the King of Buffs is that we recieved sooo many.  Now, most of the buffs we have are situationally useful at best.  <br />
<br />
-Inner Fire... the only spell we have of its kind, I just mention it out of nostalgia<br />
-Spirit of Wolf... made obsolete by the advent of Innate Run Speed<br />
-Enduring Breath... made obsolete by Magic Items (Faerune)<br />
-Ultravision... made obsolete by Magic Items (Faerune)<br />
-Levitation... necromancer/druid line of spells is vastly superior<br />
-Magic Resistance... Enchanter series is vastly superior<br />
-Fire/Cold Resistance... Druid series is vastly superior<br />
-Poison/Disease Resistance... Shaman series is the best, however poison or disease tend to be rarely used in EQ, situationally useful at best OR even if it is used, it's in the form of a DOT and EVERY priest class has poison/disease removal abilities and not an insignifcant number of other classes have the ability to remove or purge themselves of such effects.<br />
-Haste... Enchanter series is vastly superior  <br />
-Strength... has many buff conflicts with other better buffs (ie: Focus)<br />
-Dexterity... has many buff conflicts with other better buffs (ie: Focus )<br />
-Agility... marginal effect on combat or melee are at the Agility hard cap, melee prefer other buffs<br />
-Stamina... most melee are at the Stamina hard cap<br />
-Charisma... no noticeable effect on combat at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u242"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p242">The part that hurts most about point 28.8 is that beastlords and chanters can provide the same benefit yet beastlord can have pet dps going at the same time and chanter with a charmed pet going at the same time.<br />
<br />
So our gimp pet compared to beastlord and charmed pet DPS difference while providing the slow. <br />
In addition once the slow is done I dont have time to cast my dots or use mana effective dps.<br />
So both other slowing classes can add after the slow yet we cannot. Not worth the 5 percent in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u243"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p243">Here is the actual data we need to collect...  <br />
<br />
If someone has a list of all the major raiding guilds across all servers, poll each guild, ask them:<br />
1.  Do they NEED shaman present in order to raid in GoD.<br />
2.  If so, how many?<br />
3.  How many shaman have quit over these issues?<br />
4.  Are they actively recruiting shaman.<br />
5.  Why?<br />
<br />
On each server, conduct a poll of anyone LFG in PoK or otherwise, <br />
1.  If given a choice, which slower would you take in preference for your group?<br />
2.  If a shaman isn't your first choice, where do they fall?<br />
3.  If given a choice, what priest would you want for damage mitigation/healing.<br />
4.  If a shaman isn't your first choice, where do they fall?<br />
<br />
   <br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if we are still the most balanced class in the world anymore, what matters is now is that if EQ is a social game and they (SOE)  WANT us to group, we should be as desirable as the next class.  <br />
<br />
It also doesn't matter if over 50% of the EQ population is a shaman.  If shaman are unable to get groups or contribute to a raid, there's obviously a problem.  <br />
<br />
It doesn't matter that only one person is quitting.  It matters WHY that person is quitting.  EQ is a game and is intended to a diversion, but if people no longer find it fun, then it's SOE's responsibility to find out why and resolve it.  Not the consumer.  <br />
<br />
It isn't JUST the Shaman customer base that is saying we have been metagamed out of environment, it's virtually everyone.  This isn't an imagined thing, it's happening and that's why we are unhappy.   If you (SOE) are right and we (the shaman community) are wrong regarding our issues, why are we so undesirable now when prior to GoD, we used to be required?  If you (SOE) are right and we (the customer base) are wrong about the shaman class, it's now YOUR job to convince everyone otherwise before more people leave in disgust or dissatisfaction because this negative perception of our class (since the customer base is imagining things regarding how useful the shaman class has become) has become so pervasive that it will take hard proof to convince us otherwise.  <br />
<br />
Instead of micromanaging our spells and the endless parsing, listen to what we are actually saying... in the current environment, other classes are able to supplant our former roles so completely that we are no longer necessary but are carried by our own guildmates out of pity.  <br />
<br />
We don't want the world, just the ability to thrive in it.<br />

<br />
I agree.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u246"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p246">Yes that is true and the spell guy was not swayed by your initial argument.  So, if he is wrong, show him the error of his ways. You saw his statement, now counter it with a strong argument.  <br />
<br />
Brenlo<br />
<br />
OK, so where did &quot;Spell Guy&quot; show us the error in &quot;our&quot; ways?  What is &quot;his&quot; justification and proof that counters &quot;our&quot; perceptions?  We gave him our numbers and real game scenarios that support our arguments.  He gave us the brush off with no supporting rationale or numbers.  Just his own personal perceptions that &quot;we are fine&quot;.<br />
<br />
So tell me, I'm the paying customer and I've made a solid argument concerning issues with the game, why do I need to restate and further support my position when his remains unsupported?<br />
<br />
Taking your advice would have us sending petitions and collecting parse information for months, with no indication that it would impact the situation at all.  <br />
<br />
If you want to end this debate here and now, let Ryan tell us why our healing is fine, why our active mana regen is ok, why we need more 2.6 min dots, why or dd's take 7.8 sec to cast, etc.<br />
<br />
Brenlo, don't come here and tell me to keep doing what I've been doing, with no success, and no justification from the person making the decisions.  It's like telling a guy to keep hitting his head against a wall.<br />

I have countered with a strong argument. I hit end billing and my subscription runs out on July 2nd. I really would like to keep playing and enjoy this game again, but I feel Ryan and SOE are the ones that need to be swaying ME and other (ex-)players like me to pay to play this game instead of other games coming out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">~chuckles quietly~<br />
<br />
It's gotten to the point, for me, that reading this thread is almost comic relief.  All the attacks and shreds on people in this thread, on SOE, on Everquest, I read them and shake my head with a smile.<br />
<br />
What is saddening though, is at the same time I read the posts a large number of them make me realise just why there are people shooting at each other driving down the highway, students takeing guns into school, etc.<br />
<br />
Someone isn't happy?  They want to fight, they want to attack verbally or physically to make their point, rather than attempting to have a semi intelligent conversation first.<br />
<br />
Also ~grins~ I think it would be interesting to see just how many people posting attacks, rants, shouts and screams, would be saying / doing the same thing in person as they do behind the safety of their computer.  If they are the same in person as they are here, I'm definitely glad they weren't asked to go to the SOE meeting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">I'd like to see some justification too.<br />
<br />
If we're ok ... then tell us *why* we're ok.  Maybe we just don't realize it.<br />
<br />
If you realize we're not ok, then tell us why the shaman class can't be modified because of &lt;nnnnn&gt; issues, and at least let us know why nothing is being done.<br />
<br />
We've gone out of our way repeatedly to show how mitigating and high DPS mobs already severly crunch our healing and functional capabilities<br />
<br />
And is there any real reason behind why we don't get pet focus items?<br />
<br />
What is the &quot;vision&quot;(tm) of a shaman from SOE's side?<br />
<br />
How do we currently fit into that vision?<br />
<br />
What are the underlying issues behind why SOE thinks we're fine as is?<br />
<br />
What is &quot;noticeable&quot; increases via our stat buffs vs. melee caps, and actual usefulness?</div></div><hr />
