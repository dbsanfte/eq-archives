<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, we've all played eq for a loong time and it's a good bet everyone has noticed things that worked and others that didn't. One of the more interesting aspects of getting to try another game was seeing new solutions applied to old problems or old solutions applied differently.... I don't think anything here would be NDA since you can get most of these infos just looking at the class faq's and reading their boards<br />
<br />
<br />
-For example, the mail boxes. <br />
In one simple step, you make it possible to leave messages for people who aren't online, simplify transactions between players thus preventing the exploits that eventually lead to cash being made no drop (send it COD, problem solved), remove any need for a shared bank between same account toons and add an interesting aspect to the world itself. Twinking itself being solved by the uniform application of level restrictions on gear so it's no longer an issue. <br />
<br />
-Killing a named for a quest lets everyone in the group get the quest item.... No more long waiting lists for popular quest camps. <br />
<br />
-Automatic round robin for loot. Just set this to on and never worry about ninja looters or who's turn it is to get that drop again.<br />
<br />
-Quests can only be done once.... This is a big one because it means having a lot more actual content. <br />
<br />
-The travel options. Per continent, you get flight paths useable for a small fee with other more boat like travel between continents. <br />
<br />
-Xp for exploring.... And the way the map was implemented (exploring reveals a richly detailed map as you discover new areas). Experience the content... There's no point spending months making a great looking zone if no one ever sees it ! Booyah ! <br />
<br />
-We covered tradeskills but they're still worth mentioning.... <br />
<br />
-Class balance... So much to be said here.... Like giving snare to the classes that are going to use it to keep mobs from running away instead of the classes that would use it as a way to kite...brilliant.<br />
<br />
-Rage vs stealth vs mana... nuff said... <br />
<br />
-Buffs are insta cast... so were the dots I saw (seriously, what's the point of long casting times on these other than tediousness)<br />
<br />
Food and drink. Cut down on downtime by chowing down. All of a sudden, stat food is food that regens your mana/hp faster between fights. As a game mechanic it really works great. <br />
<br />
-Food vs potions, food is cheaper and has no cooldown but can't be used during a fight while potions are insta cast anytime but have a 2 minute cooldown to reuse making them great for emergency's while preventing exploits... <br />
<br />
-Group Invite from anywhere in the zone.... Invite the person, he sees your blips on his mini map. Knows where to find the group without 15 minutes of explanations. Also usefull when the group is entering an instance...<br />
<br />
-Druid bear form.... This one actually makes the shaman in me jealous... What rabid bear could have been. Shapechange, you can no longer cast or use items, BUT you can deal serious melee damage and take hits comparably to a warrior. No cooldown on reuse. It's a real aspect of the class, not a gimmick.<br />
<br />
-On that note.... I never saw something stupid like a 2 hour reuse on ANYTHING. Especially not on class abilities. If something takes 2 hours to refresh, then it had better be a frikking death touch, not a crappy 5 minute 3.5 dps increase ! (sorry bout that, Rabid bear just kills me)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So... what game mechanics or other aspects made you go woah, they actually made it work ...</div></div><hr />

This is not even zone dependent.  I can group invite anyone in the game (so long as we're on the same side of the war).  I can also find the types and levels of characters I want for my group (to include knowing whether or not they're already grouped or looking for group) with the best /who implementation I've seen in one of these games.<br />
<br />
-On that note.... I never saw something stupid like a 2 hour reuse on ANYTHING. <br />
The only thing close to this is the Hearthstone cooldown period of one hour, but since every class in the game gets this ability to teleport to your bind point (yes - warriors too!  :cool: ) and you typically don't need it more often, it's not a problem (although many caster classes eventually get a shorter cooldown/more teleport options).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There are a few trinkets that have long cooldowns. this is mainly because they can have cross class skills or other overpowered (or plain fun) effects</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So... what game mechanics or other aspects made you go woah, they actually made it work ...<br />
- No zoning was huge (unless you change continents).  It makes the world seamless and immersive.<br />
<br />
- watching a new flight path for the first time (hate them after the first time, however).<br />
<br />
- the sensation of character power at all levels.  As a mage I feel like I'm blowing stuff up and have a wide variety of tricks.  I love the challenge of breaking an outdoor dungeon solo to finish a quest.  With nothing but my robes and my wits I have to handle 2 and 3 pulls which is a riot.  You wouldn't even try this in EQ.<br />
<br />
- simple UI, a Blizzard hallmark.  Everything is so easy to use, especially setting up hotkeys and spell bars.<br />
<br />
- the auction house and mail system is EBay meets MMORPG.  I was blown away at how smoothly it works.  It even just &quot;feels&quot; right in a way that shared bank slots and 24/7 bazaar vendors never did.<br />
<br />
- the variety and immersiveness of the various zones.  I recently had to venture into night elf lands and the contrast to orc/undead lands was striking.  To avoid all the wandering mobs I ended up swimming along the bottom of a river and lake (undead don't need to breathe) to get to a waterfall where I had to collect some special water.  It just felt like something an undead would do- sneak in and steal something precious.  Of course then I went and put an entire camp of dryads to the flame so what can I say. :p<br />
<br />
- the way instanced dungeons still interact with the outside world instead of being entirely self contained a la LDoN in EQ.  Very, very cool how the Shadowfang Keep dungeon winds inside and outside, up and down through the castle.  When you're on the parapet you can see the surrounding lands just as if you weren't in the instance.<br />
<br />
Now if I could just find another group to try ShadowFang again and not wipe at the last room before the boss... /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Woo, where to start?   The fact that quest rewards were actually WORTH SOMETHING(!) for one! Heh.  Almost every quest has an item reward (not just xp/cash) that was usable at the level that I got the quest at, unlike EQ where maybe 1/50th of the quests are worth doing at all. (And that's including the quests people use to grind faction points.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slythor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">having a great time so far.<br />
<br />
I have a lvl 15 Shaman. Been a great game.<br />
<br />
I am enjoying all the quest , and I have leveld almost without knowing it through them.<br />
<br />
No grinding, no downtime really. <br />
<br />
I like it alot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ditto - I did a brief stint during the stress test and almost wish I didn't as now I'm like a deprived crack addict.<br />
<br />
I agree with all the other stuff posted here, and I'd add:<br />
<br />
- Quest reward choices - it's nice to have a choice of reward - sometimes you even have to choose between multiple things you can use.  You very, very rarely see a quest reward that you can't use (or at least sell - since you can vendor sell quest rewards for decent coin).<br />
- A lot of quests give multiple rewards - which is always nice.  For example, some quests would have you collecting ingredients for some food items (for an NCP baker or something) - and when you were done you'd get a stack of food and the recipe for that food (to use with the cooking secondary skill if you had it)<br />
- Quest tie-ins to some class abilities - like at level 10 I think all classes have to do a quest for their trainer to get one of their class abilities as a reward.  For my warrior I was rewarded with the 'defensive stance' ability.  I know warlocks got their first real pet for their 10th reward (and it was amusing to meet people that didn't do every quest they found and blew off their trainer quests - then asking, how do you get that pet?)<br />
- Excellent warrior implementation (best ever, IMO).  I started a warrior thinking I'd get the hang of things (not necessary since the gameplay is so intuitive) and then try something else and ended up sticking with the warrior because he started out with and developed fun abilities.  I loved how the rage system worked that &quot;powers&quot; warrior special attacks.  Even early as a warrior you get fun abilities like Rend (damage + small damage over time attack) and Hamstring (damage + 15 sec snare effect - awesome for runners in PvE).<br />
- Talent system is cool - it's sort of like getting AAs except they start at level 10 and let you tailor or enhance your character.  Some give bonuses to existing abilities/spells, some add new abilities or spells, etc - very like much like AA except since you can't get every talent available for your class you have to make choices (beyond the choice to grind xp til the end of time to get ALL AAs).<br />
- I have to restate how awesome it is not to zone.  You see a cave - you walk right into the cave (fighting the inevitable critters at the entry point).  You're in a cave, you can see out to the rest of the world.  There were cool dungeons in noobie areas - a snowy cave where it looks like it's really snow inside the cave.<br />
- WoW's graphics blew me away.  Screenshots just don't relay how impressive the graphics are.  I expected them to be mediocre at best but they were just awesome.  Very stylish, very well done - you really feel like you're in the world of warcraft.<br />
- During the ST I had zero lag (no internet or graphical lag) - the game ran silky smooth.  I never noticed any loading while travelling.  There was the occasional barely noticeable hiccup if you died and &quot;teleported&quot; to a graveyard (big jump in location, so kinda understandable).<br />
- Massive cities - but they feel right - they don't feel huge just for the sake of taking up lots of space.<br />
- I like the mild death penalty system in WoW.  I never like to die but it was nice not to lose progress via death when it did happen.  And depending on where you're &quot;bound&quot; you could still face a long run if you retrieve your body - and to me time is usually as valuable as xp.  I've never liked being severely punished for dying - it sucks to lose hours of xp.<br />
- Fastest load time of any MMORPG I've played.  And I mean fast - I'd be in the game within 30 seconds tops after firing up my WoW icon.  One time I got dropped (CTD as gryphon landed at Stormwind) and I was able to log right back on - and was still in my group.  Very nice.<br />
- I too loved the simple yet highly effective interface.  You have banks of 12 hotkeys (1 thru 0 and -/+ keys - ie, top row of keyboard) and you can shift+# or shift+arrow thru your hotbars.  The chat windows are nicely done.  The interface overall is very minimal yet it's easy to do/view everything and the end result is that you are looking at the game instead of having your screen cluttered with interface windows.  I didn't try it but there's a built in macro/script thingie for making complex hotkeys (for ex, to switch between 2h weapon and sword+shield, etc)<br />
- WoW is fun from the moment you start.  You feel effective at level 1 and it just keeps on rolling.  You immediately start with several quests and start getting useful rewards.  You don't have to look around forever to get started and early quests help guide you through content to move you along.  It's so well done it's ridiculous.  You don't feel like you need to level up to XX level (or max level) to have fun, enjoy engaging content, or have good gear.  I read a lot of the basics while DLing the ST client - but there wasn't much to learn that wasn't very obvious upon &quot;landing&quot; after making a character.  All you really need to know is controls (for movement, chat, camera, etc - depending on how much you want to know right off).  I expected to be sitting there trying to figure out stuff before I got going - but what ended up happening was that I was immediately grabbing quests, interacting with vendor NPCs to see what was up, checking out my special abilitie descriptions, and then heading out for some critter bashing - all in very little time.<br />
<br />
Arg.  I need to return to WoW!  :-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep, mild death penalty + near-zero downtime means I'm absolutely RUINED for any other mmorpg.  Funny, I'm just not willing to sit around doing nothing for minutes at a time or be punished by my video games anymore.  *grin*<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if they're still tweaking it or not, but the hearthstones + exp bonus idea just seemed to work out in great little ways.  You got a huge incentive to gate back and camp out in an inn for the night, which means the next time you log in, you can reassess what you'd like to do, instead of just pounding away at the same quest/area because that's where you camped out.</div></div><hr />
