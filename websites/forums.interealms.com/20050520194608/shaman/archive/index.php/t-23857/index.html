Lvl 67-68 was done in the Muramite Proving grounds and PoEarth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For most of my xping ( 66 -69, only 20% away from 70 ), I was in various groups that were chain pulling C2 castle.<br />
<br />
I haven't spent too much time in OoW yet.  My group tried MPG, but after a few deaths just trying to get to the zone, we were pretty pissed.  Note, I died a few times to the two kvys that are in the alleyways before the zone in while I was attempting to CR my corpse in MPG.  I got wise and memmed cheetah to run past them; which prompted me to /feedback how stupid it was to have see invis mobs so close to a zone in.</div></div><hr />

In your post you mentioned chain pulling deep water. Who or What is this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Deep water is where you pull Ofesasafadsfas to in PoWater (i believe) all of the mobs are yellow con for the most part (at lvl 66+). Chain pulling = pulling when the mob in camp isn't even dead yet (usually 15-25% of the mobs health)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Obadia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you guys must be pretty awesome... i spent 7 hours in WoS yesterdayfor a whoping 2 yellows.then i went to earth and got 2 more yellows in 5 hours.so for me earth was definately better but 12 hours netted me not even a level.  :(  <br />
 both groups were pretty consistant pulls,no deaths in either zones,earth pulls were a little faster.<br />
 today i went back to earth and got my last yellow in 2 hours.3 hours later i had my first yellow into 67.<br />
 so 17 hours i get 1 level and one yellow,yet i seem to see everyone saying ,oh i did 66-67 in 6 hours,67-68 in about the same....<br />
 all i can say is it must be nice because i sure can't fathom those numbers.   :eek:  <br />

      grats to you guys</div></div><hr />

For the most bang out of your buck, you should really xp in Fire - Castle 2.  With the abundance of mobs and the ease of pulls, a group can chain pull easy.  There is a thread on The Steel Warriors that breaks down the number of kills needed per level from 67-70 if I recall ( based on xp from mobs in Castle 2 ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Although I haven't been there because I am not flagged for it, I understand from a level 70 friend that Kod'taz is very good exp (especially since the Ele's are insanely crowded right now).<br />
<br />
And if you are like me and don't have any cool flags, Wall of Slaughter (go to Noble's Causeway from OoW zone-in, then run all the way through it to get to WoS) is decent exp and there are some pretty nice single group drops there.  Having a tracker there is handy since the nameds pop in various places in a wide open plain area, and also because they can help avoid a powerful mob that will eat a single group (I think it was called the shadow hunter or something like that) which can spawn as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Howdy:<br />
<br />
I've had the same experience as Obadia.  I expect about 2 hours per yellow in 66 when XPing in PoE or WoS.  Can't get a PoF C2 group since all the Time+ guilds have those camps locked.<br />
<br />
The best XP so far has been to pull multiples back to camp and have a bard mez all but the one being tanked.  Then I debuff and slow them ahead of the group engaging them.  This works very well as long as you have a competient group.<br />
<br />
Problem I have with chain pulling in WoS is that because of competition it is often hard to find a mob that is close.  Grabbing a couple and then going to get more when the last mob is engaged keeps us busy all of the time.  Standard 1-mob chain pulling left us with on average 30 seconds between mobs, which really adds up over the course of an hour.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As Far as I can tell...<br />
<br />
Fire (c2)<br />
Proving Grounds<br />
Any other Elemental Plane<br />
WoS<br />
<br />
This based on consistancy of mobs, mobs killed per time unit etc. Proving Grounds actually has a higher XP/mob rating, but is harder to keep consistant pulls coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">MPG seems like a nice place to xp, but if you lose a rezzer, you might be in a long CR which happened to me last night.  We were working towards a few named, and our cleric died ( I do not have Call of the Wind yet - need 3 more AA ) but we pressed on killing with me healing.  We were doing pretty well, but we started to get more and more adds.  Our tank died and I joined him soon after :(  For the most part, the mobs do not hit super hard, but if you get multi's, you might be in a world of hurt if you do not lock them down asap.  AA XP seemed awesome here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Walls of Slaughter is awful for experience. It takes roughly 10-15 mobs to make 1%, I believe. Stay out of that zone. Trains, OOC and shout arguments, ninjalooting, KS'ing ... it's perfectly awful. Elementals are crowded now. Plane of Earth and Plane of Fire are cramped and beginning to succumb to the same problems WOS has now. I'm doing my exping in Kod Taz and Yxtta. Yxtta is wonderful. 5-6 mobs per 1% experience. Quiet. Empty. Nice. I would have to rate experience zones as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Yxtta<br />
2. KodTaz/Ikkinz trials<br />
3. Fire C2 (from what I hear) and POE<br />
3. Proving Grounds<br />
4. Plane of Water (hard to fight in, but usually empty)<br />
5. Walls of Slaughter, Noble's Causeway<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">kod'taz xp rips. have had a couple really good groups there recently. chain pull north and south field camps and from the temples adjacent to them. very low risk, lots of fun, and anyone telling you a shammy can't be second healer here has one of two problems:<br />
<br />
1. crap tanks.<br />
<br />
2. no concept of how to play their character.<br />
<br />
i have healing adept 1, healing gift 2, 5k mana pool (6300 hps to canni), and first times i was down there had zero tank deaths with me using tnarg's and Q to back up heal. easy as pie. keep up regen, when puller calls inc, throw a Q on the tank, target incoming mob, hit slow. no need to malos out here, things have pretty low MR for the most part. got the turn in rune for breath of trushar on the second group i caught there, and between that and the new 9th spell slot, am having no issues whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Grab 5 melee and head over to PoF.  There is an excellent camp in the 2nd yard that is almost never taken.  On the left wall there is a cubby area populated mostly by spiders with a gazeebo*sp filled with the Firehead doods.  Move your group deep into the cubby and you have mob paradise.  I can keep a group of 5 melee going without breaking a sweat.  I prefer to have a Pali or SK for the tank, with a possible 2nd tank there for adds and intercepting chain pulls.<br />
<br />
The camp is always open and the mobs are easy enough for a single shammy to keep up np.  Though some will have an easier time than others depending on gear, spells, etc.  Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The one spot that I have not seen mentioned here yet is a Charm group in Vxed.  I'm told its very good exp, you just need to feed the pet a LOT of mobs.  Takes about 10 to 15 seconds if the Pooka is fully hasted.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Found a pretty decent spot last night in Proving Grounds.  If you have a decent map of this maze-like zone, it's east of Blind Hunter, you'll find a safe corner past the + sign looking pillars.  It's before Riftseeker's.  <br />
<br />
This will put you between two named, the Blind Hunter and a snake lady who's name starts with O.  Can drops Minor-Greater runes as well as some priest shoulders, I forget the BH's other loot.<br />
<br />
Anywho... we had war/clr/shm/mag/mag/mnk, and the exp sure flowed when we were able to pull both ways, until another group moved near BH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>arfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you get a 68 or higher to start an instanced in DS the xp is about equal with PoE or PoF. It has the added advantage or dropping runes and improved gear(from lower level instances). The PH/Named are in different spots than the lower level encounters and the named are different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">PoE and PoF should not even be compared. there is no comparison. PoF is truely the place to go for EXP. (AA or regular)<br />
<br />
IF you pull mobs within C2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GheffGutterbrains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Walked into PoWater down just past where most guilds pull Mufassa (Ofassa) and Krabby and owned up the XP... better than C2 PoFire but NOT but the weak at heart.. a. Water b. Dark c. Challenge to chain pull<br />
<br />
Rolled into PoAir... A job to get to the rings... and assuming Balt the Curse isnt up....but once settled in... sweet XP... lotsa mobs.. no competition.. and it aint water... Better than C2 again..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow, where in air can you group for good xp?  I've only been there a few times for raids so it's hard to judge the zone when surrounded by 50+ other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Noticed up a few levels theres level 68 mobs, usually birds wandering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ruined City is better than WoS.  I think it was better exp, plus much, much quieter.  Not as good as MPG, but a lot more stable, and not nearly as troublesome for corpse run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>esma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I am not ep flagged, working on tier 2, got equipment mostly matching ornate. The best Exp i have found for 66-68 so far is doing expeditions in Dranik's. Since the zone is instanced you don;t have to compete for mobs, the mobs are reletively well spaced so it is hard to get more than 3 on a pull, usually 1 or 2 which i can easily park add here.<br />
<br />
At 66 the exp is 10% per 60 so 1% per 6 kills<br />
At 67 it is double so 5% per 60.<br />
<br />
I found that a reletively moderate group can kill 60 mobs in here in about  75 minutes so that is 750 mins (12.5 hours) for 66 and 25 hours for 67.<br />
<br />
The good thing is the level of the mobs are based on the group/person who requests the expedition, so the exp here can keep getting better.<br />
<br />
Bad thing is named mob spawns (there are ph's) here are scarce, about 1 per hour in my exp, so getting rune drops here take alot longer than WoS. <br />
The ok side is you can make about 200pp per hour (not alot) from the drops off the mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When most of the people in group are post time geared, PoAir isnt so hard.. mostly about good add control as those pesky spiders have a habit of wandering in at bad times....<br />
<br />
We usually pick a temple and kill it... If we have lotsa time, we've even headed around the rings and up to the 2nd level of temples...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Fastosus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Without a doubt, the best exp for leveling is PoFire c2. I was able to pump out levels 67-70 in 2 days grouping here.</div></div><hr />
