<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a 37 shammy, and am interested in starting to work on my epic. I got the gem, and am ready to start the test of patience. My question is... will me a couple buddies around the same level be ok? Can I do it alone? Am I crazy to even think about it now?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the shark that is your problem in the test of patience will eat your two buddies for breakfast. Use invis animal the whole time, or get a couple bodyguards around level 45 - 50.  You three should be able to handle the woe and envy part for your shield, but you will need high level help again for the black dire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Invis vs animals is enough for Erud's crossing, as Shamu said, keep it up the entire time otherwise you run the risk of getting eaten.<br />
<br />
Both the paladin/SK in Rathemnts are kiteable with dogdog, load up with resist magic gear for the SK as getting snared is bad =)<br />
<br />
The paladin just takes ages to kill due to the amount of healing he can put out.<br />
<br />
Turn /pet taunt off, keep agro, and keep running and be efficient as you can against the paladin and you should be able to kill them both np (I did them at 39/40ish).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also there are some reports of Ooglyn being bugged and taking hours if ever to get to the spot under the sea.  You may want to double check and see if its fixed before dragging your friends along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the help everyone... I'll go give that sucker a try tonight :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A level 14 can do it, all you need is invisVsAnimals and your set, also remember to use a EB item or bring fish scales to cast it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can do it very young, I don't remember exactly what level I did it but it was well below level 30.  I do recomend setting a timer for your EB and Invis to Animals so you can replace them as needed so you're not forced to do it while any sharks are around.<br />
<br />
Envy, Woe and Marr's Promise are droppable so you really don't even need to kill the MoBs if you don't want to.  They can usually be found in the bazaar.  I do recomend doing it right just for the pride of it though.</div></div><hr />
