<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been hearing good things about this zone, but as of yet haven't visited there.  Is the exp as good as I've heard, upwards of half a blue a kill for mid 50's?  Is it possible to solo as a level 53<br />
around the entrance (I have seen no maps, so I'll be a coward and hang around the entrance).<br />
<br />
Can anyone share their experiences?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Solo at 53?  probably not.  Everything in zone is dark blue to a level 60, and they hit pretty hard  On the other hand, the yard trash do not summon (ravens, virulent arachnids), but I have had root break early and break often.<br />
<br />
On my server, this is becoming a DL rerun.  there were 99 peeps in zone the other night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know if I'd call it the new DL (yet).  I wouldn't advise you to solo here.  It's very easy to get a group here for a shaman, the mobs here hit so hard they have to be slowed!  I was in a full group there last nite at the werewolf (ravenous nitestalker) camp and we had 5 blue diamonds and a regular diamond drop in a little over an hour.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Soloing is possible, yes. But not worth it. I soloed some of the treants at 54, and only got 2% per kill and it took 10-12 minutes to kill *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mandryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I soloed here at 57 and now a bit at 58 and have mixed feelings about the time:exp ratio.  Sometimes I'll get 2% per tree/raven, sometimes it takes two kills per %.  When soloing, I'll run east of the GY and work my way around the large semi-open area pulling with Turgurs, rooting, epic, bane, jbb till break, root, rinse, repeat till dead.  Lately, however, I'll duo with a ranger or rogue friend and slow, root, and DoT heavily to gain agro and do the old 'run in a circle like a foo' routine while psuedo dogdog beats 'em down.  Exp moves slower per kill, but adds up faster in the long run due to the decrease in down time.<br />

I still prefer Howling Stones for the quiet atmosphere :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tell me about quiet atmosphere. I'm soloing in Mons Letalis, at the Gray zone line and most often I am the only one in the zone other than uber groups training mobs to the Gray as they pass thru.:mad: <br />
<br />
Some Rockhoppers and Stonegrabbers are light blue now though, and I need to move on someplace outdoors.<br />
<br />
Level 53, have horsey and JBB...  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">53-56 you can do skyfire soe some experience, although not outstanding.  The sperm like mobs (devourers ...) are the best exp kills being slightly overconned.<br />
<br />
55-58 WL, sentient suits (epic and JBB are musts for this).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mandryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From 53-56 I practically lived in CoM.  When the critters around the zin bridge turned light blue, I worked on in to the goo house and gazebos.  Nice exp and cash, quiet, yet somewhat out of the way.  IIRC, everything came single (at least up to the gazebos) at 53-54.  Most everything slows easily and drop quickly.<br />
<br />
Good luck and good hunting wherever you choose.</div></div><hr />
