<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vuulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I get 1% every 2 - 3 kills on PoJ prisoners, 1 Pox, 1 Bane, 1 turgurs, Dogdog and me.  Is there any better spot than this? I was thinking about giving chardok a shot because I see it in a lot of the 59 posts but wasnt sure how many kills it takes to get 1% of exp or approximate hit points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">POV, close to half a blue per kill regular xp in a full group for me when I was grinding there at 59. One full blue per kill in AA. I didn't get too many resists, but careful of the aggro. It took an estimated 3.2 seconds from aggro to Loading, please wait... the first time I slowed too soon P.<br />
<br />
You could also try Greig's end. The xp is still decent there and the loot table is pretty nice too. Don't try the zoneline, you can safely invis and run around the zone. There are several rooms with safe spots that you can set up and single pull. Probably safer to bring a partner to help learn the zone first though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">have to second pov.  with warrior tanking, hit mob with lvl 19 malaise as mob is inc, mob was slowed by the time mob was at 90 life, had no more than one slow resist entire night at lvl 58, and very rare agro on me.  in about 5 hours, made 60% of my lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 59 with a duo 57 warrior GE is a pretty good spot .. 2-3 per 1% and they are pretty easy.  Some cast necro/sk type stuff but kinda on the low lvl side.  I was not impressed =)<br />
<br />
PoJ .. for the cattle<br />
PoV I bet would be good exp if ya got a good group.<br />
Chardok I bet would be a nice change of pace but pretty far from anywhere and getting a rez might be tough.<br />
Umbral .. yeah yeah .. but UP was the hottest spot right before PoP came out and the exp is still good.  Its kinda a hike to get there but hey .. if your looking for out of the way places this is still pretty good.  Mobs &lt; 150 and summon but very weak .. BTW dont pull the shaman they will mess u up good =)  It schooled me because I never use rain spells .. but he reminded me that we get a rain that hits for 540X3 which is a quick 1620 points of damage for 300-400 mana.  Guess what I went and bought on my way to get my corpse =)<br />
<br />
59 has been the toughest lvl for me .. I have tried many different zones and while many are good ... it all depends on your play style.</div></div><hr />

I avoid the desert in pov like the plague. Too many wanderers, trains and unrootable mobs. Not sure what its like on your server but I don't go there unless its with guidies, or a seasoned bard or ranger that i know well.<br />
<br />
My favorite group spot is on the shore of the river by the razorfiend tunnels (and inside the fiends tunnel at higher levels). better room to move around, less hazards, great xp/aaxp and plenty to pull.<br />
<br />
Then again I would suggest you start groups in storms at the northeast corner so that you can make headway on getting quest flagged for tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have only been to storms once, but exp seemed pretty similar to PoV, any 2nd tier pop zone rocks for exp, if you get get a group in there your gold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, it seems like he's asking for solo advice..I don't think you group at the PoJ prisoners much at 59 :p<br />
<br />
If you do want solo advice, I'd have to say the CY in PoD is good. Easy kills, best exp in tier 1 other than some extreme PoN soloing. They hit hard enough to keep things interesting, but Stoicisim and KM are more than enough to keep you alive.</div></div><hr />
