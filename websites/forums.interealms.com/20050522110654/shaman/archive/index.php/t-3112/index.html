<br />
<br />
                       For those of you with a little free time, you might want to log into Test and try out the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
                       We?ve got the functionality in. Now we need your feedback and bug reports.<br />
<br />
                       If you see something broken or if you have an idea for an improvement, you can send them to the Dev Corner (or use<br />
                       /bug for bugs).<br />
<br />
                       Thanks for helping us out. We hope you like it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice. :) Might have to wander over and check it out, long as the locals dont get their panties in a bundle over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Minng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll have to remember to starch my panties before logging in.  My best advice for avoiding conflict with &quot;testies&quot; this weekend would be to work up 3 plat or so before going to the bazaar, so you can buy your trader's satchel.  The number of lvl 1's there begging for plat would try anyone's patience.<br />
<br />
Both the zone and the server have been having some stability problems so you'll need some patience of your own too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would try, but everytime I've tried to log onto Test since kunark came out I've crashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can wait til the interface goes live to try it out. And I dont beg. So, do you call us 'proddies', Minng?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was bored this morning so...<br />
<br />
I didn't set myself up as a merchant, didn't want to bother trying to get the plat together to buy a satchel :) I did do a bit of browsing and it is pretty nice.<br />
<br />
/bazaar brings up an interface where you can search by race, class, slot, primary stat and seller. You can sort your results by price, name or seller. In other words, it's really easy to use.<br />
<br />
Finding those people selling stuff is another matter entirely :) There's no way to identify which &quot;tent&quot; the seller is at, you just have to wander around and look for them. The name alteration that happens is you become &quot;Trader &lt;Name&gt;&quot;. <br />
<br />
Another thing I noticed was guild tags. They are now below names on Test. I don't know when that happened or if it's just going to remain a test thing but I don't remember it from the last time I was on the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hmmm....sooo if i happened to have like 8 trader bags in my bank ....and i went selling in bazar...that means all those trader bags with stuff in them would be up for grabs?<br />
<br />
what if i only wanted to sell &quot;some&quot; stuff in my bank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hahaha.  The zone crashed on test...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Smasherr, one way you could not sell the stuff would be to set the price to 500 times what its worth, or you could buy a 10 slot bag from your local tailor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm sure you have to designate the item and price for that item, so just carrying the item in a satchel is not going to mean people will be able to buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rathelon is correct.  You have to physically set a price on an item for it to be up for sale.  Other stuff in your trader satchel is not shown, it is just that the item has to be in a trader satchel and not some other type of bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you're paranoid about Trader Satchels (for good reason I agree), there are toolboxes available in Thurgadin that are dirt cheap and hold 10 giant items.  I wish I could remember the name of them, because I'll be replacing about 20 trader satchels with them pretty soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Someone on another board already tested it, and reported that items in traders satchels in your bank are not available for sale.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">From the instructions I read you have to go stand in a stall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ummm..if peopel will leave thier comps on, won;t that just hog up bandwith?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes, to some extent. But I don't think you'll find limited bandwidth is the cause of many lag problems when playing EQ.<br />
<br />
The actual bandwidth used by EQ is quite low (it must be as you can play over a 28.8 modem). Lag is caused by high latency in the connection, which is a different issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">wow this is sweet. i wonder why i never heard of this. thank for im hitting a level where i can hit some good raids and good loot ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The 10-slot toolboxes aren't sold in Thurgadin unless a players sold one to a merchant.  They are called Deluxe Toolboxes and are sold by the gnomes in the pirate camp in Iceclad (they were put in for making the the gnome tinkered Watchman armor, which requires more than 8 slots to make.)  Cheap and easy way to stock up on 10-slot containers, provided you have the Velious expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Minng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I do, at least in my own thinking, use the term &quot;proddie&quot;.  However, I don't really hold any malice or negative connotation with the term.  I also think it's prefectly reasonable that since I classify a group of folks as &quot;proddies&quot; that I myself could be classified as a &quot;testie&quot;, in fact it's funny.  As another testie put it in one of those proddie/vs/testie threads &quot;every server has it's *******s&quot; (or something like that, sorry Malakie) we've got plenty of them.  The great thing about Test is that I can pretty much keep track of them, due to the lower overall population.<br />
<br />
In any case, the bazaar is looking pretty good; though there have been some stability issues and continue to be as far as I know.  I just hope I can get Minng outta there in time for my raid tonight =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Big problem I can foresee... limited stalls, large population.  Some people may very well leave an alt account on a second computer in Trade status 24/7, simply to 'reserve' a stall...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">From what I've seen on test you can easily &quot;cram&quot; a number of people into a stall so it's not that limited. <br />
<br />
As for people leaving their pc's on 24/7 they'll only do that if they have something to sell, and their ISP allows long continuous connection. In the UK most of the dial up ISPs either force you to re-dial every two hours or prohibit excessive contiuous connections for things like MP3 sharing. So I presume this would fall into that category.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest problem will be how many people the zone as a whole can support. if you've got a hundred people selling and another hundered trying to buy stuff, it may collapse under the stress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I logged in to check out the bazaar last night.<br />
ran around and killed enough stuff with a newbie to get my 1pp 3gp for a satchel.  Took the spires to the moon.  Zoned into the bazaar.  I typed /bazaar to bring up the Interface.<br />
<br />
Then tried to sort for shaman items.<br />
and promptly crashed to the desktop.<br />

<br />
Just by your very usage of the term you are implying a negative connotation, because you are separating yourself from another group of people. You know it's a negative term, whether you admit it to yourself or not. At the very least, you come off a bit arrogant...at the worst, well...<br />
<br />
You and every other player on test is no different than those of us who play on other servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
silliest thing I've ever heard.  If I call someone a brunette because they have brown hair I am seperating myself from them, but there are no negative conotations.  Or I call myself christian, etc. etc. etc.  Stupid argument, why jump on him for calling himself a testie...Troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I found it funny while playing on Test, the &quot;regular&quot; test players seemed so intruded by all the people trying out the new UI.   Last time I saw, I pay the same amount each month as they do.  It's not like I was getting something for free while they are paying for it.<br />
<br />
...but, on to the subject.  I disliked the selling aspect of the Bazaar.  I originally thought there were NPC's you gave a bag with items to sell.  I didn't realize I had to stand for god knows how long, in the same spot to sell something.  When I'm online, I want to play, not stand around.  I don't have 2 comps, so I can't use a mule to do the selling, while I do more important stuff.   At least with &quot;auction chat&quot; I can run around doing things productive.  It is, however, an easy setup to use.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, the search engine for buying items, is extremely nice and useful.  The bazaar interface is definately more buyer friendly than seller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Apparently you arent following, Vandal. And I'm not trolling, I just think this label is ignorant.<br />
<br />
Test players arent different from players on any other server. We all pay the same money to play, and are given equal access to any server we want to play on, at any given time we wish to play on them. <br />
<br />
'Proddies' is a term used to refer to any player from another server other than test meant to imply players who have it easy because they dont have to deal with bugs, frequent server outages, player wipes, item loss etc. Thereby implying that 'Testies' are superior because they have more hardships to deal with than 'proddies'. Minng knows it's not a term of endearment, he just chooses to tell himself he doesnt use it that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It's foolish to take the attitudes of some as a representation of the entire server.  Just as it's foolish for some from test to label everyone from live based on the actions of a few.  I have faith that anyone from live serious about testing the interface would not troll around the server sending random /tells &quot;*** would you have a 60 on test&quot;.  Every server has it's &quot;bad apples&quot; and unfortunatally test is no exception.  The server has been very unstable for 1.5 months or better, causing us to not be able to raid anything of any significance.  That is most likely the cause of the attitude your receiving.  I'm not giving an excuse, simply a reason for it.<br />
<br />
Proddie is used to describe an attitude, not where you play.  It's very likly that the people running around test calling people proddies are more deserving of the title than the ones they accuse.  Most avoid the lower lvl zones on patch day, run anon or /role, and have better things to do than really care who's logged in and where they play.<br />
<br />
The interface still has some bugs.  It hard locks one of my boxes and lags the other severly.  The icons will take some getting used to and for me the display seems very crowded at anything under 1024x768.  To VI's credit they have been making improments in it every day, and from the first day till now it's coming along pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">/me thinks &quot;Proddie&quot; and &quot;Teste&quot; work just fine.  Just consider them shorthand for &quot;People on production or test servers who routinely deal with and/or are addicted and obnoxious people.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Minng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The point I'm trying to get across is that there is a difference, it's just insignificant.  If I knew the server you came from I could call you a Xevvie or whatever.  In the end it really doesn't matter.  I kinda like the hair color analogy.  By all means come to test and try out things, it's what the server's there for.  There are people that think they're superior for playing on Test, and there are visitors that think they're better for playing wherever they do.  In the end they're the kinda people that are really hard to make see reason anyway.  Best to have another beer and laugh it off.<br />
<br />
We may be crazy for playing here, but it's got it's advantages.  Not better, just different.  There are some that'll come off with the attitude that we testes (it's even better without the i) are doing the rest of everybody some big favor, that's bull.  We like it here, you like it there; it's all good.  If we didn't like it here, we'd move.<br />
<br />
On Topic:  There were a couple of days there where they /bazaar query function worked (okay, maybe it was just 1 day) so I'm confident they'll get that working before it goes live.  One thing I haven't seen is any way to query for spells, which happens to be the big thing I'm shopping for at the mo.  If you think it'd be handy to be able to do so, drop a /feedback should you come over to try it out.<br />
<br />
G'luck all, hope any visits you make to Test are pleasant =)<br />

For far too da.mn long blue and red servers have served as live beta's while Test server chugged along with half the population and twice the rare spawns.<br />
<br />
Now all of a sudden Test server is being used to TEST something and they act like they're getting put out.<br />
