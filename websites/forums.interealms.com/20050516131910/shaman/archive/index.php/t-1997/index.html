<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After many a dead vampyre, we finally got the named to drop Everlasting Breath.<br />
<br />
I rolled a 9.  But, it was not low enough to lose, as the other bear rolled a 6.  So Congrats me on Everlasting Breath!<br />
<br />
I'm excited and sit down to scribe the spell.<br />
<br />
And get the following message:<br />
<br />
&quot;Your class/race/deity cannot use this item.&quot;<br />
<br />
No!  Say it isn't so!<br />
<br />
The spell does still show class as druid, and races as druid races.  My understanding was that regardless I would still be able to scribe it.<br />
<br />
I petitioned, and the guide was no help.  Did not know if it was a bug, or worse yet, a fix.<br />
<br />
Anyone know anything about this?  <br />

I did a bug report, but have zero faith in that being read in a timely manner.<br />

You could try posting it here in the Developers Corner (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Developer|APO|s+Corner&amp;number=1&amp;DaysPrune=20&amp;LastLogin=)</div></div><hr />

Well in the 30 or so times i've kiled him he's never once droped a non-cash item, always a gem or emerald ring or somethign.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd say petition and see if the GM can give you another one, maybe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the links folks!  I sent a report of the problem to the Developer's Board.  <br />
<br />
After reading random sets of rules, this was the link I ended up at:<br />

So yes there is a way to &quot;reach&quot; VI.  You are not able to post a topic on the message board that is viewable by the public.   But you are able to send a message, which if it is deemed worthy/informative/something they can handle they will post for you and respond to.   This one-sided method of communication is frustrating, although I still hold out some hope that it will yield results. <br />
<br />
I have not yet heard back from them.   The scroll remains in my inventory, and remains unscribable.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else looted one since the last patch? <br />
<br />
And yes, Everlasting Breath, at least, is not just a legend. <br />
