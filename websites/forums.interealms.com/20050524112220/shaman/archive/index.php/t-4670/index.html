<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just looking at the new cleric yaulp. The clerics don't think it makes up for losing their dominance in healing and lack of flexibility and they're probably right. However I was thinking how much i'd like that spell.<br />
<br />
In theory we have a bunch of combat enhancing spells that I don't think i've ever cast. Plus we also have cannibalization which is something we can cast to increase our mana regen and let us stand and fight a bit more frequently.<br />
<br />
Think we've got any chance of getting those spells combined in some way? Or at least looked at for effectiveness. It would be very nice if you could make a case for it being worth your while to cast your combat / mana-regen buff and mix it up. Whereas at the moment a shaman probably should be sitting and medding most of the time if you want peak efficiency. Since our melee DPS probably doesn't make up for the enhanced mana / health regen of sitting.<br />
<br />
Perhaps druids got the better heal spell because they're actually going to make shaman's and clerics &quot;fighting priests&quot; like it said on the box.<br />
<br />
I'd love to be able to mix it up without feeling i'm reducing the group efficiency. In fact i'd happily trade that 2K heal for it. I'd love to hear a melee say,<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddamn Kireiina, why are you sitting? Get in here and help.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nitsujlak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Solo playing 1-34 i tanked most of the time, 34-45 i root rotted or pet kited, and then from 45+ whenever i solo'd i tanked the mobs. <br />
<br />
A shaman is a war priest already is what im getting to. Well most are.... some misinformed people still just assume since a shaman is a wis caster that thats all the matters. <br />
<br />
I about laughed my self to death when i met a shaman twink only level 10 with 2 velium wis rings, split paw gloves, gator legs, ect ect. <br />
<br />
Anyways im rambling again... point is, shaman are war priests. Especially solo. In groups 1-30 i melee'd some off and on, 30+ though i rarely meleed in groups.. and after 50 i would canni dance, slow mobs, epic dot and jbb when i was free of anything else i needed to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When soloing I love tanking the foe. I was stating how much I want to be able to tank hill giants and all the druids in guild are laughing at me. However even there I'm mostly tanking so I can use dogdog. If I didn't have him then root rotting would be massively more efficient.<br />
<br />
However I am talking about in groups. I have not yet been in a group where I have felt I can stand up and wack the foe without becoming (more) of a limiter on the groups performance. Dogdog gets to fight, since someone else can keep the mob from eating him, but I don't.<br />
<br />
Hm, let's see, perhaps an example.<br />
<br />
Spell: Fury of the North (&lt;- barb and proud)<br />
+ATK<br />
+ damage bonus<br />
+6 mana per tick.<br />
No meditation or regeneration for 4 tick duration.<br />
<br />
Balance is tricky, but check how it works. I do a cast of canni to balance out my regen spell. Then I cast this. At this point there's no point in sitting, no party will expect me to. What's more I add some party DPS by being up on my feet and stabbing.<br />
<br />
Not sure how to add the damage bonus. Haste or stat bonuses are either meaningless or unbalancing since we have out own. Ideally i'd like to see either a chance at dual wield or a +X primary hand damage bonus so our average damage goes up a bit. Hitting for 1 sort of sucks.<br />
<br />
Doesn't really change our soloing so much. It's dogdog and dots that do most of the damage anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nitsujlak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">we do have a small, usually underused fury type line. Fleeting Fury and Frenzy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did mention that we have melee buff's. I also mentioned i've never cast them. Perhaps i've been missing out.<br />
<br />
Rage: Level 49<br />
+Dex, +Str, +Agi by about 50 points<br />
+18 AC<br />
<br />
Sorry VI. 18 AC isn't going to make us a viable tank and everyone (who isn't hitting the stat caps) knows that stat buffs have a marginal value in melee output. The end result is my time is better spent medding (sigh).<br />
<br />
That whole spell line is not even worth buying, let alone actually casting. It was once, apparently, and was nerfed into utter pointlessness. Which is a shame, cause I love the concept.<br />
<br />
Now if Rage did what Rabid bear does now and Rabid bear was pumped to make it worthwhile we're talking. Although I should probably still be medding.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Shaman don't need more stat buffs. We're all big beefy races (barring the weedy little lizards) with lots of stat buffs up to and including Avatar (which is mostly useful because of the +ATK buff anyway).<br />
<br />
+damage on my sample spell could also be acheived by putting a proc in though. It would be sort of cool to be proccing something nasty. The clerics get a +140DD now, perhaps an 80 for us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nitsujlak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh well its been a while for me. Ive just started back only recently. <br />
<br />
I call myself (well all 3 of the shaman i have played) Battle Shaman in that i get the best ratio weapon i can find, hp jewelry, and usually a haste item if i can get ahold of one (fungi too when talking about my first char past level 52 and then my second char from level 1... but my third char started from square one iwht nothing on him so he wont be getting a fungi until FAR in the future heh) <br />
<br />
Anyways i think i was misreading your posts (easy to do when you are half awake heh) <br />
<br />
Pre- level 30 even untwinked we can melee &quot;ok&quot; and as matter of fact we sort of have to... since we all know shammies are hell from 20-34. :o And after i got my epic i meleed a lot too in groups.. but that was just becuase i wanted to show off hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We have cannibalize. We are warrior priests. We standup to monsters that make warriors run screaming for their mamas. Dragons, giants, mighty apes, and treacherous snakes to name a few.<br />
<br />
Well anyway... the idea of tweaking and extending the Fury line has been mentioned frequently in the past. Seems to make sense to me. Would be great if they added something like &quot;Thunderous Fury&quot; 30 sec buff, gave double attack and 50 ATK Level 53. Probably be too over-powered, but hey they seem intent on giving us CH too. :D <br />
<br />
Also, the rage line originally gave you boosted regen, but drained your mana at the same time. Got changed to an ac/stat buffer some time after Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It was once, apparently, and was nerfed into utter pointlessness. <br />
<br />
Do you know what rage line used to do?  It was kinda cool but much more pointless than it is now.  It used to do all that and add like 15 hp/tic regen at the cost of all your mana, down to the last drop, but if you had no mana it would still stay up and you'd get the regen anyway.  Problem with that is, we aren't good melees and even that much regen isn't going to make us do enuf damage thru pure melee.  <br />
<br />
Now that with rabid bear might be kinda kewl, but honestly I'd rather have the 15 minute +50ish ac (plus 75 str dex agil) buff from Voice of the Berserker than the spell it used to be.  <br />
<br />
The AC makes a difference for cheap (1 mana) casting cost, while after 24 seconds I can still resume my duties as a caster.  That's a big difference from how it used to be.  It was all or nothing back then.  Either yer a melee or a caster.  Now I can get the stat/ac benefit of the self buff and still be a caster.  Even with rabid bear activated, I'm still a more effective caster than I am an effective melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your pet is your melee. He gets up and tries with all his doggie might to might the hiney of the evil mobbies. That's the best you'll probably ever get until you ding Rabid Bear (then go primal on them yo~).<br />
<br />
Clerics could get some melee... but then why do we have Paladin's again?<br />
<br />
And if casting that spell turns off all your regen, it'll probably never get used. Without your 30-40 hp a tick regen you'd be a pretty ordinary tank.<br />
<br />
I personally really like that idea someone keeps spreading around about weapon/proc buffs. Casting a &quot;serpent&quot; buff on someone and giving them a poison proc with that +atk or something. It'll probably end up going to the BSTs though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I love the image of warrior priests. But, reality check, our melee sucks. In a group where a real melee exists we are contributing the most to the party when we are on our butts. Because this way we get more health to canni away and mana to cast with.<br />
<br />
The boosted attack, draining mana doesn't work for this reason. If we turned outselves into (slightly) better melee's at the cost of being able to cast less spells we are reducing the groups effectiveness.<br />
<br />
An AC bonus is pointless in this context. If the main thing a shaman brings to a group is his tanking ability then the group is really screwed up.<br />
<br />
And I don't want a pet fighting for me, i'd be a BL (or any pet clas) if that turned me on. Nor do I need more buffs to cast on others.<br />
<br />
Look at the design of the cleric spell. It's designed to make it viable for a cleric to melee in an XP group without getting yelled / laughed at for killing the parties effectiveness.  I'd love to have something like that.<br />
<br />
As to why my sample spell removed meditation and regen (this is natural btw, not spell or item) is that these are the reasons you are sitting. If the spell just gave a mana bonus you'd cast it and sit. It should give a mana bonus instead of sitting.<br />
<br />
Anyway, revised version time<br />
<br />
Rabid Fury:<br />
+ATK<br />
+Mana (1)<br />
+Proc (2)<br />
starving (3)<br />
<br />
(1) Mana equal to what we woud get from sitting med in that time frame plus a bonus to cover the casting cost. Which means cast this spell and you are recovering mana as if you were sitting.<br />
<br />
(2) A small DD to make up for the shaman's low DPS. Clerics have gotten a 140 point unresistable DD via their new summoned hammer.<br />
<br />
(3) I believe the starving state in EQ means you don't regenerate mana or hitpoints? This would be the perfect thing. Note that our regen spell, regen items, the mana regen from this spell and FT items should still work. The main aim is *there's no point in sitting*.<br />
<br />
End result: Shaman can get up an melee (poorly) without screwing the groups efficiency. Doesn't really make us much stronger soloists either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ah, and some of you may not have seen the new cleric spells. There's a summoned hammer with a superb ratio, undead bane and 140 point unresistable proc to go with it.<br />
<br />
But this is the interesting one.<br />

Interesting concept. I think it's going to fail though, because you'll still cast it and then sit down to get max mana. So expect to see yaulp-dancing coming to an xp group near you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I must admit that I am sure I picked shaman because somewhere in the book I read that they are a fighting healer.  No whilst I admit I can tank pretty well my melee is pretty pathetic.  I hope they at some point shift us to a better damage table and maybe give us a limited double attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Clerics have been getting stuff like that because Shaman like us are putting them out of a job.<br />
<br />
Yaulp dancing sounds like a lot of work for an effective 4 mana a tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yaulp-Dancing may be a lot of work for 4 mana a tick, but shaman used to dance for less than that! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Forget the whole idea of new spells for melee effects on Shammy's.  We suck at melee.  If you want us more effective in this area, we need to get off our current attack table and onto one that's got less whiffs.  I'm maxed on mob poking and I still melee like my Grandma fighting with her eyes closed!  New spells would only make us whiff HARDER or FASTER and what's the use in that?<br />
<br />
Change our table!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmm, a spell that would change the attack table for a limited duration, with some negative effects tagged on (no casting or no mana regeneration while that buff is up), now that would be an interesting spell line if balanced properly!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It was kinda cool but much more pointless than it is now<br />
- Old Rage line owned. Snap on Funguy Tunic, cannibalize 2-3 shots, pull mob with slow, Rage, JBB all the way. Funguy + regen from Rage was way enough to keep your HPs always maxed. Non stop XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmmm changing melee table because of a spell?  That'd be kinda like making a spell that changed your class temporarily.  Verant is all about making changes if they don't cascade much AND don't take too much programmer time (EQ2 and PoP, doncha know?).  This would violate both principles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Rabid bear melee is actually suprisingly good, I never really took it seriously until I accidently ks'd a 60 warrior swinging epics =P<br />

proc does 75-150 (random on each proc) damage and cant not be resisted. So between this hammer and yaulp thats a nice 100 increase to dex for them so it should proc a lot.<br />
<br />
So with this hammer, yaulpV and the lower cost on their hammer pet, clerics are getting some nice upgrades. Which I think wll be very nice compensation for the druid/shaman heals that could be going live</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">/sigh<br />
I prefer a small upgrade in my melee damage output than a lame 2k 10 sec cast heal ..<br />
Even with a rightousness (20 22 hammer proc a 100dd+stun), a shield of holy vigor (41% haste), chanter haste, bard haste/attack buff, ranger attack buff and 1hb 200 I miss way too much..<br />
If only my &quot;wuddaru tried to hit you but miss&quot; spam message could lag to death the mob...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'd like it if we were better at melee, but I don't think that's going to happen. We are perceived as a strong class and very strong soloers, there's not going to be much support for a sizable melee upgrade. Love to be wrong of course.<br />
<br />
A more limited request, and the one i'm making, is to make the rage line less pointless. And to give me an excuse to go and melee badly rather than constantly med. Not an increase in solo power, not much of an increase in group DPS, but a reduction in how much time is spent medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">What level are you Kireiina?<br />
Why do you think added AC is pointless?  <br />
None of the other oracles on this board feel that way.  We feel added AC helps you do your job while taking fewer hits, losing less hps, and having a better grip on things in general.  <br />
<br />
At the same time I'd take Yaulp V over VotB any day.  But honestly without popping rabid bear, my melee is so pathetic I can JBB for much more damage.  Why exactly would I want to whiff when I can land bracer nukes or Torrents or dots?  I would want Yaulp V because I never sit to med anyway, and 10 FT is awfully nice and stacks with my canni.<br />
<br />
Unless they move us to a hybrid dmg table it's not gonna get any better.   Somehow I doubt that will happen.  I would like to lead a crusade to get the duration/re-use time on Rabid Bear skill made a bit more reasonable however.  It's absolutely silly right now.  <br />
<br />
Ready for a &quot;Land Story?&quot;  I was hunting in PoG with a 59 necro and 60 cleric couple nights ago.  I was pulling for some reason and I had some bad luck and made a terrible pull.  I got a named horse (can't be slowed, or at least I couldn't slow it) and two other regular PoG animal mobs.  I slowed the other two mobs, accepted a heal from the cleric, and popped rabid bear to tank the named horse while the necro fear kited the other two mobs.  I used my rabid bear to make myself into a &quot;melee&quot; and the cleric timed CH's on me just like I was a warrior or something!  It was really neat, and my melee combined with some necro dots and necro pet damage was enuf to kill the beast before we all ran outta mana.  The other two critters were easily dispatched after that.  Anyway neat story cuz i got to be a melee, and we turned a bad pull (that many raids would wipe to) into a rousing victory!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just some extra stuff off the cleric board. The first is that the cleric summoned hammer (dumb idea though, it should add a proc to what you wield) procs very frequently adding significant DPS. They're also going to experiment with giving clerics block, which ties in with the new shield changes to give them increased defence. They've also increased the cleric pet so it's a worthwhile DoT (they say).<br />
<br />
The clerics hate it, I want it. And the day I get out-melee'd by a cleric is the day I seriously consider changing classes.<br />
<br />
This is taken from a posting by a developer btw, so a bit more than rumor. It was also mentioned that there will be something more coming to give them group desirability. No idea what that will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vallya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">(ooc)<br />
Bleh. I must be missing something here. I can't get enough of the 30ac I'm getting from my gimpy Rage spell.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt;<br />
Back in my cleric days, everyone was complaining about the mind numbing med and heal cycle. Threads wishing for better melee skill were common.  For good or ill, it looks like they are getting their wish. Having lived the med/heal life, I think they deserve a little variety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Personally, I would love to see a bit of an upgrade to our melee.  But it isn't going to happen... as stated many times here on the board, we are *defensive* soloers. <br />
<br />
If you want to do decent damage in melee and cast spells you should have started a paladin (or another hybrid).  They have so many advantanges over us in melee it isn't even funny.   And that's how it should be.<br />
<br />
tanking &lt;&gt; damage dealing.  I think most of us get a bigger kick out of telling the main tank &quot;it's ok, I got it - you get the other one&quot; instead of just being another melee that has to /assist.  I like to tank mobs to keep them occupied, not to kill them.  They spend so much time focused on me they don't notice dogdog (or the rogue, or the monk, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">rage is GREAT. callin 18 ac useless? what you wearin for your BP? would you trade it for something with 18 less ac? i thought not...<br />
<br />
sure our melee isn't that great. but don't expect a cleric, even with Yaulp 5 and the Hammer of Cleric Soloing to go out and get that many more hits than we do. even with those nice bonuses i would laugh very hard if i were in an exp group or raid and saw the cleric swinging.<br />
<br />
What i suspect it will make a huge difference for is those clerics who got left out of an exp group (because shaman and druids are now that much more capable of replacing them) and have to go it all alone. Clerics do NOT get any pet to help their dps, so they really need some serious melee enhancement in order to be able to fight without a tank. <br />
<br />
you are a pure caster. no matter what they do for us you will ALWAYS help your group out more by having plenty of mana than you possibly could by waving your hammer or trying to poke mobs with that shiny feathered stick. sorry but that's the way it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Rage, Fury.... gee, those sound like &quot;offensive&quot; upgrades, things that make us able to attack the foe. The fact the only thing they give is some defensive AC proves they're broken.<br />
<br />
Should you actually want to melee while in a group the AC is meaningless unless something goes wrong. Something like all the real warriors being dead or you nuking like a wizard. At which point I really doubt 18AC makes any significant difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Tanking priests..yes. Tanking things that make warriors run screaming to their mamas? Maybe the elf ones, but for the rest that's just wishful thinking Darjeeling.<br />
<br />
I'm extremely satisfied with my tanking ability. I'm definately not smoking what you are kireiina, if I wanted to be a better meleer i'd log in...<br />
<br />
wait for it..<br />
<br />
A melee class character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">You missed the point. I said &quot;significant&quot;. Sure I'll take AC if I can get it. Do I believe that +/- 18AC at level 50 will be a significant difference? No I do not.<br />
<br />
Likewise everyone who said &quot;make a melee character&quot; has missed the point. I'm happy being a shaman. Although I also have a monk on another server for when I want to do damage directly.<br />
<br />
My point, stated simply, is twofold.<br />
<br />
1) I would like a spell that let me do things other than med constantly. I would like the *guilt* of going up and having a whiff at the foe be reduced.<br />
<br />
2) Clerics are getting melee enhancements, which they hate. We are moving closer to being primary healers, which I hate.<br />
<br />
The clerics originally asked for &quot;standing meditation&quot;. They wanted to be up and active while getting the advantages of the meditation skill. I believe &quot;yaulp&quot; is an attempt to do that for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It would seem that shamans are a well-rounded, well-balanced class.  However, shamans seem to be well-rounded, well-balanced class in the Kunark-way, since shamans haven't gotten any practical upgrades to either damage output, offensive skills or defensive skills, or healing, since Kunark.  In a game increasingly designed around chain-CHealing clerics, Torpor/Chloro/Nature's Touch is still the way to go for druids and shamans.  Dodge is still chugging at 75, defense and offense at 200.  Epic/JBB are still the respectable source of damage.<br />

We're a class without a clear class-defining ability.  If anything, I think it's the mana regeneration that sets shamans apart from the rest.  However, even mana regen is largely from Kunark-era.  Torpor sounds good for mana regeneration, but it's 300hp/tick sounds a bit weak in an era with mobs that quad over 900 points.  Does the mana regeneration from Torpor make chain-Chloroblast a viable mode of healing?  In general, does Torpor heal enough that it can keep you alive and allow you to regenerate enough mana at the same time when you're being pounded on by Velious/Luclin-era mobs, or do you need to augment it by chloroblast/superior heal and hope you won't run out of mana?  Yeah, you can solo Velious dragons, but so can shadowknights nowadays too, for example.<br />
<br />
Clerics are getting big improvements in their melee-ability.  Great, all the more power for them.  We're possibly getting a partial Complete Heal, which personally I'm not too keen about.  However, clerics are still the de-facto healers of Everquest, but it seems that shamans are losing the place as the de-facto battle priests, what with proposed Block skill for clerics and all.  Will there be anything to compensate in the future?  Or have we truly been the utterly balanced class from Kunark era that absolutely needs no upgrades whatsoever because our Kunark-selves were already good enough for Velious and Luclin era, and other classes need massive upgrades in all areas in order to keep up with us, and anyone who questions that is a whiner?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A modern cleric can often get KEI (it lasts so long), has a self mana buff, and has this new yaulp. I don't think it's a design intent that the yaulp is going to be used (only?) as a mana regen buff but it's going to happen. Clerics have already noted that when on a horse you just click the spell gem every 4 ticks. This is in addition to the existence of FT items.<br />
<br />
The average mana regen is much higher than it used to be. <br />
<br />
I just hold out hope that the reason shaman's got a 2K heal is because they are considering us for some of the melee upgrades the clerics get. Although it's more likely that we get the 2K because slow is so good the shaman class is considered to need nothing more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that's very fair.  When I'm the only healer in a group, I spend less time running about dotting and nuking, I watch group mate's health bars closely and I'm quick to duck out of a long cast to throw a heal when needed.<br />
<br />
These improvements are to add to a cleric's arsenal, not supplant it.  It's not like they'll lose the ability to be an effective group healer just because they gain the ability to do some damage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Disclaimer: pardon my obvious newbieness here, but I've a simple question about something I'd dearly like to be clarified.<br />
<br />
A lot of the shamans here don't like the idea of us getting a partial Complete Heal, and I understand and agree with this sentiment completely.  However, it seems that a lot of you do not like the idea of an improved Torpor-like spell at 60th level, either.   In the scenarios that I've run in my head, it'd be a great replacement of the shaman 3K Cheal, but maybe I've been missing something all along; this is something I'd like clarified, why do you not like the idea.<br />
<br />
Here's my reasoning why it'd be a decent replacement, while the druids should get the 3K partial CHeal:<br />
<br />
Torpor/Canni IV+V is the primary method of mana-regeneration at 60th level.  1200 to 1800 hitpoints of regeneration over 24 to 36 seconds will yield a respectable amount of mana, and it's about the limit that a sane shaman would cannibalize his health to before casting Torpor.  However, Torpor's 300hp/tick heal is now less useful than it was in the past, because the mobs can hit harder than that even hit slow, and thus you'd need to augment the healing with Chloroblast.  All in all, it doesn't seem too mana-efficient, and the mana-regeneration suffers.  With the added tasks of slowing/debuffing/buffing/doting(not with DoT stacking..)/nuking/rooting/whatever, the mana-drain is pretty heavy on the shaman, so decent mana-regen would seem important.<br />
<br />
If there were to be added a new Torpor-like spell that healed anywhere from 575 (if druids had 1950 point heal) to 850 (if druids had 2925 point heal) hitpoints per tick over 24 seconds, it would help mana-regeneration but not linearily; I would presume about 1.5 times the present Torpor-like mana-regen, at most, because of the limitations of Cannibalize spells.  However, it would allow you to survive some beating and regenerate mana at the same time without resorting to Chloroblast.  Though most usefulness such spell would give on raids though: it would lessen the effective damage taken by the tank or the enchanter (or whomever), thus allowing a bit more leeway in timing the cleric/druid Complete Heals.  It would give each three priest classes a non-redundant healing role in raids, so each would be equally wanted, and there'd be less competition.<br />
<br />
This, combined with other, non-healing related changes, would perhaps give shamans a good performance-boost.  Maybe add the melee- and tanking-ability of shamans, lower the resistances of our spells, add decent damage shields to our line of spells outside of potions; Or something along those lines - it's easy to overpower a class :)  Clerics+druids already are nuking/doting classes and have buffs that rival or exceed our own, so this would be good to keep in mind.    However, some other changes would be necessary in order to maintain a balanced shaman class ... and not just for shamans, but for both clerics and druids as well lest we become woefully underpowered with these new changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, as you can see I'm a thorough newbie, so if you more knowledgeable people would enlighten me I would be most appreciative :)<br />

What shaman is relying on the 18-24 AC from Rage/VoB to allow him to tank? The AC from those spells should be a drop in the bucket of your total AC. They are just more of a good thing. How is that bad again?<br />

Now they suddenly improve cleric melee, which just puts us farther behind. And the 2k heal isn't even all that amazing, i dont feel the need for it. Besides their new heal spells are enough to make up for this i believe. They get a group torpor-like spell without the neg. effects and its less mana per person! Its 1200 over 24 sec (for like 1000-1100 mana? whereas torpor cast 6 times would be 1200), almost an exact copy of torpor, but for the whole group. I'm usually pretty quiet about class changes but for some reason this one just pisses me off.

I won't lie and say I wouldn't like a cool yaulp spell or something similar, but clerics deserve something for them possibly being displaced out of xp groups if the new mini-CH's hit Live.

Why do you keep talking about sitting down? Show me a shaman post 51 who spends any significant time on their ass and i'll explain to them the value of the cannibalization skill.<br />

As for melee... well if a cleric can haste himself 50%, max his stats, add 120 attk, and so on, i'll start getting nervous. Would be nice if we could get a spear for nice melee damage too, but we'll see what happens in PoP.<br />
<br />
But, the point about melee is irrelevant in any case. Because of the JBB crutch (sorry oiksar). Until we can do more than 266/8 DPS with a hammer then there will be very few situations where there's not something more meaningful you could be doing. And no...it's not sitting on your ASS.<br />

They're going to absolutely own in HS vs the skellies/ghosts now, will be awesome to see them contribute more that way.<br />

As far as buffs go... I've got enough. As far as using what I've got and the benefit I get from it: you can bet your ass I'm using absolutely every possible stat/AC/HP buff I can cast when I'm soloing, and usually also when I'm grouped.

What you're saying is absurd. I have 977 ATK with 255 STR and 200 in my weapon skill (1HB, 2HB, and piercing). That's with no ATK buffs or effects. I can haste myself by 50%. If I'm feeling slick, I can Avatar myself too. At the same time, my DEX is over 200.<br />

I actually hear that from time to time.  XP grinding in Seb or Charasis or Chardok I can slow critters.  I'll cann between swings of my weapon.  Regen keeps me high.  I'll sit if needed between pulls.  I rarely get below 75% mana and don't feel guilty.  Only time I get lower is when I'm the primary source of crowd control and/or the main healer.  Folks I group with realize that swinging my maul can contribute up up to 60-80 damage per tick, whiffs factored in.  Cheaper to do that than to add a dot and then try to get the mana back.</div></div><hr />

Let us not forget the nice little Hammer of Judgment, a cleric-summoned no-drop/no-rent weapon.  It's a 14/18 (24/18 against undead) weapon with an very proc-happy (by Verant's deliberate design) effect that does up to 150 points of almost-impossible-to-resist damage on the target.  Sure, they cleric may not hit for as high damage as a shaman (The only difference in pure melee-skills that clerics have is the 25 lower weapon skill cap.  That translates into what, 75 less ATK overall?  That's what the 50ATK from Yaulp V is for) would with a similar ratio weapon but the proc more than compensates, moreso because you can proc even on misses. <br />
<br />
After adding that spell into the equation, keep in mind that this is a spell that will potentially be available to all 56th level clerics, and not just the chosen few like the shamans who've attained better weapons than the epic.  Bone of Bertoxxulous might come close as far as weapons go for shamans, but how many shamans actually have that weapon?<br />
<br />
Besides, if you Torpor yourself to keep yourself alive or to regen mana, you've effectively rooted and slowed yourself so your melee output is even lower.</div></div><hr />

No way this is true at 60.  Most mobs that a 60 shaman fights have enough defense abilities (AC, defense, parry, dodge, etc.) that your melee is &quot;whiff, whiff, whiff, 25, whiff, whiff&quot;.  Avatar slightly increases the melee damage output, but not by much.<br />
<br />
The problem is that shamans have melee skills designed when the highest mobs in the game were 50ish.  Rabid Bear is the only thing we have that modifies this.  So don't expect to be a warrior priest AND an oracle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i really hated that change :/<br />
<br />
it SHOULD add some melee skill of sorts, happily take my mana for it, it used to be an option, now it's just some miniavatar without atk, not to mention the annoying casting lockup they forgot to take out.<br />
dmg bonus would be nice, but then again, we still miss 8 out of 10 hits, so well, wouldnt help much alone.<br />
<br />
oh, and block=all classes, everyone using shields blocks, this isnt cleric specific.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Rage's Dex component doesn't stack with dex buffs.  I switched from Harness to Talisman+Str, and then use this.<br />
<br />
Rage is a nice low-mana decent-duration addition to our arsenal.   I use it to replace Shroud, Agi, and Dex buffs when I'm soloing.  100 mana about every 15-20 mins.   If I'm somewhere that I feel the psychological need to be buffed to the gills, then I'll use our standard buffs and then layer Rage on top.  It stacks with Shroud, Str, Agi.  Overall I end up with +100 Agi, +120ish Str, and the AC boost from Agi+Shroud+Rage is 40ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Let the clerics have something fun.<br />
<br />
For a VERY long time, well pretty much from the beginning, the cleric class has been singular and boring. There's nothing associated with the class that's &quot;fun&quot;. Think about how many &quot;fun&quot; spells you have as a shaman, even those you'd never use, but KNOW they are there... the clerics have none. Hell, they are the ONLY casters who don't have Invisibility, have you ANY idea how big a pain in the ass that is?<br />
<br />
As for cleric melee, it's just a bone thrown at them. Clerics have a lower weapons (maybe offense, I forgot) cap than we do, I think 175 or something like that. In most exp groups, clerics are ALREADY meleeing because they've got nothing to do. Have you ever seen a cleric using a Poison Wind Censor? I usually PA them.<br />
<br />
On a raid, a smart cleric would keep an eye on his mana before he even CONSIDERS to go melee. Procs are frickle, and clerics miss even more than we do. I think everyone can agree that Rabid Bear + good 2hb &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yalp V + cleric hammer? I can barely clock 40DPS on non-luclin mobs with rabid bear... at ~1300 ATK with a 48/42 weapon and max haste. How much better do you think a cleric can do?<br />
<br />
As for the mana regen from Yalp V... it costs 25 mana, and adds 40 (10 per tick, 4 ticks). That's +15 mana in 24 secs... which shaman in their right mind would be threatened by THAT?</div></div><hr />

But, the point about melee is irrelevant in any case. Because of the JBB crutch (sorry oiksar). Until we can do more than 266/8 DPS with a hammer then there will be very few situations where there's not something more meaningful you could be doing. And no...it's not sitting on your ASS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your right.  Its sitting on your horse!<br />
<br />
I saved a few K plat, sold my REIF and bought ELMER the uber horse (on sale for 8399).  One of the best equipment decisions I've made to date.  Although I greatly like the idea of being able to meele, the truth is playing like a tanking caster gets better results.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">just one more point:<br />
<br />
yaulp 5 is not going to keep any clerics from medding when they need mana.<br />
<br />
yaulp 5 generates a whopping 4 mana per tick (i heard somewhere that they actually dropped its casting cost making it net more like 7 mana per tick).<br />
<br />
meditate generates AT LEAST 20 mana per tick, not sure how it works out with med skill &gt; 200 so i will just assume it does nothing at all!<br />
<br />
most of the time even medding will not be enough to keep a cleric good for mana through constant pulls (if it is, either the puller is not pulling fast enough or there's a mage in the group :p), so there is NO WAY that meleeing with yaulp 5 can be considered a sustainable form of mana production. At best, it's enough to slightly reduce downtime when the cleric is FORCED to stand up (because he is soloing!)<br />
<br />
the correct way to use yaulp 5 (in a fast-exp group) is to &quot;yaulp dance&quot; standing up once every 24 seconds to pop yaulp5 and then sit down and med again. not as intensive as cannidancing but not as impressive a mana regen boost either ;)<br />
<br />
if someone in my group died because the cleric was too hammer-happy to med and went OOM... my group would be looking for another cleric.<br />
<br />
melee may be marginally more exciting then medding (although honestly that stab animation gets just as boring after a while), but for casters and priests it will never be more useful than a healthy mana bar.</div></div><hr />

I know clerics will want a compensation for our new heal, and it makes sense. But...(snip) And the 2k heal isn't even all that amazing, i dont feel the need for it. Besides their new heal spells are enough to make up for this i believe. They get a group torpor-like spell without the neg. effects and its less mana per person! Its 1200 over 24 sec (for like 1000-1100 mana? whereas torpor cast 6 times would be 1200), almost an exact copy of torpor, but for the whole group.<br />
<br />
First of all sparky, we already have Celestial Elixir. It was basically 150% the cost of torpor for no downsides.<br />
<br />
Second, Group CE is utter crap. If you actually think any cleric would want to spend nearly 1000 mana (it was lowered to 975 I believe) for something that doesn't even instantly heal the group, you have another thing coming.<br />
<br />
Third, 975 / 300 = 3.25 the mana cost of CE, not 6 times. Group spells are always less than 6x the cost. Group Torpor would be 3.25 x 200 = 650 mana were it ever made.<br />
<br />
Fourth, trade you our horrible group CE, our horrible raid-only heal (1600/525), our horrible upgrade to remedy (~975/400), all JUST for a right click damage item. Dot or DD I don't care. Ah yes, Hammer of the Sun. Sorry I guess I'm not l33t enough to get that. Shaman get to MQ an epic for free dot and jbb for &gt; 25 dps alone.<br />
<br />
Fourth, did I mention Group CE = teh suk?</div></div><hr />
