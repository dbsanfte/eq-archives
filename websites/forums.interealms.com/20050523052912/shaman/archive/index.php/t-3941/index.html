<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to find that site with all the info on Western Wastes but cannot find it for the life of me.  Anyone have the address?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Damn...that was the link I had written down - was hoping I just had it wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Didn't Juujuu have a great WW website?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Eh, dunno if Juu ever had a WW site.  He's probly on now, and I'll let him know of this thread in any case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think that link was to Jing's WW site.<br />
<br />
He said a long time ago he switched ISPs and didn't know why that link was still active.  I think...<br />
<br />
any plans to revive that Jing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I found something else, its not as good as the other site but maybe it could help you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">that site was incredible for info.  Hope whoever was hosting it, has it posted somewhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, the WW site was mine. I was on Qwest DSL, which migrated all their customers to MSN DSL which is quite possibly the worst DSL in the world. I'm switching to Earthlink in the next 2 weeks or so, and I will post the WW site up again. I'll post the new URL here when it goes up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I found that internet archive version too, but as far as I can tell, it's pretty much worthless. :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Unfortunately non of that Archive version works :(<br />

Jing....looking forward to you getting yours back up and running, for the meantime:<br />
<br />

<br />
seems to have most of the info I am looking for (infact, looks as though it was compiled from your site!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe if compiled means copied, ok. I don't care though, it's not like the WW site makes me any money, so steal all ya want from it. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately I can't start up my Earthlink DSL account until MSN pulls the plug on their DSL, which could take a few days. Then I have to wait for Earthlink to ship me out a new DSL modem before I actually have a decent connection. So I'm likely to be using *shudder* 56k for up to 2 weeks. I can probably upload the site on a 56k while I sleep, it's under 4 MB if I recall.</div></div><hr />
