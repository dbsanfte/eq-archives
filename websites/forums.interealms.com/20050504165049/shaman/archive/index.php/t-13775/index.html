<br />
So now to my question.<br />
<br />
Ive been stuck at 40 for almost 1.5 months. Everywhere i go exp is terrible. I mean everywhere. Douing Nobles, Echo Caverns, TM.<br />
<br />
Where should i hunt 40-49 for best exp. loot is not a problem i like being an anti-uber )<br />
<br />
thx for all the help!!<br />

<br />
You're not being patient enough.  Seriously, up till level 55 nobles are the best exp in the game, barring finding a tier2+ group in PoP.  And you say its slow?!?!?  When I was 40 I had to level up without KEI.  40 (and 45, and 50, and 51, 54, and 59) were all hell levels and were MEGA hard to get through.  You have it really easy now.  Just grin and bear it, grinding isn't the most fun thing to do.. alternatively, you could go to a dungeon, try Sol B or Lower Guk - the exp will be about the same but those zones are a ton of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solo'ed and duo'ed in Kaesora at 40. Having the Regent Symbol of Innoruuk helps ALOT in dungeons, but being a pale, scrawny barbarian, you can't use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can I suggest the Dreadlands? Many will puke at the thought of grinding in DL, but I rather enjoyed my time thru there with my shammy... probably mostly becuase from 38-49 I was all of about 2-3 groups... I solo'd the whole time &amp; went from 38-49 in about 3 solid days of grinding and a lot of kei's. The loot was half decent... each run to the nex for KEI I had about 100-200pp to deposit in the bank (including loots). <br />
<br />
Even if you group in DL the xp is very good with a decent group &amp; if grouping is your thing then head into KC at 45 &amp; get to 50-52 really fast, again with denet groups.<br />
<br />
GL &amp; have fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sirenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">gunthak gunthak gunthak<br />
<br />
in gunthak you can solo nicely on the beach till about 44 when things turn l blue<br />
<br />
then you can do the fort and its surroudings and then you can duo the town or go to dulaks<br />
<br />
id suggest being at least 45 for dulaks and bring a friend or 2<br />
<br />
if you can get a full group you can even take a boat)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd stick with Dreadlands. <br />
<br />
With a KEI, you can solo stuff there easy....and get your melee skills up easy.<br />
<br />
It'd be faster than grouping, easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">City of Mist.  Work on your epic while you're there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another vote for the Dreadlands.  It's not great experience per mob<br />
but the mobs abound.  Being an &quot;anti-uber&quot; you may not like depending<br />
on KEI; I however dislike grinding and if I need to drop 50p every three<br />
hours to double my kill rate, I'll do it without hesitating.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'd advise buffing yourself up, getting a KEI and racing<br />
(or getting a TL) to the DL.  Do levels 40, 41 and 42 in one or all of the<br />
three Yeti caves.  The mobs don't hit particularly hard, should give 2%<br />
apiece at level 40 and drop halfway decent platinum and flowers that<br />
sell OK.  See eqatlas' map of DL for locations.<br />
<br />
43 to 49 chill around KC, I prefer the southeast ruin myself.  DL's been<br />
pretty empty of late on Lanys with the Planes and LoY and whatnot.<br />
Pull, in this order: Cockatrices, Drovlargs, Spiders.  Avoid ravishing<br />
drovlargs.  If your defense is lagging, take the time to fight stuff toe to<br />
toe and let your pet nibble on it from behind.  It'll be a bit slower<br />
leveling but the melee skillups are worth it.  If your skills are<br />
satisfactory, pull with slow, sic pet with taunt on (sidenote: Keep your<br />
pet regen/hasted. When you get HoS give it to him as well.  If you have<br />
the clickable Jaundiced Bone pieces with strength and dexterity buffs,<br />
use them on pet.  If not, no big deal.  Also make sure pet is dual<br />
wielding).  Layer DoT's and let pet tank, rooting the mob if you pull too<br />
much aggro.<br />
<br />
This method netted me around 60% of a level per KEI I think.  Avoid<br />
groups unless they have a cleric, enchanter, high-damage melees and<br />
someone who knows how to chain pull.  Elsewise solo experience rates<br />
are better.<br />
<br />
When you hit 49 you'll have more options on places to hunt. BW, HK,<br />
PoJ or PoI groups perhaps.  Envenomed Bolt is a great DoT.  HoS is a<br />
great buff.  And so on.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you.  If you have other questions post 'em.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Braag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not sure if I'm too old school, but I spent most of my levels around 40 in EW, GD and TM.  I think around mid-40s, I headed over to TD for some Spiroc fun.  As I remember, the mobs were always plentiful and the XP was pretty good.  BTW, I did almost all of it soloing.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I highly recommend Shabby Fleabitten's Guide (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=5652&amp;highlight=shabby+fleabitten+guide).  Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">39-46 I hung out in Crystal Caverns.  I spent 39-40 killing orcs until I had enough faction to sell to the dwarfs there (everyone starts dubious), then switched to terrors/geos until 46.  There are 4 terrors around a broken bridge that are single pulls, cake if you slow, send pet and tank/dot.  There are also 2 more a little farther inside in the great hall.  Single pullable, same routine to kill.  Also if you can get the geo ramp, they are awesome till 46.  Single pulls, plenty to kill, super loot (named geos drop gems that sell for 15-190pp).  They do assist and run downhill when low on health, but if you start from the bottom of the ramp and work your way up you'll never have an issue with runner adds.  <br />
<br />
It was a nice relaxing time, vendors and bank in zone so you never had to run far for a bank run.  Also, the dwarfs act as guards so if you get in trouble, just hoof it to their town.  9 times out of 10 they'll kill whatever is beating on you before it kills you.  :)<br />
<br />
Once I hit 46, I went to City of Mist and did the 9 entrance mobs and 6 courtyard mobs (once I got a couple levels).  Stayed there till I hit 51, then did the gnomes in Echo Caverns till 52 (my current level).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd have to put in another vote for Gunthak.  I just went from 40-44 there in quite a nice amount of time.  Stuff there is very easy, all I really had to do was pull with malisement (if needed, not everything needed  it and you can get a sense of what does and what doesn't), send the dog dog, slow it, then DoT it, giving myself agro and meleeing it to death.  Fights are easy and I got 1-2% exp each kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I gotta go with Sirenna, Gunthak was great for me from 41-44. Good mobs, good loot, good exp. (keep yourself sowed, and watch for trains comming from the tunnel)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cortez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I soloed most of 40-45 in Nurga - experience seemed really good...but that was back in the day when those big spiders were in there - not sure what exp would be like now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Go to the city of mist<br />
XP at 40 there and esp if u can solo some stuff is GODLY.<br />
Your epic involves COM anyway might as well go there while u can get mad xp.<br />
<br />
Grab a kei before they nerf u and get 43 so u can get some more.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you hate soloing or hate undead then go to the dreadlands. You can also xp in GD or EW killing giants/dorfs (depends on what faction u need)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Go fight the gnome guards in echo caverns.  The xp in there rocks. there are 4 guards and 1 single ( harold the herald ) you can pull.  1% xp each mob.  You'll need to pull with root because you can't single pull the guards till 49.  <br />
<br />
Pull by rooting a guard.<br />
The other guard will come.<br />
Sick scooby on the guard that comes (give him a couple weapons)<br />
slow<br />
dot<br />
melee<br />
take on other guard same way.<br />
<br />
Move up to the left and rinse/repeat with the next 2 guards.<br />
<br />
Move up and pull harold the herald with a slow (stay up against left wall and get him just in your view, that way you don't get adds )  run back down to where you fought the second set of guards and follow the above.<br />
<br />
Move back down to first pull spot and med<br />
<br />
Any hp buffs you can get prior to going in will make this easier at lower levels, but you can easily get through the 40's in here.<br />
<br />
Also, close to zone if things go bad.  close to bank, vendors, kei, etc.  CR is very simple if necessary.<br />
<br />
You take a faction hit to the kingdom of above / below, but I've yet to find a place or read a post where this is a bad thing<br />
<br />
No loot, only pp so you won't fill your bags with junk.  <br />
<br />
It's a side path that is a dead end so you should never get trained<br />
<br />
Also, just beyond the path to the gnomes (going straight ahead as you enter the zone )  you'll find a camp with 4 bugs.  They are far enough apart that you can single pull them with slow and are also decent xp.  it's on the main path though so there is a slight potential for adds.<br />
<br />
The room outside the TM is also a pretty good spot to single pull but the named bug can spawn in there occassionally and he'll ruin your day<br />
<br />
Hope this info helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wooja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I soloed in the Overthere from 40-44.  Mobs were still giving 1% per kill at 44 with the troll racial penalty.  It is probably the most boring zone in the game in terms of aesthetics, but the mobs are plentiful and easy to kill.  I went out near the small pool of murky water straight out from the SF entrance, where mobs path all around.  It saved me the time of pulling, and when I didn&#8217;t want adds, I could avoid them pretty easily.  When I got an add, it was easy to slow it and root park until me and the dog got around to it.  It has been a while, so I don&#8217;t remember what spell combos I was using, but I was tanking and using a REIF.</div></div><hr />

Been going to gunthak to solo since early in my 39th year. Plant yourself at the Nadox lava-river zone. No trains, no adds, 2 pops which don't aggro when other attacked - all DB with ocnl yellow - and when *$#^ hits the fan - zone to safety.<br />
<br />
Started going into Dulak about 1/4 way into 40. Furthest ventured was a group of 3 (45 pal, 38 wiz and 40 sham-me) onto Stormwave. Cleared the boat, held for 2 cycles, then wiz had to log. Also, pick up any and all Shivs that drop here - Fido likes them as they make him a quick Alpha-Fido.<br />
Solo works ok here too - along tunnel to docks - pull with malaise, then either root or slow, &quot;go get 'em Fido&quot;, dot/dot, melee.<br />
<br />
Took me about 5-6 hours interrupted to get 40. <br />
