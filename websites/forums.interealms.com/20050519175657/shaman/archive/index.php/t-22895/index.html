<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have had a few requests to recompile my other thread about the ADD shaman where a interesting AA came to light concerning focus of abilities.<br />
<br />
So i would like to ask all the math freaks to please help, cause im not good at figuring this stuff out, please help us balance this AA proposal to something viable so we can request it if its actualy a solid idea. Again, i thought it was a neat idea, but im only doing this cause of the PM's i have gotten concerning it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, to start of let me recap what the idea is about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spirit focus is a proposed AA where basicly we would give up 1 ability for another. Example would be, we would active this AA and it would lock us into 1 of 2 modes. Healing mode or DPS mode. The idea behind this AA is that shaman now have no unique role. We have a wide range of abilities at our disposal, yet we are too weak in most of them to be effective in anything other then backup healing and slowing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, now that your up to speed, lets move to the abilited its self.<br />
<br />
<br />
As i said, the AA is basicly this.<br />
<br />
Active this AA and it lasts for, lets start off with, 1 hour. If you deactivate it, you can not reactivate it for another hour ( or however much time is left on the timer ).<br />
<br />
While this AA is active you would lose say.. 33% healing for a 33% gain in DSP. The 33% dps will include nukes and DoT's to allow us to fill in a more needed role when a slower is already present. The 33% AA would effect the healing in HoT spells as well as direct heals with possibly the CHeal excluded, cause CHeals always are left out i guess.<br />
<br />
Another idea for the DPS increase could be that when this AA is active it could be cast on puppy to make him dual wield and have a proc something long the lines of the level 15 BST pet buff. This would be coupled with the nuke and DoT upgrade ofcourse.<br />
<br />
I believe 63 is a good level for this AA with scaling percentages up to 65 as this is a PoP/GoD AA. If its OoW i think scaling from 67 to 70 would be correct.<br />
<br />
Mind you this isnt a AA to blance us and make all shaman issues go bye bye, lets face it, thats a pipe dream at best. However this will help solve 1 major issue with shaman right now. Stackablity. Also this will solve the issue of finding groups when a chanter/BST is already present.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So there it is. Sorry if i missed a few points, but its pretty late and im tired. Discuss and run with it, but please be keep in mind what SoE will be flexable about and willing to listen over. I think its wise to keep this AA effecting just DPS and HPS, anything more and its trying to let us do it all. This is just a way to enhance out existing roles and abilties for specific situations. This cant be over powering cause you simply making use of the shaman versatility and trading off 1 power for another to become useful. overpowering would be if it enchanced abilities without hurting anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, think, talk, debate. hopefuly something fruitful will come of it tomarrow. <br />
<br />
<br />
Off to bed now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's going the wrong way.<br />
<br />
3 healing classes (Druid, Cleric, Shaman) with the shaman being closer to classes who's main role should not be healing (Paladins)<br />
<br />
Now how many DPS classes?  Rogue, Monk, Wizard, Mage(pre-high end), Necro, Ranger, BL<br />
<br />
If we up our DPS even 33% (60-75% seems overly optimistic ) :<br />
1) tick off 7 classes<br />
2) distance ourselves from the two main healers even further and put pallies in front of our healing ability<br />
3) Make sure that 7 classes ensure that going forward Shaman DPS is low to protect them from us infringing upon their already over-crowded role.<br />
<br />
I'd like to up my healing and try and fill a slot with less competition rather than be an also ran in the DPS category (yes, we are currently an also ran in the healing role but at least that is a natural area for us to be in).  <br />
<br />
Tank, Healer, Slower, Crowd control, puller and DPS are the 6 basic viable group/raid roles.<br />
<br />
3 tanks<br />
3 healers<br />
4 slowers (counting bards but not classes w/ epic slow)<br />
3 -6  Crowd control classes (depending if you count paci/harmony as a CC tool and more if you consider 0 damage off-tanking as part of crowd control)<br />
3-6 pulling classes (depending if you count paci harmony as a pulling tool)<br />
7 DPS classes<br />
<br />
Why put us in competition with the largest group instead of lobbying to expand on our current strengths?<br />
<br />
DPS is not a shaman role, parse high end Shaman bards and SK's come out on the bottom.<br />
<br />
Part of Shaman issues is the vaunted utility.  We can do a bit of everything are masters of nothing, that is keeping us from having a viable role and I see this sugesstion as futher diluting us, by adding more unneccessary utility rather than shoring up one area to give us a role.<br />
<br />
EDIT: solutions that do not scale w/ the content and are hard coded are sure to become obsolete with newer ever more challanging content.  Ask SK's about thier terrorswith a hard coded amount of agro or mages about pets with hard coded hit maxes and HP, ask shaman about thier crappy heals that are hard coded and don't scale properly.<br />
<br />
This does not scale properly and therefore will in the end be useless (as it effectively hard caps our DPS and encourages DPS classes to oppose a DPS increase for us).<br />
<br />
I applaud the thought, and hope you continue to use your fertile imagination for more ideas (as I have none that I see viable), but please take my analysis into consideration when considering your next ideas, ti may be one that can help us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well i think you might not full understand what i mean. You say that you want to up your healing not your DPS cause its a more needed role and shaman do not do DPS.<br />
<br />
The point off the AA is you can chose Healing or DPS to &quot;focus&quot; on. Im not sure if you missed that or not but i wanna make it clear. I would agree 100% if i was talking about only dpps though.<br />
<br />
This AA would be able to let the shaman focus his abilties to suit what the group needs. If your on a raid and you have all the healing you need, you have 3 shamans dedicated to buffing and slowing, then the other shaman could kick in DPS mode and help the raid move along better. Or like i said they can avticate the healing mode and becoming effective healers to fill in a gap in cleric/druids. Right now our healing is weak. With time on our side, we are very effective and efficent healers, but in a game where people dont sit and med anymore, where breaks arent taken, the HoT is not as effective in its ucrrent base form to allow us to be effective in higher end content.<br />
<br />
<br />
To rebutle your scaling statment. I feel your are off the mark on that one. You say this will not scale as it goes up through the levels, but i think it scales fine. This will be a 33% increase to all spells, not just 1 level of spells or just 65-70 spells. If you heal with Q or nuke with VS, itll be upgraded accordingly. If you heal with DM and BoT, then itll be upgrades accordingly. 33% is the only fixed ratio in the propsal and bt simply moving it up the chain, it can pretty much infinitly scale up.<br />
<br />
If you disagree with anything please let me know, but i think this still is a pretty good idea in its current state. Thnx doe the feedback too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't see anything in your initial post other than a 33% DPS increase and a 33% healing fall off.  I see a mention of 2 modes but no proposal for a healing mode.  And if the healing mode works the same way it still doesn't help us as 33% better shaman heals only makes us better patch healers, not a group role, and lowers our DPS (currently among the bottom 2 to 3 classes) to  a point that people won't want us even casting spells as they'll just take up MOb buff slots and be about as effective as an SK dot.<br />
<br />
As far as scaling, I wasn't clear.  33% is a hard coded amount of increase lika  a focus.  Problem is that even in the last year mobs power has increased by more than that amount. Player HP (high end reasonably attainable, not max) has increased by that amount. This ability would become dated very quickly.  Notice that with each high end expansion they need to keep improving the focii, because the old ones aren't as effective against the new MObs.   <br />
<br />
What's proposed here is almost an innate focii.  Unfortunately that means in 2 expansions the hard coded % would not be enough to keep up with the mobs even with new spells since they will take this ability into effect while making ned content (like they did with slow, defensive, stuns, etc.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to disagree. The focus % would scale up with the spell increases you know what i mean?. Like if your in PoP and Q is your spell, it is 33% to that lets say, then you move to GoD and its 33% to BoT and in OoW itll be 33% to those.<br />
<br />
<br />
33% btw is just a number im throwing out there as a max AA solution. On level 1 it would be say 11% and level 2 would be 22%. <br />
<br />
Anyway, forgive my short reply, but im tired from work and it hink this thread will help shead some light on where all this is coming from. I tend to sift things down to their most direct incarnation. I sometimes leave out things i shouldnt when i do this and i fear i might have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">33% increase would still not make us significant in either area.<br />
<br />
The problem is our abilities are ballanced against slow, and slow has been nerfed, therefore our applicability in slow nerfed content is low.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a casting time slow to match our melee slow, cause most of the mobs now AE and proc stuff.<br />
<br />
Better still add a decent proc rate buff to FA and make it last 15 minutes 8)<br />
<br />
Im not really sure how to ballance shamans. But unfortunately in upper pop and above shaman go from hero to zero very fast, and once again cleric/warr/chanter become the group core.<br />
<br />
For a while a sham and a pall/sk could compete with that group core role. Thats what people want back. For a while in EQ there existed a period where you could make up whatever deficiencies in start up stats, or minor stream variant (tank, healer, slower, dps). This has been taken away now, and grinding out 300AA's cause your shaman no longer has a group role and the guild wants a bard is just unthinkable.<br />
<br />
Im not sure how to get tha class interchangeability back without diluting the class strengths. Face it, they gave everyone everyone elses abilities.<br />
<br />
Warriors cast agro spells now in the form of discs, now the other melee's are screaming for a form of defensive.<br />
<br />
Beastlords slow as well as we do (almost and the diff doesnt matter) and provide better dps, and get thier own form of clarity.<br />
<br />
I want a period again where the char I spent several years on has a strong role in groups. Thats why people are quitting in droves, and why every new char on the block is a war, cleric, bard or BL. do a who all in the newbie zones one day 8)<br />
<br />
change is good, but change can also be bad.<br />
<br />
Good hunting all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spiritual focus<br />
3 levels 5 aa/level <br />
(if its a GoD/pop aa)<br />
Level 1 at 63.<br />
Level 2 at 64.<br />
Level 3 at 65.<br />
(if its a OoW aa)<br />
Level 1 at 66.<br />
Level 2 at 68.<br />
Level 3 at 70.<br />
<br />
casting time 5 secs - duration 2 hours - recast 1.5 hours<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 1 - Healing focus = +33% healing increase (+spell haste) -33% to Detrimental spells <br />
(-spell haste?)<br />
Level 2 - Spell Focus = +33% Detrimental spell increase (+spell haste) -33% to Melee/pet DPS<br />
Level 3 - Melee Focus = +33% Melee damage -33% Healing ability (-spell haste?)<br />
<br />
(i like the idea of the visual representation being a change in dogdogs appearance)]<br />
normal Dogdog is yur standard swiss army shaman.<br />
Evil races:<br />
<br />
Level 1 - Bear<br />
Level 2 - Aligator<br />
Level 3 - Scaled wolf<br />
<br />
Good races + Vah shir<br />
<br />
Level 1 - Bear<br />
Level 2 - Raven (or something, ravens fit shaman well look at our icon, ravens feathers)<br />
Level 3 - Cat (not tiger like fuzzy bst's maybe panthers or something)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The spell increase as an example for the healing focus a 33% increase on Tnargs mending, with the healing focii up, will heal 1789 HP's Base, before imp healing 4 etc<br />
<br />
33% on velium strike (spell haste and damage and recast) damage = 1230 cast time 5.9 <br />
<br />
<br />
ok we'd want the spell haste on our heals and detrimental spells as a bonus (not that over powering still) however if we cose the opposite then there should be a 33% slower cast time, Thats self explanitory.<br />
<br />
now the hard one, checking the forums there are shaman who love to melee and tank, so how could we give them their 33% bonus?<br />
<br />
possibilites:<br />
+33% to AC and HP's<br />
+ +33% dogdog ac, innate Duel wield, and wielding Cleric summoned hammers (theres a good pet DPS - ok the last bit maybe a bit much but good innate procs for all intensive purposes)<br />
+ at 60% of that of their Piercing skill - Ripost/double attack/bash<br />
<br />
and the negs when using spell focus<br />
-33% to melee DPS/dogdog DPS<br />
-33% innate slow when meleeing<br />
a 33% malus to agil/dex?<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps yu a little, i didnt want to post it as yu seem to be leading the charge. i know yu dont entirely like the melee bit, but its seems to fit as there are melee shaman that would love this focus, and it being the 3rd lvl yu can either get it or forget it *shrugs* and besides 3 choices is easier to make than 5... the lvls maybe wont work in that way, but yu can have level 2 needs prereq of level one etc... <br />

<br />
<br />
I think this idea is in the wrong. I can understand your concern that they would ignore other things if we got something like this, but i feel we cant live in fear of this penalty. Especialy from this AA which is not meant to affect balanc ein anyway. This AA infact can not effect balance cause its a activated AA that pushes us in 1 direction or another, it fixes nothign at all witht he class.<br />
<br />
What this does fix is group desirability. This want make it so we dont need healing upgrades, this will make it so if a group say looses a cleric on a LD, we can be come the effective healer of the group. If the group has a shaman, another can be picked up as he can go to DPS mode and stack. This will help shaman that are being left out of raid situations, cause once buffs are done and 1-2 slowers are present, they arent needed anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Correct balance? Obsolutly no intention of doing that, but help desirability in situational enviroments and help our stacking, i do feel this would work for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What this does fix is group desirability.

<br />
It doesn't give us enough healing to be a main healer in GoD, it doesn't give us enough DP to be more desireable even in something as easy as LDoN hards.<br />
<br />
This does not improve viability even for current content.<br />
It doen't raise our DPS signifigantly, not nearly enough to be desireable for DPS anyway.<br />
Again sacrificing real long term viability for more useless utility.<br />
<br />
33% DPS increase may put us above bards in a raid situation, but still not high enough to be a desireable DPS class like Wizards, rogues, etc.<br />
<br />
If you can't be an effective healer AND slower in 1 group non-GoD content now you have problems knowing how to play your class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why is it shaman see bad stuff in everything, this was ment to allow us to stack well in raids/groups but thats fine, if yu want to be 3rd tier or 4th tier shaman in a raid and basically tiwddle yur thumbs then fine, yu guys have fun playing tiddlywinks...</div></div><hr />
