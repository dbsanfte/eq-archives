<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
First off I wanted to say that im not quiting my shaman at all just asking a lil advice. I didn't get to 55 and epic all for notin. hehe<br />
<br />
Anyway, my friend currently a 60 necro is delving into pvp more and more and its been something we both wanted to do a long time. My question is we are both kinda hard core players so we can lv fast n stuff so high end is always an option. He is playing a rogue and I am either wanting to player a ranger or a bard.<br />
I hear bards are kings of pvp and was wanting to know how hard of a time I willhave it till later or how easy etc. Any good info on them is great and I have a 56k modem im told twisting with that sux at some times.<br />
<br />
Thx <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you want to be the most annoying class to play on a PvP server, choose bard.  Hard as hell to kill, and hard to die by them, as they'll always just run away if you get a leg up on them, or it'll take them forever to whittle you down only to heal all the way back up.  Rangers are pretty good at PvP if played right...hell, any class is good if played right.  The only class I wouldn't play based on firsthand experience is a mage.  If you do start a mage, stop around 20, as they are still high in the power curve PvP wise at that level against untwinked players.  After that, it's just pure frustration.  Took me 2 years to get a mage on VZ up to 35, took me about 22 days /played to get to 52 with my shaman.  Survivability is key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The really good bards I've met says they need pretty good connection to be able to play real good. It's not possible to twist more than 3 songs and switch instruments back and forth at the same time if you lag or have a slow connection.<br />
<br />
Also, they have all redesigned their keyboard and have stuff on the strangest places there... heh... so they can use the mouse for moving and looking around. Works very good for bards but I have no idea how it would work for a shaman if you plan on switching between the chars.<br />
<br />
If you see no problems with this, I think bard is a good choice for PvP. They are very hard to kill for most everybody else, and they can do some pretty impressive stuff. It's also one of the few classes I've met running around solo out in enemy-land ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Rangers are very fun in PvP and tracking totally rules when others try to hide. Rangers become lethal with levels and archery in the high end game, well, the most common advice for others is 'Run!'<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd say less downtime for a bard to level up with a rogue, but in the high end game both bards and rangers are two of the more lethal classes when played by a skilled player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you plan on pvp'ing w/ your rogue friend quite a bit, a bard is the obvious choice.  There is hardly a stronger duo than a rogue and bard on Rallos where I played.  You'll never die and you can kill almost any class in a flash with your combined skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thx for the info and any more would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">...then I guess I'll plug some for the ranger. <br />
<br />
I play(ed) a necro on SZ, and the single most annoying thing I have ever encountered is a ranger who ensnares you out of nowhere, ensnares the pet, and runs. Yes runs. You end up either having to dispell, or follow. Usually you dispell your pet, and they re-root it. If you just dispell yourself and give chase they snare again. All the while shooting that damned bow at you. Or they can seperate you from the pet, whether it be you shadowstepping, or whatever. Once away from your pet they can melee or once again pull out that damned bow. Ranger's are cool, but these people are right, bards seem to be the better choice. All I'm saying is, if you ever decide to go solo on a PvP and love to piss off casters, make a ranger.<br />
<br />
Off Topic: A few of you have, but those who haven't, go to Google.com and search this; Fansy the famous; he isn't around much anymore, but holy shiz he is(was) funny as hell. The stories will make you laugh till you die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shadowknights and paladins are both strong classes in PvP. At 60th, with DOT heals and your Selo's speed pet, you're virtually unkillable as a paladin, and as a shadowknight, you can lifetap to your heart's content and deliver a 1k+ dmg HT as the killing blow. Plus with epics and/or higher end weapons, you dish out massive damage in PvP.<br />
<br />
Plus either class makes a good tank while the rogue is beating away from behind, when you're just leveling up.<br />
<br />
I'd even suggest the SK/Paly duo instead of the rogue. A friend of mine (who plays a 59th level Cleric) and I made an SK and paladin twink, and we do pretty well as a team. We each dish out good damage, he has stopping power when people try to run, and my heals help when we're outnumbered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fansy the famous was the infamous leader of the Flowers of Happiness.  He was a lvl 5 good bard on Sullon Zek who used to run around Oasis (evil territory) training SG's on everybody, causing the biggest riots and fits of laughter (and hysteria if you ever saw one of those insane trains) you ever saw.<br />
<br />
If I remember right, you can check out those stories on the FoH homepage at www.flowersofhappiness.com, but that's just a guess.  Check out his other character, Blart, on Rallos Zek.  He was a legend and funny as all hell.</div></div><hr />
