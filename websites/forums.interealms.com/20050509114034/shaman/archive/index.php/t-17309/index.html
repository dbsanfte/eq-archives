<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok not discussing the length of the patch, or the specifics in terms of what time it is or whatever. What I am questioning is, what kind of changes would you like to see? It doesn't have to be all shaman based and can cover any classes and anything within the game, even about certain encounters and about certain zones. Btw limit the flaming! My ideas;<br />
1. Rabid bear change, Reuse changed from 2 hours to 30 mins<br />
2. Radiant cure fixed to Cure detrimental effects 100% of the time,  or reuse time adjusted. Ie it seems to randomly cure Malos when you have it on you even with radiant cure 3 it will only sometimes cure it. And when detrimental effects are cured. A %T has been cured is a welcome text.<br />
3. Introduction of a &quot;medium&quot; setting for Ldon. With a Scaled point system after the 90 minutes has finished. Also possibly an addition of quests that require drops from certain themed zones, and these quests are unlocked the more adventures you do and perhaps randomized a little.<br />
4. Full out resists slows are rarer and more likely to be a scaled mitigate depending on perhaps how much it is debuffed.<br />
5. Enchanters split into 2 classes(however I won't say anymore than that, just leave you pondering how I mean, and focusing on the absurdness and outcry it would cause.)<br />
6. Elemental gloves changed to effect Velium strike, or Bane.<br />
7. Flagging requirement changed to let 75% in from 85%<br />
8. Flag Management tool incorporated into guild window.<br />
9. Druids changed to Chain level mitigation(omg!)<br />
10. Monks to get Run Speed 6, Warriors to get warcry changed from what it is to a 2 min reuse ability that is targettable and gets a 200 hate on a mob. Rogues to get 3 new imbue lines.<br />
11. An ability to target nearest mob near you and face the direction its at<br />
12. Poair/Poearth fixed to have some sort of indicator when something is up. Pow revamped to have water in areas but not in all.<br />
13. Introduction of a type 9 augment which can only be used on &quot;special items&quot; in the past which have been superseded in quality.<br />
14. Raids to be fixed not to be bugged through zones.<br />
15. Pallies AA Act of Valor adjusted from its use atm to being able to 96% rez someone once every 72 eq hours. <br />
16. lvl 60 requirement on zoning into all 2nd tier zones. Solro opened up to everyone but chamber requiring usual access. Ornate made nodrop.<br />
17. Names in Ldon to have a special ability. Some sort of AE, along lines of lesser raid mobs.<br />
18. Collections fixed in Ldon<br />
19. Ability to get half your adventure points back, ie a kinda sell feature.<br />
20. Addition of pop epics.<br />
21. Addition of a low level specially themed raid zones.(With rare drops such as swords with procs of illusion with benefits on that illusion, and items that give charges of say 500 dd) Of course this noone over the level can enter the zone. <br />
22. New feature of Guest guild tag.<br />
23. Master tradeskillers to get a title<br />
24. Comm2 in Ssra made more frequent<br />
25. Ability to have a &quot;2nd&quot; guild, A kinda pickup coalition. New feature LFC(Looking for Coalition), Its a kinda atm thing rather than a fixed thing like a guild.<br />
26. Necros given ability to Exterminate. Ie ability to completely destroy a mob with no corpse up to lvl 65 mobs with restriction of reuse every twenty four rl hours.<br />
27. Don't know of its use but a safezone, ie you need to afk in group. You have an option of safezoning and when you finished return to group easy enough. Except you can't use when a  mob in the area.<br />
28. Addition of new pvp only spells.(unresistable -120 dr lvl 65 shaman spell)<br />
29. Ldon dots changed to -30 resistadj<br />
30. Rogues given a lesser Group Sos(the idea behind this is a trained tracker I think it is can lead a team of people through a dangerous area)<br />
31. Enchanters to get a 10 second castable silence on mobs.<br />
32. Perhaps Ability to see groups mana, and melees atk in group window.<br />
33. Server messages sent can see afk messages. And can add onto friends list and be able to use a /who person.<br />
34. Shrink given buff icon out of group.<br />
35. Ability to leave messages for those people offline.<br />
36. Pom readjusted to old pom. Zone in/out GD.<br />
37. Average hit given per fight for melee. Average heal applied per fight for healer. Maybe edging towards a current dps indicator.<br />
Obviously lots of my ideas are very idealistic and none of them will come true as a fair few have downfalls but that is just a kinda brainstorm and curious of other peoples ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ouzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i would like...<br />
group shrink outside your own group<br />
group buffs hiting any pets in your group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A box put in the trader tool to allow a percentage value to be entered. Then by pressing the button next to it you could raise or lower the prices of all your items for sale by that percentage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I for one would like to see a whole new generation of aa abilities.  That would make me happy.  And if Sony needs to fix the little annoying shaman issues such as out-of-group shrink with aa abilities what the heck - let's just get them in the game.<br />
<br />
I for one am not for the excessive &quot;dummying down&quot; of EQ but, I do feel for example, that an aa extending FA duration would simply lessen the mindlessly repetitive steps that a high level shaman goes thru every adventure.  Same with a slightly better canny4 (especially if it is aa hotkeyed to free up another slot).<br />
<br />
Just these 3 things would add the &quot;carrot of leveling&quot; back for a lot of us and lessen the mindless repetitive steps a bit.  I could go on about the &quot;useless stat buffs&quot;, partial slow resists, elemental glove effect etc. etc. etc. like the original poster did and his suggestions are all legitimate fixes for the most part.<br />
<br />
But, I think that the addition of a significant aa expansion could solve many of our annoying problems and perhaps allow shaman to specialize a bit to achieve a bit of distinction.  For example a shaman could choose an offensive path or defensive path (not both).  This sort of distinction within the shaman class would be interesting in both exp groups and in raid situations.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1. Heal over time spells (Quiescence, etc) show the amount healed per tick.<br />
2. More color and filtering options for spells and spell effects<br />
3. Some indicator of time remaining on buffs (arguable I guess) ala AC2<br />
4. Ability to see groupmates buffs on an inspect (similar to new pet window)<br />
5. Shamans receive improved invisibility<br />
6. Something done for warriors (sorry, no great ideas, they just really need some love)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1) rabid bear changed to a form of DA, or BA mod, or a form of travel spell (lev and faster than Selos).  I don't melee anyway.<br />
<br />
2) Fix Warriors.  Make warrior taunt more effective.<br />
<br />
3) fix pathing in some zones.<br />
<br />
4) randomise ALL named raid spawns to have a +/- X hr based on a fixed yet shorter period of time.<br />
<br />
5) add more traders (to the max baz limit)<br />
<br />
6) add a text filter based on keywords (ie: if the word &quot;casino&quot; is in the text it gets filtered, or words like &quot;spare&quot;, &quot;plz&quot;, &quot;m8&quot; ...)<br />
<br />
7) Wolf pets have innate sow speed ... YOU THINK!!!<br />
<br />
8) search for spells by level in the bazzaar<br />
<br />
9) text based log file you can refer to in game where you can record price ranges and dates to work out avg prices and what not for an item.<br />
<br />
10) while SoE is making the game more idiot proof, how about being able to tell if a mob is slowable and including that info in a consider message (ie: &quot;X scowls at you ready to attack - what would you like your tombstone to say - It looks completely/mostly/partially vulnerable/immune to slow attempts&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sow speed dog.<br />
<br />
Group buffs hit pets.<br />
<br />
Race-appropriate pets.<br />
<br />
Ability to shrink anyone in your raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1) We have added Solitaire, Minesweeper, Tetris, and several other single-player games to the Gems repertoire.<br />
2) We have also added multiplayer games as well, including Puzzlefighter, Poker (casual and betting) with several variants, Backgammon, Chess, Checkers, Monopoly, and Diablo 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1- Shrink/grow and Group shrink out of group<br />
<br />
2- Rabid Bear gets reuse and duration changed along the same lines as Mage elemental form. Also changed to use an appropriately colored bearmap like normal bear or possibly even a new bear model specific to Rapid bear. Make it the newer better bear form that 60 plus shaman everywhere can have fun with. <br />
<br />
3- Resist modifiers appropriate to the spell levels applied to our spells.<br />
<br />
4- Higher level Slow with a lower recast timer on it and a resist modifier in line with other similarly leveled slow spells.<br />
<br />
5- Group quiescence @ shaman. Every other healer has some form of group heal. Even pallies and beastlords get some form of group healing.<br />
<br />
6- ALL the complete healing spells have been removed from the game and replaced with a line of balanced, mana efficient heals presenting a real progression appropriate to their level and not requiring stupid limitations such as &quot;not affected by aa's or focus items&quot;. A 65th cleric heals the same hp as a 39th cleric with his complete healing. This is just wrong. Open ended percentage heals were a flawed concept to begin with. If you're going to put a cap on the max hp they will heal anyways, suck it up, go full monty and fix it for real.<br />
<br />
7- I'd love to see more difference in healing styles between the different priest classes. Actually I think I may start a thread just on this subject. There is so much potential there for tweaking.<br />
<br />
8- Give all the pure melees the luvin that they've been needing for the past year. (subject beaten to death already. Great solutions, inexistent implementation).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Some of the ideas posted above are very nice. Not sure what is meant by giving a GM tradeskill title. Do you mean in game, like an AA title? It would be nice to know that guy your paying 1k for a tailoring combine really is at 250. Could get rather cluttered when you start getting multiple titles though.<br />
I still have a 55 warrior that I don't have the heart to delete, my number one patch suggestion would be to just FIX the problem once and for all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">-There will be a new expansion coming out in xxx that emphasises your skill as a player and not your popularity, timezone, ammount of friends e.t.c. One to 72 players will be able to take on new challenges, and have fun in a hundred or more completely different zones that use a new graphics processing engine to ensure you get maximum FPS.<br />
<br />
-Bloodied Ore of Vengeance has been changed back to slot 7<br />
<br />
-Completing adventures seconds after the alloted time will no longer result in a penalty. Penalties will scale down for the time after 90 minutes you use. Finishing in over 120 minute will still result in 20 points.<br />
<br />
-LDON Adventure loot will be conformed to the gear level of the players<br />
<br />
-LDON AA EXP has been toned up<br />
<br />
-You can now pick which type of LDON adventure you want to do<br />
<br />
-Plane of Time trials no longer take 12 hours to repop with loot, instead they are instanced so anyone in your 18man group has to not have been in a trial that has popped loot in the last 12 hours<br />
<br />
-We will stop nerfing encounters to cockblock people<br />
<br />
-You will now be able to bring your characters to Everquest 2 in the future if you so wish to do so.<br />
<br />
-Shamans now have an AA which allows root not to break if they nuke a rooted mob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1, Fix Warriors taunt - I though it should easy just change their taunt skill, like make taunt 100% success and add fixed amount of hate scale by level/skill, eg add 100 hate every time, that about 1000 hate per minutes (compare to BoW pro 2 per minutes = 1400 hate); that make any warrior able to get steady agro without depend on ubber weapon pro<br />
<br />
2, add more high end content, 5+ guild in element suck, won't take long for same happen in PoTime<br />
<br />
3, group Q is good idea for next expansion<br />
<br />
4, change 85% flag raid rule to 5/6 flag group rule; that mean a group of 5 flag can bring 6th unflag to exp/raid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/Shownames filter that will give First name and guild association. (I /feedback this every time I log in.  Its just silly that I cant see JUST this information without having to have surnames and AAtitles)<br />
<br />
Second for improved invis.  Shaman are the only class that gets invis and does not get some from of guarenteed duration invis.<br />
<br />
Fix to the pet missing that started happening about 2 patches ago.  I dont know if its only my imagination, but since they started specific pet reporting it seems as if my pet has developed myopia because it cant hit jack anymore.<br />
<br />
An Acumen AA.  Passive Class AA.  6 points<br />
<br />
AA's that allow you to cast spells without memming them.  Spells like Sow that are very low level but still see constant use.  a level cap to them of course.  Point cost sonsistant with spell level (so Turgurs would be 9 points while sow would be 1 or 2)  Max of 3 spells.  <br />
<br />
Ability to scribe a memmed spell to parchment for reselling.  Cap to the spell level.  One time usage for each spell.  Maybe not the best idea, but would be nice to be able to make some money back that I pumped into spells, much like reselling dropable gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm a simple man and somewhat shallow...all I want is Velious Armor Textures to work properly on the Luclin models.  When I see that it will be a joyous day, a joyous day indeed.<br />
<br />
Using the current option to load it everything works and looks correct except the chest slot :(.  So dissapointing to see all these people runnin around with what I think looks like noob armor.<br />
<br />
This will probably change if I ever get a char to 65 (highest is 57 Rogue) but for now thats it :P.<br />
<br />
The idea for warrior taunt being better is a good idea.  Perhaps make them like the fabled Berserkers of Norse mythology, able to go berserk on a timer (aa ability....I know nothing of thei rcurrent aa's tho so if they have something like this im sorry).  Being in this particular berserk phase would do more than increase critical hit chance, it would do something like piss the mob off x2 for each taunt for instance, reduce reuse time on kick/bash and taunt and give them 10% innate haste stackable with all other.  Might be unbalancing but I dont think so :P.<br />
<br />
Timer could refresh every 20 minutes?  maybe 15? Sounds good to me ;).  And last 5 minutes.  Penalty for the bonus?  I'd like to say reduced AC but then that defeats the purpose unless its a short duration like 10 seconds.  Reduced AGI would do the same but does make sense, maybe something as simple as a snare effect and when its over self damage for a % of HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1. True instancing for Plane of Time ala LDoN.<br />
<br />
2.  More variance and frequency in raid-level mob spawns to address timezone issues.<br />
<br />
3.  A limited number of flags on FR, Xeg, Arb, and Corny that can be assigned at a later date for those poor bastards who took one night off EQ and missed a key kill.<br />
<br />
4.  Allow shrink to work in raid.<br />
<br />
5.  Allow a full 70 person raid into LDoN raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Patch message For 10.21.2003<br />

All low level spells that are resisted or Have no effect on the monsters due to immunity or what have you. now Generate a total of 1 point of hate. Your Feeble Attempts to affect the mob amuse it enough to kick your head in At thier lesiure rather than right now. You want to piss something off. Burn mana like the big boys. A Wizard chain casting  Bolt of A warm summer breeze should be laughed out of the arena. Same goes for a Stun/ little clinging darkness that is less than a fart from some of these monsters.<br />
<br />
From this day forward. There is a parse filter set up client side. Certain words can be set to Show up as other words. plz can become please. Sow can beome spirit of wolf.

j/k, that is a cool idea, I think DAoC has it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Definately agree with a lot of the other ldon suggestions. Especially increasing the EXP.<br />
<br />
Made ldon mob density/kill requirements scale for the number of people in group. <br />
<br />
Add Vah Shir smithed cultural armor <br />
<br />
Make Ssra and VT instanced and spawnable by each guild once per week. Hell, do it for every raid zone from ToV up.<br />
<br />
DoT agro decreased to be inline with nukes that do the same ammount of damage.<br />
<br />
Bane given same resist mod as other LDoN DoTs.<br />
<br />
Warriors and Monks fixed, they are now useful in exp groups now.<br />
<br />
Pacify/lull changed to only work on mobs below lvl 58 and be resisted much much more often.<br />
<br />
Upgrade added to the spirit of B'hali line with same movement increase as FoE and a 45 attack increase.<br />
<br />
Vengence added to many common melee only items even if only a small ammount. Vengence should be as available to melee as FT is to casters and it really isn't even close anymore. <br />
<br />
Racial AA's added<br />
<br />
Bards AE damage/DoT song line removed or changed to prevent swarm kiting. Saw a bard complaing that their top AE dot only does like 450/tic or something with AA's and intrusments or something like that. <br />
<br />
New set of advanced cultrual put in with a rec lvl of 63 and stats similar to elemental smithed armor, but not requiring any flags to aquire the components. The market for regular cultrual has been all but ruined.<br />
<br />
Another PotC style trade skill quest added where all the components are trade skill made and tradeable so that anyone could do the final combine.</div></div><hr />

6. Improved invis and a self only Spirit form that is seen as neutral,and can move through some barriers, like doors, furniture and other Players.<br />
7. Fix Warroirs (and give them a AA Ability that summons a follower like a squire to heal a bit clean thier armour and mayeb bash a few things)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Bash up to 200<br />

Change rabid bear proc to be a poison DD, maybe with a mana sieve component.<br />
Rabid bear lasts 6 minutes, with a 10 minute Reuse time.<br />
Innate Malisement. 5/10/15 AAs, gives -5/-10/-20 innate resist to all spells. Should bring us back where we should be compared to like -50 and -100 on necro/druid spells.  Spending 5 seconds and 400 mana per mob to close the gap is complete bull****.<br />
MNK WAR PAL BRD RNG removed from classes that can use bracelet of Darkness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Lots of good ideas!<br />
<br />
3. Introduction of a &quot;medium&quot; setting for Ldon. With a Scaled point system after the 90 minutes has finished. Also possibly an addition of quests that require drops from certain themed zones, and these quests are unlocked the more adventures you do and perhaps randomized a little.<br />
<br />
- I'd love to see this.  Normal difficulty is often way to easy if you have any kind of good group and the difference between normal and high difficutly is extreme (not saying high diff is too much, just saying a middle setting would be nice).<br />
<br />
11. An ability to target nearest mob near you and face the direction its at<br />
<br />
- Two things.  It'd be nice to be able to target nearest critter period and then have a key for 'tabbing' between nearby critters (ala DAoC).  It would also be nice to have a face command to face whatever you have targetted.<br />
<br />
18. Collections fixed in Ldon<br />
<br />
- Only ever have problems with low quantity collections.<br />
<br />
21. Addition of a low level specially themed raid zones.(With rare drops such as swords with procs of illusion with benefits on that illusion, and items that give charges of say 500 dd) Of course this noone over the level can enter the zone. <br />
<br />
- Would be interesting...but I wonder if raids of that level could be organized since most people have a high average level on established servers.  I can't see raids for alts and the few new-to-the-game people really working well?<br />
<br />
27. Don't know of its use but a safezone, ie you need to afk in group. You have an option of safezoning and when you finished return to group easy enough. Except you can't use when a mob in the area.<br />
<br />
- Would remove a lot of the danger, and therefore the excitement, from the game, I think.  If you're gonna be afk that long, long enough to zone away from group, then might as well just log off and back.<br />
<br />
32. Perhaps Ability to see groups mana, and melees atk in group window.<br />
<br />
- This would be very nice.<br />
<br />
35. Ability to leave messages for those people offline.<br />
<br />
- This would be nice.<br />
<br />
* group buffs hiting any pets in your group<br />
<br />
- This would be nice.<br />
<br />
* Some indicator of time remaining on buffs<br />
<br />
- This would be nice.<br />
<br />
Ability to see groupmates buffs on an inspect (similar to new pet window)<br />
<br />
- This or something similar would be nice.  Some folks don't like to be inspected, I guess - but it'd be nice to have some way to check for existing/dropped buffs.<br />
<br />
*  group true north and group true south so we can groove like the Village People.<br />
<br />
- LOL, would be fun.<br />
<br />
* I'd really just like them to actually fix the zone to desktop with resulting 1018 error feature that has existed for years. There is no excuse for this thing still hanging around in a game as old as EQ.<br />
<br />
- I'm not sure I've had this problem but I have had some wicked crashes zoning out of LDoN and other wierdness.  I have a fairly beefy PC and EQ generally takes a really long time to recover from these types of crashes or LDs.  I'd like to see this cleaned up a bit.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
I'm fairly content with my shaman and EQ in general but I've yet to break 50 and experience the latter portion of the game.<br />
<br />
- I'd like to be able to shrink my pet and/or shrink toons even smaller.<br />
<br />
- I'd like an upgrade to the summon food/drink spells to summon more than 1 at a time.<br />
<br />
- This wouldn't be popular, but I'd like to see xp modifiers on zones eliminated or more evenly balanced.  EQ has tons of zones and many of them are completely underutilized because many people only visit the highest mod zones.  I guess this could be done at any time with a patch, rather than an expansion.<br />
<br />
- I'd like some kind of spell that immitated the tracking ability - some kind vision thing.</div></div><hr />

This is already in the game, I use it all the time!  it's invaluable for enchanters.   You can also tab between your last two targets.<br />

<br />
I've always thought Iksar's should have scaled wolves, since our pets are supposed to be spirits that shaman are familiar with (and an iksar shaman probably has no clue what this wolf thing is).  Heck just take what the Beastlords were givin, make them translucent like our current pets and there ya go :P.<br />

In DAoC it's more than what EQ offers, yeah we got target nearest but there's no cycling of targets.  You can tab from nearest target to furthest target, and then it cycles back to nearest when furthest within range is passed.<br />
<br />
Would definitley help out when slowing stacked mobs or chanters tryin to mez stacked mobs.  Yes we can do it now but it takes just a little bit longer to wait for that perfect opportunity to click the right one.  Meanwhile someone's gettin beat down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">General:<br />
<br />
-A change to the aggro generated by certain spells used frequently by high level plate hybrids has been put in place. Spells that do not affect a mob will generate no hate whatsoever. In addition, the aggro of certain low-level DoTs has been reduced. We think that Paladins and Shadow Knights should retain their aggro-locking abilities, just not in perpetuity. If you want to lock a mob on you, it will now cost you a decent amount of mana.<br />
<br />
-The Lull line has been deleted from the game for all classes that can use it. Monks around the world rejoice.<br />
<br />
-The Bard AA ability Fading Memories has been changed to a self-only deathtouch. Monks around the world rejoice more. (Seriously, just delete the ability and refund the points.)<br />
<br />
-We have retuned melees to bring some balance to these classes. Warriors now have their own superior mitigation table. Equipment has been tuned such that hybrids can max out at approximately 80% of an equivalently equipped warrior's HP. Monks, now that they can pull, will receive additional tuning once we evaluate the effects of other changes.<br />
<br />
-Slow mitigation has now been changed to be somewhat more reasonable. It is now subratctive instead of multiplicative - i.e., it subtracts a certain % from the slow that lands on the mob. This allows shaman to actually be the preferred slowers for people who can do simple math. We have retuned certain encounters to account for this change.<br />
<br />
-The level 65 beastlord slow has been reduced to 55%.<br />
<br />
-Charmed pets have had their damage capped at a reasonable level. We finally realized that it is ludicrous to have a support class (enchanters) outdamaging entire groups.<br />
<br />
-We have increased the range of the shaman epic to bring it in line with the other epics.<br />
<br />
-The cost of alchemy components has been radically reduced. All components now cost 1/10 of what they used to.<br />
<br />
-The number of detrimental effect slots for mobs has been increased to 60.<br />
<br />
<br />
DoT and debuff changes:<br />
<br />
-The aggro for DoT spells has been reduced to be in line with direct damage spells of the same magnitude.<br />
<br />
-Bane has been given a -50 resist mod. We realized that a spell designed to do fast damage isn't that useful if you have to cast a 5 second, 400 mana spell first in order to make it land reliably.<br />
<br />
-All DoT spells with a direct damage component have had the DD effect removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman-specific changes:<br />
<br />
-The duration of all shaman buffs has been increased to be in line with the buffs of other classes. (In other words, Focus of the Seventh now lasts as long as Hand of Virtue, and so on.)<br />
<br />
-Talisman of Alacrity has been changed to Talisman of the Wind, and now gives 60% haste.<br />
<br />
-You will now be able to shrink anyone in your raid without being in the same group. A confirmation box has been added to the shrink spell, much like the wizard Translocate spell line.<br />
<br />
-A number of AA changes for shaman have been added. Alchemy Mastery has been eliminated, and the designer who put it in the game has been fed to a pack of starving wolves. New abilities added/revised:<br />
<br />
Innate Malisement (3/6/9), -5/-15/-30 resist mod on all spells cast by the shaman. (Not my idea, but a DAMN good one worth repeating over and over again.)<br />
<br />
Quick Debuff/DoT: (3/6/9): Reduce the casting time on detrimental spells by 10/25/50%. Finally, you won't have time to go make a sandwich after casting Malos.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Fury: This ability now affects DoTs as well. A DoT has a chance to land as a critical, doubling the damage every tick for the duration of the spell.<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear: Retuned so that it's not a waste of points. It has been made to be like the mage elemental form ability. Hastened Rabidity has been removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">-Warriors now get 2 taunts. One works how taunt works now, other increases hate by 1-400 depending on skill. Indepent reset timers.<br />
<br />
-Monks now have more damage mitigation naturally, not as high as it once was but still noticable. Also, monk class ATK bonus multiplier changed to 1.5<br />
<br />
-Rog atk bonus multiplier changed to 1.5. Duelist disc lasts 30 seconds. DoT procs and poisons no longer interfere with Escape.<br />
<br />
-Cost of SK aggro spells reduced by 10-25%<br />
<br />
-Rains no longer have FIXED 20% resist rate WHICH WE CAN PROVE WITH PARSES and is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and now rains are effected by Foci.<br />
<br />
-Call of Rathe (ranger buff) no longer overwrites SK selfbuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And thats my patch. Its really pretty easy to see where Sony ****s up and where they're doing a decent job. They need to wake the **** up and fix some serious balance issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Berik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Warrior taunt fixed<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Change Innothule and Grobb back to the way they were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">One thing that I'd love to seen added to LDoN is an item that you can buy for say 500 points that will strip an effect off of an item and turn it into an augment.   Make another slot, and only put that slot on items without clickies already.<br />
<br />
That way you could add the JBB click to a elemental bracer, or scale of wolf/grim aura on an earing.  <br />
<br />
Here's for dreaming! :P</div></div><hr />
