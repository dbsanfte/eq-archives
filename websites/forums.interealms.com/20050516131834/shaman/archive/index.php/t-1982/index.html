<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i know this isnt shaman related , but i have a shaman so maybe you will be nice and help me ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
i have a kitty warrior and i bought him a forged drakkel bastard . It hits for like 20 and has 45 delay or something . when i hit im a beast ;)<br />
<br />
but it doesnt seem to hit as often as i like. im a 19 warrior with like 100 skill in all relevant skills.<br />
<br />
anyway. i was thinking maybe dual wield might be better.<br />
so my question is this. what would be a good dual wield weapon/weapons. i was thinking of takingmy 34 shammy to velious and getting 2 velious short swords which i believe proc shards at 24.<br />
<br />
thats all i could think to do.<br />
<br />
any other thoughts?  btw im not rich. the warrior has like 60 pp and the drakkel sword which is worth about 30-40 pp and the shammy needs his cash for a new spear and armour :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Picking up the swords might be a good idea, because dual wield has much more taunt.<br />
<br />
tuant for weapons(as i understand it) is the # of hits, not damage, that really decides it<br />
<br />
also:level the shammy up into the 40's, and make all the cash you need there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
good point , i was fighting in the saranark fort at level 19. just didnt seem to be a effect fighter , i just felt bad is all. i dont have heavy duty armour so being a good tank was out of the question. hmmmm maybe i should just save my cash and get armour.<br />
<br />
<br />
but onto the shaman , you think i should stay in velious ?  its intresitng there thats for sure and the weapons are nice that drop and you can get mad cash for them.<br />
<br />
hmmmmm  maybe i will ;)</div></div><hr />
