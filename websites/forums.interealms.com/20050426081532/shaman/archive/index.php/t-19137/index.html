<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok this weekend i was looking to camp the Frenzied Velium Broodling but had never been there before so i head to Velks.  The first ramp you go up is where cytral eyes spawns i think not even sure but a monk was camping there so up i go.  After a few sliding falls to the ground i come to an area with a ladge against the wall.  there is a SK up there so i talk to him a bit about the camp.  He siad he has never seen a named spawn there and he camps here for velium to smith with.  Ok if you are looking out from the ledge to your left is a ramp with a ton of spiders up there and some see inviso =( , to the right is 3 spiders together, alitle farther right u can see the castle/village down to the right.  No one i talked to knew ehr ethe frenzied spawned at, i think i was at the right place but the SK wasnt pull the place holder for the frenzied because from what i have read PH is over to the left past the 2 on the left.  Was i in the right place and also what spawns up on that ledge to the left up the ramp?  Not sure how to get up there to pull them since the damn ramp is icey.  Thanks<br />

<br />
From that point (with the slippery ramp up to your left, and the 3-spawn ahead &amp; to the right), take the walkway back towards the Crystal Eyes spawn.  It will branch off to the right before it gets to the slippery downwards part.  There's a couple spiders along that right-hand branch that you can't see from the ledge; one of them is the Broodling or its PHer.<br />
<br />
From the ledge and up the ramp on the top floor are the Crystal Fang and Frenzied Velium Stalker.  The Fang is one of the spiders in the first cluster as you hit the top of the ramp.  Just kill all of them, because you'll want to clear to the Stalker which is one of the spawns on the walkway over the Crystal Eyes area.  I used to just go up to the other side; there's a safe point over there you can pull to and you don't have to keep running up that slippery ramp, although they've recently added a hunter along the path to get to that one.<br />
<br />
Hope that makes sense; a map would be a lot easier :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That ledge you mention is where Frenzy groups normally set up camp. I never pulled back then, but I always thought that the frenzy mob came from up the slippery slope on your left as you look out from the ledge.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ospri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That would depend on what loot you're looking for.  Then again, you should be able to pull both Frenzieds to that spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All i really want is the Silver chitin wristbands for my rogue which if i'm correct is straight and down from the right of the ledge.</div></div><hr />
