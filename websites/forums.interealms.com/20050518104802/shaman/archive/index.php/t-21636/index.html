Chief among the info he gave me is that Omens is going to be pushed back 6 weeks, and the time between now and then will be used to correct the issues in the game. Not stuff like class balance etc, but fixing bugs etc.<br />
<br />
I honestly feel like 6 weeks will NOT be enough. But, it's a start. <br />
<br />
(That was only a small part of it) It'll be nice to see an expansion postponed for time to &quot;switch gears&quot;... but I still say 6 weeks won't be long enough.<br />

we've decided to push Omens of War back to Late August in order to give the EQ team time to respond to important issues that the EverQuest community is raising (specifically including the issues with Gates of Discord).</div></div><hr />

The fact that 90 percent of the EQ community screamed &quot;NO&quot; at the prospect of an expansion should be a red flag that, no matter how badly they want to attract new players, get their juice out of EQ before EQ2 launches, or whatever it is they are planning to do, that they are releasing TOO MANY (half arsed) expansions TOO SOON.<br />

Hello Norrath! <br />
<br />
I wanted to announce that we've decided to push Omens of War back to Late August in order to give the EQ team time to respond to important issues that the EverQuest community is raising (specifically including the issues with Gates of Discord). We've heard some concerns from within the community that we feel are important enough to push back our next expansion and spend time fixing the problems you have brought to our attention. At the end of the day, we work for you and it's important for us to demonstrate that we both understand and appreciate that. We're also inviting many members of the community to join us here at SOE for a day to have a direct dialog with the development team about issues that are important to the EverQuest community as a whole. We've already sent out the invitations and are making all the arrangements. In addition, our EQ community managers will be coming up with a list of issues raised on the message boards so that we can come back to you with a specific list of things we're going to address. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry if you feel we haven't been listening and reacting appropriately. We do our best to balance all of the needs and concerns you raise along with expanding Norrath and giving you new and wonderful things to do in EverQuest, but we do make mistakes. We've heard you loud and clear. <br />
<br />
We have many things planned for EverQuest over the upcoming years, and our goal is to keep you happily playing EverQuest for a long time to come. The best way for us to do that is by first and foremost is by listening to you. <br />

<br />
<br />
its too late.<br />
the damage is done, everyone i know who is worth talking to is going WoW once it hits the shelves.<br />
EQ seriously was fun, until the idea of &quot;keeping us happy&quot; became &quot;leeching our money&quot;<br />
massive bugs in software, more than anything i have seen since shareware versions of &quot;DnD - menzozerabbran&quot; (sp?)<br />
this game is on life support, the only thing they can do to bring all of thier EX-subscribers back, is basically FIX EVERYTHING (not a joke, even classes)<br />
nothing short of that will bring the players back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yep i agree, too little way way way too late. i dont mind them making money, just when you forget the customers its not good.<br />
<br />
i also recon this will have a knock on affect with eq 2, it might get enough poeple to count it as successful, but i doubt it will do what eq did. <br />
mind if they realise their mistakes before release although to late for eq , eq2 could be saved.<br />
<br />
more thought, less haste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's delayed by what? a month? Thats hardly a huge time period, probably they want to use the extra time fine tuning the balance of OoW as I expect that there will be some implications in the level cap increase, not to mention bumpy roads when it comes to upgrading the graphics.<br />
<br />
Where did you come up with 90% of the eq community opposed to a new expansion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Got to agree with Slim, <br />
<br />
Read the threads, almost every post apposes a new expansion until they address the glaring bugs and incomplete content in the current game.  I, as well as many others, have also posted the same feelings on the SoE boards.  I have to believe that as detached as they seem to be, eventually the cries of the masses reached their ears.  That and the fact, that for whatever reason, there seem to be noticibly less people playing EQ right now.  Summer break, finals, burn-out, whatever, at least the Nameless server seems to have much fewer people on during prime time.  And I play other games where that does not seem to be the case, servers are running pretty busy during evening hours, seems to be EQ specific to me.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this is an honest attempt at correcting some major issues.  Only time will tell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They got some nice spindoctors at SOE for sure. They almost make it sound like there would be no problems with the Omens expansion being released when originally planned. Only reason its delayed is that they want to fix the latest expansion first. Yeah right ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Quite frankly, I am PISSED about the delay of Omens. I am in one of those &quot;Medium High End&quot; guilds. About to hit Time (only TRC in our way, once we figure out how to avoid the LD bug), but basically, there is no place for the current 4 Time guilds to go. Yeah, Gates, sure. It sucks. Its tuned to level 70, unless EVERY SINGLE ONE of your members is FULLY Time geared, you arent going far. However, at level 70, the burden eases up, and it would allow at LEAST the top 2 Time guilds on my server to move on, leaving room for 2 new ones to move in (much like VT, when PoP came out, and the VT guilds moved into that expansion).<br />
<br />
Now however, with another month or more added to the release of OoW, I can see 7 guilds EASILY being Time enabled (my guild will be 6th, there is anotehr guild that has 2 God kills that will likely be number 7). Posibly even 8. What are all THESE people supposed to do? Farm fire_mini_187 for yet another EP Leather Bracer? (Open to ALTS! Min bid 2 dkp!).<br />
<br />
Expansions, whether you like them or not, have more than one purpose. Yes, they are there to make money. But they also spread out the content that inevitably gets bottlenecked at the top. Gates did this slightly, at least the Time guild stopped farming the EP mobs, allowing the other EP enabled guilds to gear up for the EP Gods. However, now what? <br />
<br />
Yes, sure, I want to see bugs fixed. You think the same guys who fix the bugs are the guys who are working on OoW? I dont think so. You think they are gonna pull people OFF OoW to fix current in-game issues? I highly doubt it. I hate bugs as much as the next guy, but its part of any game, really. Yes, we have had more than our fair share recently, and yes, they NEED attention. I agree there are balance issues, but why fix THOSE now, when 5 more levels, AAs, and spells are around the corner? Cripes, its gonna be one big CLUSTER #@^%#$ again. <br />
<br />
I say release OoW now. Get it out there. THEN find the balance issues. THEN find the glaring bugs. Allow the OoW team to work on THAT since we will be &quot;beta testing&quot; it, as usual. But bottlenecking 15 guilds near the top of the previous expansion is really going to suck.</div></div><hr />

Hello Norrath! <br />
<br />
I wanted to announce that we've decided to push Omens of War back to Late August in order to give the EQ team time to respond to the enormous amount of cancelled accounts (specifically because of the issues with Gates of Discord). We've heard some concerns from our board of directors about future profits that we feel are important enough to push back our next expansion and spend time fixing the problems. At the end of the day, we work for your cash and it's important for us to demonstrate that we can get away with releasing unfinished products with no customer service . We're also inviting many members of the community who did not post problematic issues before to join us here at SOE for a day to have a direct dialog with the actors we hired to play our development team about issues that are important to the EverQuest community as a whole. We've already sent out the invitations and are making all the arrangements. In addition, our EQ community managers will be coming up with a list of issues raised on the message boards so that we can come back to you with a specific list of things we're going to address. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry if you discovered that we haven't been listening and reacting appropriately. We do our best to balance ignoring customers with cash milking our products. We've heard you loud and clear. <br />
<br />
We have many things planned for EverQuest over the upcoming years, and our goal is to keep you happily paying for a long time to come. The best way for us to do that is by first stating we will take action and later “forget” about this and ignore you once more. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyway they start to think.<br />
We should observe what will happen.<br />
Important thing is.. not what they say but  what they will do.<br />
We can decide what we do (included quit or continue)  even after we evaluate their work. <br />
<br />
I hope they will do well, because even now I like this game and can't stop loving our class.<br />
So I was angry with their treat to Shaman.<br />
And I have not yet believed in them because of our previous status (as you know).<br />
<br />
Anyway if we did not say anything, we might not get any improvement.<br />
I really appreciate my colleagues' restless appeal. I am sure that your action moved them to good direction. thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You know, do nt get too caught up in the hype yet. WoW has a lot of hype behind it and it looks like a awesome game, but so did FFXI and to be honest i cant stand to play it anymore. With SoE going back and fixing broke stuff then releasing a considerable upgrade to the graphics of the game, you never know how things will turn out.<br />
<br />
Honestly if they just didnt focus so much on high and raiding IMHO and spread the attention around to all styles of play, EQ could have a shot at coming back to life to atleast a very enjoyable level of play. Yea people wills till leave for other game and EQ wont be top of the food chian like it used to be, but maybe in the end itll turn out to be ok atleast  /shrug.<br />
<br />
I am pretty much moving on no matter hwat simply cause its time to, but as far os the life of the game is concerned, you never know.</div></div><hr />

Will WoW be it? I dunno. Looks good so far. So did Diablo. So did CoH. <br />

I am an EQ player. I think the game is here for a while. I am disappointed that OoW is delayed, honestly. My reasons are on the other thread, but an additional one is &quot;There will be stuff to do&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">About the &quot;too little too late&quot; posts...  If you've reached this stage, then it's probably time for you to move on and not even worry about EQ.  No company will ever fix all bugs and balance all aspects of the game - not WoW, not FF, not CoH - nobody.<br />
<br />
I can understand getting burned out on EQ after all of these years, but really...if the only thing that's going to keep you around is perfection, do yourself a favor and do something else.  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying this to attack you, I'm just giving some personal advice.  Life is too short to do something you don't enjoy.  If the game is that annoying to you, go out and find something else to do.<br />
<br />
As to the announcement by SoE...my initial reaction is it sounds good, but I'll wait and see what actually gets fixed and what OoW is like when it's released.  (btw, I like the idea of lvl 70 because it should let small guilds like mine hit larger targets to get upgrades to seriously begin thinking about EP+ progression)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's unprecidented in SoE or VI history.  They have never delayed an expansion and I think it's a good call.  While I am sceptical of the results and while it's too late for many people (including myself), there are buttloads of players this can still benefit and attract.  While I am skeptical of the results, I think it's a great desicion and I hope they produce results that keeps EQ attractive to those that play for a long time.  As people who play games, we all want a good game, something fun, it's about time SoE realised this and that sometimes the best thing for the bottom line is doing what their suppossed to do and make the game more fun to play.</div></div><hr />

Then why even come to this board and post if it's too late?  Go off and do something you like.  <br />

I just can't comprehend sitting around complaining and not even trying to get a solution - just complaining...  (yeah, I realize I'm wasting my time with this post, but it just boggles my mind when I see people so intent on being negative)</div></div><hr />

Honestly, and I am NOT trying to flame you or start a war, but what DIFFERENCE does it make to people like you overall? Wanna know the truth? The delay HURTS you. 5 more levels means PICK UPS will be trivializing the flag process in PoP very soon. 5 more levels and spells means you will be able to do more things quicker and easier, IMHO, LDoN Hards, 3-player regular LDoNs, etc etc. <br />
<br />
I think a lot of the &quot;wall&quot; issues are more universal than people think. Lots of totally casual players are 65 with a few AAs these days. Gates sucks for them. POP sucks for them. OoW offered new content (note: its not ALL for Time guilds, you know), new levels to reach, new goals. Yeah, theres bug. Duh. Always been bugs. Are the current bugs more glaring than past ones? Not really, except they seem more NOTICABLE because of the overall sense of &quot;enoughs enough&quot; a lot of people have. <br />
<br />
Heres a clue. WoW will have bugs. Wow will have balance issues. Even with Blizzards EXEMPLARY record of releasing relatively stable products &quot;out of the box&quot;, and endeavor of this magnitude is GOING to have bugs. Its inevitable. a few K beta testers cannot find everything, as we have already seen time and time again in EQ, and even the stuff they DO find will be prioritized as far as fixing it goes. They need to release the game to begin making back the investment. <br />
<br />
Abby said it all right here, and I think there is more truth to this analysis than any I have seen in a while (thats my &quot;Good&quot; rep bump Ab)<br />
<br />
<br />
About the &quot;too little too late&quot; posts...  If you've reached this stage, then it's probably time for you to move on and not even worry about EQ.  No company will ever fix all bugs and balance all aspects of the game - not WoW, not FF, not CoH - nobody.<br />
<br />
Thats the deal. I really think that no matter what, EQ has just run its course for a lot of people. It has for me in the past. I skipped Luclin completely. Didnt play more than 1 hour a week average from the time Luclin shipped to the time PoP went live. But here I am. Why? Cause Baldurs Gate 1 &amp; 2 were good, but I beat them, twice. Because Diablo 2 was great, but it got old after a while. Because classics like Alpha Centuri and Fallout 2 and other powerful games succeeded in occupying my time for a good while, and when I came back to EQ, it was as fresh as ever (almost, not going into the &quot;good 'ol days&quot; here).<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think OoW is probably the best thing that could happen to this game, and I think the delay will hurt EQ overall more than it will help, because, as I said in the other thread, it will further bottleneck the &quot;Top 12&quot; or so guilds on all servers, which will create a food-chain reaction that will make a lot of &quot;middle semi raiding between hardcore and casual&quot; players get discouraged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Interesting.<br />
<br />
Maybe Im cynical, but I think this has more to do with letting some of the bad vibes die down than an actual desire to fix things.  End of august is three months away.  Its also at the end of summer, and kids will be going back to school and college, so they will be spending more time at their computers.  <br />
<br />
I also think they are counting on a number of the people that have quit to reactivate their accounts, and then there will be a &quot;new and improved&quot; OOW for them to consider.  And if you think Im wrong about some people reactivating their accounts, look at the number of people on this board that have quit, but still post here on a regular basis.  Now, Im certainly not saying that they shouldnt be posting here; I welcome every post by them because any ideas and opinions can be vaulable.   But these are the people that have &quot;Quite EQ&quot;.  I dont consider then to have quit EQ, they just quit playing EQ.  The fact that many still post here and are concerned with class and content balance show that they have not yet given up on EQ.  Its very possible that SOE is counting on these people coming back.  I would say thats probably a safe bet.  Not all, mind you, but some will return</div></div><hr />

         I don't know when you have begin eq , but for old player , Sony have destroyed their game.They don't have create everquest ,they have bought it ,and after they just make crap add on .<br />
luclin ,pop , loy ,ldon ,god : crap ,crap ,crap and more crap. Antonica ,kurnak and velious were great ,and if i still play eq it's due to them .If you wanna look yourself a pur sony's mmorpg , try SWG.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think Aby hit it on the head..if SOE pisses you off, if you really hate EQ, then why would you even care about posting on EQ boards? I think you don't really hate EQ or you want it to succeed, or something is drawing you back. I know when I quit UO way back when I never looked back, never went back to UO community boards, nothing. I tried DAOC as well but it didn't have the draw, it didn't suck me in. I will give WoW a try when it comes out but for now EQ is still fun for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think its good advice Abynormal.<br />
<br />
I was anxiously awaiting OOW as well though I havent preordered it yet, levels and a new epic were enough for me.  I play in a casual mid-level type guild thats now fooling around in the Elementals so while I deal with many of the small bugs that almost everyone sees, the graphic getting stuck bugs, the lockups in PoW and PoK, etc., I dont have to deal with the unfinished content from each new expansion so I think its not quite as frustrating.<br />
<br />
Im glad to see them take a step back though, making their product better can only be a good thing, and may change the way they do things in the future.  I admire what they do to bring such a fantastic game to all of us and I wouldnt want to be in their shoes from the perfection that is expected of them from most of their client base.<br />
<br />
People say they want quality over quantity but stepping too far in the quality direction means less quantity which means people get bored and quit before the next expansion which can also be a big issue.  I like the 6 month plan personally, gives me some time to finish up the last expansion while dabbling in the new one, then of course there is the massive content from previous expansions, always there.  That was the big killer for me in DAoC, not enough content and of course the awful pvp class balance issues.<br />
<br />
I and everyone knows they push product releases out early, but I dont understand how everyone cant understand this, its a tough business and its only going to get tougher.  Sony is trying very hard now (some say too late but I beg to differ) to please everyone, class boards and now the retuning and fixing.  I see it as a good thing for those who choose to remain and dont get frustrated easily.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just wanted to comment on the WoW having bugs...<br />
<br />
I bet it will have bugs, even the great Blizzard games have patches... mostly minor bugs, and even some unit balance and stuff.<br />
<br />
I'm sure WoW will have patches and bug fixes too.<br />
<br />
I remember the Gates beta test... where people were screaming that it's not ready... things as simple as having our ward text updated to be a heal instead of endurance.... weren't done, in addition to other things.<br />
<br />
Then there was the DX 9 upgrade... and the people posting from Test that it still has a crapload of problems...<br />
<br />
I truly believe... that Blizzard will not release WoW until they're satisfied it's ready... and to Blizzard, that means a lot.<br />
<br />
We won't know for a fact until it actually releases, but I think Blizzards track record speaks for itself... they canned a game that wasn't working out (lost all investment - I think it was called Warcraft Adventures or something...)... delayed StarCraft for a long time until it was &quot;right&quot;... I still remember them showing a screenshot of the interface when it was &quot;almost&quot; ready to release... but then they went back and fixed/updated a ton of stuff.<br />
<br />
I know that company bottom lines involve cost vs rewards, and then ultimately profit.   I believe Blizzard sees good games, as good profit.  I believe SoE sees &quot;get it out and sell it now&quot; as good profit.<br />
<br />
Time will tell if this is true... or bull****... or somewhere in between...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I don't consider this pre-Omens hype at all.  I think it's purely damage control.  I'm pretty sure they've seen massive defections across the board, especially in some classes (us, for example!).  Given the exceptionally poor work on GoD (bugs, content, balance of classes, itemization, progression), I think they finally realized they've pissed off a major portion of their population.  I strongly doubt they've had the pre-sales on OoW they wanted, not to mention the attrition in their current player base.<br />
<br />
SoE has finally had an epiphany.  If they piss on the customer, the customer will leave--and not play their other games.  They have several projects in the water at the moment, EQ2 being only one of them.  Their success on those projects may depend, in large part, upon their ability to keep a customer base pleased with their support (something that has been severly lacking the last 2+ years).<br />
<br />
So, that being said, I think we will see some fairly substantial changes in the works.  They've already made significant changes in GoD--the retuning was pretty substantial.  The qvic entrance requirements were substantially nerfed (only 1 person has to collect 60+ items in kodtaz and complete group trials 7-9 (don't ask me wth SoE was thinking to try to require that of everyone--guess they didn't learn from VP keys)).<br />
<br />
I'm expecting big things from OoW (some of this delay isn't really to fix GoD no matter what they say--it's to program in some of those items on the player wishlists for level 70 and AAs.  A player base of a quarter of a million people can come up with a lot more and better ideas than a few developers at SoE (a few monkeys could do better than the GoD developers)).  My only concern is that they don't go overboard trying to please people and make so many new spells and AAs that it dumbs down the content to the level of a six-year old.<br />
<br />
It is indeed time to put on our &quot;Wait and see&quot; hats.<br />
<br />
Good luck, guys!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I was more surprised by the fact that, for the first time in 5 years, an expansion was postponed to &quot;fix current issues&quot; (or so they say), which was enough for me to say &quot;Ok, benefit of the doubt, but you better come through with it&quot;. At this point, they don't really have a choice but to come through with it, because if they don't, they have a lot to lose, and a lot to gain on this.<br />
<br />
Would I like to see less emphasis toward the raiding lifestyle? You bet! More emphasis on small groups and &quot;being able to actually USE the content you've paid for, even if you only have an hour or two&quot;? You bet! More content for the raiding crowd? No, NO, and NO<br />
<br />
If the &quot;casual player&quot; is the majority, why do they get, really, no &quot;fun content&quot; at all? The raiding crowd (the minority, since PoP, not including Shadowrest or Forgotten Halls, grouping each LDoN theme as 1 (because it basically is), and grouping the Sewers of Nihilia as 1, has basically gotten 23 zones out of 51 total (45.1% - you add Omens, that's 43 out of 71, or 60.6%). Up until then, the minority, was given the minority in the way of &quot;content for themselves&quot;, having, what, maybe 4-5 zones (not counting old world planes - ToV, Sleeper's, VP, VT) &quot;only accessible via raids&quot;?<br />
<br />
That said, what do I think &quot;killed the casual player content&quot;? PoP, period. That was where the &quot;required raiding in order to access the majority of the content you paid for&quot; started. (The numbers above for the &quot;casual player zones&quot; include those &quot;level unlocked&quot; in PoP - basically anything that doesn't require a raid, or more than 3 hours to get at and/or finish, is marked &quot;casual&quot; - anything else, &quot;raid&quot;)<br />
<br />
The casual player, being the majority, needs the majority of the fun content again. The handful of zones they've been fed out of the last 3 expansions, have gotten boring after a week, but since the casual player can't progress due to the &quot;raid requirement&quot; in order to, they hit a ceiling. Either they do 1 of 2 things really - 1) Start raiding (I know I hate raiding, bores me even worse than just sitting around in PoK), 2) Be bored silly and go do something in one of the 5 puzzle-pieced LDoN zones.<br />
<br />
Considering the casual, not the raider, is the majority, they should be listened to, or EQ will be the EQ killer. It's that simple.</div></div><hr />

It was what a year or so before they released Kunark? 6 weeks won't kill us and IF they actually fix the problems people will find some refreshment in what they are already doing.  Enough, IMHO, to keep them satisfied until OOW is released. <br />

<br />
I think SOE has made a strategic decision to make EQ a niche market as &quot;EverRaid&quot; to keep their most loyal and diehard players happy.  Casual players are too apt to quit or be lured away by competition, despite the fact that they make up a much larger share of the potential market and pay the same fees.  Rightly or wrongly I see this as EQ's attempt to corner a niche market in much the same way that Apple Computer does.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
See above comments.  You are not their targeted consumer.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, what do I think &quot;killed the casual player content&quot;? PoP, period. That was where the &quot;required raiding in order to access the majority of the content you paid for&quot; started. (The numbers above for the &quot;casual player zones&quot; include those &quot;level unlocked&quot; in PoP - basically anything that doesn't require a raid, or more than 3 hours to get at and/or finish, is marked &quot;casual&quot; - anything else, &quot;raid&quot;)<br />
<br />
Yes, PoP was the turning point in the game.  In hindsight I see it as the first of the strategic SOE decisions to change the fundamental nature of the game into EverRaid.<br />
<br />
<br />
The casual player, being the majority, needs the majority of the fun content again. The handful of zones they've been fed out of the last 3 expansions, have gotten boring after a week, but since the casual player can't progress due to the &quot;raid requirement&quot; in order to, they hit a ceiling. Either they do 1 of 2 things really - 1) Start raiding (I know I hate raiding, bores me even worse than just sitting around in PoK), 2) Be bored silly and go do something in one of the 5 puzzle-pieced LDoN zones.<br />
<br />
You forgot option 3) Quit.  There are plenty of upcoming and released games catering to the casual market.  At this point it's easier to write EQ off as the raid game that it is and let the people that like this style of play enjoy the game as it stands.  SOE will not be changing their strategic vision of the game anytime soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering the casual, not the raider, is the majority, they should be listened to, or EQ will be the EQ killer. It's that simple.<br />
EQ won't die even after the last remaining casuals jump ship because they have a solid raid contingent that will soldier on even after server consolidation has begun.  I would imagine it will remain profitable even if no new content is produced for this crowd.  As profitable as if it continued to attract new players from the mass market pool? No, but that's no longer the strategic vision for EQ.  <br />
<br />
I think EQ2 may be their attempt to recapture some of the casual crowd but they face an uphill prospect with their past reputation and all the other competition going for the huge profits available in the casual mass market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Wasn't it Brenlo, or someone else similar that made the comment that the OoW expansion was announced too early and the zones weren't even populated yet, let alone tuned for encounters ???<br />
<br />
Ah, pardon me, but if the mobs and zones aren't even populated yet, they can't have tested or tuned any of the encounters - so I'm betting a 6 week delay is more of a necessity to get OoW ready to ship just as much as anything else, and this was a good chance for some PR in the meantime by announcing that part of the team will be looking at existing bugs.<br />
<br />
IMO it's probably as much CYA on SOE's part so instead of announcing &quot;Hey, it's not finished yet and we need more time to work on it.&quot;, they announce &quot;We're listening to you and will delay OoW a few weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure, they'll have folks working on EQ bugs ... they do that now with the patch team, the live team, and the expansion team.  The live team has always worked on bugs.  This just gives the expansion team a few weeks to actually POPULATE the zones ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Atleast statements like that seem to indicate, that SOE is aware of:<br />
- possible higher competition with other incoming MMORPGs<br />
- increasing burnout factor of long-time players<br />
- increasing disappointment about latest expansions and EQs overall direction<br />
<br />
or all of the above  ;) .<br />
<br />
Now if they actually do anything substantial about it, or leave it as it is with some cosmetic changes while ignoring the core issues like in the past ('healer balance', 'tank balance', the ever increasing gap between ubers and casuals, mudflation ...), that's a completely different question.<br />
<br />
No need to get upset now imo, the next weeks or months will clearly show, if it's only talk or some real action on SOEs side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree very much with this...but I think they are beginning to see that decision turning out to be a bad business decision.<br />
<br />
When the popstars and mega-rock-bands of EQ - like Furor and Afterlife - still played EQ it was extremely profitable for SOE to focus on making content for those select few because almost everyone else looked up to them and had more or less realistic dreams of one day become just as powerful.<br />
<br />
When customer satisfaction among the regular people outside the top 5% SOE came up with the obvious (and easy) solution LDoN. In principle this allowed casual people to get very good item but in practice it allowed the top 5% to increase the stats on their already totally out-of-whack equipment and it allowed the next 10-15% to significantly improve their equipment. But it still didnt change much for the last 80% of the people playing.<br />
<br />
Then they release GoD which was almost exclusive for the top 5% of the players. This I think has proved to be a BAD idea. Lots and lots of people have stopped playing after GoD. But even more interestingly the very uberest of the uber are among those people this time. And this I think is the real reason why we see SOE running scared now.<br />
<br />
Never before have we seen an almost flood of posts from the resident community relations person at SOE on these boards. And as others have mentioned SOE are making EQ for the sole purpose of making as big a profit as possible so you can be damn sure there is a financial reason behind this major change. It could be that SOE finally realized that basing their business on a very tiny percentage of their customers might be a rather risky strategy.<br />
<br />
And if they ever started to consolidate servers because too many casual people left then you would end up with servers with a majority of players in top-end raiding guilds. And that is as close to a recipe for disaster as possible. I dont think I ever heard of a server where people in the top-end guilds said they would appreciate some more equals to compete for spawns with.<br />
<br />
The way I - and probably also SOE - see it they have until the release of WoW to make some major improvements to EQ or its just as good as dead. They simply made too many mistakes and have been too neglicent in fixing them in the past to be able to just continue in that style now.</div></div><hr />

This is the first time in 5 years that an expansion has actually been pushed back to &quot;fix current issues&quot;. Here's hoping it gets pushed back again, because it's not finished.<br />
<br />
Maybe finding out that adhering to a release date anymore is NOT a big deal, whereas releasing a quality product, even if it is postponed repeatedly, WILL generate a, generally, happier customer base, and a better name for yourself, which increases income and decreases bottom line, because the word-of-mouth advertising will work on its own at that point.<br />
<br />
It's just better business to keep the majority of your current customers happy, they'll be a lot more willing to give you their hard earned money at that point, without causing a big stir, or a 15+ page thread on a popular gaming comic site :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">retuning GoD won't do anything much, since most people I know who are unhappy with it, it's because the expansion is so tailored to the top 2% geared players and offers very little for average players.

They better offer something for the masses soon or they will keep bleeding customers. I was hoping that was going to be OoW but now that is pushed back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Krakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">The state of eq is horrible at the moment. My group was fighting close to a wall and mobs would be pushed right through the wall and to the bottom of the zone i guess. <br />
<br />
I also keep seeing mobs falling halfway through the zone so they pop down and pop back up. Other pepole in my group were having the same problem. While this happened my dps and ability to cast on mobs was hampered b/c i couldnt reliably see them.<br />
<br />
The main tank in our group got stuck in the ground and that resulted in a group wipe.<br />
<br />
Our cleric lost the ability to cast spells on group members for some reason due to them disappearing when she casted.<br />
<br />
Also I died when a mob hit me for the total of 476 hp. I had around 2.7k hp at the moment. This might have been due to lagg but i asked someone in my group who didnt have the damage filtered and he came out with the same amount of damage i did.<br />
<br />
It was just insane this all happened during one session with one group. Maybe i just had bad luck. <br />
<br />
But then after the group i went to pok and experienced my 3rd pok freeze. Ever since a few patches ago the pok has been horrible. Well at least they fixed collision enough so im not getting stuck in the trees when i bump into them anymore.<br />
<br />
I understand that games have bugs and glitches but when there is this many and they are this disruptive there is a major problem. This is not the quality that i expect when i pay monthly for a game.<br />

<br />
I don't believe so, Blazz.  At least I don't believe there's a guaranteed significant effect on players as a whole.<br />
<br />
Killing flagging mobs takes knowing the strats and being able to have an orderly, disciplined raid, and also having the gear and perhaps AA.  If you can't do that at 65 and you don't have the gear and AA yet, you can't do it at 70 either.  Level 70 won't make any particular player smarter or more disciplined, reveal strats and give them practice in them, or make raids and guilds more disciplined.  It's not the levels that hold anyone back from flagging.  At least not at 65.<br />
<br />
Additionally, we really don't know that level 70 will make things all that much easier even with what virtues it does bring.   We don't really know if people's resistances will get a lot better or just a little...and if they get too good, whether mobs will be adjusted accordingly.  We don't really know that the hitpoint jump will be huge or significant.  For people in the elementals, it doesn't take long before having mana isn't too big a problem , so extra mana won't necessarily be too important.<br />
<br />
The new spells you mentioned?  Most people I know still don't have theirs from GoD.  Another expansion with more spells?  Well, that's just more spells they might not have.  A lot of people are frustrated with the way GoD spells are coming into the game, and unless all our great spells are on vendors, it's very likely to stay that way -- worsen, really, as more spells come into the game but perhaps don't really seem to get to people.<br />
<br />
Remember when PoP first started and it took forever to get spells?  Heck, that's when you could buy and sell them.  Now they're no drop and class-specific.  I really don't see any reason to suppose the existence of spells in the game will have much effect on the game; most people won't see most of those spells for a very long time.  If people are counting on those spells to get ahead in the elementals, that's not going to happen because if you can't handle the elementals, you're not going to be handling GoD, either -- not as long as fully time equipped people are regularly getting wiped out there.  There won't be any shortcutting there to make it easier for people on the lower end of the scale to advance -- not unless they redesign how things are presently done.<br />
<br />
Now, neither one of us can be sure what's really in store.  But I don't think you've made your case at all that anything coming out in OOW is going to help much of anybody out.</div></div><hr />

And if they ever started to consolidate servers because too many casual people left then you would end up with servers with a majority of players in top-end raiding guilds. And that is as close to a recipe for disaster as possible. I dont think I ever heard of a server where people in the top-end guilds said they would appreciate some more equals to compete for spawns with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Very well said, Bumadan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe finding out that adhering to a release date anymore is NOT a big deal, whereas releasing a quality product, even if it is postponed repeatedly, WILL generate a, generally, happier customer base, and a better name for yourself, which increases income and decreases bottom line, because the word-of-mouth advertising will work on its own at that point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agreed, Karaab.  Blizzard takes forever to put out games and they're rewarded by making a staggering amount of money.  Carmack and Id state flatly that the next iteration of Doom or Quake or whatever is coming out &quot;when it's ready.&quot;  And they're up to their ears in Ferrari's.  Both companies have millions of extremely loyal fans who are more than happy to pay them good money, product after product after product -- for years and probably eventually decades.<br />
<br />
The idea that you get the most profit by churning and burning your customers is a primitive one that works best when there is no serious competition to speak of and the customer is pretty well trapped between buying your product or having nothing at all.  The Japanese decided to make better cars and consumer electronics and became one of the top economies in the world after practically coming back from ashes -- a practically impossible task.<br />
<br />
A big danger in not caring about quality is believing that nobody else cares either and nobody ever will.  Sitting on your laurels when they've gotten ratty is gambling.  If somebody does care, and offers quality -- they can wind up eating your lunch bigtime.  Especially if you've been glibly building up resentment for a long time by giving your customers a bad deal.  Virtually nobody I know who has any kind of reasonable money buys an American car.  In Germany, they joke that FORD stands for &quot;fur osterdeutsche richtig das&quot; -- It's good enough for East Germans.  Hope I got the spelling right -- anyway, quite a put down.  There aren't even American t.v.'s made anymore.  If America was perfectly willing to drop the ball, other people were perfectly willing to scoop it up and run with it.  And thank goodness--that did America an awful lot of good.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the competition from CoH and the impending competition from WoW will do Sony a lot of good too.  Wising up could improve their bottom line and keep the bottom from falling out of it, and WoW could be the best thing to ever happen to EQ customers who never even play WoW.<br />
<br />
A change in corporate culture is long overdue.  Most people aren't strong enough to make drastic changes though, and organizations can move in geologic time compared to people.  It will be interesting to see just how smart Sony gets, and how much it matters -- to their bottomline and to the quality of play experience of their customers.</div></div><hr />

They failed, those guilds got pissed off and many have now split.

I dont think you can compare Blizzards previous efforts with EQ, they operate off different financial models. Blizzards games are one shot affairs - once they have sold the product they generate no further revenue, and it doesn't matter if the player stops playing since they have your money. In that scenario then yes, it is very important for the new product to be &quot;ready&quot; when it ships, because being &quot;ready&quot; is how they generate revenue. Its not like you are going to lose your customer base if it &quot;isnt ready&quot;. EQ on the other hand is a subscription model. They require people to continue playing, and to do that they have to supply constant &quot;new product&quot;. They can't just not do it for a year while they &quot;get it right&quot;. The customers will be gone by then, particularly with a game as mature as EQ.<br />
<br />
So its a difficult situation, with a fine line they have to walk. Blizzard will be facing the same situation once WoW ages, if it survives that long. They will need constant new material to keep the customers there, and as time progresses and players become more skilled, that appetite will become ever more voracious. I doubt WoW will reach that stage though, I can't see any future game in this genre rising to the same level as EQ. In some ways the cards are even more stacked against them since people who play this genre are now, by and large, seasoned veterans, who can consume content way faster than the virgins of early EQ ever could ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Killing flagging mobs takes knowing the strats and being able to have an orderly, disciplined raid, and also having the gear and perhaps AA.  If you can't do that at 65 and you don't have the gear and AA yet, you can't do it at 70 either.  Level 70 won't make any particular player smarter or more disciplined, reveal strats and give them practice in them, or make raids and guilds more disciplined.  It's not the levels that hold anyone back from flagging.  At least not at 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
Killing Nagafen and Vox at level 50 took VERY specific strategys and VERY good teamwork. However, it wasnt long after Kunark came out that everyone realized that levels &gt; all. It trivialized those events SO baddly that the had to put a &quot;Level Boot&quot; on them. And not 5 levels either, they put it TWO levels up. <br />
<br />
The same thing will happen with PoP, trust me. Most servers are taking down RZ now with pick-ups. My server recently got him to under 40%. You add 5 level to that force, and its a GIMMEE. Strats become far less of an issue when you have levels. The events are far more forgiving if mistakes are made. Not to mention that 5 more levels SHOULD put even Bazaar warriors near the 10K hp mark. <br />
<br />
As for spells, I certainly hope SOE learned an important lesson about availablility with Gates. Hard to say though, SOE doesnt seem to learn lessons til they kick them square in the bank-account. Regardless, I wouldnt be suprised to see them go back to a turn-in system for the majority of OoW spells.</div></div><hr />

This is a key point. WoW will not have a &quot;learning curve&quot; like the original EQ did. In fact, this is what killed MANY new games that have come out as EQ Killers. People KNOW what to do now. Even the more casual players KNOW what to do, for the most part. <br />

I do see WoW getting a significant amount of true n00bies though. Blizzard has a HUGE audiance, and a lot of them are still playing D2 and Starcraft. A lot will give WoW a go.

No, it's not that other people get better stuff (or even better stuff faster), it's that you can NEVER get better stuff after a certain point simply because of a difference in playstyle (not playtime even).<br />
<br />
And your continuing labeling of casual issues as whining makes about as much sense as labeling all raider complaints (including your own) about Gates as mere &quot;whining&quot;.  It serves no purpose other than as an offhanded insult- you're bigger than that, Blazz, so drop it.  More people than you play this game and their issues are no more or less valid than your own, even if you disagree.<br />

<br />
I'm ok with restricting 20 or 30% of the zones based on a combination of flags and single groupable quests, as long as the quests can really be done by the non-uber crowd in some kind of realistic amount of time.  Yes, this probably means the uber crowd could easily do the quests to get access, but I don't see that as a problem since they can easily do the flags too.  (and I'm ok with the flagging route getting better drops - which will steer the ubers away from the quest rout)<br />
<br />
In the end, I really think SoE needs to do something about the disparity between uber and non-uber gear.  They can do this either via reducing the gap or reducing the affect of the gap.  (ex:  going back to having an AC cap that can be obtained by the non-uber crowd)  <br />
<br />
Note:  I'm not saying make things easy...I'm just saying make them reasonably possible for the people that are not in a raiding guild or continually searching for that good 72 person pu raid.</div></div><hr />

Back then it was FBSS vs. RBB - a much bigger difference.<br />

You're correct Veeshan...I wasn't clear in my post...  What I meant was there is a more significant affect in today's game of having a large gear difference since they removed the AC softcap (or mob atk cap - whichever it was that effectively mitigated the difference between 1500 and 1200 ac.)<br />

By the way, I'm speaking from a warriors perspective since that's my main.  I'm not sure if the gear difference has that much impact on casting classes.</div></div><hr />

Tugela, you missed the point about quality entirely.  Nobody makes games anymore as one-shots -- they hope you will like them enough to buy expansions.  Warcraft RTS's have them, Doom has gone through Doom 2 and Quakes etc.  <br />
<br />
Getting a reputation for making a bad one-shot makes people far less likely to buy anything from you in the future in general, much less buy an expansion to that very item.  And negative word of mouth can stick around like glue to a poor product, while positive word of mouth means one happy guy could do all the selling for you to make another dozen people buy your product.<br />
<br />
Enthusiasm for not just a particular product but an entire company from customers who feel a company has earned their trust can be tremendously profitable.  Some embrace that model, and some don't -- but it's a lot easier to get away with disregarding your reputation when, like American car manufacturers used to be and EQ used to be, you're really the only game in town.  Then getting away with shoddy workmanship and just churning and burning your customers may work.  I think WoW, among other products, may prove that it's time for Sony's business model to grow up a bit.  <br />
<br />
Certainly it would be unwise, in a market suddenly turned mature and competitive, for them to just let a reputation for quality and customer service be something everyone naturally associates with somebody else.</div></div><hr />

Level 70 won't make people stop breaking mezzes.  It won't make cowardly chanters tash instead of hoping they don't have to.  It won't make people know when to heal instead of doing DPS, when to offtank non-mezzable mobs instead of mezzable ones, etc.  It won't make people AFK less or stop fighting amongst themselves or stop watching t.v. while they play.  We don't know the effect on resistances(which can be critical in some encounters) yet.  We don't know how many hitpoints will be added, or how much they will matter -- or even if monsters will be retuned if things seem suddenly too easy.<br />
<br />
Level 70 won't make people smarter or more disciplined, and at anything approaching the higher levels of the game, both those things can be critical.  If open raiders are successfully raiding, it's not because they suddenly turned level 65.  That isn't what got the top guilds through, either.  Knowing the strats matters; discipline matters; the ability of people to be flexible and adapt matters.  Level 65 is not the key.<br />

<br />
Nope, you are the one missing the point Blarg  :p . Blizzards model to date has involved recieving revenue when the product is released. A bunch on people buy, play it for a while and slowly drift to other games. A year later they release an expansion, and people who played the original game buy it, based on their previous experience.<br />
<br />
The EQ model is different though. The bulk of their revenue comes from subscriptions. If players play for a few months, exhaust the content and move off to play other games, as they do with Blizzards rts ones, they no longer generate revenue. Obviously in this model the publisher needs to provide new content constantly to keep their revenue stream. They cant delay it for a year, that would be financially disasterous. It is fundamentally different from the business model Blizzard has employed to date. <br />
<br />
This will change of course with WoW, Blizzard will have to adopt the same approach or they will lose money. It won't be immediately obvious since WoW is a new game, but I can guarentee that they will be doing the same thing as Sony in a year or two. However, I would be pretty surprised if WoW lasted anything nearly as long as EQ, there is just too much competition and players are just too experienced at these sorts of games for publishers to keep up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">I think EQ may be finding it financially disastrous to follow their old model of just slopping any old content out of there, broken or not, balanced or not, whether the zones are populated or not.  I think overall their approach with GoD may have lost them money long-term.<br />
<br />
Fundamentally, EQ will be forced to adapt to a model wherein quality counts once the competition becomes stiffer.  <br />
<br />
I don't think it's at all likely that Blizzard will adopt the model of Sony/EQ of releasing half-baked product as if they had a completely captive audience and quality didn't matter.  Because the audience is no longer really captive, and because Blizzard I think has fundamentally sounder business sense, as well as greater respect for the customer.<br />
<br />
I think, Tugela, that you make more of the obvious differences in the way these companies have in the past made income than is warranted -- you're pretty much stating the obvious -- and in so doing, you are overlooking the point I had been making, which is that quality is likely to become a real factor -- and perhaps it always should have been, because EQ has taken a lot of damage to its credibility over the years.  EQ and customer service have never been two concepts that go together, nor EQ and quality.  <br />
<br />
That didn't used to matter too much, at least to enough people that it mattered all that much financially.<br />
<br />
But neither life nor business are static.  Business that don't adapt wither and even die out all the time.  EQ is probably a long way from disaster at this point -- but they are in no position whatever to compete on the basis of product quality or customer service with Blizzard.<br />
<br />
And your average guy out there in the broader market--not just the small market of hard core EQ hotheads--expects and even demands reasonably well put together product.<br />
<br />
EQ may well change its ways and become more geared toward providing that.  If it does not, it could be in a lot of trouble, even regardless of the quality or eventual improved quality of their games.</div></div><hr />

I dunno man. You ever go to an early Kunark pick-up Naggy raid? Those people were TRYING to find ways to get themselves killed, but in the end, being higher level allowed HUGE mistakes to be overcome by brute force. Sorry, but a LOT of POP encounters can be won this way, its already been proven that more = better there. The tactics involved become less and less complicted as people get higher level. I have killed Trakanon with 4 people. I have seen 65s solo other Kunark dragons regularly, even &quot;no DPS&quot; classes like Paladins. Whats gonna be hard for 60 people who are all level 68-70 about killing RZ? Adds? Come on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They might be forced to address quality, but that will come at the expense of quantity, and at some point the content will not be there to satisfy their customers. When that happens, the customers will leave. And I dont think that you can discount the different revenue models for their past business structures. A RTS game, once released, does not have an overhead to maintain, whereas a subscription based game requires a massive server farm and all the associated maintainance costs, which I imagine are quite high. They cant afford to delay a game by any length of time, new content has to be released on an ever tightening shedule, or they will lose subscriptions and with it their ability to maintain the infrastructure the game requires. RTS games on the other hand require very little infrastructure after release.<br />
<br />
People are saying that subscriptions are being cancelled because of GoD, balance or what not. I dont think that is true. What has really happened is that since PoP the content that has been released has not satisfied the needs of the bulk of their long term customers, and consequently these people are leaving the game in their droves. Look at what happened after PoP:<br />
<br />
1) LoY was released. This was actually a great mini-expansion, but the problem was that the bulk of their customers had passed the level of content it was aimed at. Consequently they ignored it, it offered little entertainment for them. So they waited, killing time in PoP (metaphorically speaking).<br />
<br />
2) LDoN was released. Again, a great idea in concept, the problem was that it very quickly became clear that it was a LOT of the same stuff, and it became old quickly. It entertained for about 2 weeks and then it was drudge. Raids were put in belatedly, but were not successful because of the enormous amounts of clearing required and the size limitations. So no one wanted to do them. Again, the entertainment value was limited. What did people do? They waited, killing time in PoP (again).<br />
<br />
3) GoD was released. I like GoD a lot, allthough I know many of you dont. It is tough hard, stuff, but the problem is that from late PoP all the way through to the end of the LDoN era, the game had been made progressively easier and players got soft. People, especially the newcomers, came to believe that it was their skills that were blowing things away. It wasnt, and GoD showed that with a vengeance. Some relearned their old skills and got back down to business, but most of those who never had those skills slunk back off to the easy stuff. But the effects of GoD is complex. One of the things that happened in the late PoP era was the growth of massive raiding guilds. These guilds have a core of achievers and swarm of hangers on who go for the ride, and that only got more pronounced as they got bigger. So what happened when suddenly progression was determined to an initial extent by what groups did rather than guilds. All of a sudden these two groups of people are exposed. The achievers forge on ahead while the swarm is left behind. And then they find out that they need everyone for more raids, so they have to go back and tediously ferry everyone through. Not only that, the hard core design of the game makes implentation of diverse scripts very difficult, consequently imbalance and bugs abound. At the end of all this what happens: many of the most dedicated players burn out and retire, those who stay wait. They go back to PoP to kill time.<br />
<br />
Only by now they have been killing time in PoP a very long time and it has gotten excruciatingly boring. So people leave. Oh, they will come up with all sorts of reasons why they are doing it, but IMO it is basically that they have nothing to do, at least nothing they havent done a hundred times before.<br />
<br />
And that is where we stand now, the dilema that Sony faces. They have to keep their customers for the game to remain financially viable, its a crisis for them, what can they do? I think that this delay is to answer that question more than anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it takes money spent on servers even for games that do little more than matchmaking, and when that money is lacking, it can cripple the game.<br />
<br />
Diablo 2, Total Annihilation: Kingdoms are two examples that come quickly to mind.  The first one was so massively popular that it took a while for many people to notice, but finally one gaming magazine started admitting that the problems with the servers were crippling people's ability to play, and it pissed a lot of people off.  Me included, definitely.  I could barely play for weeks, and it did a lot to crimp my enjoyment and eventual pursuit of the game.  TA: Kingdoms was a much smaller RTS game, but their poor servers were absolutely crippling to the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;They cant afford to delay a game by any length of time...&quot;<br />
<br />
This is just a supposition on your part.  EQ is not a money loser, and it always strikes me as pretty funny when people speak as if it were.  It's had a captive audience for years, and been able to keep it despite consistently buggy code and unfinished content, because it is so profitable.  Sony is in no way crippled by lack of money either within the part of their company that makes EQ nor within Sony's vast multinational coffers in general.  Lack of money has NOT been forcing EQ to be buggy or unfinished or poorly designed.  There is just nothing sensible about that idea.<br />

It also presupposes what I think can no longer be supposed -- that quality itself is NOT a contributor to the bottom line.  My argument has been that quality is in fact central to long-term profitability in many cases.  Blizzard's case, Id's case prove that, and it's why people are busting down the doors of software shops when they release games.  I can't even find EQ boxes almost ever in Southern California's big stores when they release expansions, in comparison -- and this was starting from long before you could just download them.<br />
<br />
Customer loyalty is money in the bank, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
In EQ's olden golden days, when there were really no alternatives, quality could be only one of many strategies, perhaps a not especially attractive one if you just didn't give a damn about your customers and assumed there would never be an alternative to what you provide.  I mean, if you were the only one selling oxygen, what would you care if your customers asked you who cut the cheese?  Especially if you had, er...personal problems.  Honestly, Brad &amp; Co. exhibited attitude when talking to and about their customers that was shockingly negative, to say the least.<br />
<br />
With WoW coming out, I really do think it's time for EQ to adjust their business model.  I think it was time a long time ago, but I don't think I'm the only one who found EQ's business model lacking.  It's just that it mattered less before.<br />
<br />
I think Sony obviously agrees, too.  That's why we're seeing people like Brenlo, whether they're terribly useful or not, and seeing much chatter about how they're trying to make customer service and having the designers actually understand the game actually mean something again.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Tugela, I think Sony agrees with me more than with you.<br />
<br />
They have to.  They're doing this for a living, even if they're not quite sure how to do it anymore.<br />
<br />
By the way, I don't agree with ever more content as necessarily being central to either the way the game works or profitability either, which you seem to.  Ever more quantity regardless of whether it's working or buggy or not, and regardless of whether only 5 to 10% of your population can even access it, is what you sell to ONE small segment of your audience.  That's probably the part of the community you hear the most from, because high-level guilds and people who want to be them one day are very vocal and have no small amount of confidence that they know everything and are essentially the only ones that count(*cough* Furor *cough*cough* -- and many of the rest of us).  But it's never been the largest part, and unless EQ is going to settle for being a niche game, it probably never will be.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of players are more casual, from what I understand, and for them, simply having more places to go and things that WORK is of far more importance than what is available to uber guilds.  It's not just that most people may never see Plane of Time and beyond -- it's always been a very fair proposition that a huge percentage of players don't really even have that as a significant goal at all, or even as a goal whatsoever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Which, on a side note, leads me to again point out that I think you are looking at things in an extremely partisan way, as if your outlook were everyone's, when in fact it is just one viewpoint among many -- no less credible for that, but certainly no more credible than anyone else's.<br />
<br />
What I am after specifically is your negative comments towards LDON.  Virtually everyone I know has put in anywhere from very significant non-raiding time in LDON to an incredible orgy of hours there.  Some people will always have complaints about anything, but by and large, for the vast majority of the customer base, I think LDON is about as close to an unqualfied success as you could ever hope for in a game.  <br />
<br />
For you, maybe it was good for two weeks.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's remotely fair to even begin to think you speak for everyone on that.  I'm surprised you could even put that out as an argument before you caught yourself and weeded it out.<br />
<br />
Your comments on GoD are interesting, but somewhat incomplete.  Not that anything can ever be complete in such a vast game with such a diversity of people.<br />
<br />
One thing that I feel was left out and that was critical is that it's not just a harder core of achievers who decided to tackle GoD or stick with it or whatever.  GoD reverted to the holy trinity, which was a stupid design decision; one that they had earlier recognized was a stupid design idea when they increased druid and shaman healing power a few times so that groups could reliably function even if a cleric hadn't happen to log on that night.  Reinstating that bad design decision had a negative effect on player enthusiasm for the game and therefore on Sony's monthly nugget, no doubt.  Many hybrids and shamans leaving in droves is one sign of that.<br />
<br />
Also, I think like you did that GoD did shock people out of their old ways of thinking and playing, but to the negative of my class, and that's a critical thing chasing people out.  Hybrids faced much the same situation.  <br />
<br />
People who never went anywhere without a shaman suddenly started seeing how crummy shaman are in GoD and that led people to do two things:  start thinking maybe they should try using BL's and chanters more often, and then seeing how well that worked, and never going back.  A vast mental adjustment went on among the common players.  And the new-found insight for the many slow learners in the game applied to previous content to GoD just as easily, so there has been a ripple effect throughout the entire game of shamans being less desired regardless of the level or the group.<br />
<br />
It's rare now, on my server, that you would prefer a shaman over a beastlord or chanter alternative.  People looking for slowers these days, either among friends or guildies or spamming channels and whatnot, from lowbies to time-equipped, advertise &quot;need a BL or chanter for slows&quot; and such.  What happened to the best slower in the game for slows?  Eh, not enough to make up for what he does NOT provide.  Amazingly, the much-vaunted best slower in the game has become superfluous for his core ability, and thus by definition superfluous for everything, considering all his other skills have been toned down to be balanced against the overwhelming benefit of having the game's best version of one of what used to be the most critical spells in the game.<br />
<br />
Something similar happened when Sony adjusted shaman and druid healing earlier.  People who wouldn't be caught dead anywhere without a cleric were the majority.  As the healing ability of other healers was adjusted a couple of times, it took quite a long time before most caught on that druids and even shamans could do actually do healing in a good deal of content, and when it finally caught on among the majority, suddenly druids went from a big-time also-ran class to very desireable, and shamans went from a class that many people had barely even heard of and had little knowledge of to a class widely recognized as having a tremendously useful broad range of abilities.  There was a delayed reaction as the majority of people integrated the obvious:  that shamans were hot stuff.  There is now an opposite trend:  people are realizing that shamans suck.<br />
<br />
Lots of us knew this for some time, and have been dreading the people who play mechanically finally catching on, actually thinking about the game, and telling their friends.  By now, that knowledge has permeated the game, for the most part ending the shaman as a useful class in most people's minds outside of raids.<br />
<br />
GoD introduced a lot of damning ripple effects into the game that have fundamentally changed things for the worse for certain classes, while leaving others okay or even vastly enhanced(the holy trinity is doing a minimal amount of complaining -- I've actually seen an enormous amount of cheering and gloating, personally).</div></div><hr />

BlargX, your grasp of the financial machinations is impressive.  You must be Furor's twin brother, minus the insecurity and buffoonery, but retaining the vast knowledge of the game and the game outside the game (i.e. market forces).  If there was a way for me to subscribe to just your posts I would do it.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm done with the brownnosing now. :P</div></div><hr />

Well, people had a lot of reasons for going back to LDoN, none of which had to do with the content as such (because, be honest, there wasn't any). They went to earn points for whatever they needed. Because other people were going there to earn points, they were convienent place to get pickup groups. Others found something to do by chasing the leaderboard. I've done about 200 or so adventures. They stopped being something I wanted after about 30 or so, but hey! you gotta get your points so you can get your **** ;). There are technically about 40-50 zones in LDoN, but they look like 5, and even in those 5 elements repeat so much that you have a constant sense of deja vu. LDoN population is a lot lower now judging from the number of people hanging around the wayfarer camps, very often they are empty. Once people have the points they need, they go back to more enjoyable parts of the game. Hardly a success. I agree, it could have been, the concept held such promise, particularly with the possibility of dynamically developing content. But it was a major disappointment, at least for me.</div></div><hr />
