I would choose a monk over a warrior for a few reasons...<br />
<br />
-Feign Death (great for CR recovery and splitting mobs)<br />
-Stronger DPS (faster kills)<br />
<br />
I also find monks easier to twink out (no-drop and purchased items)<br />
-Iceburrower Skin of worms in Western Wastes<br />
-MQ Shackle of Tynnium <br />
-Fungi (great for either)<br />
-etc.<br />
<br />
Pretty much anything you will be duoing a monk can tank as well as a warrior (if you need a warrior- its probably too intense of a fight to be duoing...), and the monk's utility will come in handy more for when your shaman gets himself in trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe your incorrect regarding a monks vs warriors tanking ability.  A Warrior can tank much more then a monk due to the better mitigation.<br />
<br />
Might I suggest a different path though?  What about a Mage?  Once you get lvl61, you get Ward of Xegony (Air Pet).  WoX can tank very well through PoP tier 3.  At lvl 66, there is Child of Air.  This pet is a beast.  Mages can solo tier 3 pop with this pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bah, I just wrote a huge essay then remembered I promised myself no more comments on duo threads....<br />
<br />
At any rate, I two box a necro.  Use the search button for the gajillion threads debating pally's vs sk's vs monks vs warriors vs mages vs... etc.. Shaman can duo with anything. All depends on what you like to do.  I farm in dungeons.. alot.  Necro is perfect for that.</div></div><hr />
