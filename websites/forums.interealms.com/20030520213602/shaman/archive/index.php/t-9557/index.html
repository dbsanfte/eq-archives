<br />
1. Nice stats.<br />
2. Frees up turgur slot.<br />
3. No recast time, so can be cast faster.<br />
4. No mana usage.<br />

That bp would be our Elemental armor I think, too good for Ornate imo.  Elemental molds &quot;I believe&quot; drop from T4+ zones.  May be T5 so don't quote me as I'm still in T3 atm.<br />
<br />
What I don't understand is SOE obsession with Dex on shaman armor/weapons.  We don't need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow.<br />
<br />
My only comment is that with focus and spell haste my turgurs cast time is only like 1.8 I think.<br />
<br />
<br />
No recast time would own though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Turgur is 3 sec cast and 2.25 sec recast.<br />
<br />
If 1.8 sec is min with affliction haste, you get 3.6 sec total.<br />
<br />
With this, its 3 sec total, a saving of 0.6 sec.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Turgur is 3 sec cast and 2.25 sec recast. <br />
<br />
If 1.8 sec is min with affliction haste, you get 3.6 sec total. <br />
<br />
With this, its 3 sec total, a saving of 0.6 sec. <br />
<br />
<br />
Only if you are chain casting turgurs will the recast matter.   It only takes 1.7 seconds to cast turgurs the first time.  If you have to cast it again its 2.25 wait or at 3.95 secs from start, 1.7 secs later it will finish, for a total cast time of 5.65 seconds.  Which is faster than 2 casts of the bp of 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
So, for one cast spell is much faster, for chain casting its nearly the same.   Personally I like it but i won't demem turgurs,  honestly I'd rather have Cloud of Grummus on it, since you never know when it will be needed and I rarely have room to mem it.<br />
<br />
Either way, I'm more than happy with it and will be spending whatever dkp i need to get it.  Since bp is one of my last slots to upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thats correct Jaradis. Depends on what you are doing. Ofcourse, after your last slow cast, you have to wait the time it takes for all spells to get usable again. Not sure how long that is. 1-1.5 sec?<br />
<br />
Anyway, seems far superior to having the spell memmed for multiple reasons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">*scratch head* Where do such short recasts of Turgurs come from? My gem doesn't ungrey for a good 6 seconds after I cast. A virtual eternity when you get a resist, or a multiple inc.<br />
<br />
No spell haste, 2 casts of Turgurs takes 12 seconds for me. I can do 3-4 with the BP in that time frame.</div></div><hr />

The BP is much better than the actual spell.<br />

It probably easier to channel as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does this still work? And if it does isnt it an exploit that should get fixed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've got 2.0 recast on Turgur's, but think about it like this:<br />
<br />
Cast Turgurs.<br />
When it's done, immediately click the bp.<br />
If the gems are greyed, click it again.<br />
Cast Turgurs for the second time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">re: instaclick<br />
Doesn't work on VoB, at least.  The gems might come back, but nobody's home.  I'll have to try it elsewhere, tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Instacast items don't refresh greyed out spells anymore (never worked for me at all). They *seem* to be available but you still can't cast the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Phlegma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Even if the clicky greyed bug doesn't work, you can still cast this as a second cast while waiting for gem to clear, and by the time the BP's done casting, you can click gem again.<br />
<br />
I do things along the same lines in groups.  Cast Turgurs, then Immediately click the spear, soon as the spear lands, canniballize, and Immediately click the JBB.  I wouldn't unmem tugurs either, but this would give me the chance to get multiple mobs slowed even sooner.</div></div><hr />

Get lev<br />
get in a small  hallway with 50 of your guildies all leved<br />
now fight 4 mobs, 2 of which split into 2 more mobs each, and 2 of which proc a dispell + flux.<br />
click BP... repeatedly<br />
<br />
enjoy :)<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, the BP is absolutely usefull in numerous ways, its just situational. I won't be unmemming turgur's at raids any time soon personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">This is elemental armor as far as I know so very very few of us will ever get it. While that could be used as an argument for saying that it doesnt matter what spells they put on it that would be far from the truth. Putting better versions of classdefining spells on armor is wrong because then SoE will just have to tune encounters to ensure they are still challenging to the select few meaning they will be much more than challenging to others.<br />
<br />
Debuffs are NOT a good idea on armor since they have way to much influence on encounters. Buffs on the other hand are ok since they affect players. Heals can be problematic and so can DD/DoTs. Its amazing that SoE still dont know what is good and what is bad in their own game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">1) Insta click items to insta refresh spells does work. It does not work on VoB but it will on say Malo/Slow. Cast the spell then immediatly click on blk fur boots then cast the spell again. It is possible to be &quot;to&quot; fast but you can speed up the process with this.<br />
2) I agree with those who don't care for this effect on the BP. This is a spell we already got yet Warriors get a INT caster spell on theirs that they should not have access to. As a matter of fact, true melee items should have nothing but passive effects on them. IE: Aura of battle, Fungal regrowth. Some of the other classes get some pretty decent effects yet we get one of the least troublesome spells to cast. Don't get me wrong I don't hate it but I surely would have put more thought into it. Its probably more to do with Verant trying to address the spell gem shortage for Shm.<br />
3) For the dificulty they need to up the resists. Trust me when I say this, in the elemental planes, if you dont have 400+ on the resists your gonna get owned by the mobs AE. Example (insert name)the Enlightened in PoWater hits for about 1.7k and has a nasty cold based mana/hp dot. When I was in a normal group with about 420 cr I only resisted about 70% of the time. Other mobs in the zone also make for some tough AE's that require insane resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just a speculation here, but I'm thinking that the Plane of Time is tuned so that surviving there without the kind of abilities and stats on these armors will be nearly impossible.<br />
<br />
They're just too good for almost anything else in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">&quot;They're just too good for almost anything else in the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
That doesnt mean they wont be used for anything else.</div></div><hr />
