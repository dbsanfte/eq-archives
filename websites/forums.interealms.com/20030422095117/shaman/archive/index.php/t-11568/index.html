<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently I have finally started making money the way I like, hand over fist.  (I love the bazaar!)<br />
<br />
I have read enough on these boards to know to get a horse as soon as possible, and I am almost able to buy one without taking me back to zero.  I am only going to get a cheap one for the standing mana regen, not for travel.<br />
<br />
My confusion comes into my chest item.  Currently I have Barbed ringmail 30AC +50hps, but I have seen alot that says get a Cere. Iksar Plate or Fungi if you can afford it.  I know the Fungi will not happen anytime soon, but is the Iksar plate worth it?  I would be losing 11AC and +50 hps.  I like to still get in the melee, so I would be a little more vulnerable.<br />
<br />
I am a Barbarian, so no innate regen.  I am only lev 22, so I really don't know how Canni is going to change things.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would stay with what you have until you get Cannibalize, then I'd switch to the Ceremonial BP.  If you feel the need, carry the other with you -- I ended up doing this for a goodly while, and know some shaman that do this with their Fungus Tunic, since it detracts from Dex and Agi.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I decided that the regen on the BP far outweighed the 11 AC loss, and the 50hp that the mail gives you is simply one minute's regen on the Iksar BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with Shandy, switch it out when you get canni.  Makes doing everything else so much easier ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll agree with the other posters as well.  I picked up a Ikky BP when I was in my early 40's and I used it untill 53 when I upgraded to barbed ringmail.  I still carry it with me for when I need the extra boost of hp regen.  But with regrowth now and having many many more HP's than I used to the BP is getting to be less usefull and just more weight to carry around.  <br />
<br />
Eventually Im gonna pass it on to my SK twink for resting during soloing.<br />
<br />
It is a good investment though.  Its in the top 3 purchases ever made, along with my JBB and my horse, Glue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im going to have to disagree id get it asap because the regen is gonna be alot nicer the the extra 50hp because in the course of a fight youll regen a lot more then 50hp so in essence the ceremonial bp will have alot more hp on it then the barbed.  THis is important because at your early 20's you are still doing some tanking and melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mathametically I have to agree with the last poster. If your fights last a minute, then in your first fight you've matched the +50 HP off the Barbed Ringmail. Now every tick you wear that Ikky BP is free hp, which will equal free mana in 2 more levels. Regen items are the best twink items in the game to use for a reason. I scrimped and saved and had a Barbed Ringmail at lvl 37, didn't get an Ikky till 47, and even with what I said above, once I'd gotten my AC close enough to a new mitigation level (That's every 50 AC 700, 750, 800, 850....) I'd take off the Ikky and put on the Ringmail to reach that new mitigation level. Most I can say is that there is never a black and white answer...circumstances will dictate what's best at any given time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What's the feeling on the ikky after you get stoicism?  At that point should we be looking for an AC/hp upgrade instead of the regen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm going to throw my RE BP on and see if I miss it.  I nee to get some plate arms though so I don't look like I have no shoulders ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would say drop your next 10+k on a Tae Ew BP.  45ac, 50hp, tons of stats.  Really a superior quality item!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would say drop your next 10+k on a Tae Ew BP.  45ac, 50hp, tons of stats.  Really a superior quality item!<br />
<br />
The economy on my server, Drinal, is so screwed up that the Tae Ew stuff costs 25kpp.  Lots of other stuff is weird like too.  Some things that should sell for 100pp, go for like 5kpp, and vice versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Once you get stoicism, loose the ikky.  There isn't realy a reason to loose the AC + stats of a better BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Once you get stoicism, loose the ikky.  There isn't realy a reason to loose the AC + stats of a better BP.<br />
<br />
I don't know if i agree here. I'm a 60 shammy with a fungi. Thats 30 hps regen a tick with fungi + regrowth. If im sitting on a horse thats another 3 or 4. So 33-34 or so. Add in 3 for regen 3 and im at 36-37. Thats ALOT of hp regen per tick and it IS noticeable. I have stoicisim but not torpor. Basicly, when i take off the fungi I can still &quot;feel&quot; the difference.<br />
<br />
Alot of times while fighting you dont have time to click stocisim then cani down. You are busy debuffing/slowing, ect. On raids you might be eatting some Aoe's. Thats when its nice to be wearing regen items. You start the fight at 60% hp. You do your thing. You look down and you are at 80% and your main slow/debuf/cripple has landed. Now you can start caniing right away for nuke mana without having to start the stoic thing.<br />
<br />
I guess its playstyle too. I personally will never give up the fungi. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree with you about keeping the fungi.  It is one of the best pieces of equipment for a shaman, but he only has the ikky which is 5hp regen and is not that great as you get higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If I had a fungi instead of an Ikky I wouldnt have traded either.  But Hamman was right, that 5hp/tic gets lost in there when you have regrowth and a horse.  So I opted to lose the 5 hp/tic BP for one with some more AC on it.  And seeing as I am getting sitting regen on the horse, I really only lost 2hp/tic. (I think my sitting regen is 3hp/tic...I'll have to check...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Last I checked I didn't get sitting hp regen on a horse, though that 18hp regen or whatever would be nice.</div></div><hr />
