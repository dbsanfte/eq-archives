<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Shaman-<br />
<br />
Just got Stoicism, serious game-changer, now I'm looking ahead to funding a JBB.  Seem to run 15k+/- range on Torvon.<br />
<br />
Gonna strip myself nekked to to so.<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=494623<br />
<br />
Man that Ikky BP looks a little passe now.  Planning on selling that (7k), REIF (5k), SC Hand wraps(3k), Blight Hammer (500) to fund JBB.  Will keep Barb Spirt Hammer. Sell CC shield for Barb Ringmail to replace Ikky.<br />
(edit- reduced gear to sell, double checked prices)<br />
<br />
Is this a good idea?  From what I've seen on these boards it is, and I'm kinda scared the price on Ikky BP is gonna tank now.  Glad I've still got a full set of totemic in the bank!<br />
<br />
Anyway just looking for a sanity check before I sell-off my prized gear.<br />
<br />
Thanks all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally, I don't think its worth it.<br />
<br />
I play a 46 Ogre Shammy on Fennin Ro and I just recently recieved a JB Bracer as a gift from my older brother, who plays a 60 High Elf Cleric.<br />
<br />
Its nice, but if your going to sacrafice that much for it, its so not worth it. I think theres to much hype around it. Sure you can solo manalessly, but you also need to be able to stand there and take a decent beating while the slowed mob beats on you. JB Bracer generates a lot of argo, and its a big pain in the ass to root and then click bracer, especially with an 8 second cast time. <br />
<br />
Just FYI I can self buff my hp to about 1700 and my ac is 850ish and 179 Wis. With KEI and Stoic + Cana + Chloro you can easily minimize your downtime to maybe a minute longer then what it would be for a JB bracer. (From my experience doing Cana dance with chloro and stoic while having KEI on)<br />
<br />
In groups I don't use my JB Bracer, I change it out and use my Bracelet of the Spirit(charmer or caller, don't remember) with my Chains of the Accused. <br />
<br />
In short, I wouldn't sacrafice that much for a Jb Bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm excellent point..with the advent of stoicism is the mana free damage of the JBB as valuable as it once was?  Hell I can lob in a few Bliz Blasts and DoTs kill the mob with zero manna left , Can down to 10% HP and Stoicism back up...still no downtime.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the comments gang, please keep the comments comming.<br />
<br />
I still think the Ikky Bp has gotta go though, 5 hp regen ain't what is once was to me.  5-7k for Ikky would rock..of course my rogue alt could sure use it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">JBB will essentially powerlevel you from 45-55.  After that it slowly loses its appeal, taking a big hit at 58 (cann4 / KM) and another hit when you get torpor.  I wouldn't sell your other gear to get it.  I should point out though, IMO you're sacrificing way too much hp/ac for wisdom, going by the gear shown in yer magelo profile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OK- but I thought I was in the sweet spot- self buffed 1500hp, 900AC, 176 wisdom.  I traded my jaundiced stuff out to gain manna, hp etc. Sold barbed ringmail for Ikky BP.<br />
<br />
I am sacrificing AC for effects however, spell haste II, mann pres II, afflict eff and extend afflic. I swap out a posion ected wrist (13ac) for the cbb if I'm tanking, but that small change in AC seems to do nothing, so I wear it for effect (I DoT alot).<br />
<br />
I don't get beat on too badly, but that may change as I level.<br />
<br />
Thanks, please keep 'em comming I will be making a major decision pretty soon, and I really respect the knowledge on this board.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think your sacraficing anything for anything. You have a nice balance of AC, Hp and Wisdom IMO.<br />
<br />
As stated above,my level 46 sham is at 1700 hp 850 ac and 179 wis with self buffs, and it may be arguable that I can gimp my wisdom for more ac/hp, but I dont feel the need to. I solo all the time and I can do it fine. I can stand there and take hits while trying to cast slow, and can solo a mob (without JB bracer) using just under 2 bubs of mana. <br />
<br />
You are fine I think, especially for a Barbarian (taking a guess at race from diety) but I still wouldn't sell that much gear for JB Bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">JBB is so overwhelmingly better than that stuff at lvl 45-59 it is laughable.  You will lose a tiny amount of stats, but any stats are a joke compared to the power of TheBracer(TM).  <br />
<br />
Hell, a 45 shaman with Totemic and a JBB won't just out-xp a 45 shaman twinked out in full Skyshine without a jbb, he will completely and utterly utterly dominate him Lennox Lewis vs Pee Wee Herman style.  And your situation is not nearly that extreme, you aren't selling most of your gear, the only real loss being the 5hp regen (haste and weapons mean jack once you have the JBB, and the barb hammer proc is a nice thing to swing between blasts).  <br />
<br />
Buy it, don't look back, and thank me later =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well if you just want to get that bracer as I sure did.  How well does Acrylia Ore sale on your server.  On A Ro it sales for any were from 50-80pp for small block of ore.  I when to Tembrous Mountians where I was able to solo the Aliens and Grimlings looting Ore and Gems.  I regualy was able to port back to the bazaar with full load of junk to sale for about 200pp and 1/2 pack to full pack of ore to sale off in bazaar mode.  Made near 20k in 2 weeks or so and 4 levels.  I probley would made even more if I had started doing the relic pack quests earlier by timing the runner while I was hunting there and turning in the pack for the pattern and saling either the pattern for 400pp or the pack for 800-1000k pp.  You only need about a 21 skill in tailoring to make the threads and cords for the pack that is a no fail combine.  That way you wont even have sale your stuff to finance a bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Agree with Uggok.  JBB is so overpowered from 45 to 58 it is silly.  I would sell all my stuff to get it and wear Giant scalemail from kael if need be or jarcrap armor or totemic or jaundiced bone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The click isn't THAT good. 8 second cast time for 237 damage? Sure its manaless, but its not some godly item you all think it is.<br />
<br />
And what if he wants to group but hes gimped for gear and has no mana or hp to cana back up? Sure he can solo fine, but hes now a gimped slower in the group.<br />
<br />
I dunno about you guys but theres no way I can straight solo. I need groupage to keep my interest level up.<br />
<br />
But I'm glad you were able to raise the plat by yourself without having to sell lots of your gear for the JB Bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd say 45-53 or so it's overpowered. But post 54? not even close it's almost useless when you factor in the fact that grouping in pop is basically guarunteed better exp then anywhere else. <br />
<br />
Is it worth it to sell all your equip? debatable I suppose. If you can requip yourself decently then I'd do it. If not don't the loss of ac will drop you down so much that your gonna get killed when tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">45-57 JBB is by far the best soloing piece of gear for a shaman. I got one when I was 51 and literally leveled 4 times as fast as before. Like someone else said above it loses it's luster once you hit 58 and Kraggs/C4 but even so it's still a great piece for soloing and even grouping in outdoor zones with a horse.<br />
<br />
Not sure on going prices on your server but it looks like you may be selling more than you need to. I know REIF runs for 8-10k on EMarr and Ikky 4-5k. But if you have to sell all you listed then you need to ask yourself how much you solo vs group. If you group more, keep the gear and just keep saving. If solo, get the JBB. With it you will soon be able to solo areas that give nice drops in addition to exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Great comments folks.<br />
<br />
I do solo ALOT do to RL time constraints.  I hope not to have to sell all that gear, it was a worst-case scenario.  Hehe I have to FIND a JBB for sale on Torvon first.<br />
<br />
Also, I hope to regain alot of that gear as I PL my way from 45-54 or so, so hopefully its a temporary downgrade.<br />

Thanks so far, please keep 'em comming.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just got this fine piece of gear last night at level 53.  It took me almost 4 months of no upgrades to save up for it.  Of course the nutty costs of spells slowed me down a bit.  But in general, I spent nothing on gear, I was determined to get this thing.  Finally snagged it for 15k in the baz.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm glad I didn't get this earlier.  Why?  Because my skills would be seriously lacking if I had.  It's too darned easy to just sit there and click this thing.  I can see that if I had this thing at 45, I would be lost without it now.  I like knowing that I don't NEED this bracer to be effective.  <br />
<br />
Having said that, this more than doubled my pace when duoing with a 53SK.  SK's have aggro down to a science, so even chain-clicking, I didn't pull aggro.  And if you really want to watch the damage fly, throw an ebolt on the mob and then start chaining the JBB.  <br />
<br />
In answer to the question.  I would not &quot;sell all&quot; to get this thing.  While it may make you strong soloing or duoing, it's going to hurt you in other situations.  And do you really want to just stand away from the fight and click-click-click-click?  Not me. I intend to whip this thing out when I'm in a bad situation or I'm hell bent for leather on getting a ding.  Otherwise, I'll continue to hone my skills and be the best shaman I can be, not just a clicker.  I view the JBB as an ace up my sleeve, not my livelihood.<br />
<br />
That's my 2cp.  (My last 2cp after blowing my savings on the JBB.)  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">grouping in pop is basically guarunteed better exp then anywhere else<br />
<br />
I don't think this is at all true until the very late 50s. With a JBB, a Shaman can solo xp MUCH quicker than with a full group in any tier 1 plane. <br />
<br />
I can get quicker, more reliable and steady xp in a number of zones, at 55, than I can in a planar group... And i don't wipe ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>adayoner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with the others about the jbb being pretty godly in the 40s.  I remember being 47 when i got mine and taking off 20% of a dkblues hp with one jbb shot.... i dunno but add hasted alpha'd dogdog and your killing at a pretty godly speed.  Shoot i remember trying to power to 51 right before a guild raid and getting a yellow in about 50 min in dl, basically chin pulling and dogdog, jbbing mobs down.<br />
<br />
I do thing you'd be selling a little too much from what it seems for your jbb.  looks like you don't need the blight hammer, i would drop the schw as if you're meleeing the delay on the weapon won't matter with the jbb's 8 sec recast.  If you feel like selling the ikky and can get 5-7 k then go for it.  I would also try farming for a bit of pp in rathe, I know its ususally a hellzone, but with stoicism you shouldn't have much downtime and can probly come out with upwards of 500pp after a kei session ( closer to 1k with a jbb).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">strange cause I had fungi/jbb whatever and at 55/56 I was getting much better exp in pop cy groups then I was soloing. on top of that I'd say level from 55-61 I only had 4 deaths while in a group.<br />
<br />
Guess you need better groups then tall</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">nobody really brings up kei and aego here.  I always get both before I go and fight.  I am almost 35 now and I went for AC on my gear.  My ac is in the 900s and with AEGO my hps are about 2k.  Add kei and I am a soloing demon.  I am currently devouring drolvs and froggies in Firiona Vie (back near the giants in the area like to refer to as the 'dog run' at the swamp zone).  I am using a soulstripper which will start proc'ing at 40 and make me even tougher.  I just slow, debuff and then beat the tar out of the mobs and I can pull 1 after another with no downtime.  <br />
My point is...  wouldn't a jbb be a little pointless since we can now get AEGO and KEI?  I always have atleast 3 bubbles of mana and my hps stay pretty full with regen and an occasional heal.  I am used to standing there toe to toe with the mobs and I haven't ever used the root and rot method.  I solo yellows and reds very often.  With an FBSS and Quickness I probably do about 100 to 150 points of damage in the 8 seconds that it would take to cast with the JBB.  My 1hb will be capped by the time I can use the JBB and I will probably be doing more like 100-200 points of damage in the same time it would take to cast the 250 point damage blast from the JBB. <br />
I am not ruling it out, I just don't see how it would be as useful to me now as it would have been before AEGO and KEI.  Those 2 spells have significantly changed the game.  Please give your thoughts about the JBB with KEI and AEGO in the equation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Aye good point.  <br />
<br />
I have NEVER gotten a KEI.  Its like crack I hear from friends when they need a fix.  I figure I spent my crack money on the horse. <br />
<br />
Now admittedly this is an uninformed opinion, since I never had a KEI, but is 75-100pp or so a good deal (average on Torvon)?  Can you regain that 75-100pp in loot, over and above what you would get with no KEI while using the buff?  Particularly at our relatively low levels.  In the 50's+ with a greater loot pool available it may be a good investment.  Downtime~0 now (but that's with Stoicism) so is there really that large an incremental gain in income/xp?<br />
<br />
While I realize 1 JBB= 150 KEI's (at 100) I can resell the JBB (or other gear, except horsie but thats water under the bridge) and at least break-even. Can you tell I'm an accountant  :p ??<br />
<br />
Personal choice here, but I feel kinda weird buying huge buffs.  Guess I'm kinda independent that way.<br />
<br />
Maybe its just me, but with schw and REIF + 44 haste spell and 200 offense and 190 something piercing I don't do nearly that melee damage.<br />
Fully buffed 200+ str 170+ dex (for procs) my melee still sucks ass.  Spells + hasted &amp; alpha dogdog = damage for Lars.<br />
<br />
But soulstripper is very sweet, only problem is between 9k-18k on Torvon.  Ok, the 18k seller is confused.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input. Please, please keep 'em comming.<br />
<br />
Lars<br />
<br />
EDIT- Imay be wrong on KEi cost/benefit as I may need to check KEI prices.  Like I said I never use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>rosco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I really think using a JBB or not is a matter of choice. Using the epic as well.<br />
<br />
The choice is :<br />
- with JBB and a horse,  casting epic the chain casting JBB, at level 60 you do about 50dps and gain 20mana/tick.<br />
- without JBB and without a horse, you can do the same amount of damage, and canni the mana back.<br />
<br />
(facts for dps calcul : epic is 80sec, add 9sec casting time, add 10 casts of jbb, thats : 1250 (epic) + 2 630 (jbb) =  3 880 damage in 89 sec, that's 43.5 dps)<br />
<br />
Now another point :<br />
- if you're fighting mobs one after another, the calcul above is true. And you'd rather been using the JBB<br />
- But if you have, say, an add. You root/pet/slow/whatever him. If you keep solely chain casting JBB, you'll do damage to one mob only. Id rather been slowing/doting/rooting both of them in this case, and not use JBB, not to break root.<br />
<br />
I'd say, until you have big dps dots (Pox and Bane and epic), jbb is cool for both soloing and grouping. When you have those big nasty dots and torpor, I'd say JBB is cool if you want to relax. After all, chain clicking a bracer is not that hard. JBB is 35dps, so it's not like you did nothing. You actually help your group chain-casting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">75pp on kei? donations here run 15-25pp on ct. I use to give 50pp myself until pop but thats back when I had tons of money to spare. <br />

Good choice getting JBB.<br />
Get the mount.  Actually I use a horse, but yes get the cheapest one.  The only time you will be using it is when you aren't moving so why would care how fast it runs.  The ability to switch out spell gems without gaining sit-aggro is also a very fine benefit of the horse.  You want to know the game changing things:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The only caveat to the JBB is the insane cast time.
