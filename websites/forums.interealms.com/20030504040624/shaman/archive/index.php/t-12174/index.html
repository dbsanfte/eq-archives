<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I finally got all the components needed for this spell. I asked a guild Wizard with 200 Research skill to try the combine for me.<br />
We combined Yaeth's Page 102 Left, Runed Emblem, Rune of Association, Parchement and Quill in his Sorceror's Lexicon and got the message &quot;These items do not combine in this container&quot;.<br />
<br />
What did we do wrong?<br />
<br />
Someone on the crucible channel told me this combine is broken. Is this correct? I play on FV and Primal Avatar is not flagged No Drop for our server but from what I can tell the combine itself is actually bugged.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any thoughts on this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It has a Yaeth's page which is enchanter, a runed emblem, which is mage...are you sure a wizard book is the right one for the combine?  From what I read, even though any int caster can do the combines, they have to be done in the appropriate type of book?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Odds are it uses a page other than what is listed.  If I get a chance I will try with Yaeth's 102 R tonight.  I don't have the left, but can pick up the right cheap enough in bazaar and I have the other two pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I&#8217;d appreciate that Mardark and if you could let me know if it works I would be grateful. I&#8217;m going to have an Enchanter try the combine for me tonight and see if that makes any difference.<br />
<br />
Also, on the EQTraders page that lists the combine recipes, Primal Avatar is one of the few that has a trivial level listed after it, leading me to believe that someone has either succeeded or failed in a combine for this spell &#8211; but in either case has gotten a message other than &#8220;does not combine&#8221;. If you have tried this combine and it has worked (whether succeed or fail) can up post the circumstances &#8211; I.E. exact components and which class combined it using which container?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What kind of container was he trying to do the combine in? For these new researched spells they have to be combined in a different container than the normal researched spells. They need to buy this special research container near the Lighthouse in LoY. More information about this can be found here: http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/LoYresearch.htm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He was using the Sorceror's Lexicon - the Wizard &quot;special research&quot; container.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I may have gotten the recipe wrong, seeing as the one I saw for this spell was at least second hand, but it said 'Yaeth's compendium page 102'.  Seeing as recipe didn't specify right or left I'm guessing you might have to use both right and left sides of the page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You have to use the new spell research book from LoY.  Was that done or did they use the old one they had?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I assume it was the one from LoY - which is listed as the &quot;Sorceror's Lexicon&quot; - which is what he used. All the recipies I have seen indicate only Page 102 Left is needed - I haven't checked the recipe books from the vendor in-game but all the sites I have seen have only 3 components listed - 102L, Rune of Association and Runed Emblem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ya, i was thinking of going and checking the recipe book in game too.  Wonder what it actually says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Found the recipe books in PoK, in the building right by the nexus stone.  Primal Avatar is not a spell listed in the books.  So it kinda looks like it was taken out.</div></div><hr />
