When you want aggro, cast &quot;Flame Lick&quot;, yes your level 9 debuff/dot spell. I was in Kael/Arena when I realised that everytime I cast this I would get summoned, or if I'm tanking along with the MT the mob would instantly turn on me without fail. Not too bad for capturing aggro when you need to, plus it's a 1.5 second cast time. Of course after like 3 or 4 times I used I decided not to be such a hero lolol, no aggro please, hehehe. But the good thing about it is that I saved the shm and druid countless times. Kinda hard to miss the shm getting summoned when a big bear suddenly pops into the middle of your screen. When that happens, cast Flame Lick and then start hitting away on the Jolt key hehehe. Get aggro and lose aggro almost instantly.<br />
<br />
Just thought that I would pass on what small bit of knowledge that I recently learnt. Don't know about anyone else but I never bothered using Flame Lick the moment I hit 15 I think, so this is a fairly new one to me. Always thought that snare was the big aggro generator but this spell takes the cake for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brumla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">any other spell we have cant beat flamelick+tangling weeds combo<br />
<br />
flamelick is dot with + debuffer part<br />
tangling weeds is snare with 0,5 sec casting time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elladan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just remember that if you are grouped with an Enchanter, Tangling Weeds is a lot better option.  It too is fast cast/low mana, but doesn't have a DoT component that breaks mez.<br />
