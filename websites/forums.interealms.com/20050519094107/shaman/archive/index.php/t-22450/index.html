Hobart is a Programmer, he simply implements what the Designers tell him to implement and then documents it.  I agree, he is doing a fine job of it.<br />

The problems we have are with the Designers.  It's Brenlo's problem as well.  There is very little communication to him or us as to what is being discussed on a daily or weekly basis at the Design level.</div></div><hr />

Sudedor i presume youve read &quot;The 10 questions we would like answered&quot; on the SoE boards.<br />
The ill pass it on from the CR and then hearing nothing for weeks isnt exactly good CR.<br />
If the people they passed it onto didnt respond or threw it in the bin any CR worth their salt is going to come back regularly and say &quot; its being looked into&quot; yes i know its lying but thats what a lot of CR is.<br />
If theyre so intent on not lying to their customers then they should come back to their customers and say &quot;sorry the devs wont answer etc&quot; not just totally ignore it.<br />

It is commendable. And I wish more devs would do it. But then we would see exactly who is doing what. And who is spending thier time padding thier post counts Or working on thier rankings in the PvP ladder on WoW or something rather than actually working for SoE.<br />

The dev doing the collision fixing is doing the same thing. He actively solicits feedback which is even better. He is getting so much positive press that people are bringing items only possibly related to collision into the thread in hopes of getting action :)</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what more needed to be said there . . . if an answer hasn't been posted then it hasn't been written . . . I'm a little confused as to what you'd like Brenlo to say . . . the fact that he hasn't posted a response seems to say enough, no?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sudedor, if you want to satisfy the majority, you have to give a status update on a regular basis, even if the update is, there is nothing new to report. That way people know at least someone is still actively looking at it. People want feedback even if it's not progression. If someone says I will get back to when I get a response and you don't hear from him for weeks, you have no idea if he is even employed any more let alone still working on your answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Allow me to say it for him then:<br />

<br />
Khavok's tossed out some good ideas for feedback, tried them on test, and kept some dialogues going with monks and warriors until SoE decided to kill the sucktacular &quot;opening&quot; system.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Its the differecen between Active CR and Passive CR. Brenlo can sit in his office all day and not hear a thing from anyone about anything, and therefore not post . . .<br />
<br />
or . . .<br />
<br />
He can actively talk to the people involved, find out if there have been discussions, find out if changes are planned, being considered, or chucked, and no matter WHAT answers he gets, he tells us, regularly, consistantly. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think the CR people should have a &quot;Twice a Week&quot; statement forum, where only they post, and tell us whats happening. TELLING me that &quot;They havent made a decision on a bigger shaman heal yet&quot; is a helluva lot better than &quot;::cricket chirp for a month::&quot;</div></div><hr />

Correspondents are a first step, alleviating them of a very time consuming process of tracking down all the various boards for each class and reading enough to truly understand.<br />

I hope that as we move forward, we'll see something along those lines develop out of what the SoE boards call &quot;Class Top 10&quot; lists.</div></div><hr />

There are at least 48 boards among the 16 classes of Norrath, assuming that each class has only one external board.  Not to mention any tradeskill, raidcentric, etc board.<br />

<br />
I can definately see him picking one board per day to read and respond to.  Then it might take 3 weeks to make the class rounds.  Not as often as some would like, but a lot more frequent than history would show.<br />
<br />
And the 48 boards is quite an exxaggeration dont you think?  Almost all classes have an accepted central board for quite some time.  Of course if you add the 3 different forums for each class that sony set up for itself, then you could be correct about the number.  Seems wierd to make more forums when there are generally accepted forums already in existence with a high number of posters of each class.</div></div><hr />

I forwarded the 10 questions along and am awaiting a response. As soon as I have one I will post it.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I see statements this criptic and lacking in real information I tend to make an effort to read between the lines. Doing so, based on the last 5 years of dealing with this same type of &quot;answer&quot;, I came up with this:<br />
<br />
&quot;I have routed the 10 questions through our circular file system. As soon as any question that was on the list is addressed as the result of someone accidently doing something about I will grab the opportunity to post my &quot;active involvement&quot; in seeing this issue through to resolution.&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Pardon the above - I am not as bitter as that makes me seem. It was meant as humor. Regarding Brenlo, however, his posts are condesending, pedantic, flippant and, when he &quot;informs the community&quot; weave a nasty web of double-speak. His statements mean absolutely nothing. He is not informing. He is not rationally explaining. He is just ... answering. Answering is not always providing an answer. Subtle difference.<br />
<br />
I have forwarded memos/lists/etc. &quot;along&quot; many, many times and without some 'flag of importance' or a company focus on the memo contents it means nothing. Forwarding just means it is off his desk - if in fact it was ever forwarded. I have a few &quot;forwarded&quot; items in my inbox now. Unless it addresses something I am actively working on, expecting or have been pre-informed to expect and act on, that memo will sit there until I have time to take a look at it. Even then, 99% of the time I will consider it informational material only and go back to what I am focused on accomplishing at the moment. This is how it works. If it aint flagged priority, it aint priority.<br />
<br />
If these were active, important SOE focused issues the statement would of read more along the lines of: <br />
<br />
&quot;This list was discussed at our last issues meeting. Those responsible for the areas each item falls into are reviewing them. Please remember, these folks have lots on their plates so getting a correct answer back will take some time. I will continue to bring this list up at our issues meetings until each question is addressed. I will provide you with information as it comes to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The difference is active pursuit of answers and inactive &quot;hope to catch it when it happens.&quot; A real community representative would actively address the questions at every opportunity to get the answers and then communicate back to the ... community. Brenlo is not a community representative. He is, despite the hug-me attempt early on, Community Relations. Read, Public Relations. He is the first corporate wall of apathy, indifference and bottlenecking between the customer and the company. He does his job well. He knows the majority of players are mushrooms and he only has to keep them in the dark and feed them bull****.<br />
<br />
The decent posts coming out are from those folks (devs, programmers) who are somewhat like the players. Interested in the game. Maybe not in the same way - but interested just the same. Given the chance to tweak this or change that or design this 'whole new thing' they are in their version of game happiness. I would be willing to bet that collectively the programmers/devs have some very cool and innovative ideas for game changes that would make us all go &quot;WOW!!&quot; (and not in a World of Warcraft way) Chances of us seeing these changes are minimal - though some will be incorporated into the next and next and next expansion.<br />
<br />
Likely, as SOE works to minimize the player moaning they do the same inside the company by limiting what the development and programming teams could actually achieve and implement by keeping them short staffed, a majority focused on developing new expansions and the whole department further compartmentalized so that one programmer or group doesn't know what the other is doing.<br />
<br />
Take this for what you will, just a thought.</div></div><hr />

Frankly, I am beyond thrilled that we get anything back from LDoN gear.  Much of the NODROP gear can only be destroyed when it is upgraded.<br />

Not exactly.  If you look and read carefully, you'll notice that what we perceive to be the &quot;good&quot; posts are coming from Programmers only.  The people who do the actual implementation.  What we lack are posts from the Designers, those who make the decisions about what to implement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even leasing something you pay more for it than buying it outright.<br />
<br />
Think of the 30% as a usage fee if that helps at all. The time you used it goes into that cost. Most RPG's only give back half value of something 70% is pretty nice of them.  (DM guide in DnD and Several other games sell back or purchase price for items is where I got that value from)<br />

Hobart is a Programmer, he simply implements what the Designers tell him to implement and then documents it.  I agree, he is doing a fine job of it.<br />

The problems we have are with the Designers.  It's Brenlo's problem as well.  There is very little communication to him or us as to what is being discussed on a daily or weekly basis at the Design level.<br />

It's really not difficult to spend a bit of time every couple of days browsing through messages.  I never said I read every thread.  After all, how many times would YOU read a thread on &quot;Is Canni 2 worth getting&quot; or &quot;Which is the best race?&quot;  I could, however, have damn well identified 5 of the top bitches/requests each class had before it was posted, reposted, discussed, hashed over, nit-picked, voted on, taken down, and re-voted upon.<br />
<br />
But then, I'm easily amused and thrive on observing petty and pointless bickering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Monday July 12th Update 5:00pm<br />
<br />
- The &quot;Spell recovery not yet met.&quot; bug is fixed<br />
<br />
- Changed LDoN equipment buy back to 70% of the original cost.<br />
<br />
And there was much rejoicing!<br />
<br />
Im very happy to ge getting 70% of points back.  I've got a few pieces in the bank that do me no good.  Now I can put them to good use.  So its a 70% increase over what I get today; thats a good upgrade in anyones book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Not joking.  I think it's great we are getting something back as well, however, why penalize us 30%?  What is the justification for that?  We put alot of time and effort into gaining those points...30% penalty is too much.<br />
Did you use the item at all? Come on, this is like some bad dream, people complaining about &quot;only&quot; getting 70% back. When you bought it, it was ZERO back. You do know that, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I'm fairly thrilled by the 70% back thing.  When it goes live, I'll be at the LDoN merchant spending my 4000 banked LDoN points on something I can use for the next few months instead of waiting for the &quot;elemental level&quot; gear to go live.  I'd have felt really stupid spending all my points on something that would become obsolete a month later.  Luckily (or unluckily depending on how you look at it), I have enough gear spots that would be upgraded by existing high end LDoN armor/augs, that it makes a lot of sense to spend the points immediately on something I can use, expecting to pay a 30% rental fee, rather than continuing to wait for rumored &quot;better stuff&quot; which who knows when it will arrive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Sudedor I was making the point that people appreciate communication and using the hyperbole of not knowing if he was even still employed. I guess plain text has a way of being taken too literally. Just giving some advice I have learned along the way in my time as customer service. Dunno why really since I doubt it will be taken in any form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">OMGZ Brenlo should work 20 hours a day!!!111! Give the guy a break, Rome wasn't built in a day. He has legions of other people whining tons louder than the shamans.<br />
<br />
Justin - first off - boy bands suck.  There is something very scary about 30-something year old men singing to screaming 14 year old girls.<br />
<br />
Second - while nobody is suggesting that Brenlo work 20 hours a day, certainly here in the REAL WORLD, that is not uncommon.<br />
<br />
Third, no Rome wasn't built in a day. However, EQ has been around FIVE YEARS.  Certainly by this time there should be a working client-customer relationship and / or  mechanism.  There is neither.<br />
<br />
Finally, yes, people are whining loudly.  However, perspective please.  Let's look at things impartially.  Shaman have fallen to number three (and by a pretty sizeable margin) healer among priest classes after traditionally at least being equal with Druids.<br />
<br />
Compounding that &quot;nerf by neglect&quot; is the fact that the Shamans CORE ABILITY - (that be slow NOT buffs) is now mitigated.<br />
<br />
So yes, Shaman do have something to &quot;whine about.&quot;<br />
<br />
And did I mention that boy bands suck?</div></div><hr />
