<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sshawnbrewer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so whats better EQ2 or WoW? i realize that ill get all opinions but im kind of confused on what to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am having a lot of fun in WoW. I have not played EQ2 nor do I intend to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have played eq2, and well its almost like playing eq1 but with steeper system requirements and dying during tradeskills like smithing.<br />
<br />
i would rather play wow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EQ 2 is actually nothing like EQ 1. It seems almost everything WoW players like about WoW is available in EQ 2 with the exception of PvP.<br />
<br />
Soloing, great tradeskilling system, tons of quests, both have it. Though EQ 2 is more demanding for system requirements.  <br />
<br />
A lot of people will bash EQ 2 for the sake of it being Sony's new game. Which can easily be understood given how much they let EQ 1 go to the crapper, but it's a new team working the game and with some serious competition out there now they've really been on their feet. When problems rise up, they fix it quickly. I'm still getting used to it as I often find myself searching for news if Hell has frozen over.<br />
<br />
In short, neither are better. Both are great choices. You just need to choose yourself. If you're into PvP or want to enjoy an entirely new world, the choice is easy, go WoW. If you like the lore from EQ1 and have a great system, EQ 2 is a great option.<br />
<br />
As for dieing by tradesklling in EQ 2, that's only in theory. I've never seen it happen myself. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What Uthgar said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I played EQ2 for the five days I waited between the end of WoW beta and its release.  I found EQ2 to be very much like EQ1 in theme, very much like SWG in graphics and interface, and something else I can't put my finger on - it's like the game is &quot;flat.&quot;  I don't get a sense of depth (in both graphics and backstory/theme) in EQ2 like I did in the first 15 minutes of WoW.  EQ2 is very playable, but I prefer WoW for the engrossing atmosphere..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The long term of WoW is unknown, but it's definetely worth experiencing. It will make you realise just how little care and effort SOE had been putting into EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Regardless of EQ2's merits, WoW is an outstanding game and lots of fun.  All the EQ2 screenshots I have seen look like ass, and I have a long-standing grudge against SOE, as well as a general lack of faith in their ability to make a good game.  That made it an easy decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I messed around with EQ2 at a friend's house when he bought it and have watched him play. Personally, I'm not impressed by the graphics and the gameplay is just more of the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">WoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Friends at work are playing EQ2. I've seen it and farted around on one of their accounts during beta.<br />
<br />
Played WoW ST1, ST2, OB.<br />
<br />
I chose WoW. <br />
<br />
As someone else mentioned, something about EQ2 just didn't &quot;feel&quot; right to me where WoW did. To each his own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hangman S'Noose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hands down WoW......I rarely say &quot;never&quot; aboaut anything but I will never go back to EQ in any form :) Lovin' WoW ------ so easy to just get lost in the depth of the game.<br />
<br />
Hangman<br />
&quot;Madness takes its toll; Please have exact change ready&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Best thing to ask would be what do those playing the game of their choice enjoy so much about it. Get good feedback from both games and judge from there.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, asking most WoW players what they think of EQ 2 will result in how much they think it sucks despite either not playing it and seeing just screenshots or playing it very briefly and never actually getting anywhere in it.<br />
<br />
I haven't played WoW, but the screenshots I've seen I found are not at all impressive but I won't be quick to judge the game based on that. With either game to get a real opinion one would have to actualy play and work at the game and experience it first hand.<br />
<br />
I'd simply ask here what people like about WoW, then take the same question to an EQ 2 board and ask people what they think about their game. Though try to refrain from mentioning the other game. Say EQ on a WoW board or WoW on an EQ board and you'll get an influx of mud slinging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I haven't played EQ2, and I confess a morbid curiousity, but after the last couple expansions of EQ1 and SWG it's nice to out from under SoE's yoke.<br />
<br />
WoW is a blast.  I expected a lot and was not disappointed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Just read this in the other forum:<br />
<br />

As an added benefit for our Station Access subscribers, we are pleased to announce that all Station Access accounts now include four additional EverQuest II character slots. This brings the total available character slots up to eight for our Station Access subscribers.<br />
<br />
ROFLMAO!<br />
<br />
Did I mention how nice it is to be away from SoE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">FYI, there is a side by side comparison of the two games at http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/572/572447p1.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks Scalia! That was an excellent read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Some surprise ratings, but there were very few points in that article I'd dispute.  Nice summary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Nice article Scalia.  I'm pretty much in agreement with all of the ratings (in my limited EQ2 experience).  The author did a nice job of helping potential players decide which game's style best fit in with their interests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">EQ2 hands down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">EQ2 hands down.<br />
/chuckle  :)  Fly away little seagull.<br />
<br />
Like I said, different styles for different interests.  Looks like the author of the comparison and many of our interests are close in comparison.  Refresh's may differ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I saw what eq2 looks like the other day at a friend's place.<br />
The graphics quality of the characters and textures and stuff I think is far superior in eq2.<br />
The way they do stuff like shadows properly mapping onto other players armor when you pass in front of them is big.<br />
Stuff like rocks actually look like rocks as opposed to rock shaped 3d objects with rock textures painted on to resemble a rock.<br />
<br />
I talk to a coworker about the similarities and differences between the 2 games, and when it comes to tradeskill interfaces, quest interfaces, and stuff like that, the two games are the same.  The UI is very very similar and you can tell there was a lot of borrowing of ideas from one another.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen much of the storyline in eq2 or heard about it.  I don't even know if there is much storyline.  The quests that I've had for the Tauren shaman though are amazingly well written.  The quests link into each other in meaningful ways.  The areas you hunt in are logicly laid out for a good progression when levelling and questing.  I had more storyline happening in WoW in about 1 hour of gameplay than I had in total of all of eq.  The reasons why you are hunting X creature for this npc make sense.  For example, this goblin in Booty Bay is a leatherworker making shoes.  He wants you to go out and do multiple quests for him hunting different creatures for their skins and other item drops.  Once you finally get the different type of drops that make sense as to why he'd want them, he thanks you, and says he's got some leftover materials to make you a new set of boots too.  This makes a hell of lot more sense than random X npc saying &quot;I hate badgers!  Go kill some for me and bring me their tails!&quot; or whatever.  The progression of jungle animal hunting in Stranglethorn vale is another good example, where there's a hunting expedition stationed along the river asking you to join up with their hunt and find certain creatures in the area, going up in level each quest, and having to hunt down big nasty named mobs.<br />
<br />
For me though, I'll never be trying eq2.  I vowed long ago to never ever buy another SOE game because of how they refused to learn how to properly patch and put out expansions for eq.  Wow has been very fun and I'll be sticking with it for my main entertainment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I never planned to play eq2 or WoW after i eventually quit eq1 but i accidentaly got into WoW beta and it totally sucked me in. I dont care 1% what eq2 is like as i have found the game that suits me perfectly and i have no intention to upgrade my PC just to try out EQ2. I even got ppl from my old  gang to start with me once it lauches in Europe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Here's my 2 cents for what it's worth. No need to flame if you disagree, that's cool if you have a different opinion, no big deal.<br />
<br />
WoW is surprisingly more like early EQ1 than EQ2 is. Early EQ1 had this sense of many different moods and flavors to zones, of a lot of in jokes and humor, stylized graphics that were simple but effective. WoW has all that, it does a good job of bringing back that early EQ1 magic in an updated form. If you miss those days and cherish them, then this is the game for you.<br />
<br />
EQ2 is more of a next generation mmorpg, it has more advanced graphics, tradeskilling and a few other things including wide use by NPCs of talking to the point where when you play EQ1 and WoW the game seems oddly silent by comparison. If you want the latest best type of mmorpg, in the sense of feeling cutting edge, then this game is probably more for you.<br />
<br />
They are both good games, you can't really go wrong with either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">/chuckle  :)  Fly away little seagull.<br />

lol, what can I saw that hasn't already been said about either game.  I have played them both and I just didn't &quot;get hooked&quot; on wow as fast as I got hooked on EQ.  I have always liked the storey line.  I like what they did with the new lore.  I like seeing Lucin shattered across the sky.  I just like the game.  It just gets frustrating seeing eq peeps bash wow and wow peeps bash eq.  So I just left a simple answer  :p .<br />
I don't know what it is with the warcraft story line...I just couldn't get interested in it.  What are ya going to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Canceled my 6 accounts. That say enough? WoW rocks if only cause you can solo when you need to. That being said there are ALOT of clowns in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The more I sample both these games, the more I&quot;m convinced that 80% of EQ2's negative image among many players is due to the awful artwork, character models, zone looks and stuff. The actual game play is pretty darn good, but there just are no &quot;wow&quot; factors among the graphics in EQ2 as their are in World of Warcraft. Sony should get new artists pronto, they are letting the game design team down.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't really much better (or even that much different) than EQ2 but it has this very cool stylized look that goes a long way to creating a fun experience.</div></div><hr />
