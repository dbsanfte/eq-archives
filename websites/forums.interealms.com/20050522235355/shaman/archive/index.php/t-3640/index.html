<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anyone know an average (I know it varies by server) price on these items? Also what general level could a shaman start hunting for these pieces. With stats like that I am sure its well out of my price range atm but one of these days when I am rolling in plat I will be looking to upgrade and am trying to get as many configurations of eq as I can to try and maximize my PP/Uber Gear ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Average level to hunt Cazic Thule is 60. Prices are somewhere between &quot;a lot&quot; and &quot;not sold&quot; on these items on most servers. That will change of course as they become more common - but will take a while.<br />
<br />
I love that Archon camp too. I also have the superfun Hammer of Spiritcalling, but my cleric friend has the only Raptor Tooth Bauble that Terrorclaw has coughed up for us so far.<br />
<br />
Also from that camp:<br />
<br />
Earring of Pain (I currently wear one of these)<br />
Tae Ew Ritualists Mask<br />
Lizard Bone Earring<br />
Fleshgrinder<br />
Lizard Tooth Earring<br />
Barbed Rubicite Coif<br />
<br />
Still looking for info on the Piranha Tooth Necklace though - I also suspect it must be rare off a named fish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've killed fishes for Experience. They're actually quite under-rated. Relatively easy to single or double-pull, pretty low hp, plentiful. <br />
<br />
And one named fish (Silverfang) drops the Silverfang club. A very nice little monk 1hb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you get lucky you can get in a CT group prior to 60. I got lucky and got invited at 55 since one of my friends was the group leader. We were fine until the cleric had to bolt :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is technically 2 fish camps.<br />
One on way to blue/green pools (ring of slime area) and 1 on way to the sewers. Both are seldom hunted because most people abhor fighting in water so loot is less well known. <br />
<br />
As for the piranah necklace, I would guess it's off a named fish that spawns on the way to the green/blue pools. The named one in the sewer area drops the spiked items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dropped offa named .. eer something <br />
nice hp/sta</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">dropped off a named fish in the blue pool, the pool before the ally with slimes leading to the green pool. it wasn't really 'named' like 'Silverfang', it was just something like 'a razortooth pirahna' or something, different from the normal ones....sorry forgot the name but i think it was something with razortooth.<br />
<br />
great neck :)</div></div><hr />
