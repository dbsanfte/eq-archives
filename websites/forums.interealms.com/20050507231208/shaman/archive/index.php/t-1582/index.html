<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought the patch said that cast time on right-clicks were reduced again. Is this not the case?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think so... I was JBB'ing like crazy last night and the time didn't seem any different to me.  Do you mean that the mage focus items were now supposed to work with right-click items?  If so, I certainly hope you're right!  I didn't have any focus items last night, so I can't speak to that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The patch let focus item extend the durations of items that cast buffs, then they had to make a special exclusion for donal's bp.  :)</div></div><hr />
