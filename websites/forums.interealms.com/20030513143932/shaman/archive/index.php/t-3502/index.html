<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was thinking of a variation of the old Drop a rogue way.  Have a Cleric DA himself, get him/her &amp; a mage to jump off from Paineel.  Cleric res mage and then mage CoH everone down from zone in.<br />
<br />
Anyone done it this way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>slitherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">justr fight your way their get a monk a couple clerics and about 15 rangers so they can do their hole epic part and it right on the way take you about 3hours tops. then when you get to the undead tower UI and go up to kirn and kill him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">take a group in and kill down, since they changed it so that mobs are mezzable, you should have no problems long as you have a chanter and a decent group...great xp as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, Hole's a whole lot easier now.  I hated it before, now things are much nicer.  Of everything, this was the toughest part when I did it.  I've recently helped a friend do it, and it was much much much much much easier.<br />
<br />
Much.</div></div><hr />
