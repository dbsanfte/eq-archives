<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">- Aim of Gindan replaced with Talisman of Alacraty (group haste).<br />
- Talisman of Gindan replced with Tiny terror (group Shrink).<br />
- Strength of Diaku changed to single target strengh and dex buff.<br />
- Talisman of Diaku now a group strengh and dex buff.<br />
<br />
OK, so the last two spells are still largely useless to us, but we get group haste which is a godsend.  We also have group shrink, while hardly worthy or a 65+ spell, it's useful and it's called 'Tiny Terror' which deserves some bonus points alone.<br />
<br />
OK, so it's not 100% better, but I think it's a fairly reasonable compromise.  It appears that shaman concerns are being addressed of late, I think it's very encouraging.<br />
<br />
Alchemy - Getting better.<br />
Rare spells - Much more available.<br />
Cop out 65+ spells - Great improvement.<br />
<br />

Maybe this will shut up the anti-whine brigade for a while, as well as the whiners. :)</div></div><hr />
