<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hopp Along</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question:<br />
I have been noticing with my new shaman that many times (not every) if I cast a buff on a party member while the buff is fading, they will get the message that they received the buff.  Then within one tick they get a message that the buff faded.  ***?  Is this related to some of the posts that I read about the server and client communication timing/lag problems?<br />
<br />
<br />
Background:<br />
The group member is a housemate of mine and I have been watching both screens when this has happened.  Second we have a cable modem, so normal lag is low.  Both our PC are AMD 1400 or better.  Both our Video cards are GeForce 3's or better.  Both PC's have 512Meg RAM.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is anyone else having these problems?<br />
