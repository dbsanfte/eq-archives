<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After 6 weeks i finally made it to level 54 but now im stuck.  Most of my old standby xp places are becoming light blue to green to me, and most of the places in luclin or velious where i can actually solo its almost not worth it due to the insane hps of some of the mobs.  Can anyone recommend a decent place where i can go to, to solo when i am not able, or dont have the time for a pickup group?  <br />
<br />
p.s. Keep in mind that I do NOT have LoY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tailz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've only been there at my current level (55), but give Maiden's Eye a whirl...try and grab a spot just outside to the right of the DSP zone and pull goranga gatherers, and see how you do. The only problem with ME is trains, and there's not really a safe place to the left of the DSP zone where you won't get adds.<br />
<br />
Failing that there's the rockhopper cave in DSP (some might be light blue), or the guards in Katta (there's a good spot near the mansion area)...but that's a long run from the nearest PoP book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was on dundoalak's Run ( sp ) and the xp was not that good.. i'm lookn for places where i can get 1% a kill.. <br />
<br />
doing ooze's in PoD is ok, but they have alot of hp and arn't fun when root breaks, but doable, just slow.</div></div><hr />

hhk <br />
<br />
raptors in TD  (off peak)<br />
<br />
Hornets nest in BWood...maybe to many lblue tho.<br />
<br />
Duo in chadok?  on chadok faction so never hunted here really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Level 53 was my bummer, but so far level 54 is flying by.  If you cant get into a pop group then just go late at night and solo in Karnors, Ive been gettin about 1% per kill (not all but most).  The mobs are easy, dont have tons of hp, and can drop some loot.  You can single pull just about everything in this place.   Gets even better if you have a monk partner :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did 53 and 54 at seafuries. Some are light blue at 54, but they are so easy that it made it worthwhile even with a few light blues thrown in.  Cash is ok if you get the occasional gem drop.  Really they are cake.   Add JBB/epic and well, they are not even the least bit challenging.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the advice guys.  I finally made it through 54 and 55 grouping in PoN/PoD with soloing in maidens eye or PoJ when I couldnt get a group.  Got my grummus flag at 56 and have been hunting in crypt of decay for the past 1.5 levels.  Mobs are surprisingly easy to slow there and the xp from even the trash mobs is amazing.  Am now 3/4 of the way through 57, so should get 58 today. :)</div></div><hr />
