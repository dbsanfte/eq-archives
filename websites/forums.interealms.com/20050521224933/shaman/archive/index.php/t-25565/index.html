<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One thing I really love is seeing new places and doing new things,<br />
In the past I've tried some adventurous things.<br />
<br />
I'm just looking for fun mobs to kill while LFG, kinda getting sick of farming loyalist faction in DS.<br />
<br />
just looking something I could solo or just throw together a couple of people. Dragons, Old bosses, interesting situations with certain mobs.<br />
<br />
I've attempted to solo Gore twice now. first time, I got her to 80, second 60. highly MR, but was fun to try.<br />
<br />
I took out Keeper of Souls in PoSky when two group raid just wiped (mob was at 50%, but still, its interesting to take out a mob like that in less than 30 secs when his DT refreshes)<br />
<br />
I break out my Pile Driver and beat down the Cliff Golems in OT all the time.<br />
<br />
I'm sure everyone has their own stories, and I'd love to hear them along with suggestions and/or strats on what to go after next :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">anything you find easy to solo that involves tanking, try it unbuffed...it makes a world of difference and puts fun back in the fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apocobring1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">while this sure as hell isn't profitable, full of XP, or even really worth your time - but still<br />
<br />
nothing makes me more happy than just going and clearing out all of CB before it can respawn<br />
<br />
*shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nah....was thinking more along the lines of BIG mobs....stuff you can tell stories about...CB is something you do when you hit lvl 35, for revenge for all the hard times it gave you as a newb...<br />
<br />
when I hit 55 I cleared Raptor Island in TD, those raptors killed me so many times when I was trying to do my canni 2 quest.<br />
<br />
I just like to try new things...heh...I'm the crazy shammy that will try anything...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Work your way down to Trak's Lair in Seb. Try him or not, but Jumpy is still there and I can say with confidence you will be fighting 2-3 juggs and/or frogs/shrooms in lots of spots. Great fun to see how far you can go as they still do decent damage to you at 69/70.<br />
<br />
Another spot is the Hole, deeper in. Mobs are blue and don't come single.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">During my last week or so of playing (this was about 5 months ago) I went and revisited my dragon friends in Western Wastes.<br />
<br />
One at a time? Cake<br />
<br />
Two at a time? Pie<br />
<br />
Three at a time? Fun !<br />
<br />
These were the nest dragons along the coast as well as the dragons right outside ToV on the walls.<br />
<br />
Obviously without being able to keep many buffs up (3 insta clickies, but with 3 dispelling dragons, it's still hard to keep anything up) it was a challenge for having 3 at once. I mean, they're dragons!<br />
<br />
I wasn't very highly geared... I think I was around 5300 unbuffed, Bloodlink, TA, Ikkinz ring... I'm not really sure what else. Had all my spells except GOD.. only had Nihil from that expansion.<br />
<br />
Anyways, if you're looking to have some fun, give it a shot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pecannius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, soloing those dragons outside of ToV is very fun, BUT there are some wandering dragons that cast some really nasty gravity flux.  With levitation dispelled, it does about 900dmg a smack. This makes things more interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Who gets things dispelled? I mean really.  Sow boots, coldain ring, VT shield or cloak, throw in a gobbo earring and a spyglass if you're feeling nutty.  There's even instant lev, from Cazic Thule zone!<br />
<br />
Like, it's kinda hard to stay buffed against Sontalak, but not against the Dar brood.  Lol, gotta say though, I'm usually too lazy, and just go at em unbuffed =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kland's AE doesn't dispel by buff order.<br />
<br />
That being said, I fought him for like 5 min solo and was still at 85% mana, but I couldn't bypass his regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dohrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Try Praetorian in Grieg<br />
<br />
I got him at 90% on first try, at 40% on second, I shall use Spiritual Channeling next time and finish it.<br />
<br />
BTW he has good MR and regen, bring Blood of Yoppa or expect to fail<br />
<br />
Doh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Praetorian Myral, with the DA hammer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>dohrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Praetorian Myral, with the DA hammer?<br />
<br />
yep, the same, just dont be hit and DA wont help him...</div></div><hr />
