<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am sorry to bitch here ... but here it goes...<br />
<br />
I have Read in one post that i started today as well as at least one another new post. How NOT having GoD spells is a BAD thing... Your Not Trying to groups your not doing this your not doing that... And if you DONT have YOUR GoD Spells HOW did you Get your POP Spells? Did You TRY and Get Them or Did you Buy Them?<br />
<br />
Why do I have to Follow any of this?<br />
<br />
I play the way I play... I dont have any GoD Spells. If I ever get any well good for me? I guess? if I do decide to go to GoD Zones without my guild and heven forbid i get one of these spells... Does this make me a better Shaman? I wonder after reading some of the arguments about people not trying...<br />
<br />
I do not belong to a raiding guild... Vindi is about where my guild is at if we raid and have enough people on and he is up... etc etc.. <br />
<br />
Since getting married last jan i dont play much. and i like doing LDoN or BoT... <br />
<br />
I know everyone is intitled to there opinion on this board. And its only a few people saying this, but I dont think that I or others should have to read that they are not trying if they dont have certain spells or how they got them.<br />
<br />
again Sorry for bitching....<br />
<br />
Flame Away!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">totally confused what your point is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having GoD spells makes you a better shaman provided you're not an idiot to start with. Not having GoD spells does not make you a crappy shaman, it just means you're not the best you could be. Capitalizing every other word makes me have to read your post twice.<br />
<br />
My advice. Get a strong warrior, a cleric, yourself, an enchanter thats not a moron, a ranger thats not a moron and some other class, and go to Vxed. Don't worry about getting the flag or whatever. Clear up the right side and eventually youll see a room off of the main  path that has 5 pookas  in it. One of the pookas is the ph for Chavoor the Trickster. He can drop spells. Also above and below this part of the main path are cragbeasts. Kill these too as they can spawn Umbiki the named cragbeast when they respawn. I find this is the easiest camp for spells, and is where I got my heal and slow. Eventually you'll get KT flagged and you can get trushar off of named there. Since they upgraded HoT's the quiesence now is like what trushar was when i first got it, so no real hurry there. And don't ex[ect to ever see the canni spell unless youre in a hardcore raiding guild.<br />
<br />
Hope some of this helps, just don't expect to get your spells fast. I camped Vxed for 2 weeks straight to get mine, and that was before they made the spells that dropped able to be turned in by anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't be sorry.  Most of the friction between the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have nots&quot; is based on what you are doing about it.  <br />
<br />
From your post here it does not seem like you are trying to get the spells, nor are you too worried about it.  That does not make you a better or worse anything.<br />
<br />
Some people, however, like to state that they want the spells but they are too difficult to get...FSOE...can't wait for WoW...shaman are broken...blah blah blah.   Yet some may not spend much time in GoD.  Go figure. <br />
<br />
 When Gates came out I spent most of my free time there with very little success.  Very few guildies wanted to be bothered with it at that time.  Within a few months of farming, I had my first spell.  Then another...then finally i got the slow from a sewer farming crew in the guild.  <br />
<br />
People will give tips on how to go about getting them.    Ranting about SoE and ubers and guilds will get no &lt;3 from me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well then you'd better close your eyes or ignore half the ubers, because that is the lamest thing i've ever heard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ranting about SoE and ubers and guilds will get no &lt;3 from me.<br />
<br />
Just like people with time loots and more than 500 AAs saying that GoD spells are not difficult to get will get no &lt;3 from me.<br />
<br />
So many things are much easier for the &quot;haves&quot;. A couple of the key factors are:<br />
<br />
- the ability to put together at wellknit group with very good equipment<br />
- the ability to get back exp fast if they should die trying something<br />
<br />
To me its obvious that the risks and challenges that &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;casual&quot; people face in expansions like GoD are far greater than what the dear ubers face. Yet the reward is the same. And I wouldnt be surprised if OoW is more of the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't ever recall saying that it was easy - moreseo that it was doable.  <br />
<br />
By the way, the rewards would be comparitively higher for the &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;casual&quot;...no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Getting level 65 spells isn't so much hard, as it is slow.<br />
This is coming from someone with about 350AAs, 1/2 Time/GoD gear, 1/2 ele plane gear, and all their spells minus ancient canni.<br />
I just recently managed to get my new heal spell while farming sewers for bic drops.<br />
I got my heal over time very easily due to the sheer number of jelki runes that drop in ikkinz and KT.<br />
I very much lucked out and got my slow spell when one of my best in game friends was farming zone in of KT, and the slow spell dropped with no shaman in group (back before runes dropped).  I happened to be in Qinimi at the time and ran over asap.<br />
I remember getting my level 65 spells.<br />
I had to farm bot named mobs for ages to get most of my spells.<br />
This was back before zones opened up to everyone due to level, and before they had their drop rates adjusted.<br />
<br />
Most any groups nowadays can kill bot named.  They spawn every 6 hours.  You can time when they die, and get a group ready to jump them when they spawn to increase chances of them dropping for you.  There are many times pickup raids on targets that drop runes.  Brell has pickup raids on some elemental plane targets in fact, and anyone regardless of guild status can generally get ele plane flagged.  Also, runes do in fact drop in Sol Ro tower off named mobs, if you go into mini bosses sections.  Or, you could just farm stuff for cash and buy the spell, or if a high end guild person has runes they are trying to sell, see if they want some good tribute items in trade.<br />
<br />
The eril rune isn't much harder to get than the runes from pop.  If you can farm a bot named, you have a group capable of hunting in the sewers in god.  The sewers are in fact decent xp, compared to say tier 3 xp zones, and can be quite comparable to ele planes.<br />
<br />
Jelki is harder to get, but mainly because you have to find 5 other people willing to go through tipt.  Once you get KT flagged though, getting a jelki rune shouldn't take you long if you hunt in the zone at all for xp.  The named here are beefy, but they have extremely low hit points and die in about 30-40 seconds of max dps.<br />
<br />
The rune that gives us our slow spell is the really hard spell to find.  I don't know where it drops for sure besides very very few KT named.  I've so far seen my own spell drop, and 1 rune drop.  In comparison, i've seen about 8 - 10 drop off various named in KT, and about 30 drop off raid targets in ikkinz trials and uqua.  Do they drop somewhere else often like Umbiki or Chorsomething the Soemthing (named pooka in Vxed)?  I know it doesn't drop in Tipt, which the Kyv Boss should really drop a rune every time for his difficulty in killing and just plain getting to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To the original poster:<br />
Having your GoD spells will make you a better shaman. You will have more tools to deal with whatever your groups run into. Having said that, it does not make you a bad shaman if you do not have them. Play your game and let the next guy play his. Like any game, the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. If you are having fun with some of the older content, than you have met the goals of this game: you are having fun. Enjoy it, don't begrudge those who spend more time and are experiencing newer content and don't look down on those playing maybe once a week with friends in lvl 20 zones. It isnt a contest, it's a game, the point of which isn't to measure who has the biggest virtual cyber-unit, but to have fun doing whatever the hell it is you decide is fun to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Meh? My slow spell came out of Sewers of Nihilia: Purifying Plant, and to that point I had lost four rolls on it. I wouldn't call it hard to find. I'm not KT flagged, tho runes apparently drop like candy there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't care much for GoD's spell distribution scheme.  I liked the old Kunark style - except the screw up with malo and torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">KT is definitely the way to go.  Get your friends together for sewers, vexed, and Tipt.  KT is worth it.  Exp is better than elementals and the augs + trash drops are tasty enough to keep all satisfied.  And if Yiktu drops, do your server a favor and default it to your cleric.  EQ is a better place everytime a cleric gets Holy Light.</div></div><hr />

I agree that the spell distribution method in Gates is the sukk, but I really would rather not have &quot;random drops made rare by a variable set through the roof&quot; like Kunark. PoPs system seemd the best, honestly, with 3 &quot;Tiers&quot; of spells, tradable after turn in. <br />
<br />
I have no Gates spells. I am not KT flagged. It sucks, but this is the system we have. And I will work with it. Its been adjusted. People who get to KT will have an easier time getting their spells. People who arent in KT, or not trying to get there, probably don't have as great a &quot;need&quot; (yes, yes, I understand everyone WANTS everything) though. <br />
<br />
PoP was probably a year old before I got my final 65 Spell, and I just got RGC 6 months ago, a lvl 56 (?) spell. I worked my quests in LoY for those spells. I did LDoN runs for those spells. And I will do what it takes to get my Gates and OoW spells. <br />
<br />
Because thats how you PLAY A GAME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Blazz, playing the game and commenting on design are totally different things.<br />
<br />
The hostility to commenting (or complaining whatever) on game design puzzles me sometimes.  <br />
<br />
Things can be better, and they get better through discussion and feedback.  <br />
<br />
Mutely plowing forward is your style, that's good.  It's not the only way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I got 2 out of my 3 GoD spells before KT, I got the slow in Ferubi and the DD Heal in Vxed off the trickster as mentioned above. The mini-nameds in Ferubi can drop runes. (i.e. not Rondo, Packmaster, etc, the other guys their names escape me at the moment)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reward is exactly the same the way I see it. An upgrade to a spell we both have will be the same upgrade for both of us. The only thing that differs is the &quot;ease&quot; of getting it.<br />
<br />
I dont like this system but I also admit that I dont have any surefire way to fix it. I fear EQ has gotten too far out of balance to ever being able to suit different types of players.<br />
<br />
If GoD had been a better expansion for my playstyle (an hour here, two hours there, not always a full perfect group on in my casual guild) I would definately have bought OoW. Now I am 99% sure OoW is going to be the first expansion that I wont buy. I also changed my subscription to pay each month so that I dont risk prepaying for too much. So when WoW is out I'm gone hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see what you are saying for the spells - I should have been more specific.  I meant that while hunting/farming/flagging there would be a high probablitily of stumbling accross some other loot.  These are what I meant by that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I fear EQ has gotten too far out of balance to ever being able to suit different types of players.<br />
<br />
Not vis-a-vis spell drops. I don't care if uber-raider gets his or her spell on day one. I just want to know that with EQUAL TIME INVESTED I can get mine.<br />
<br />
LDON was great for that. Yeah, you had to suffer through some pick-up roulette, but if you invested the time - you got your spells.</div></div><hr />

I might just shelve the shaman and not bother with any of this. Besides, WoW will be out in a few months.</div></div><hr />

Give a cleric an extra 300 hp healed to their already bloated heals when I could get Balance of the Nihil for the same rune &lt;boggle&gt;<br />

No shaman in my guild has Balance yet.</div></div><hr />
