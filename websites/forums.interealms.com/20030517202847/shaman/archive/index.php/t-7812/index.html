<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This my first time showing my rags here, after seeing some of the magelos out there, well lets just say there are some shaman that define the word UBER. <br />
I work best with goals and have reached my first goal of 1009AC unbuffed and my second goal of being able to do can5 unbuffed 1933hp. My next goal of course is 1100ac.<br />
I have 4 weak slots: arms back ring and earring, those are obvious to me.  Where do I go from here on the rest of the gear?I am in a guild still doing HoT and kunark dragons, vindi etc. We won't be in VT any time soon maybe ST in a few more months.<br />
<br />
Appreciate any input anyone is willing to provide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hardened Grey Flesh Seeves is a slight arm upgrade... hp is king...<br />
<br />
AC: +16 Str: +6 Sta: +6 Dex: +6 Cold Resist: +5 HP: +25<br />
<br />
Hmm... your gloves probably could be changed...<br />
<br />
Shissar Scaled Gloves back you a bit on AC but give way more HP, Mana and WIS<br />
<br />
AC: 12 IS: +5  INT: +5  HP: +40  MANA: +40<br />
<br />
i have no real ideas on what uber loot to get...<br />
<br />
Perhaps your guild can do Rumblecrush and get this sexy belt among other stuff, still a slight tunedown of AC in favor of other stuff...<br />
<br />
Belt of Scintillation<br />
AC: 10<br />
STR: +4  DEX: +4  STA: +4  CHA: +15  <br />
WIS: +10  INT: +10  AGI: +4  HP: +25  <br />
MANA: +50  SV MAGIC: +15<br />
<br />
Alll i can come up with, hope it helps some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">...why not pop a cap in Lodizial's ass? The Lodizial shell Shield is equipable in your back slot (&quot;equipable in your back slot&quot;? ooer - that just sounds SO wrong), and is pretty nice as a back slot item. With a single group of HoT capable players, Lodi would drop faster than a whore's drawers!<br />
<br />
thats my 2n6 worth anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why would he downgrade to a gimpy lodi shield?<br />
<br />
Bracer - Barbed Rubicite<br />
Gloves - Coldain Skin<br />
Arms - Hardened Gray Flesh Sleeves<br />
Ears - Electrum Black Sapphire or Earring of Twisted Leaves (over the claw, not the solstice :p)<br />
<br />
Other than that, you've pretty much got what I'm aiming for or what I'm wearing, so I'm out of suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your stuff is looking pretty good, to boost over 1100ac isnt a priority for me, but if it is for you, you are going to need higher end pop loot and ntov loot to do it without sacrificing a lot of HP, imo.<br />
<br />
Hiero cloak isnt weak.<br />
<br />
For a small AC boost, you could look for the barbarian crafted belt, artificers ringmail, its 15ac, 40hp, 40mana and 5 wis i believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you all for your input, some great ideas there, I have had my eye on artificers ringmail tunic for months.<br />

Alas there is no cultural tribunal smith on innoruuk :(<br />
<br />
Gotta give some kudos.<br />
<br />

This thread names 2 barb grandmaster smiths on your server.  If you see a shaman running around in black chain, find out if it's Artificer's and where he got it.  If you see a warrior running around in Helanic Tundra (looks like light blue and tan, kinda), ask them where they got it.  You will find a smith eventually. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks Harwel :)<br />
<br />
The only name I have come up with till this point was Jaxel and he no longer plays. I will look Icereaver up in game.<br />
<br />
Thanks again D)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If your guild does Vindi, then get a Vindi BP.  ALOT more HP, and much better resits.<br />
<br />
Some new PoP Items are really freaking tight. Girdle of Mithaniel is pretty nice.  Theres also some bone thing you can stick in your range slot, it has a 20% spell haste, and is sham only.  Either one of those would be great upgrades for you(i know your range slot is already pretty covered, but cutting a 1/5th of your cast time is crazy).<br />
<br />
edit: Girdle of Mith doesnt have haste of Mith after all :P</div></div><hr />
