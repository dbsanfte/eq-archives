<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>WDN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im sure you all can help me out.  Trying to get back into EQ.  Im on a different computer than when I played last.  After installing I tried to play.  When I was going to the Character selection screen  I get this message &quot;EQ.exe has discovered a problem and has to close&quot;<br />
<br />
Now most likely  I will need a new video card.  My computer now (my wifes) has an AMD chip and I believe it to be a 350MHz.  I know it says you need 400+ to run but I ran it on mine after Luclin came out on a  350.<br />
<br />
My problem is this.  I dont want to spend the money on a video card if that is not the problem.  It is just a stock video card from Compaq.  Do any of you know if it will be more than just the video card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What version of DirectX are you using?<br />
<br />
Are all your drivers up to date?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WDN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DirectX 9.0<br />
<br />
<br />
My brother-in-law went in and updated some drivers not sure if he updated those.  Will go check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was useing a celeron 500 after luclin, was zoneing fast as could be between ME and DS.  Things have changed, I highly recomend upgradeing your computer overall if you wish to play eq with any sort of enjoyment.  Be prepared for 15min+ zonetimes and only being able to play in old world zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>WDN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I really cant justify spending the cash to upgrade this computer.  I wont be able to play that much anyways.  Just an hour or two on some weekdays and a little bit on the weekends.  Was just looking to go back to playing a game that I loved and hated.</div></div><hr />

That is not my experience at all. My second box is a pII 400 with 256 ram and a 32 meg old gforce card. I zone before almost everyone I group with. I play in any zone I wish although on the second computer I am miserable in big raids in certain zones. Yes you'll bog down at times and have to adjust your clipping for certain zones but you'll be fine at a casual player you describe. I expect you won't be doing many huge raids where you'll really notice the lacking puter horsepower. Oh and of course you'll have to turn off all the flashy eye candy sparkled most likely, but most everyone I know turns those off anyway:)<br />
<br />
The rumors are that EQ is designing a new graphics engine so it may be that within the next several months EQ will require a 1gig or better computer and the latest gforce cards to play, I have no idea.</div></div><hr />
