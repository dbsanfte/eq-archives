<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well in my search for the remainder of my lvl 60 spells, I am headed to Veeshans Peak. Got the majority of it done now, but still trying to get the Ancient Jarsath to spawn. I parked my necro there and randomly log it in and hit the sense undead key a few times. So far, nothing, except some dudes pet. I am not very familiar with that zone at ALL. Tons of see invis greenies and annoying bixys. My necro is parked next to some dog temple for now. <br />
<br />
60 monk friend of mine has been religiously slaughtering everything on that side of the zone for the last few days, he has yet to see it either. <br />
<br />
Anyone got any tips to make it spawn? Or where it spawns?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Krak, it's not a spawnable mob, to the best of my knowledge.  He tends to be in the south east part of the zone (quadrant 4 if you like math).  Best to check him at odd times.  Maybe get up at 3am and check, or in the mornings right as you get up.  I'm not positive on spawn times, but I've heard 8 hours.  GL on him.  He's a pain to find, but easy to kill at least.<br />
<br />

<br />
*edited--try parking at about -1000, -1000 and doing sense undead from there.  He spawns mid-zone(ish) and wanders SE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is by far the most annoying part of the quest. I have heard random spawn, I have heard 8 hours, 12 hours. The only thing I can say for sure is Vekis is on his spawn table. If he is up (you can catch his pet with sense undead) then just aggro him and drag him to zone and he should despawn. <br />
<br />
If you have access to a second PC level a cleric up to 9 and park him in FV and keep hitting sense undead. Eventually he will pop. You might try a necro too but most of them will be KoS around FV.<br />
One more thing, AJ is Almost always up after a patch/server reboot so maybe park there before a patch and get on first thing you might bag him.<br />
<br />
Good luck on a really annoying camp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Vekis<br />
<br />
whos is this anyway? someone I can kill instead of draggin to zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">he has a PH from my research and from talking with ppl in my guild.  Kill the non- dvolrag roamers from the dog temple out to the mud pits to try and get him to spawn.  Not 100% sure if this actually has any effect but it &quot;seemed&quot; to have helped many in my guild get him to spawn. It took me forever to get him to spawn and several days on and off killing. He is considered a 2hour spawn i believe. Your mileage will vary, IMHO.  When i spotted him finally he was just north east of the  mud pits.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
<br />
Now if I could only get my guild to get in there since I got my key ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Vekis is a level 55 (or so) necro that hangs around the waterfall between the FV and Ill Omen zones.  While I was hunting the FV giant camp, I heard a lot of cocky people try to kill her and very few succeed.<br />
<br />
I was at that giant camp for three levels and never say the AJ, though.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I didn't think he had a PH. If it does, then other mobs must kill the PH from time to time because he's up quite commonly. I've killed the ancient at least 6 times for myself and MQ'd the part with other guild members. On the east zone wall in Firiona Vie there's a passage through the wall with pillars outside it. There are drolvargs everywhere here, including inside the passage and beyond it. On the west side of this passage is where I most commonly see the ancient. He roams from the passage area down hill to the west past a drolvarg fort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Back when I hunted in FV, I saw the AJ *all the time*. We used to kill him just out of boredom, he is always 42, so he was actually kind of fun in my low 40's (very resistant, but hey). <br />
<br />
Vekis is not on his spawn table, because Vekis *is* a forced-spawn mob when you kill one of those silly elf/FV adventurers that shout they are moving onward in FV, Vekis is a mob used in an Iksar Warrior armor quest.<br />
<br />
AJ had a tendancy to walk up the zone wall by the dog temple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He is an eight hour spawn but can skip spawns.  When my guild was farming VP keys, we would post the time he was killed and try to get him the next spawn, we were pretty successful at timng him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not sure if the AJ is on an 8 hour timer as well, but I have seen him pop twice in about an hour and a half.  I focused mainly on killing leeches and frogs during this camp and had him in about 5 hours.  He pathed along the middle of the hill below the drolvarg fort and was pretty easy to spot.  <br />
<br />
I can't really say where he popped initially because I caught him after an afk to the head, but he was on the same route as one of the frogs I kept killing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zcul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ok got lost of guildies this part by making a necro level 1 mule with sense undead spell bought (fast run from cabilis, 1 sow potion)..<br />
<br />
then i parked it at zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
he has no ph guys u are wasting your time. he's on a 8hr spawn timer, so if u dont find him, farm exp for 7 hrs and check again etc.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think Allakazam's had a thread on him.  I buffed up, put up a dog, buffed him, and killed anything that moved in the triangle between the Drolvarg fort and the two Drolvarg camps.  AJ came wandering by about an hour into the killing.<br />
<br />
No idea if I just happened to be in the right place at the right time, or the indiscriminant killing helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm truly amazed that people can't find him up.<br />
I've wandered into him 2x so far just running to seb from dl.<br />
Also, I had my paladin bound in FV for a while, and every time he died, I'd sense undead just to see if he was up, and about 95% of the time he was.<br />
Also, an 8 hour spawn time is a crock.  I've killed him with my paly, camped out to my main to try looting the medallion, but it rotted due to connection issues with logging back in.  I just sensed undead and like 5 minutes later he was up again.  *shrug*.<br />
He's the easiest part of the quest where you have to kill an npc for something.  He's almost always up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">crapola....<br />
<br />
log in the necro last night, bam hes up. Leave my necro sitting there while I haul butt with my main trying to get to FV. 10 mins of the necro sitting there, I get a tell from a 60 monk in the zone...<br />
&quot;can you hit sense undead and tell me what direction it points you in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally zone my shaman in, start pounding the sense undead key and invising the lil 13 necro who will get eaten at the drop of a hat by all the see invis stuff in that zone...finally find him, get a /loc, gate the necro...and when I come running up over the hill to that loc with the shaman, what do I see? Dead AJ at the feet of that monk, lil assling leafblower in tow. Gah! Guy was nice about it, even offered to let me loot it...but fair is fair he beat me to it. At least I know it spawns. Now I have a necro, shaman, and druid all bound in the zone so if the fooker pops, he's mine!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">LOL, I got the AJ a long time ago.  I was doing something in FV when this n00b came running and screaming into FV being chased by the AJ.  As I remember I was in my late 40's at the time, so I just slowed it and dot'd it and it was dead pretty quickly (didn't have a JBB in those days).  I looted the medallion and kept it in my bank for ages until I turned 60 and finally figured out what it was for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yup, easiest way to get him is to park a sense undead casting player either by the Drolvarg Temple or on the bridge to FV.  Just check it as you log on and when you log off and you'll have it in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">AJ in FV was the most difficult for me.  I killed only Frenzied Leeches(not the drovargs) to finally get him to spawn.  I actually saw him by a tree nearest the right drovarg camp, if you are facing the drovarg temple.  AJ took me almost 2 weeks of on and off camping to get.  Many times i have zoned into FV and others people are farming him.<br />
<br />
Painsoul in TT-he was up when i went by seb.<br />
BG Marauder-up first time<br />
Kaesora bag-up first time<br />
DL rotting skel-1 ph then killed<br />
Swamp bag-day or 2 to get<br />
KC basement- 2-3 hours<br />
<br />
<br />
Just have patience.  Sooner or later he will pop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have seen himpop thrice in eight hours. Guild made a push on VP for spell farming reasons...<br />
<br />
That was total genocide of anything that dared pass near the teple thouhg so it would seem he has PHs...<br />
<br />
Me I got him by binding there and make doggy sniff for him everytime I died. Got him like a week before they nerfed doggys nose too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What was that about doggy sniffing? Was it &quot;pet attack mobname&quot; or something like that?<br />
<br />
Shaben</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nuor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">After it was killed, I parked a cleric there. 4h later, I logged him on and the AJ was up, wandering west from the doggie temple.<br />
<br />
So I'd say the spawn time is 4h tops.</div></div><hr />
