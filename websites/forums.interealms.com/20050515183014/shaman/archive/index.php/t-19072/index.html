<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My votes:<br />
<br />
Cannabalize (specifically, keep a cann spell just have bigger hitpoint bites, bigger mana returns)<br />
<br />
Direct damage - our nukes are a joke<br />
<br />
Buffs - Focus should add MORE hitpoints, stat buffs should do SOMETHING for the stat capped. Group FA -NOW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My votes, in order of preference:<br />
<br />
Slow:  Fix it so a shaman's slow is mitigated one rank higher than any other class.  Therefore, a mob that is &quot;slightly&quot; affected by chanters/BLs will be &quot;somewhat&quot; affected by a shaman.  Shamans could fully slow mobs who mitigate to &quot;mostly&quot; affected.  Also, give shamans a new slow that has a much lower slow rate (40%), but is either unresistable or has a significant -resist modifier, maybe -50, and can be overwritten by a stronger slow (Turgur's, Forlorn Deeds).<br />
<br />
Heals:  Give shamans 3 new spells:  an upgrade to Quiescence (400 a tick), a group Quiescence that heals a lesser amount (200 a tick), and a new single-target heal that heals for 4000 and has a 10 second cast time.<br />
<br />
I can live with every other balancing issue if they make those two changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Re: rez, I think people have finally woke up. For years we've been dilluting what we are asking for with trivial crap and getting that very same trivial crap.  I am also very happy to see so many people who are passionate and knowledgeble about our class posting ideas that are really good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I could care less about damage.  My preferences in order: Canni / mana regen, a truly class defining lineup of slows, then buffs.<br />
<br />
I rolled a shaman knowing that I would be a support class.  I'd really hate to see any potential improvements put on the cutting board in favor of damage dealing upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I really think asking for any change in the slow department is unrealistic. They've done their best to trivialize the effect that slow has on the game in a lot of cases by many different methods (mitigation, fast kill mobs, immunities, ect..). <br />
<br />
From my personal point of view I'd like to see:<br />
<br />
A) DoTs fixed. They are not viable for exp groups and don't produce the best results for raids. Need to be 3-4 tics in duration for 2-3k damage with the same total agro over the entire length of the dot that landing a 3k nuke would add instantly. <br />
<br />
Edit: Just wanted to clarify this to avoid confusion. Lets say hypothetically a 3k DD adds 1000 hate when it hits. A 3k/4 Tic DoT should add no more then 250 hate per tic. <br />
<br />
B) Better direct heal fast or big, either way works for me.<br />
<br />
C) Something useful to be worth mgb'n mid fight. 5 shamans with MGB and only one buff worth MGB'n is a complete waste. Druid, Clerics, and even BL's have excellent MGB AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I clicked on other because I think we seriously need a true PBAoE slow and Malx line spell and I don't think they can really be thrown in with the single target stuff.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">IMO we need:<br />
(1) Cannibalize upgrade. Big chunk HP, big chunk mana.<br />
(2) Direct heal upgrades. Paladins in GoD will blow us out of the water in the healing department. A hybrid healing better than a priest, sad, pathetic game balance.<br />
(3) Aggro reduction spell/ability (this will indirectly improve DoT DPS). OR, DoT improvments.<br />
(4) A good nuke upgrade.<br />
(5) Let's get rid of Tugur, 51 spell, 5 expansion old. We need a new potent slow that will allow us to reclaim the king of slowing title.</div></div><hr />

3.) Canni line:  Havn't used cann4 in over a year because it isn't effecient enough with cann5+c5+horse+capped ft.<br />
4.) DoTs:  Aggro rating is retarded.  I didn't just prison rape the mob, sorry.  Resist rate on many boss mobs is retarded enough then to have the super ass raping aggro to top it off sucks, plain and simple.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I picked healing/dds because that is the two areas we need the most help in. This is also what can make shamans stack in raids, since one good shaman can handle the debuffing np.<br />
<br />
Getting better slows/debuffs etc would NOT help us stack better at raids which is one of our major problems. Also, getting a cannibalize upgrade is pretty much worthless too since several fights are too short to even unload a full mana bar with our worthless slow-casting spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I voted healing.  There's no way a hybrid should be able to match, let alone beat, a priest when it comes to healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">1) DPS...we suck...so many threads devoted to maximizing our dps, and we still suck.<br />
<br />
2)healing...druids should be able to heal better..i don't want to make them worthless, but healing tanks on mobs that slow midigate (and most higher end mobs do) is a joke.  pallies out heal us. it isn't right.<br />
<br />
4) Canni.  our mana regen isn't that great anymore comparied to other classes....spell mana costs need to be adjusted and/or we need a better/faster canni spell/aa.<br />
<br />
5)pet.  i say this only because of all the new GoD stuff.  spirit calling is crap, why would we want a new zerg aa?  Our pet hp/dps is crap, pet crits are only a small small start to fix this.  do we want this fixed our just flat out removed (the zerg/pet AAs)?  i don't want to be a beastlord, but for god sakes a pet that gets one rounded is worthless....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">1 thing we need is a get out of jail card.   One thing I thought would be semi-uniq would be an insta/fast cast AA that healed us say 600-1k/tic for 4 tics.  put it on a DA timer or larger.<br />
<br />
Things to balance it out could be:<br />
1) Unable be healed durring the spell (ala DA)<br />
2) heal amount / duration<br />
3) add a de-agro component<br />
4) add a 1k/tic mana drain and change duration to mana based<br />
<br />
High end shaman durability leaves much to be desired imo.  I want to bitch about why, but I wont :P<br />
<br />
Another thing which wouldn't be stretching it nearly as much but would be very nice is a poison based VP or another dr VP, just so we can use it twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I picked slows and healing.<br />
<br />
I think we need heals that make us more capable of keeping a group alive during high end raid encounters, and during single-group encounters (LDoN) where there is no ench and no cleric.  Namely:  We need a group heal.<br />
<br />
I think we need something that makes us more adept at slows.  I think a fast casting, low resist, medium recast time slow would be great.  I also think we need a PBAE slow and malos.  As it stands now, we are almost eclipsed by an enchanter when it comes to slowing, and in single-group encounters there is really no reason to pick one over the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I probably could have picked almost everything on the list to a degree but I went with the two I felt we needed most.  Cannibalize and direct damage were my choices.  I would have chosen healing and slows as my 3rd and 4th.  <br />
<br />
Obviously continuing with the increased mana cost of our spells to compinsate for a mana regen that isn't much better than most classes passive mana regen and no upgrades to it in 3-4 expansions is not right.  It doesn't seem right to make us work so hard on an active ability to slightly surpass other classes mana regen AND make our spells so mana intensive.  We need a spell or AA that doubles canni 4.<br />
<br />
I picked direct damage second.   The gap between our nukes and every other priest/int caster class has become increasingly larger.  We aren't supposed to do great dps but dots aren't really an option 90% of the time.  Now we are in a time when enchanters, beast lords and even bards to a lesser extent can slow as well as us in almost all experience situations.  If we continue to fall behind these classes in dps why choose a shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually, there is...VoQ.<br />
<br />
As a 65 shaman who doesn't raid, I've noticed that the number of groups I get has been going down, as has been many of my fellow 65 Shaman compatriots.  The reason is because we're being passed over for the other two slowing classes because they bring more to the group than we can.<br />
<br />
I can slow, buff (if you haven't capped yet), and heal somewhat as I contribute some dps.<br />
<br />
Enchanters have VoQ and crowd control.  `Nuff said.<br />
<br />
Beastlords bring massive DPS and mana/hp regen (SD, Paragon).<br />
<br />
I've noticed this trend more sharply in LDoN, where crowd control and DPS are so much more important than they are in PoP or other high level zones (Droga, Veksar, etc).  BLs have a bit of trouble replacing us as slowers in PoP (where that 10% makes a huge difference), but we still compete for slowing spots with the enchanters.  And given a choice between an enchanter and a shaman, 75% of the groups out there are going to pick the enchanter for the on-demand VoQ and mezzing.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are the slowers that can regen mana and mez.  Beastlords are the slowers who can regen hp/mana and DPS the mob.  Shamans must be upgraded so that they are the slowers who can heal.<br />
<br />
This is what SoE has to fix before we become the new Warriors of EQ.  It's not there yet, but given the track record of how we're being left behind as all the other classes get upgraded, that day is approaching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I voted for:<br />
<br />
Healing:  Our heals blow ass.  Paladins can outheal me, it's pathetic.  I want a higher quies (500 would do, not this 360 crap), a group quies, and a much higher spot heal and gimp-CH (slightly less than druids, not ridiculously less like now).  We're priests, not int casters.<br />
<br />
Cannibalize and Manaregen:  Canni 5 is ~23% of my mana every 3 minutes.  That plus canni 4 takes up the majority of my time in everquest.  I have decent mana regen, when I'm really trying, but I can't really do anything else.  We need a bigger canni 4 type spell, so that we don't have to be constantly casting.  Even bards get downtime when they're not actually fighting.  I do not.  Since the only addition to my mana regen is canni 5, while all other classes have gone from practically nothing to very good mana regen, I have lost relative mana regen capabilities.<br />
<br />
Buffs:  Our buffs are crap.  Hybrids buff more ATK than me, and except ferocity line (which is better than avatar line anyways), have much longer timers on those buffs.  We buff significantly less hp than the other two priest classes (hybrids buff more), and we buff less haste than enchanters.  All our stat buffs are worthless, with the exception of stamina, which matters less and less as a buff the better your gear gets.  We need 1) higher hp buffs, 2) something to replace our worthless stat buffs.<br />
<br />
DD/DoT/Pet:  We are asstastic in all of these categories.  Weakest pets, weakest dds, weakest dots, out of the people who have each of those.  Our dots are unusable in group situations.  They don't have resist mods or the mana efficiency of other dotting classes.  Our DDs are slow casting, small, and inefficient, all of which further add to my constant canniing (as well as taking up valuable canni time).  We nuke worse than a CLERIC, the best healing class.  Rangers can outnuke us, and have archery and melee as outputs for damage as well.  Our pet is laughable.  I carry around a few weapons to arm him, because our pet is the only one that cannot dual wield.  If a mob gets on him, even with focus, and often faith, I can be almost sure he'll die.<br />
These three categories are my means of damaging of mob.  They're all subpar.  Combine them, and they're still subpar.<br />
<br />
Slows:  We are the king of slowing.  This is the only thing that makes up for every other category being as poor as it is.  Because of slow, our crappy heals are enough (just barely).  Because of slow, we have longer to damage the mob before it kills us (slowing time, remember? ;) ).  But we're not that much ahead of the much more CC specialized enchanters, or the ridiculously powerful beastlord (very high damage, buffs nearly as well as us, doesn't heal as well, has a very tough pet, etc).  I don't think we need a 95% slow or something.  Just something to mod turgur's with a negative resist debuff, and/or a (seperate from turgur's) PB large AE slow.<br />
<br />
Other debuffs:  AE malos of some sort, please.  On a bad pull, in a highly resistant area, it takes a VERY long time to get everything slowed.  If I take a risk and try to slow non-malosed creatures, I run a much higher risk of getting smashed into the ground after a resist, thus leaving a lot of undebuffed mobs sitting around camp.  Perhaps some...NEW...debuffs.  Fizzle chance uppers, spell slow, massive ac debuff, hell I dunno, I'm not a game designer.   :p<br />
<br />
What's the main problem with being a shaman?  Turgur's.  This spell has been the excuse for our lack updates or innovation anywhere in our spell lineup since Kunark.  It makes up for the low dps and healing...but only when we're solo.  When we're grouped in PoP and LDoN, things die so fast that our slow, inefficient spells don't have any time to do their thing before the vast amounts of DPS flowing out from everyone else in the group have destroyed the low hp, low ac, high damage, high atk mob in front of us.  Now that this is the case, we're seeing more and more our weaknesses, and it's becoming a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well my order is <br />
<br />
Healing <br />
Cannabalize <br />
Direct Damage<br />
Melee<br />

<br />
honestly slow is at the bottom of my list because the devs had made it obvious that slow is overpowering for the encounters they want to create so I dont think it is that big of a deal to let that one go. The problem is to me that when they introduced migitation they unbalanced shaman and did nothing to rebalance us so unless the devs have some imagination the order above should be used to increase our relative power ... at least in my vision</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">3.) Canni line:  Havn't used cann4 in over a year because it isn't effecient enough with cann5+c5+horse+capped ft.<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
Nukes?  Why give a ****?  I'm not here to nuke.  If I was, I'd re-make as some sissy robe wearing bitch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You have already reduced yourself to a &quot;sissy robe wearing bitch.&quot; You lose 100m/tick when you're not using canni4.  Cannibalization amortizes to about 42m/tick if you use it immediately when it pops each time.  Welcome to being a level 35 cleric!<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, about the thread starter's follow-up posts mentioning &quot;asking for a lot and haggling down.&quot;  How about a zone-wide instacast spell that immobilizes mobs and reduces their attack speed to 0?  It would be unresistable, override mitigation and attack speed change immunity and generate 0 aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
If and when the developers read threads like this, it most likely gives them a good belly laugh while they're eating their California rolls and drinking their Mountain Dew in front of their workstations.  Ask for reasonable things, because they won't pay attention to stupid requests.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would be happy if:<br />
<br />
1.  They took 1 second off Tnarg's casting time<br />
2.  Fixed overwriting other slows<br />
<br />
Ever noticed a mob becomes horribly resistant to Turgur's once any slow has already landed on him?  I'd like a message indicating 1) if Turgur's has already landed it on (e.g. &quot;This mob is already swarmed with insects...&quot; then giving a resist/land message) 2) if a lesser slow has already landed it (e.g. &quot;This mob is suffering from a lesser form of slow...&quot; then giving a resist/land message).<br />
<br />
Landing slows isn't a problem on raid mobs.  They never get below 95% health without being slowed.  If you have astute enchanters, mages and bards, your target's resists will be sufficiently weakened within 30 seconds of engagement.  If your tank can't stand up for 30 seconds in defensive mode, then you've got bigger problems.<br />
<br />
3. They gave us a discipline similar to Stonestance (maybe 50% damage mitigation) that lasts 4 ticks and is resuable every 3 minutes or so.  I hate dying on raids when a knight can't mez a mob quickly enough or healers aren't paying attention.<br />
4. Canni5 that is in line with previous upgrades.  Usually they double the damage, mana return and casting time.  A 5-second canni is unacceptable.  Their original Chaotic Pain stats looked promising though.<br />
5. Screw a new dogdog, I want the ability to charm undead things and animals at the same level druids can.  Have you ever been in a Takish adventure with 2 mages and an enchanter? Three of those summoned rock things with haste and FA and you can clear a room in under two minutes.<br />
<br />
Regarding being replaced by beastlord and enchanters in groups: you're imagining things.  I get offers for groups all the time, it's hard not to find a group.  I turn down group invites every day.  I get invitations immediately upon putting up LFG during raids.  Shamans have no problems getting groups, ever.  Try being a warrior and go LFG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finally I dont care what the conservative shaman think, we need and DESERVE an unresistable, unmitigatable (is that a word?) Slow AA!!!!<br />
<br />
Enchanters and Beastlords get slow spells that rival ours.  In return for a Beastlord groups get massive DPS, Mana regen and slows.  In return for an enchanter groups get crowd control, better haste mana regen and slows.<br />
<br />
What do we offer?  Capped stat buffs that are useless.  A slow spell that is marginally better.  Very low DPS, a bad pet, and ****ty heals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Um, no?<br />
<br />
I have empirical evidence that this is true for mobs at or above your level.  If you try this on mobs in PoN, you seldom get any resists because the mobs are all 10 levels lower than you (and probably have lower MR).  If you try this in the elemental planes, you'll notice.  Whenever there are no beastlords in raid, my slows usually land first time.  When they're present I have many more resists.</div></div><hr />

That is all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've slowed an metric ****ton of mobs, over 3 years as a raid shaman in a guild where the shaman believe &quot;it doesn't matter who slows it, get it slowed fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
As a result of this motto, as a team of shaman, we consistently land slows on top of each other, usually seconds apart. If Gardeltron (who is also in my guild) slows a mob before me IN MY EXPERIENCE I would have no special difficulty landing a slow 1 second later. We also make a habit of re-slowing boss mobs before the slow wears off. Again, this is NEVER a problem.<br />
<br />
As far as PON vs. the Elemental Planes, we were multi-slowing in POEB Tuesday, over top of each other, all night.<br />
<br />
As far as other class slows, guild bards routinely slow on inc, there is no problem overwriting bard slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">uhm, ok.  i will admit it.  i voted for melee, but i didn't do it 27 times.<br />
<br />
if we get fabulously lucky, we will get one decent thing (one of the top 3/4) and one of the lesser things<br />
<br />
if we are really lucky, we will get just one of the top things<br />
<br />
if we are even looked at by Sony we will just get something on the list picked by the RNG<br />
<br />
of the &quot;big&quot; things, Heal has the best shot.  we are treated like a house cat on Heals, and it doesn't take a genius to figure it out.  CHeal rotation, group heal, whatever.  we just need something.<br />
<br />
next would be the spell agro.  chances are we won't see this because we don't think anyone at Sony plays a shaman and has a clue as to how it works, and with spell stacking i can't see them lowering it enough to be useful.<br />
<br />
slow and canni.  not that it would be unbalanced, but i see the other classes having a fit.  make that an ole fashioned conniption hissy fit.  <br />
<br />
buffs?  let's see what happens to endurance.  most of the rest of what we have has already been replaced except for focus.  that or it turns us into Bots where the shaman buffs and sits down because he is 2boxed.<br />
<br />
pets?  the amount of upgrade that would have to occur to make us a viable pet class is probably just not going to happen.  we might get a tad, but to make us a pet class it would be better than a melee upgrade for soloing.<br />
<br />
DD? we need an upgrade, sure; but to make us the class that could chain cast nukes and then take the hits better than anyother class will probably not happen.<br />
<br />
other debuffs?  OK, sounds great.  but at 62, i cast cripple all the time and can not honestly tell you it makes a big enough difference.  i swear each time i cast it the mob hits me for a round at max before it settles in.<br />
<br />
damage over time?  please no.  that cuts us out of LDoN for life.<br />
<br />
while i would love to be balanced to Pallies, i will take Rangers.  we share most of the great gear, they get archery/we get pet.  they have some buffs/ we have some buffs (that we actually use, not all the ones in our book)  they have some nukes/ we need to keep pace with them, not wizards.<br />
<br />
gimmie the &quot;Priest&quot; heal, and the Ranger Melee (then make all the jokes about Ranger melee dying) and i will be happy, and i hope not over-powered.  the Heal gets me in groups (coupled with what i already have) and the melee is just a reason to have the auto attack button on when i am in range of the mob anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">We need a fix for what I call the &quot;shammy double whammy&quot;, wherein long cast times PLUS low damage/efficiency spells tax us twice over. <br />
At least one of these two factors needs to be addressed to a significant degree.<br />
For example if I want to use a bunch of mana to vstrike a mob inefficiently, (and with no spell resist mod other than my 5 second base malo), I should be allowed to do it. Currently I am restricted in doing this by the horrific cast time. So in effect I have all this wonderful mana pool that everyone keeps referring to, but I'm not even allowed to waste it by the bucketloads to raise some respectable dps.<br />
<br />
How envious your friends would be if they found out that you had won a million dollars. How amused they would be when they found out you were only allowed spend 20 bucks a day, plus you incurred an extra 25% &quot;millionares tax&quot; on all the stuff you bought.<br />
<br />
p.s. remove the inherent full resist chance from rain spells. It realy gets under my skin when I can take more damage from tears spell with 300+ poison resists than some blue debuffed mob. aaaarggg! I swear I become more like George Castanza every time I think about this one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Heals : we need to be on par with Druids again, not more powerful than them, but on par.<br />

<br />
Pet : I don't want a better pet, I want one able to HIT. Great deal to give me rabid bite, rampage, flurry, what you want, if the pet don't hit, it's useless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">In order of importance to me (I apologize for the poor grammar and structure, it's late and I travelled today.  BTW, /wave anyone across the street at the MS Campus, I'll be there friday :):<br />
<br />
1. Cannibalize and Manaregen<br />
<br />
Canni4 requires far too many casts to make it effective at giving us the mana regen that we need for our spells.  I should not have to be casting a spell over and over, weaving other spells inbetween casts of canni4.  Canni5 no longer takes a big enough chunk of hitpoints per use.<br />
<br />
2. Buffs<br />
<br />
The Focus line of spells no longer buffs nearly the hitpoints it should be, when compared to other classes buffs.  The duration of our focus line also is still far too short compared to other classes buffs.  Maxing melee stats without buffs has become more common, lessening the effectiveness of our stat buffs.  As stat buffs have become antiquated, Shamans can no longer effectively buff relevant stats or abilities.  I hate to insert a suggestion here, but I would really, REALLY like to see Shaman be able to buff skill mods, raise *and* buff stat caps, and grant abilities (strikethrough, etc) with a very large number of variations.  This type of buffing would be somewhat similar to AA choice.  Each player, if they researched Shaman buffs, could request specific buffs that would most benefit their character, rather than just using a static buff set.<br />
<br />
Why we can't buff endurance regen.../boggle /boggle /boggle<br />
<br />
3. Damage Over Time<br />
<br />
It's really quite silly that we have three lines of spells, two of them reaching back to the original game, that are basically reserved to solo/duo (or any time the shm wants to tank).  Poison dots have an outrageously high aggro value for the damage they do and their resist rate.  Disease dots are limited to only solo/duo xp or for aiding the shm to be summoned by a boss mob.  The curse spells should have a shorter recast time.  There are also far too few good focus items available for dots.<br />
<br />
4. Healing<br />
<br />
Tnargs and Kraggs mending are both horribly ineffecient spells.  Hell, I would rather just spam chloroblast over and over and over, at least it's easy to get IH3, spell haste 3, and mana pres 3 items (or similar) to affect it. :)  I do not think we need or deserve any kind of group heals, certainly not in spell form, possibly with an aa since all other priests and priest hybrids have either group heal spells or aa's.<br />
<br />
Quiessence no longer effectively heals enough and shouldn't require numerous AA's in addition to a rare spell to make our healing on par with other priest classes in specific situations.  I can't speak for myself, but it seems that our healing is completely unsatisfactory (even with a LOT of AA's) for ldon hard and elemental planes.<br />
<br />
5. Slows<br />
<br />
Slow mitigation combined with mudflation have removed too much of the gap between beastlord, enchanter, and shaman slowing effectiveness.  Enchanters used to not like slowing because they would die easily to unslowed mobs, but that is no longer the case with new runes and new gear.  Beastlords would rather use their mana for other things than slow, but in much of norrath their lesser slow is far outweighed by the dps they bring to the group.  What Shaman really have over the other two is the ease of slowing because we have malo(s), but it requires far more time and mana than the other two classes.<br />
<br />
I picked five total because I had a pretty hard time deciding between slows and heals because, as this applies to the rest of the available choices, I just don't think that it's a problem anywhere outside of ldon hard and elemental planes (and even some elemental planes a shm *can* be the only healer and slower).  I haven't been turned down from a group because they had a bst or chanter already.  On the contrary, when I do group with chanters and beastlords, they are happy to have me because then they don't have to slow and can do other things.<br />
<br />
As for the healing, combined with all our other abilities, makes the shaman class extremely powerful across the vast majority of norrath.  I am proud that a well played shm can take 5 dps classes just about anywhere outside of elemental and ldon hard.<br />
<br />
While our nukes might be ineffecient and slow casting, they are still good when modified by our mana regen.  Now, I speak from the shm crowd that is *always* casting a spell, so I know I might see more benefit from canni than other shm and don't mind the lackings of our nukes and rains :)  However, my canni habit does allow me to throw a good 3-4 casts of ice strike (used because of focus items) at 675+crits and very few resists on average, against just about every mob in an ldon easy fight when the mobs live about 40 seconds.  I'm not in the group to do nuke damage, so 2k+slow+debuffs+buffs+heals+cc+pet+...I'm happy :)<br />
<br />
Cripple I hardly have ever cast and don't really plan to until I see more evidence of it's effectiveness.  Now with the upcoming melee openings system perhaps cripple will be changed to affect openings as well, that might be worthwhile.  Malo has been plenty for me ever since I got it, which is why I never bothered getting malos.  I have absolutely no desire for an ae malo or ae slow (tigirs is bad enough) *until* we can have more spell gem slots.  Those would be so completely situational that by the time the situation came up, you memmed the spell, and could cast it, the situation would either be gone or under control.<br />
<br />
I like my &quot;companion&quot; :)  I do NOT like that sony seems to be pushing us towards more of a pet class.  I like to max out puppy with items and buffs, but by no means do I want to be close to a pet class.  I recently started a mage alt and I actually thought their pets did way way more damage than the mage class has parsed out, so I am happy with my alpha'd dog at 30-40dps.  However, it's not like we are going to be pet chaining so remove the recast delay of our pet spells already, thanks :)<br />
<br />
Melee:  Umm, yeah.  Clerics can do it, good for them, I don't want to and I am in no way going to use reasoning for us to be &quot;battle priests&quot; based on what the Everquest Players Handbook states.  If my epic were a book, I could care less.  My gf's 65 cleric using her summoned hammer and lower weapon skill hits about 40% more often than I do, but my time meleeing is time not canni'ing.<br />
<br />
After writing all that, it's the stuff that I didn't put in up top that are my biggest gripes really, such as: Talisman of Alacrity not being 60% haste, tiny terror not being /tgb'able, ferine avatar and Q needing so many aa's for them to really be good, and Shaman getting SoW first and then ONE upgrade / variance to the spell three expansions later, while druids recieved variance upon upgrade upon variance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Find a level 65+ mob<br />
2. Cast Turgur's Insects on him without debuffing its MR<br />
3. Note whether slow landed or not<br />
4. Repeat steps 1-3 at least 29 more times.<br />
<br />
1. Return the mob to its original unslowed state<br />
2. Cast Forlorn Deeds (or any non-shaman slow) on him without debuffing its MR until it lands<br />
3. Cast Turgur's Insects once<br />
4. Note whether Turgur's Insects lands or not<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">You know, with all the crap jzak posted(1 second faster Tnarg's, so that focus effects don't work with it anymore? Smart request of yours), I hate to side with him. <br />
<br />
There is an inherent problem with overwriting Slows. And before jzak posted this in this thread, there were several posts of mine stating this. Of course, I have never said I had evidence. <br />
I am going to try to explain the problem, even though I don't expect anyone to believe me. I have feedback'ed this &quot;bug&quot; a lot of times, but I am quite sure that it's too complicated to fix the actualy coding problem causing this for them to care.<br />
<br />
Remember the neverending and weekly arising debate about Slows and whether the Beastlord Slow is harder to resist than the Shaman Slow?<br />
<br />
99% of the Shamans have wondered about this at some point or another. But people forget, that many of us old timers, had the same thoughts about Enchanter Slows for a long time(to a lesser extend, and I'll explain why). My explanation for this is as follows(Keep in mind that this is highly hypothetical and honestly I give a **** about those who aren't even considering this):<br />
<br />
When you slow a mob, there's some sort of serverside &quot;level check&quot;(Spell level, not Character level, which in my &quot;theory&quot; only matters when you want to overwrite another spell with the same effect). <br />
You and your fellow Beastlord start casting Slow on an incoming mob(Let's say it has an MR of 100. Not too hard to slow, but not too easy either. For the sake of this argument, we will just assume that you have a 50% chance to land a Slow at 100 MR). <br />
The Beastlord has the faster Slow and happens to land it. The Beastlord Slow is a level 65 spell. The Shaman Slow(Level 51) goes off and is resisted on the already Beastlord slowed mob. Now you cast Slow another 2 times just to see it getting resisted(and at this point you wonder how the **** the Beastlord landed his Slow without debuffs on this apparently high MR mob). In reality, though, the mob isn't highly MR and the Shaman Slow would have landed just fine, *if* the Beastlord hadn't landed his before him.<br />
The game has a problem letting the level 51 Shaman Slow overwrite the 14 level higher Beastlord Slow, which effectively lowers the chance to land your Slow from the intial 50%(100 MR) to somewhere around 25%. So while you *can still* overwrite the Beastlord Slow, it will be a lot harder(If you cast Malos, the chances go up of course).<br />
In my guild I am &quot;famous&quot; for this theory. The thing is, that even though we never know when our Beastlords Slow mobs(Sometimes they do, other times they don't because they are too lazy), I can usually tell if Beastlords are slowing telling by my resist rate, which leads to people wondering if I am right.<br />
<br />
The wider the gap between spell levels the more problems you will encounter overwriting the higher level spell. This explains the phenomenon of Beastlords and Enchanters(with Shaman mains) saying the resist rate on their Slows is identical, while many would swear the Beastlord Slow is easier to land(The resist rate on the intial Slow is the same, it's when a higher Slow is on already that things are messed up). Obviously, they always cast Slow with just one toon even when tri-boxing.<br />
Do I think this sounds far fetched? <br />
Yes, I do.<br />
Am I convinced there's an inherent problem with overwriting Slows(regardless of whether my theory of spell levels is correct)? <br />
Yes, 100%</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I voted:<br />
1) slows - I know SoE overdid slow early in the game, and there isn't much chance of them throwing us a bone, but I think we really need a boost here.  My best slows are all 5 expansions (soon to be 6) old.  And for all the other reasons we all know too well.<br />
2) Cann/manaregen - I could take all the crap spells I have if I could get more time and mana to cast more of them.  A crappy nuke cast 3 times instead of once (while I regen mana the rest of the time) is better than what I got now.<br />
3) DD - The only times my nuke kills anything is when it either a) laughs itself to death, or b) the lag is so bad I don't see the mob's health bar plumet till the spell is almost off (doing the last 100-300 HP the mob had with my oh so uber 925 nuke).<br />
4) Buffs - I'd like something meaningfull that I don't have to recast every 6-9 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I'm seconding most of the people here in that I voted for<br />
<br />
1)Heals.  If I'm s priest class, I'd like to be at least able to heal as well as a paladin.  It annoys me that most of the people I group with hate half my heal line up (I don't have Quince yet, and all the melee I group with hate stoicism and topor, understandably).  The snare and slow effect on the HoT spells make them undesirable for at least half the people I group with.  To make up for it I get the slow and gimped Krags, or the quick and gimped Tnargs.<br />
<br />
2)Canni.  Canni is not efficient.  Yes, I can canni then heal, canni then heal, but that is all I can do.  Canni is not time efficient.  Since Sony does not want me to solo, where I can kill at my own pace, but wants me to group, I'd ask that Sony quit making my class move at a different pace to everyone else in the group.  I noticed in a Ldon last night.  I'm always snared with my own heal over time and struggling to match the pace of an aggressive group, and then constantly canning to keep up with malo/slows, and healing off the tank.  Shaman's may be efficient in the sense that we can canni/heal and make our own manna, but we're so slow at everything else that I struggle to keep up with an aggressive pace.  I can either allow the extra time to cast my slow spells, or I can canni, its hard to do both.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a slow with a resist debuff built in that I would not have to promptly cast turgurs overtop of.  I already have malo, whats the point of an inferior slow with a resist debuff?  A slow equal to turgaurs with a debuff would be useful. I'd like to see quicker casting DD.  I'd like buffs that last longer, or buffs that are good enough that people will go out of their way to ask for.  I'd like to see melee that is at least on par with clerics.  However I doubt that Sony will give us more than one bone, so I worry most about the first two, with the rest of the list on the bottom.  Dot's I've given up on.  Unless I'm soloing they are just too slow.  And there is no real point in me soloing, since shaman just cannot kill fast enough to get good exp doing it. I'm not particularly interested in having a better pet.  I'm a class with a pet, not a pet class, and I know Sony will never give us a good pet, so there's not much point in improvements when the best I can hope for is less gimpy.<br />
<br />
Over all, even more that the top two I listed, or all the secondary things, I'd like to see an indication that Sony has an understanding of how the shaman interacts with others.  For a large extent I feel like a support class that moves at a different pace than the group I am supporting.  I can do almost any thing and everything, s l o w l y.  This pacing problem seems like the root of the issue to me.  When the rest of the game is concerned with damage per second, I am the class that wants maximize the number of seconds that I have to deal damage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">The way I look at it years ago shaman had 2 real things going for them, slows and buffs. Well I am fairly certain that we will never see a major upgrade on slow.<br />
<br />
I'd be much happier with the addition of more meaningful buffs. A post 60 buff should not be aimed at melee stats that most pure melee are close to capping anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">My stance is we need two things to keep up with the game:<br />
<br />
A MEANINGFUL heal.  Not this lame 1300 heal that doesn't heal more than 20% of the common level 65 tank's HP.  Something isn't right when the paladin can heal for more than I can before my spell even has time to finish casting.  If I am going to cast a heal, it better be capable of healing bare minimum of 2k damage and cast in 4 seconds or less. (note:  60 hp/tick is NOT a healing upgrade!)<br />
<br />
Nukes that have a REASONABLE cast time and do a respectable amount of damage.  Give it a slightly longer refresh time like the clerics and enchanters.  As it is, I don't have enough time to land more than 1-2 nukes in LDON in a full group.  The fact remains that a ranger with 2 nukes will outdamage our potential in the majority of LDON, and beastlords are not far behind.  Yes, if we chain our nukes and they chain their's, we win for total damage output!  However, how many times do you actually cast more than 3 nukes before the MOB dies in experience groups?  In this REALISTIC situation who puts out more damage?  It certainly is not us; is this right?<br />
<br />
If we got some of the other stuff (increased mana regen, better buffs, etc.), that would be excellent.  However, I feel that the game is fast becoming hard hitting mobs that die in 10-30 seconds.  What we need, assuming this is the focus of the game, is a larger, faster casting heal and larger, faster casting nukes.  If we do not receive upgrades in these two critical areas, we will soon have no place in the game (from the 65 perspective anyhow...1-60 is pretty well balanced for all classes :) )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Well I would vote for a slightly better Direct heal. 1750ish 200 range 400 mana. 3 sec casting time.<br />
<br />
A remarkably better heal over time. 450 hp a tick 6 ticks Base with 300 mana cost. 3 second cast time.<br />
<br />
DD has never been something I liked. But improvements upon a rain spell would be nice. Take away the Resist bug and remove the 4 hit max and increase the rain to 5 waves. Still only allow It to hit 4 total mobs per wave however.<br />
<br />
Make the disease line useful to cast. Add a massive debuff effect to it. When you are sicker than a dog it should DO something. Either a Massive stat debuff or Attk and secondary stat debuff. No It wont Do full damage but let the debuff and the damage together make value for the mana cost and the Time to cast.<br />
<br />
A Slow that is effective. Perhaps a Lesser Value slow that Like another poster said. Is one less of a mitagation effect. Like a 60% Slow that penetrates the sllow mitagation. If a 50% Mitagator would instead be 25%. So if in a mitagator area that slow is loaded instead. <br />
<br />
Small improvements wouldnt bother me if they were consistant and meshed to a overall greater whole. As it is We get very little that would aid shaman in thier primary functions. Group support and enhancement.<br />

<br />
<br />
You can get only get Tnarg's down to ~2.7s with worn focus effects anyway.  Taking 1 second off Tnarg's would result in a 2.8s casting time.  Sorry for thinking of the non-raiding shamans for once.  It was, in fact, a smart quest, since it requires killing an elemental god (or Time gods) to get the focus effect to drop it below 2.8 seconds.  It's hard for even Time shamans to get Tnarg's to that cast time, since QoM only exists on 3 items in the entire game (Gleaming Mesh Girdle (FR), Earring of Unseen Horrors (CT in Time), Temporal Chainmail Sleeves (VZ in Time)).  Fennin Ro is easily killed, VZ in Time is not (usually) and CT can only be reached after you kill VZ.<br />
<br />
If they dropped Tnarg's to just 3 seconds casting, we'd be able to get a 2.1s heal with QoM.  I doubt they would ever allow that.<br />

<br />
Healing could be improved by giving us that 3K heal we were supposed to get with the druids.  Also, a MGB-able group Q would be wonderful<br />
<br />
Slows, to make it simple, just fix the recast time on it.  But otherwise, less resistance is always good too.<br />
<br />
DD should not take so freeking long to cast.  The amount of damage done in the cast time it takes is embarassing.  Up the amount of damage and cut the cast time in half.<br />
<br />
As far as the rest, I'd love to see more improvements, but I don't know how we'd fix them.   Maybe if we could cast &quot;pre-buffs&quot; that raises stat caps, our buffs would become more desirable again.  More buffs that add attack and last more than just a few minutes would nice too.  Upgrading SoW is much over due IMO.   Something near bard speed would be a nice bonus.  As far as DoTs go, some take too long to cast and the damage is over too much time.   Bane is by far my favorite DoT.   I should think we'd get a few new DoTs under this &quot;cursed&quot; line.</div></div><hr />

If I am in a group as the healer and the slower I have a problem when the mob resists slow. You only get one chance to cast that slow, if it resists then I find I am chain casting Tnargs on that tank (and praying for that crit heal) just to keep him barely alive. Tnargs does not get their health up to a safe enough level where I can take the time to try to get that mob slowed. If I break away from chain spam healing to try to slow again, the tank will likely die. Even if I cast a quiescence on the tank when the mob is pulling, if that slow is resisted then I am stuck desperately spamming that tnargs with no other shot at slowing. If the mob does get slowed then I am usually fine keeping the tank alive, but if its resisted or the mob has a high mitigation then its a problem.<br />
<br />
Things that would help in this situation, a better quick heal; a HoT that heals for more and lasts longer; a slow with a faster cast time, recast time and a decent resist modifer. The slow for GoD as it sits is a step in the right direction, if they upped the duration on that and decreased the recast time it might be helpful as it would mean the mob would not resist slow as much and this situation would not be as likely to happen.</div></div><hr />

Well, not so much better mana regen but more like larger mana regen :)  The next addition to the canni line could, for example, be a worse ratio than canni4, have a longer recast time, but take double the hitpoints and give double the mana.  For me, when I think better mana regen, I want a spell that I won't have to cast all the time to keep my mana regen high enough to use my other spells.<br />

<br />
First, I am at 2.3 with the cleric haste, so I don't see why 2.1 should be a problem(you'd be at 1.8 with BoR/AoR). <br />
However, my comment actually aimed at the &quot;taking 1 second off Tnarg's&quot; statement(which is a poor idea in reality as explained above) and a 3 second Tnarg's would actually be a good suggestion(with the exception that Nature's Infusion would benefit from this as well probably). Didn't quite get the Wicked Bone Atlatl comment, though. <br />
On a side note, while Qickening of Mithaniel is relatively hard to come by(Fennin is a rather easy fight and the belt usually goes to Shamans and Druids), there's items with Speed of Mithaniel(25% instead of 30% from QoM) which are very easy to acquire for VT level guilds. So that &quot;non time guild player&quot; argument is pretty weak. Even the Wicked Bone Atlatl brings Tnarg's down to what, 3 seconds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I surprised that so many people want better mana regen when I have heard a million times on this board, &quot;Once you have Torpor/Qu and Can 5 you will have limitless mana&quot; or something to that effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly.  People don't think ahead most of the time and they always think more is better.  I posted that I never run out of mana on most raid encounters and this is the case with all the other shamans in my guild, and the same with xp groups.  No matter how much I cast, I'm always ahead of the rest of the group in mana.  This was true when I first started raiding and it's true now with EP/Time gear.  The only zone I would go oom on occasion was VT.  I think everyone will agree that's a stupid zone full of stupid mobs with stupid amounts of hp and AC.<br />
<br />
Quicker mana regen will give us nothing but headaches.  It's not necessary on most raids unless you're the only shaman present.  If you're in an xp group, you're going to have to wait on someone else's mana to regen already anyway.  How many times have you said &quot;wait a sec guys, I'm oom&quot; in an xp group?  Our mana regeneration isn't the problem.  If you run oom and want a quick burst of mana, time it so your Canni5 is up and &quot;wham!&quot; an instant ~20% mana return.  It seems some are too lazy to do this.  If you never want to see your mana bar under 100%, then play a bard.  Necessity is the mother of invention, not laziness.<br />
<br />
I want more (useful) things to do with my mana, I don't want more of it.  DoTs, even though more efficient than DD, would be a good use of my mana.  I don't want an AA to reduce DoT aggro, because there's an inherent flaw in DoT damage calculation.  I want a fix to that bug or, like I mentioned before, an amnesia DoT (with a resist adjust) that does 1 point of damage per tick and reduces hate by a fixed amount each tick.  An AA would be an across the board reduction of aggro and I don't want that.  I want control of my aggro reduction.  It's very useful to be able to grab aggro at times.  You can save raids that way.<br />
<br />
In general, threads like this will not result in useful changes to our class, because:<br />
<br />
1.  People post outrageous rubbish that no dev would ever consider.  They have no basis or reasoning behind why they want a change, only because it's &quot;more, better, faster.&quot;<br />
<br />
2. We don't have a representative among the devs at SoE.  There's a dev who plays an SK (or someone close to the dev who plays an SK) who comes to the main SK board and says &quot;Hey guys, what AAs do you want this expansion?&quot;  Then the SKs post away.  The number one request from them: AA hotkey Death Peace.  They almost got it in PoP, but it was cut for some reason.  It looks like they're closer to getting it this time.<br />
<br />
3. No one on this board is a Thott (i.e. devs won't give you the time of day).  His suggestions are taken into consideration many times.  Even though he denies having anything to do with changes incorporated into new expansions  (self-membluring mobs, monks getting pacify: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4698&amp;source=Test).  The whole &quot;revamp the monk&quot; thing he suggested is due to his opinion that bards are overpowered (they are) and are inches away from the nerf bat.  So if he smokescreens the devs with thoughts of increasing the power of monks, bards won't be touched.<br />
<br />
Even if threads like this produced useful suggestions, we lack any sort of representation to get them to SoE.  We're simply going to be shoved into archetypes (We're a DoT class, so the devs think.  We're a pet class, so the devs think, etc)  and given &quot;improvements&quot; that way.  The vague/absurb suggestions that I've seen for the past two weeks will never be given to us.  Do your research, folks.  Be specific in your requests.  Don't even use direct comparisons to other classes, because if you do, the devs will think &quot;if you want the abilities of class X, then go play class X.&quot;  <br />
<br />
If you want to know how to effectively propose changes, here's an example: http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/Monk_Suggestions.php</div></div><hr />

<br />
There will be no &quot;pie in the sky&quot; requests in the final proposal.<br />
<br />
2. We don't have a representative among the devs at SoE.    <br />
<br />
We have no control over this, but this is not a deterrent. Are we supposed to just give up and never ask for any improvements because there isn't a shaman dev? That's a pretty defeatist attitude.<br />
<br />
3. No one on this board is a Thott (i.e. devs won't give you the time of day).    <br />
<br />
I see that as a positive. <br />
<br />
I know the devs do read our board. We can only try to make our best attempt to find areas of improvement the majority of the shaman agree on and present it in a clear, organized fashion.<br />
<br />
If you think this attempt is useless, you don't have to participate. I'm pretty pleased with the dialogue so far, I'm impressed with the individuals who can speak about our issues with such clarity and conviction and I'm intrigued with some of the more creative and &quot;out of the box&quot; ideas which have been suggested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">jzak, you're a tool.  Do you have some empirical evidence to back up your claim that more manaregen will give us nothing but headaches too?<br />
<br />
/bangs head against desk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">1) Mana regen - Our spells cost more based on the theory that our self mana regen is better then other casting classes. Just isn't so anymore. Every pure caster gets some sort of self regen spell (stacking issues sure) but that make them on par or better then our our mana regen which requires us to loose Health for Mana. Remember if you need to ask for one thing make it this. ALL our spells mana costs are based around this theory. <br />
<br />
I would like to see Bigger chunks of Health for Mana then having to press a key 15 times. Make it AA, Hotkeyable. If anything make it half the use time of Can5 with hald the return results.<br />
<br />
2) Healing - In group setups (lets not even talk raiding) Shaman do have their place over other slowing classes and thats healing. We make good fits like any other class would for certain group makeups. However seeing how each expansion the Mobs hit harder I would like to see a Better heal. Heck a group Heal would be nice to keep us inline with our Preist status. Paladins get Group and Single Target heals, is it that hard to ask for something better then that?<br />
<br />
3) Slows. Leave it alone. If anything I like the 60% slow but lets look into giving us something on par with with our new step brother class Beastlords. I Have no issue with them or Enchanters getting slow however a faster casting slow for less % would be great even if it only lasted 30-60 seconds. This would make us on par with enchanters for grouping desirablity since we can sorta Slow CC and shaman tank adds. Tigirs is neato for this but its resisted more then being useful.<br />
<br />
4) Other - Personally being a Raid/Guild Leader I feel shaman can fill many roles in a raid. However I would like to see us have a Raid castable MGB much along the lines of Spirit of Wood and Paragon. I think the Devs got something like this going with the new AA ward? But Endurance regen should only be one side of it. I would like to see us have a MGB/Group casting AA like Paragon but instead of giving mana and health have it give endurance and health. Make it non stackable with Wood or Paragon or both thus not throwing game balance for past encounters into a spin, but really if it was stackable would it really be that bad? I mean Pop Forces guilds into 72 person raids and then LDoN forces them lower will god Be 72 person raids? How would this new AA idea really make a difference? <br />
<br />
See this new AA would cover 2 issues we all seem to have.. healing and Raid Shaman 2+ roles. Not only would it be good for groups but for raids.<br />
<br />
Shamans do need some upgrades but remember we can't be the best at any one thing, thats what make our class, the swiss army knife.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't count cast spell haste buffs in the equation, because 1) you need a cleric for them 2) they waste a buff slot that is sometimes needed 3) if you have the cleric to cast BoR/AoR then you probably won't be healing much anyway.<br />
<br />
Hooded Sanguine Mantle and Orb of Thunderous Spirits are the only two items with Speed of Mithaniel available to shamans.  Agnarr is not a farm mob, because his event is annoying.  Usually you do him a couple times to flag everyone and that's it.  I wouldn't consider Arlyxir a farm mob either.  Why go through all the trouble of killing those mobs for a 5% increase over a range item you can buy for 5-10k (or get in an xp group in CoD) in bazaar? A permanent 10% increase is desirable though. <br />

A 1.8s (well, 1.75s) ~1300hp heal already exists in the game.  It's called Supernal Remedy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3465&amp;source=Test) and there's no shaman class on it.  So it's a not a good suggestion to reduce Tnarg's to 3s, because it will never happen.  If they wanted us to have that spell, we'd have it already (or druids would).</div></div><hr />

You confuse me big time...<br />
<br />
In your first post you wanted them to reduce the cast time of Tnarg's to 2.8 seconds(that's what you explicitely asked for under point 1). <br />
I explained that doing this, would actually be detriment and turn Tnarg's into a worse heal than it is for most of us(There's a Speed of Mithaniel Augment dropping from a VT level raid btw). <br />
So your wish is to make Tnarg's a worse spell for 90% of the Shamans and 0.2 seconds faster for those 10% who can not get ahold of anything better than a Wicked Bone Atlatl?</div></div><hr />

My tnargs is 2.6 without any spell haste buffs and I don't have the best focus.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">jzak, you're a tool.  Do you have some empirical evidence to back up your claim that more manaregen will give us nothing but headaches too?<br />
<br />
/bangs head against desk<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes. A mana bar at 50% (my manapool is ~5800) after I chain cast rains or Velium Strike on most PoP raid mobs (I start casting when the mob is 90-92% health if no aggro issues are present), but I only do approximately 100dps, when my potential is closer to 200dps.  Although I might end at 40% mana if I'm not standing in range of Chorus of Marr, but let's not split hairs. ;)<br />
<br />
As for xp groups and in general, no class is supposed to have unlimited mana, this is self-evident.  On hard ldon adventures, I chain cast Velium Strike after the mob is slowed and debuffed and I still have plenty of mana throughout the entire adventure, because there's usually time between pulls and splits to canni anyway.  It's an extreme case where I'll be low; mostly a bad pull if I have to heal people a lot or if a cleric dies will cause me undue mana use.  Do these extreme cases warrant a miraculous improvement to our mana regen abilities?  No, but many seem to think so.<br />
<br />
I previously gave you my reasons why it would cause headaches.  You simply insult me.  I don't think I'm the tool in this argument.  Please, respond like an adult and not a 6-year-old child.  Bang your head a little harder on that desk and maybe you'll knock some sense into it.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat myself: I don't want more mana, I want more useful things which use my mana.  <br />
<br />
I think this is the basis of everyone's requests here as well: stronger DDs, stronger heals, ability to use DoTs.  Those would use our mana for a better purpose than chain raining or slow-casting DDs.  Our mana regeneraton isn't the problem, it's the options we have for using our mana.  If you keep begging for more efficient mana regeneration, we'll get less mana efficient spells to compensate in return and we'll be in the some spot we were in Luclin, PoP, etc.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I'm sorry for trying and help and bring up the foundation of our class's flaws and not quick fixes that SoE is apt to throw in our faces.  Maybe in the next expansion after GoD we'll get Critical Affliction Mastery so we can crit more dots that we never use on raids!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Mana Regen<br />
How about a group canni?  Wouldn't that be fun to MGB in the middle of a Time Bertox fight?<br />
<br />
Seriously though.. how can we really say we need a better canni when at the very same time we're talking about having all this mana we can't use?  By choice I'm not max FT, because I honestly can't remember the last time I went seriously oom on my shaman.  Even when chain casting Tnargs during a god fight.  I NEVER go oom in exp groups/adventures.  If you're oom a lot, you're not using your tools.  If you don't like alternating spells with canni, don't use so much mana.  And if you're annoyed about chain casting canni, be thankful you're not a bard.<br />
<br />
Aside from Necros, no one beats us for mana regen.  I'm not even sure necros do.  It's the one area we're still one of the best.<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
Sony put themselves in a hole with slows.  The only thing I can really see being viable is an AA slow that can bypass the mitigation.  Wizards get a Strong Root.  Shaman should have a Strong Slow.  Give it a 12-minute recast time, whatever.<br />
<br />
I'm kinda ehh in regards to AE Malos or whatever.  I can't see them making it PBAE any more than I can see it being an unresistable debuff.  And if it's neither, it will go by the way of Tigir's which, because of resists and target limits, was very rarely used, with only 8 spell slots available.<br />
<br />
In general though, debuffs aren't a big problem for shaman.<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
It's hard for me to be real objective since I'm max on AA and (almost) the best healing focus (QoM, M'sG, PoM).  I can see either a group heal over time, or a bigger single target heal, but otherwise, I'm not unhappy at all with shaman healing abilities.<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
We're not just mediocre buffers.  We've quickly gone to the bottom of the pile here.  Almost every class with mana now has buffs I'd rather have over my own.  I'd like a buff that combined a large HP buff with replenishment.  Similar to druids' Nine, except with HP regen instead of mana.  Make it last just as long as Nine or Virtue.<br />
<br />
The suggestion of having an ability buff is a great one, too.  Give us some of those item effects we see as a buff.  Stun resist, combat effects, etc.  I suppose that's probably asking for too much though.<br />
<br />
Aggro<br />
The biggest complaint I have overall is about our inability to be an impact without over-aggro.  DoT aggro is rediculous.  (Aside from Cripple, our debuff aggro is normal.)  I say give us a self-only deaggro buff, if you're not going to decrease the aggro on our existing spells.  Better yet, give us Subtlety.<br />
<br />
We have some really great tools already, but we're not able to use them because the aggro is so disproportionate.  It's my biggest source of frustration with our class.<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
Screw pets.  All those Pet AAs they're reportedly giving us in GoD are pure insults.  And what a collossal demonstration of laziness and lack of creativity.  Please, get a clue.  We're not a pet class, not in the high end game.<br />
<br />
Damage<br />
Because of aggro, the majority of our dots are solo spells only.  Bane is really only useful on single target encounters, so it's decent for god raids, but I wish it was resisted less.  At least it's recast keeps us from getting summoned by it!  :)<br />
<br />
And last, I'm not a heavy nuker, and not really a fan of DDs -- otherwise I wouldn't have made a shaman -- however, our nukes are pretty much a joke.  Either make them shorter casting, or much bigger damage.  I'd prefer shorter casting.<br />
<br />
Along those lines, I'd love to see a focus that gave improved damage to poison nukes, aside from the &quot;all nukes&quot; focus.  I don't have ID yet because I always feel guilty taking ID when there's &quot;real&quot; nukers yet to get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The long and short of it is, over time, Shaman have gone from being kings at a couple things (buffing, debuffing, soloing), to being mediocre or subpar in just about everything (except soloing).  The game advanced, but we haven't.  We're so balanced now that there isn't anything unique about us anymore, and we're essentially replaceable when it comes right down to it.  It's kind of depressing.  Think I'll go sit over with the monks now.<br />

<br />
Its not that we suck at mana regen its that all our spells costs are based on that we have the best mana regen out there and that is not the case anymore. I would much rather have a Canni that I could hit in half the time that I can canni5 to get back half the mana of 5. Its just making life simple for us. Heck they have dumbed down the game for tradeskills why not repetitive keys like canni. Besides you forget that other casters mana regen is based on a spell that stays in place.. canni 4 you have to keep mem'd.. you can simply cast it and then put it away. Hell I'd take a lich form of mana regen atleast its castable and then forgetable. <br />
<br />
Grouping sure you may not go out of mana but at raids I tap my bar out and Can 5 2-3 times in a fight..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">You make a valid point Durich.  I, too, wish our method of regen (canni) wasn't so tedious.  But... when it comes to things that need to be fixed/improved... we have enough mana, regardless of the cost of our spells.  I'm willing to work a little extra here (canni, canni, canni) if it means we can get something done about aggro or have better buffs instead.  But heck, if they want to address all of the above, I won't complain!  Just making my personal priority clear.<br />

You can take 1,000,000 data points, but in the interest of time, 30 grants strong enough power in process sampling in most cases.<br />
<br />
About the highjacking, I requested the posts be moved if there was interest.  No one did this, so they're staying here I guess.<br />

And thank you for your concern about me taking a statistics class. I don't have to be a mathematical genius to know that 30 casts of a spell is not a big sample enough to build statistical information on it. Especially when I get 7+ resists on a few mobs in LDoN easy adventures.</div></div><hr />

Fo7 takes me to 50%Sorry for being a dumbass.  I had no idea you cast Fo7 in the heat of battle.  For the record, I haven't always had 6k mana, and I remember when Fo7 and even Khura's would take up huge percentages of my mana bar.  But we're not talking about percentages.  We're talking about mana regen, and making it through fights with enough mana, which we do, almost regardless of our level (post-54) or mana pool.<br />
<br />
Would I prefer passive regen over active regen?  Heck ya.  But I don't see that happening, and I'm okay with that.<br />
<br />
As my original post indicated, I was listing my personal priorities.  And when it comes to problem areas that need to be fixed, mana regen shouldn't be our top priority.  That's just my opinion, though I'm plenty malleable if there's a pursuasive enough argument out there.<br />
