<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halmah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thinking of getting a third account to transfer my 62 druid to and 3 box now that I have a laptop that can handle this game.  I have been 2 boxing my monk and my Sham in in Velks (almost always deserted) but am getting bored there.  I figure by 3 boxing these 3 toons I get the best of everything. Druid has snare, DS, Mana regen buffs, and decent heals/nukes, + resist buffs; Sham has Stackable buffs on druids, pois/dis resist buffs, slow and haste; Monk has incredible DPS with buffs.  All toons have nice equipment (been playing 4 years).  Trouble is I have never 3 boxed and wouldnt know where to go for the best exp.  The real trouble is landing a Shams slow at the level he is.  Should I just continue leveling the sham in a 2 box with monk? or try the 3 box out and where to do it?<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance for advice<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>slimb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tier 1 planes should treat you well.  The XP wouldn't be the greatest for the druid/monk.  But it'd help you catch your shammy up.  PoN has yard trash thats easy to grab solo (no need for FD pulling or such).   At 54 your shaman shouldn't do too bad with slowing either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">droga or IA would be a fun spot for the 3 of ya, along with nadox as well. With a little buffage you should be able to 3box nadox too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KaeruWak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PoJ basement is a nice place with low resists to go while your shaman levels up, and the cash loot is great.  It has a nice XP bonus, and it's an outdoor zone for your druid.</div></div><hr />
