<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>murghkhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Apologies in advance for the cross-post but I felt that the topic was very relevant for shamans and given that healing is normally stated as the #1 shaman concern (as in the poll that's stickied) and the most common request is a upgrade in the Quiescence line, I wanted to get some feedback on this idea. I am sure many have suggested this before but if we can get both classes to agree on the benefits, maybe we can make SoE fix this. <br />

Hoping for some feedback as well as how best to bring this to SOE's attention.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think Tnargs itself needs an upgrade, and a better number for the GoD spell. Tnarg's should be where the Gates instant heal is at now. The upgrade to HoT would be nice for old content, but would not really help shaman fill secondary healer role.</div></div><hr />
