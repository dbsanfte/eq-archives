<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the past couple of days there's been one in the bazaar for 5k.<br />
<br />
Today I log on to sell a few things and notice there is another person selling one or 4k...and one more selling for 350pp.<br />
<br />
So I book it to the bank, get 350pp and run and buy it.<br />
<br />
Is this a good utility weapon worth keeping or should I sell it for a profit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Perhaps use it until you get Turgur's Insects.  I don't see how you'd want it after that, however.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I just read something that says it has a recommended level of 51.  If that's true ... bleh ... I'd say sell it, especially if you can get 4-5k.</div></div><hr />

I call mine the Shaman Death Stik.  When it procs on the first hit - man that’s nice.  But it's when you are getting the snot beat out of you by an unslowed mob trying to desperately get it to proc (&quot;just one more hit...&quot;), that’s when it will get you killed.  I doubt I'll ever seriously use it, but it had a better ratio than my Centi Warhammer, so I'm fooling around with it.  It saves me casting a 175 mana spell, but costs me 1k or so in health :)<br />
<br />
Truly a worthless weapon - can't use it in a group, and soloing it will get you killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've had one for sale at 1500pp forever.<br />
<br />
It's a good utility weapon if you are wading into a big crowd of mobs (I.E. greenies) and want the free slows (I used this for HHK guards a while) .  Or if you REALLY hate to cast and want to pretend to be a melee, this is a weapon to use.<br />
<br />
Otherwise get something with a nasty proc...I still have a Hammer of Scourge for sale..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh..I just sold my Blight for 1500pp.  About as much as I could get for it.<br />
<br />
I'll put the Di'zok stick at 3k..see if I get any bites.<br />
<br />
And yes, It's rec. lvl of 51..can't even equip it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At first glance, looked like a pos, but I gave it some more thought and changed my mind.  It's not right-click, that sucks, but it's a pretty high level spell proc at least, that's cool.  However, in almost every situation it's safer and more efficient to cast slow on inc mobs, don't wanna rely on the randomness of the proc.  <br />
<br />
That's why at first I thought it sucked, because in that respect I told myself the proc is worthless.  But say you pull a train, and assuming you have someone for crowd control, you can use mana on slowing all the incs once.  But sometimes, a fight lasts longer than 6 minutes, and some mobs need reslowed.  You could then proc the weapon afterwards, thus refreshing slow at the cost of 0 mana as the tank is picking on them one by one.<br />
<br />
But overall, I'd say this weapon is kinda situational.  By the time you reach 51, you'll get a better slow, and you'll probably stick to that one as it slows more and takes 2 seconds less to cast.  And problem is, as long is turgurs on the mob, this proc will be absolutely worthless.<br />
<br />
You *could* continue using togors insects post 51 tho, it's still a high % slow.  Tanks won't see the difference either, and like that you could continue refreshing togors at the cost of 0 mana, but again this is assuming the fight will last long enough that slows need refreshed, which might not happen very often.  But at 350pp, best to keep bagged along with the resist gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd keep it. I have a bag full of weapons I carry around, thats one of em. Damn nice for greenie farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There was some discussion awhile back regarding this slow stick. It's a very handy weapon, especially for TOV raids when it is very difficult to slow mobs for shaman's with or w/o Malo. This baby procs alot and has been a life saver many of times.  I've also ran into situations where someone pulled a crapload of mobs and I ran out of mana...&quot;inc slow stick to the rescue!.&quot; <br />
<br />
DO NOT under estimate the power of the slow stick...it is well worth the price of 4K(or so).<br />
