<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone give some tips for killing the BoT Tower bosses?  Or what the order of difficulty is?<br />
<br />
We went after Auliffe blind as bats and got wiped... <br />
65 Warrior<br />
65 Druid<br />
65 Chanter<br />
64 Rogue<br />
65 Cleric<br />
64 Monk<br />
65 Sham<br />
62 Rogue<br />
63 SK<br />
65 Necro<br />
64 Wiz<br />
<br />
As you can see we were low on healing and that stupid friggin stun is really what wiped us.  We just couldnt get folks healed in time after being stunned and once our MA went down the rest of us went down real fast.<br />
<br />
Any clues as to what our resists should be to start resisting some of the AEs they shoot out?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info folks.  I always get great help here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Add<br />
<br />
65 Bard<br />
<br />
to that list and you can pretty much ignore the stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't think you can get ANY of the tower bosses with that crew.  These are Named bosses.  The normal wing bosses are MiniNamed and can be pretty tough for a single group.  I can't imagine going after the towers with just two groups.<br />
<br />
I think the normal rotation on the easiest tower (water) is three or four, and you don't have even that much.  He also has a small AoE, which you can easily hide from, having the tanks run to you for healing.  I'd place Aufie as the second toughest mob, with that knockback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BAH we dont need all those big groups of folks.... all of us 2 boxing doesnt help things though ;)<br />
<br />
We were thinking about the bard... we know a bard and we just have to get her a tower key i guess.  That is our problem for a lot of the big guys we want to do is that bards are required due to our not being in uber gear and having huge resists.  As it stood we only had 3 of the 11 with MR over 250 buffed up and the Boss has a neg 250 adjustment on his stun :/<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info guys.</div></div><hr />

Unless they've changed it since I was there, the tower key will take in a whole group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">on Auliffe Chaoswind...<br />
<br />
Everyone should have Lev or DMF, his stun is knockback and will shoot you off the platoform.  3-4 group minimum on most of the Tower bosses, MT tactics with CH rotation.<br />
<br />
water boss...<br />
Keep your casters out of AE range and hes cake<br />
<br />
fire boss...<br />
Hard because of pops and thin wall aggro.  Im convinced if you could get him to the floor of the big round room he would be easy.  Havent tried it yet.  Usually we fight him on the walkway down from his platform.<br />
<br />
earth both...<br />
Almost impossible to split off the adds that come with him.  Also, most arnt mezzable.  Stick a tank on each of the adds and have raid force take down the boss.  Other then that he was too hard. The pull is the hard part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It might be possible to kill one or two of the tower bosses with less than 4 groups with some creative use of charm but highly risky and subject to fail most of the time. One warrior and one cleric is just not going to be able to carry you far enough. Two clerics at a bare minimum, preferably 3 or 4 and you might be able to take one or two of the bosses. Your mileage may vary of course depending on how good your gear is and how much aa you have but after a quick look at your gear if everyone elses is similar you are going to have a tough time of it. But hey, doesn't hurt to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh i'm the gimp of the group :)<br />
<br />
We havent gotten any good drops for my sham ever and my rogue is the back up rogue so everything is deferred to the main.<br />
<br />
Everyone in the guild has roughly 100AA for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We have done all 4 bosses.  Air and water were the easiest.<br />
<br />
For air, just DMF the raid and the proc becomes negeligble.  He becomes a start melee fight after that.  If someone does fall off w/ lev or DMF the can manuever to the port back to the top platform.  I could see 3 GOOD grps doing him.  Also i think he is the easist to clear to.<br />
<br />
Water was a simple fight w/ AoE managment.<br />
<br />
Fire has the nasty aggro in the areana.  Clearing the pops around the areana and then pulling him to the center is the key.<br />
<br />
Earth is by far the most difficult.  The clearing is a pain due to the Jord Skygge's w/ there 1500dd.  There is also some nasty wll aggro.  When you get to him, you have him and his 3 turkeys to deal with.  1 of the turkeys is Mezzable, 1 rootable (but you'd need a druid w/ Savage Root as he broke a Shaman lvl663 root in about 5 seconds), and 1 needs to be off tanked.  It took us 3 or 4 times to get him down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">take 2 clerics, a good tank a  bard and a chanter with CoD and you will take Auliffe easy.<br />
<br />
Have done it in groups as small as 8. Me, druid warrior cleric cleric chanter mage(call of the arch mage enabled) bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My question is why bother? <br />
<br />
My guild has killed at least 8 tower names so far without a single loot item dropping other then spec/rune/agnarr key. <br />
<br />
They are still not fixed and and basically a complete waste of time until they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We got a pile of those monk 2handers that proc lighting strike or something from Auliffe and those that haven't upgraded with a Sol Ro or PoF 2hander still use them.<br />

See how bitter you get after that happens over and over and over, even after they said they fixed it then said later they forgot too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gummey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Earth Boss is a Piece of cake with the right crew and pulling Strategy.  When I was in CT with my Main we had great pains learing this back in January.<br />
<br />
Essensialy you have the Earth Boss and 4 Named Storm Riders.<br />
<br />
You can not pull the boss Directly.. or all of the storm riders will come once pacify wears off.<br />
<br />
The Key is to remember that the Earth Boss, and 4 Guardians are linked.<br />
<br />
So Pacify pull a Named Guardian &quot;Fetter in corner&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Boss Mob come to save his presious pet &quot;MT on Earth bos and pull to Opposit corner&quot;<br />
<br />
Named Guardian comes to help Earth Boss and Friend..&quot; Fetter in other corner&quot;<br />
<br />
Every one assist MT in killing Earth Boss<br />
<br />
Yet Other Named Guardian comes to assist. &quot;Fetter it in other corner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Final Named Guardian comes to help &quot;Fetter on table&quot;<br />
<br />
Wizards keep Guardians fettered...<br />
<br />
Kill earth Boss..<br />
<br />
Then Dispatch Guardians.<br />
<br />
See easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That works, except for through-the-floor aggro.  You have so much aggro in different places, that it's guranteed that you'll have problems there and possibly warping and summoning too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heh that works also except for the fact there are only 11 of us :) <br />
<br />
Yeah i'm starting to think that we just need more folks to get this down right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seemed to work pretty flawlessly before the patches that fixed floor agro.  Remember this is the last room before the stairs that go up to the Boss.  The one with the huge table in the middle.  Guardians get fettered closest to stairs.  and Boss mob is taken out on the oposit end away from stairs. corner fight like AOW or Vindi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">pardon my ignorance...fettered?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">my friend did all the bot tower minis with 18, are they easier than described?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thx rez on 2 month old post  :p oh and they are all 1 groupable, cept earth(lightning is tough), if you are well equipped and know what your doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Without CoD they can be MT'd with two or three clerics.  With CoD it is a lot easier.  Nerf CoD plz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">CoD is already nerfed, CoD pets will no longer tank if there is more than 3 PCs on the hate list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">2 Clerics, 1 warrior, 1 ench with COD pet, 1 bard, 1 shaman can take em all cept sand and maybe lightning, depending on how good ya are.  And no, not COD pet for tanking, just for dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah the info is a bit old and times do change. These guys are definitely 1 groupable altho the odds are if your up to that point the actual drops on them aren't really very interesting to you. The bp patterns would make some good money tho I'm sure.<br />
<br />
Personally I've done the water boss with about 10 people with only 2 clerics and a druid as healers and we where able to do it easily.<br />
<br />
Of the other ones I could definitely see lightning being done altho he definitely would be a bit harder.<br />
<br />
For the air and the earth wings they should be doable too but i'd say both will require a bard in the mix. For the earth wing the bard can gate 2 of the adds/pets back to thier bind so you only have the named and 1 messable add to deal with. For the air it's for the added MR to resist the ae.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hello,<br />
<br />
3 of thes tower bosses can be one grouped, we have done it but usually bring 8 to 12 ppl for them, the more ppl you bring the bigger of a hassle they become. Of these chars about 4 to 7 are twoboxed.<br />
<br />
Leather bp guy: Learn to love paci and bring a bard and you ease thro this one.<br />
<br />
Plate bp guy: Paci your way to him and just kill him<br />
<br />
Chain bp guy: Learn to love paci and memblur, preslow him. Have someone take the rampage. Bard on this one for help on preslow is great.<br />
<br />
One good clr or two will do on all, we are usually 1 to 2 clrs and 1 to 3 shms on each of these.</div></div><hr />
