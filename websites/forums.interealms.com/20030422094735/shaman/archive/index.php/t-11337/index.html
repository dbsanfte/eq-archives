The Shadowstep potion has a 3.0 sec cast time when single... But when you make 10 of them, and combine them in a 10dose - the cast time increases to 10 sec... (!)<br />
<br />
Yeah... Funny huh? Has to be a bug, i figured, and i am so clever! I think... Not... But... Oh well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">another bug... can't combine 5 halfling illusion potions into a 5doser :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have you /bugged this, /feedbacked it, /petitioned it?  put it in a forum that the developers actually read?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SoW potion effect is wearing off when zoning.   Anyone else have this problem?  This is on a frog.  I sent a feedback, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What level frog? If he's low level, sow from a potion isn't going to last long at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Level has nothing to do with how long it lasts.  I've used them on low levels before and lasts the same amount all the time.   The problem isn't length though, it goes off once you zone.  For example, I drank the potion just before zoning, and after zoned, no longer sowed.</div></div><hr />

Make a lvl 1 twink and give him sow potions...watch them last like 10 mins.</div></div><hr />

Haven't known a difference, but that's not the point of my issue.<br />
It's wearing off after ZONING.  That's the issue.</div></div><hr />

If that's not the point, then why bring it up?  As for the actual point, my baby fwoggie has had no probs with SoW potions and zoning.  He's kept the (albeit short-lived) effect from Gukta to PoK to Everfrost to Halas and back to EF.  Where, of course, it wore off just as he got a couple polar bear cubs mad at him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SoW potions scale from 27 minutes at level 9 down to 3 minutes at level 1. Timed it myself. It is indeed short, and maybe that's your problem. But if your SoW is gone in even less time than that, then you have a different problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did you zone because you were almost dead?  That will strip all buffs if you zone and &quot;die&quot; while zoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, I wasn't almost dead.  I tried it three seperate times.  At level 9, I drunk the potion just before zone-line, zoned, and sow was gone.  I doubt the effect has a 20-30 second life-span regardless of level.  It must be some freak bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As far as I know, buffs are stripped etc when you zone in with &quot;Hp less than zero hp with no hp equipment&quot;, or to put it another way, if you have 400hp in hp equipment on your char, and zone with less than that (means you normally would have been dead if you hadnt any hp equipment), you will get stripped for buffs. <br />
<br />
So if you are a froglok twink at lvl 4-5 and have lots of hp twink gear, even if you zone with pretty high hp, you can lose your buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">VI said way back when potions first came out that the effect duration was not factor'd off the level of the maker.<br />
<br />
It was, however, based on the level of the person drinking the potion.  They became the &quot;caster&quot; of the spell.<br />
<br />
Level 1 sow = 3 mins<br />
Level 65 sow = priceless<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Smokejaguar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The developers and programmers at Everquest do read the /bug and /feedback reports every day.  The best way to get things changed and addressed is to keep sending in those reports.  Posting here about a problem is a good way to get the word out to other people to send in those reports.  The /bug and /feedback reports are the best way to communicate with people at EQ, that is why they put it in the game.</div></div><hr />

Pretty good chance this is your problem.  If you have a level 1 frog, with 20 hp, and +500hp in gear, if you zone with 500 hp, you're going to get your buffs stripped every time.</div></div><hr />
