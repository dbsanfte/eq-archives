<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, sorry to post here, but I'm pretty much in a stump right now. Currently, I've been grouping in High Keep since 29, and now I'm 31. I'm getting very tired of this place, mainly because of the whiny people and all the trains they can't control. I read in the hunting forums that Dawnshroud would be great till 36 or something, but I was wondering if I headed down there, would I be getting the same exp as in High Keep? The only place that I know so far that has about the same exp or better then High Keep, is Crystal Caverns. The only time I hunt there is when my guild mates are on, but they get off around 10 pm my time, so I make the journey back to High Keep. I'm also getting a bit tired of Crystal Caverns, mainly because I keep dieing there and having a hard as heck time to get out. So guys, what would you recommend for the best grouping exp? Loot isn't really important, but it would be great. I'm really in a bind right, and I don't wan't to be 31 for a week like I was 29. Any input would be appreciated, and yes, I know I should of posted in the hunting forums, but no one is ever on there. Thanks again - Exodus<br />
<br />
P.S. - I've read that HP is more important then wisdom. I currently have 146 Wisdom, and I was wondering if you guys can give me some advice on some gear that can help me raise my hit points. I only have about 500-1k to spend, so I was wondering if there are a few pieces of gear that can help me raise my hitpoints. Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are lots of different places you can go. You could solo (If you can control 2 monsters at a time =p) or group in SplitPaw. If you can get a good group going in there you can get some really good exp due to the exp bonus. You could also hunt just outside of SplitPaw in SK and kill the Gnolls out there. You could also hunt in Frontier Mountain near the LoIO zone . I stayed there for about 3-4 lvls and made pretty good exp and some ok loot of the Giants that are found wondering. Everfrost might be a ok place for you to go to too. You can probably kill the Mammoths there to lvl 32 and get a descent ammount of pp from the tusks well you are at it.  Just wait till lvl 34 though, then things will get much easier :)<br />
<br />
Edit: I just realized that you were asking for a place with good grouping exp. Since I only grouped twice in my Shamans carrer I'm probably not the best person to say where to go. But all those places above have lots of places to group in. Best place probably being SplitPaw if you can get a good group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're going to Danwshroud get in a group at the shroom house, very fast xp with lots of action, I highly recommend it until about 35. Decent loot too since the shrooms sel for 2-5pp each.<br />
<br />
You caould also go to Overthere and get a good group, reall yfast xp but watch out for the goons and trains if you're on the ledge. i prefer to hunt near the Skyfire zone rather than the ledge because there aren't as many trains as on the ledge.<br />
<br />
As far as your HP problem, you can get a clay guardian shield which is 25AC and 50hp for 2-300 in bazaar, and most of the ry'gorr stuff can be found for the same price there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bonegnawa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For good grouping XP I have found that Sol A, Kaesora, and deep in Dalnir is great.  In Sol A you get a group together and kill the gnomes and clockwork gnomes.  In Kaesora the undead are better xp than the live stuff (spiders and ravagers), and in Dalnir pretty much anything will give you good XP.  All 3 of these zones are great, but will be mostly empty.  You will need to bring your own group 99% of the time.  I hope this helps you out.  Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Exodus, you are a dying breed sir :) But it is a great thing to see some of you still around like we all were in the old days. it sounds like most of your time is spent in dungeon type environments such as CC and HP so far, and yes, they are more challenging, but you are doing great things for your skills as a shaman without even knowing it. I would recommend you continue to hunt in dungeons whenever possible as it will be much more rewarding to you in the long run than LoIO, FM, dreadlans, OT, that sort of thing is. <br />
<br />
I would recommend you try taking your group to some new spots like Mines of Nurga I think is a good spot for your level. Also, Dalnir is a great dungeon as well. Guk, Solusek b, Permafrost, etc. <br />
<br />
As for equipment, if you can post your magelo profile with y our current gear, it will make it much easier for us to recommend upgrades :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey guys, thanks for the quick replies. I've decided to just bind in Thurgadin and hunt in CC when my guild mates are there, and just take the spire back to Luclin and group in Dawnshroud when they're not. The exp in CC is very good, and the only reason why we kept dieing was because my guildies and I were not working together (Fixed that last night =). Aktunka, not sure what you meant, but I guess I'll take it as a compliment ). I'll go ahead and post my Magelo profile tonight when I have a chance to write down my gear. Thanks again guys, you don't know how much you guys helped. - Exodus<br />
<br />
P.S. - After I hit 34, I plan on soloing if the exp is better and faster then with a group. I'm going to try what a guide in these forums suggested, and I'll hunt kodiaks in the GD. If the exp is not as fast as it would be with a group, I'll try grouping elsewhere. If I plan to solo from 34 and on, what would be better to have; more mana or more hitpoints? Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would have to say that HP would definetly be more beneficial to a soloing shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lol yeah sorry I meant it as a compliment. Shaman that spend their time during the formative years (and all classes really) will be better at their job later on. Dungeons are typically at least somewhat challenging. Outdoor zones are typically not challenging at all. Outdoor zones you always have the crutch to fall back on of SoW and lots of room to play with for running a mob around or whatever. This can sometimes be good exp out there, but it doesnt teach folks to really be solid in groups. If you always have the easy out available of just running to the zone, then if things get a little tough it makes sense for yo to just zone out and then come back in. if you are deep in a dungeon and you know that if you try to run you will get killed by the adds, that makes everyone pay attention a bit more and work better as a team. If your group can succeed and do well in a dungeon, then the outdoor zones will seem even easier to you. Anyhow, i was complimenting you and recommending that you do more groups in dungeons (many of the dungeons are bring your own group nowadays though) and hone your skills so that you can be the best shaman you can be later on. Good luck!</div></div><hr />
