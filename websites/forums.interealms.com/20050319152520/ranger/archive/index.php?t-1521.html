<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">J'horra</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well pretty soon I am going to be in the market for a new truck.  I read several reviews for the different models I was looking at, and none really told me much.  Each review just said how great the truck was and none listed any problems or concerns.  Granted maybe that's because the ones I'm looking at are all good, who knows.<br />
<br />
Basically what I'm looking for is a smaller truck with a crew cab.  (Smaller as in less than a half ton.)  What ever it is, it has to have a crew cab, though not necessarilly a 4 door.<br />
<br />
I have 4 different models in mind currently.  The Ford Ranger, a Mazda B-series, a Toyota Tacoma or a Nissan Frontier.  Believe it or not the one that got the best review of the list I read from was the Ford Ranger, and regardless of all else I have always been a Ford fan.  The one with least favorable review was the Nissan, not that they said anything bad about it, they just gushed the least.<br />
<br />
Of the four the Mazda seemed the cheapest with the Ford just a tad higher.  All were fairly close in price.  With the options I want on this I would really like to keep it around or under 20,000.  Any advise on this would be very helpfull.  <br />
<br />
PS:  It doesn't need to be a 4x4.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">J'horra</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a 94 Ford Ranger for about 6 months and absolutely loved it, so I'm partially leaning towards them or Mazda as they are made by Ford.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quebelor</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ordered my ranger in '97 from the factory, and i have been completely satisfied with it since then.  The mazda's are about the same as the rangers in every way, except that the standards for them are a little lower from what I understand.<br />
<br />
Good luck, :) <br />
<br />
ps. upgrade from the 4-banger engine, it is well worth the extra expense. I went with the largest they had in '97 which was a 4.0 liter V6, and I haven't had any problems with it. I also upgraded the air filter from the paper ones to the re-chargable type (can't think of name.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sionach</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first car ever was a Ford Ranger (5-speed, 4-cylinder, short-bed, regular cab).  I *still* miss that truck, LOL.  I've had a Nissan pickup since then, but wasn't all that excited about it.  Between the two, I'd definitely go for a Ford.  Heck, I'm looking at getting a new car in the next few months and am considering a Ranger again.<br />
<br />
The only trouble I had with my Ranger was an air-intake issue; basically the air filter had to be changed at a maximum of three months (whether it appeared dirty or not) or the engine would &quot;ping&quot; on accelleration due to insufficient air intake.  That seems to be a problem peculiar to at least the early-mid 90's Fords though; happened with my mom's 6-cylinder Tempo and her 4-cylinder Escort.  They may have corrected this problem with the newer models though.<br />
<br />
My dad has a Toyota Tahoe (I think that's the name) and has had some trouble with it; overall, he doesn't seem too impressed with Toyota's trucks, although their cars are definitely at the top of the list.<br />
<br />
I'm not at all familiar with Mazdas, but of the 4 makes you listed, I'd definitely go for the Ford Ranger; they're great trucks &amp; fun to drive.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I drive a Ranger that is an extended cab.  It has 4 doors, but not the coventional doors you might be thinking of.  If you didn't go with the Ranger, I would recomend the Tacoma.  They cost a little bit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">J'horra</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this is a nice surprise, I thought for sure everyone was going to tell me to get a Nissan or Toyota.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1997 Ford Ranger, King Cab.  No third or fourth door.  I'll be keeping it for a long long time.  The other trucks just don't measure up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayspring Askanison</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here's why you should choose the  Ranger.<br />
1. It's a Ford. Best selling trucks in the U.S.<br />
2. No matter how well the Japanese make cars, they still don't know diddly about trucks.<br />
3. It's a RANGER!!!<br />
 Plus I've had mine for 8 years and have put 124,000 miles on it and have had no major repairs on it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now if you wanted the next size up in trucks I'd say go with the Tundra.  They are rated the safest trucks out there.  The F150 by the way was rated the most dangerous.  Poll from less than a year ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hokanu</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You may already know but...<br />
Ford Ranger = Mazda B series.<br />
<br />
Same engies etc.. The vehicles are almost identical. Either ford makes the mazda or vice versa but either way you cant go wrong. I have an explorer.. and i love it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayspring Askanison</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ford now makes all Mazda trucks. Not sure about their cars.<br />
 And I thought it was the Silverado graded as the most dangerous?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coryn</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mazda IS a ranger, repackaged.  The ranger crew cab is nice.  Mazda/ford is basically a pricing and trim decision.<br />
<br />
Nissan now makes a supercharged v6 crew cab... I'd be leery of buying that until you see how it fares over a few years of consumer reports.   Supercharged engines can be finnicky.  That said, their normal engine is fine.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for just an on-the-road vehicle with cargo capacity, Toyota has a great rep as a car maker.  They're still building their rep as a truck maker, but they're not all that different if you're not getting a 4x4.  All the people I know with tacomas and tundras are extraordinarily happy with them.<br />
<br />
Dayspring, manual or automatic in yours?  I chose manual in my 99 ranger, as the last ford we owned went through 6 new transmissions in 9 years.  124k is pretty good for either.<br />
After going through six automatic transmissions in eight years in our last ford, I distrust them.<br />
<br />
Plus, the stick shift ranger has 6 cup holders... the auto only has 4 ^_^<br />
<br />
Anyways, ford/mazda or toyota are probably your best bets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jorana</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was going to say boo Ford.  I drive a Chevy S-10 ZQ8 that my husband bought me.  It is real cute.  But from your list, I'd say Ford.  Like Dayspring said, It's a RANGER!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emer</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go with the Ford Ranger also.  They are a solidly buit truck with good motors.  Get the 4.0 L v6 if you can.  A bit better than the others.  Mechanically the Toyotas hold up just a bit better, but the Ford gives it a run for the money.<br />
<br />
The new Mazdas are pretty much a Ford with a few variances, but Mazdas are inherintly more expensive to fix.<br />
<br />
Nissan makes a good truck, but they tend to sound like a baby rattle after 50K or so and not something I'd recommend getting if you wish to keep it for a long length of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go with a Ford SVT Lightning.<br />
<br />
Not 4x4 or a crew cab, but hey it's got 360hp!  ; )<br />
<br />
The newer Rangers are pretty nice.  I also like the Tundra as well.  I had an 89 Dodge Dakota that I liked very well, and the Dakota is the only one of the mid-sized pickups that you can get a V-8 in I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emer</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hands down I work on less Dodges than anything else.  I'm pretty sure that part of it is that there are less Dodges on the road than Fords or Chevrolets.  One thing I do notice though about Dodges is that they aren't plagued by some of the more common and long lasting problems that GM and Ford have been fighting for years.<br />
<br />
Dodge/Chrysler people tend to be off in their own category and rarely are just people that switch over to try something new.<br />
<br />
A very nice addition to your list of possibilities, but I find the Dodges a bit smaller in the interior department, and lowest on the scale of traction, but low in the maintainance department too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laliana Tucckerr</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I'd have to say a Taco SR5 Crewcab personally, but thats my opinion.  I like dodges as well, I see fewer of them on the road here in Texas.  All the friends I know that have dodges love em.  Right now I drive a 98 Sonoma(5 speed, 4 banger), and I love it.  Especially when I get 30mpg+ going from Here to Dallas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samin Rainbow</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best to know your local mechanic, not one that works at a dealership, but self employed. I would go to some of your local fixit shops and ask around.<br />
<br />
Most of the guys who work everyday on cars and trucks can give you an idea of problems they see with different companies, models, and engine sizes.<br />
<br />
I have a very good friend who owns his own shop, and they have access to all the updates and recalls also.<br />
<br />
Take for instance the Ford Explorer/Bronco. They have a problem with the engine stuttering, and can't seem to figure out why. <br />
<br />
The Chevy S10 v6s seem to need more work than the 4 bangers.<br />
<br />
When the quad 4s came out, they had alot of problems with blown head gaskets. This was due to the block and head being two different materials, iron and aluminum. Both would heat and cool at different rates, causing the gasket to leak.<br />
<br />
For big trucks, I personally like GM trucks. Ford has always been to generic for me on the interior, and I have always liked the chevy engine/drivetrain better than ford's.<br />
<br />
For small trucks, the old Mazda was a great truck, I even own one still. But since the buy out from Ford, you are basically getting a Ford product with a few minor changes in appearances.<br />
<br />
The Toyota has always had the rep of being a vehicle you could depend on for lots of years and miles. To me, their trucks just plain lack power compared to the others on the market. They are also priced a little too high imo.<br />
<br />
Nissan is a decent truck. Not too expensive, and if taken care of, will give you pretty good wear and tear. I would again probly go with the 4cyl here. A bit better gas mileage, and the Jap makers just seem to do better with the smaller engine imo. With the advancement of technology, you won't see a huge amount of difference in performance either. Unless you want to tow something heavy, in which case, you shouldn't be buying a small truck.;) <br />
<br />
Dodge products have always been low on the list for me. All the way back to the day they had those dang starters that would whine after you try to crank them. They might be comparable to other makers now days due to technology, but I still put them low on the list. They seem to give you less than Ford or Chevy in performance and such. I pretty much lost all faith in Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth after the early 70s. <br />
<br />
Jeep also made/makes a truck, not sure if they still do. One word on Jeep------parts-----expensive. To me, Jeep makes only one type of vehicle worth buying, the CJ7 models.<br />
<br />
I long for the day when Honda makes a truck. I would like to see how that would turn out.<br />
<br />
Best bet though, buy what you really want/like. After all, you are the one paying the bills, and if you buy something you really didn't want just because of consumer reports, you might find yourself unhappy in the long run.<br />
<br />
happy shopping!</div></div><hr />
