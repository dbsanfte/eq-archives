<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1). Don't touch chests untill after you succede/fail at primary mission. a heal might be nice, getting free mana is nice too, but a curse that lasts 30+minutes that is -200 to all stats, and makes you drunk really sucks ass.<br />
<br />
2) go to the potty before you start the dungeon.<br />
<br />
3) have fun.<br />
<br />
anyone else got suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Watch , pay attention and anticipate moving so you dont get left behind. If you dont want to watch and move than exp in a pop camp , this is clear and move and dont get alot of time to afk. We didnt have to MOVE EACH KILL and get that hectic but was continual. <br />
<br />
   I watched the puller they will sometimes leave while a pull is in to keep a pace going. If you need to kill 58 mobs in 90 minutes and your behind do what you can to do extra damage without minimal pingpong of the mob. When we've pulled aggro off the MT its ok but dont make it worse and make them chase and keep it to a minimum.<br />
<br />
   Above all as was said go to the bathroom before you start hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Grab an Ornate Sceptre (+23% cold DDs) or similar device, replace your epic with it (just for the adventure), and nuke (velium strike) the heck out of mobs when you're done with slowing (stand next to the mob when you nuke though).  I've resorted to velium strike as my damage of choice because it's just too much effort to wait for the tank to pull agro off of you, then position yourself correctly and be careful of breaking mezzes or roots, and having to malos to reduce resists, and then by that time it's too late to rain because the mob is near dead already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Always have Tigirs loaded.  You will get more then 1 mob on many pulls and Tigirs slows just fine for the amount of HP the mobs have.</div></div><hr />

Dying does not mean you lose.  Rezzing and waiting for people to get that mana back just about guarantees it.<br />
<br />
With a mage and cleric in the group, at least, I've found that malo is required on every critter - but you really only need slow on multiple pulls.  That DS really rips the hell out of em, and making sure their rains land for full the majority of the time speeds things up a lot.</div></div><hr />

Learn RC-Ability and get it up to level 2 or 3.<br />
Or do the Blood of Nadox quest and keep that spell always memmed, in case a dot trap was triggered. Safed my butt (and my parties) two times now :-)</div></div><hr />

I group with people I don't know all the time!  And I rule them with an iron fist!!! <br />
And we win and we all are happy with the results and people want me to come be in their groups again when they are looking for shamans. <br />
<br />
Sometimes the neatest experiences are with people with whom it's their first time or they're not used to a &quot;scaled-up&quot; sort of play.  You teach them a new way to do something and it's a real break through for em!  After all, if nobody teaches the newbs how to play, often they never do learn!  <br />

In conclusion your comment was shortsighted and insulary, lacking in any sort of inspiration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">About Containers:<br />
<br />
People lose their damn minds with these...<br />
I always start by saying &quot;Dont mess with containers until end&quot;<br />
but you always get that fool who just wont listen and proceeds to &quot;try&quot; and inspect it anyway. If your group can, get a couple rooms away while one person tries to open the container.... some of them containers are pretty nasty... I have yet to see anything that drops in them thats worth the headache... I have only seen a couple of cursed containers which I was able to open... all weilded nothing<br />
<br />
You dont have to kill every mob:<br />
<br />
Just get the ones in your way, unless your in a slaughter mission.<br />
On many missions, especially the assassinate the boss mob missions, you can pacify/lull and entire room and skip it. Not advisable on rescue missions.<br />
It also helps to know where you are going. Head over to http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/[/url] and download the LDoN maps.<br />

Alot of people dont know shaman's have this AA... It certainly impresses people when you use it, especially when they pull 4-5 and you knockback one, slow one and get agro and root it off in the corner.<br />
In 15 seconds you just removed 2 of a bad pull. This AA has saved my groups life many times. This works well with or without enchanters. As far as I have seen it wont wake a sleeping mob. Many times I will knock back one mob so I can use AOE rain spells on the one the tank is fighting.<br />
I LOVE VP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We did 12 adventures without a bard or enchanter. Just had a guild cleric pull for us (pacify) and I would just peel off any adds with slow and then park.  Later on we had to get a cleric who did not have their 65 pacify, so they couldn't pull...so I would pull with root, then split off mobs with slow/root.  First time I've gotten to play main puller as a shaman, but it worked and we were pretty much chain pulling.  The next morning I did the same thing even with a bard in the group, because the bard told me he was good at mezzing but not good at pulling.<br />
<br />
I think doing assassination only missions with the LDON maps is a pretty sure (if not cheap)way to get your 51pts...most of the times when you fail, it is due to the timer, not you or your group dying.<br />
<br />
Also, there is a spell haste 4 augmentation you can buy, has anyone seen if there is a burning affliction 4 or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hail,<br />
<br />
Some personal rules I have for LDoN that haven't been mentioned yet.<br />
<br />
1)  Assign a Masterlooter.  Nobody else loots.  Roll ONLY on no drop loot in the dungeon.  Everyone can meet back at the adventurer merchants (or wherever) to roll on Lore tradable stuff and to sell/split the cash after you win or lose.  (CASH on these adventures is decent, if you are FFA'ing loot someone is getting shafted.)<br />
<br />
2.) Assign the Puller, MA, Primary Healer, MasterLooter, etc before you zone in.  Though this sounds like common sense, I've seen 3 out of 6 people act as pullers before this was straightened out. Miscommunications like that can be deadly.<br />
<br />
3.) If you have an Evaccer, USE it in a nasty overpull situation.  Succoring to the zoneline only takes a minute, and you can be right back where you were before in another minute.  It is like an automatic get out of jail free card if used right.  The loss of pets is nothing compared to the time loss in a dungeon when a member dies, EVEN if they were bound nearby (which is another rule).<br />
<br />
4) Take care of all buffing prior to entry into the dungeon, &amp; there is no reason not to go in with everyone at full mana.  Pet classes should have their summon pet spell memmed &amp; ready to cast right away.<br />
<br />
5.) Everyone goes in at the SAME TIME.  As soon as the first person enters, the clock starts, so don't waste a few minutes IN the dungeon waiting for the last person in your group to arrive.  Go inside as a group.<br />
<br />
6.) IF you are waiting to do chests and such at the end (which I agree with), STAY TOGETHER as a group when you tackle them.  Blood of Nadox or Disinfectin Aura might be able to cure the nasty dots, but if you are looking at one chest 2 passages away when the rest of the group gets hit on a different one, they still might die.  <br />
<br />
7.) When attempting to disarm a chest trap, only the person making the attempt should be within AE radius of the chest.  If the chest has no obvious traps (or you have none who can detect them), use dogdog to attack the chest with the rest of your group (including you) standing back out of range.  If the trap triggers the 3-spawn of mobs, your pet will not aggro them and you can leave them alone (if you want) w/o wasting any time on them.  <br />
<br />
8.)  Keep the group apprised of your progress.  Many still don't know that hitting Alt-V will bring up the adventure window and give them a rundown, and some are too busy to check often.  Don't let your apparent good progress on a collection quest lull your group into slowing down, because I've personally gone almost a half hour w/ no drops before when beforehand they had been dropping almost every 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
9.) Clerics &amp; rezzers, mezzers, etc, aren't required for a LDoN (normal setting).  Abnormal groups CAN succeed.  Don't waste an hour waiting for one key class.<br />
<br />
10.) HAVE FUN!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you get it, use bane.  I'm really happy with how this dot can actually run for almost its full course (or its full course on an add), and I'll toss in a nuke or 2 as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">6.) Avoid those who use AOL. Suggest that they upgrade to the cup and string connection before dungeon romping<br />
<br />
ROFL this cracked me up, ain't it the truth.  If you are playing EQ on an AOL connection you should never have been allowed to load it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">side note:  Ive had good luck with chests so far - multiple heals/mana replenishes that were very welcome when we got them.  Allowed us to continue without slowing down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have found that multi-tank groups work just as well as MA-mez groups. With 2 tanks (one on each on a mob), I can slow and DOT each, then nuke whichever needs to be nuked. 2 die in less time that it would have taken to kill them 1 at a time. 3rd mob adds are usually easily rooted off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My advice, don't do collection quests. These are the only kinds where the game can cause you to fail through no fault of your own.<br />
<br />
I've done 3...went 2-1 on them, the 2 wins were done with less than 10 minutes remaining on the clock. Maybe if they fix the distribution of the special drop item, it might be worthwhile to take these, but right now they are just invitations to fail. Going a half hour (as described above) without a single one dropping is frustrating, annoying, and causes panic and bad feelings in the group. I play to have fun, and even in victory, collection quests are no fun. I won't be doing another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Why mez when you can have multiples rotting!<br />
<br />
2, 3 or 4 in camp and Bane of Nife(or Blood)/Epic DoT is the stuff. Slow, DoT and root and adds are half dead when the rest of the group gets to them. Pets make great CC on slowed mobs.<br />
<br />
My advice, don't do collection quests. <br />
<br />
Did a collection adventure with PAL/CLR/MAG/BST/SHM/WIZ all 65 and finished with heaps of time to spare. I'd happily do more of them. Do an adventure that suites the group.<br />
<br />
Guild groups are the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">problem with collection missions is it is possible to clear an entire dungeon and not win because items are not there to collect.<br />
<br />
its rare, but can happen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've had bad luck on collections as well. I've had to kill all but 3 to get all the drops. Collection=bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I've had 0 problem on collections ... finished one yesterday with 40 minutes to spare.<br />
<br />
But yes, slaughter is by far the least random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ditto on the collections...I have won one with 1 minute to spare, I have lost one, and killed every mob in the dungeon, and still there were not enough of the &quot;trinkets&quot; available to win the mission.<br />
<br />
It's entirely too random. Like camping a named, with a PH, with a rare drop. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Collections seem to be really random... finished one with 30+ minutes to spare, finished the next with 5 min.<br />
<br />
Also, different group combos will not doom a mission to failure.  Did one with a druid, shaman (myself), necro and 3 rangers which we all assumed was destined for failure and ended up finishing way ahead of schedule.<br />
<br />
