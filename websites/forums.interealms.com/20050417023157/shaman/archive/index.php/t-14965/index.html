<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>malikaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok not gonna say much, but this place rules.<br />
<br />
with a full balanced group of 60 plus. (me 56) i got a yellow bubble in less than 2 hours. it was sick. mobs go down fast with nice group i think they have less hp than poi normal mobs but they do have quite high MR.<br />
<br />
Not only is the exp good but i won a FT2 necklace of a named (easy) mob. and there was the nice stuff dropping from named such as a 30 AC plate style bracer that was tradeable!<br />
<br />
Ok its a pain to get to but imo its worth it made trip twice. best thing to do is get hold of a non kos mage to run to the ZI and coth people up. ive had a laugh exploring the place and its many maze style castles, but the exp does rule as it gives the indoor bonus.<br />
<br />
thats all i gonna say. and if ur on AB forget everything. but be quick its a temporary zone  :rolleyes: <br />
