<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jebuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm debating whether to upgrade my other gear first or save up for a JBB.  I definately need a new chest piece soon, and a JBB costs about 20K on my server, so it's a tough decision.<br />
<br />
Here's my magelo:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">JBB for sure, with it you can kill easier and faster thus improving your wallet that much quicker to upgrade other things.<br />
Your gear doesn't look that bad from where I sit and with the Bazaar in place, upgrading will take no time at all. Took me all of 30 minutes to reoutfit myself with new gear, something that would have taken several days/weeks to do in EC. <br />
<br />
JBB for sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you solo a lot then get the JBB as it will make a big difference. If you group most of the time then maybe a general upgrade would be better. <br />
<br />
Also remember just because you save up the cash to buy one doesn't mean you'll find a seller :(<br />
<br />
How much cash do you have saved up? if it's a long way short of 20K then it probably is better to get some cheap upgrades as it'll help you kill more mobs to get more money for that JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, so far your stuff looks like you're a melee Shammy.  The JBB is made more for Kiting and group exp.  I'd go ahead and upgrade to JBB and then start to focus a little bit on Wis gear.  The AC's nice, but you will have a much larger mana pool with a little more Wis.  Once I got myself over 200 Wis, I started to change out my low AC items and balanced it a little better.  So I do have another set of stuff for resists, but Wis/AC is my primary set.</div></div><hr />

jbb for grouping? its intensely pooptastic for grouping. jbb is a GODSEND for the solo 45ish shm. buy a bloody jbb, trust me you will crap the bed when you see how nice it is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">JBB is what I call a 'game-altering' item.<br />
<br />
It CHANGES the way you play. Whether you Droot (DoT / Root - Talamay's term I can't remember), Melee, or a hybrid, JBB is an incredible item.<br />
<br />
Plus it has sell back value. When / if you finally replace it - you'll get decent return value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I would actually recommend a JBB over HP/MANA gear.<br />
<br />
JBB is a consistent, mana-free 25-30dps on most mobs, including resists.  That's 150-180 mana-free damage per tick, and it stacks with all your DOTs.   By comparison, his best poison DOT at lvl 46 does 10dps (Venom of the Snake).<br />
<br />
Even at 49, Envenomed Bolt only 25 dps, but costs 320 mana.  That means that even at 49 the JBB is infinity percent more mana efficient.  Or to look at it another way, it doubles the damage output of EBolt alone.<br />
<br />
You won't see any change this dramatic EVER in your playing life as a shaman.  When I solo now, frequently the only spell I cast is Turgur's Insects.  I use epic, JBB, and dogdog for the rest.   I only EBolt if the creature is particularly difficult or has a huge number of HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">JBB all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Greetings, :)<br />
<br />
If the JBB is 20k on your server, my advice would be DEFINATELY NOT worth it... get overall upgrades instead for your cash...<br />
<br />
IMO if you can't solo well by now, you still need to learn about your class, no offence intended, :)<br />
<br />
Ex... <br />
<br />
Earrings: Either Black Electum Sapphire Earrings (ac 2 hp 35 mana 25) or buy the components needed for Earring of the Solstice... <br />
<br />
Another Shield: Either Sarnak Battleshield (ac 25 str sta agi 5 hp 40 sv f c m 10) or a Crystal Chitin Shield (ac 20 wis 9 mana 40) or both if you want, so you can switch...<br />
<br />
Rings: those you have are good, might wanna get a Shadel Bandit Ring too :)<br />
<br />
Visible Armor: Try to get on some PoG or Kael raids and get Spirit Weavers Armor (PoG) or Rune Crafters Armor (Thurg Quest, given by the dork in the armoury), both have the same stats... :)<br />
<br />
Face: Crystal Spider Eyes, Enshrouded Veil or Mushroom Veil are all good choices...<br />
<br />
Waist: What you have is good, but also consider Oak Leaf Girdle (ac 4 hp 40 mana 40)<br />
<br />
Cloak: with the amount of cash you have (if you are considering buying a JBB...) you should also think about getting a Hiero Cloak...<br />
<br />
Or have patience and wait it out and go to seb and velks later and get your stuff... and save your money for a horsie... lol<br />
<br />
All in all IMO JBB is not worth 20k... Sure its nice to have, but it won't make the huge difference in whether or not you kill said mob... if it does... you are doing something wrong imo... :)<br />
<br />
Hope it made sense :)<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is nowhere close to a tough decision.  At level 46, and for many levels thereafter, (JBB + Totemic ) &gt;&gt;&gt; Full SS/Kael.  Needless to say (JBB + your current gear) is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anything you could get for 20k. <br />
<br />
It is an obliteratingly powerful item at that stage of your career.  Nothing comes close.  Certainly nothing you could get for 20k.  Buy it and enjoy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">To the people that are in favor in getting other equipement then a JBB, do you own one?<br />
<br />
That is the only logical reason I can come up with for you stating other gear is more important then a JBB because if you have a JBB I garauntee you would be saying differently and if you do own a JBB I dont know what your thinking.<br />
<br />
For the soloing Shaman before 60, JBB is THE BEST piece of equipement you can possibly get, better then Fungi, horse, hp items, mana items, you name it, even after 60 I still think it is the best piece of equipement you can possibly upgrade with.<br />
<br />
However, if you are a grouping Shaman I suggest other equipement as you will not be using the JBB as often as you would be doing solo but for a solo Shaman its a must have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The Desire for a JBB is the only reason why i plan on spending a few evenings in rathe when im 49(49 cause its so darn easy then, and i would rather get 49 asap then spend time in rathe now, when i could not only do it easier later, but also have my better spells sooner, rather then staying 47/48)<br />
<br />
I've used a JBB as a loaner from a guildie...its just amazing...<br />
-<br />
<br />
Anyway, what you could try doing IMO, is selling some of your stuff, like the totemic helm, and replacing it w/ JBhelm... Your Wis is more then enough(i have 150 w/ bear), but your AC is lacking abit.  A sarnak shield would be a great addition too...or a clay gaurdian sheild, which can be found cheaply(on Saryrn, Charred gaurdian shields still can sell decently, so just sell it, and make a reasonable bit of cash back, and minimize your loss if you buy a clay.  I also suggest spending abit of time buying items and selling them to vendors for a profit.  <br />
<br />
I like Silveretched Warhammers(170pp to vendors), Velium XXX rings(200+ to vendors, depends on which), JBHelms(333pp) and other such items, like forest loops and the like.  <br />
<br />
This will net you some quick cash, and pay for your upgrades.  I suggest doing this, and making a couple quick upgrades w/ no real money loss, then selling some of the old stuff :)<br />
<br />
You could even make a decent bit of pp this way :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i guess if ya got an item that gave you free nukes at 26dps then yeah, you would end up relying on that, and it would change the way you play accordingly. especially at 45 when is is the most bang for yer buck(altho it seems rather an expensive item at 45). if ya get the cash for it hey more power to ya, but ya prolly shouldnt stop lvling just to save up PP for one. LVLs &gt; ANY item no need to change your style unless ya get one.<br />
  <br />
&quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; =P<br />
<br />
and good luck! im glad someone is buying those things ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Krol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I find it amusing that JBB gets so much attention. Seriously, skip buying a JBB ever and get a piece of gear with decent stats instead. If you happen to loot a JBB or someone gives one to you, then great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">said it before and I'll say it again; anyone who doesn't recommend spending every plat you have to get a JBB as early as possible is either a) an iksar b) foolish c) not an owner of a JBB :)<br />
<br />
i dare say it is the number one single item that changes the game the most, it is one of the TOP items when you look over all classes and inventory slots, for the level 45-59 xp game. simple as that.....it's a very unbalanced item really, any item so class defining is, but it's here, and it owns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, 2 outa 3 aint bad :P<br />
and i didn't say not to buy one, hell im sure its nice.  just don't stop getting XP to pharm PP for it.  hmm on second thought...yeah!! kill greens for cash.<br />
all your xp mobs are belong to me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Even though I don't have nearly enough plat for a JBB, the decision is rather moot for me. I have never seen a JBB for sale on Druzzil Ro. Not saying that they aren't, but in all the time I've looked for them I've never seen one.<br />
<br />
The closest I've ever come to getting one was when my best friend won a JBB in a roll and the shaman with the party ninja-looted it and logged out. (He agrees with NBG but this shaman had been insisting on rolling on every drop so when the JBB dropped he felt he should get it but the party decided to roll since they had to on every other item.) My friend rolled a 99 and won the JBB but the shaman then stole it and logged. No help from the GMs either. Sigh.<br />
The  friend was going to give the JBB to me. That's a real friend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I find this funny...<br />
<br />
At his current level (46) exp'ing would be the wisest choice, if he wants decent upgrades (armor) he needs to raid, not solo, I.E. if he's gonna debuff at a point (prolly not before level 51) he will need hp/mana/ac...<br />
<br />
Yes, I do own a JBB... only used it to finish of mobs or to attract agro when grouped if needed, usually I use dog, pull with slow, root, let dog attack, and start stacking dots... then canni, canni, canni... etc then proceed to melee'ing the mob, heal pet etc and then using JBB to finish it off... at level 46 the mobs he'll be soloing will likely have atleast 3k hp if he is gonna get any decent exp... which means the 286 dd with the JBB with a cast time of 8 sec... with chance of interrupt and breaking root etc are time you could have used to regain mana or redot... imo... Again, I find that you are able to toggle multiples not using JBB than using JBB as main dmg source...<br />
<br />
But then again it is a matter of play style :) Those happy about JBB'ing all the time, should be and continue to do so, all I did was offer advice... and if he has access to almost 20k he should get upgrades, cause his current gear isn't that great imo, if he has that cash to spend... Some may say now that I prolly don't know anything, and don't know how to solo etc, etc, but hey! :) what do they know about what I can, and cannot? I know what I'm capable of and got no need to prove that...<br />
<br />
Again friend, in my honest oppinion, don't waste money on JBB when you can get almost all your gear upgraded :), but remember most importantly, do what you find is best, not what others dictate ;) You might find another way to do things, which could very possible be better than any other of us who have offered advice on this thread :)<br />
<br />
And to the person who said that advising gear over JBB doesn't own one or is foolish, to that I can only say... you must get really suke exp then when soloing, cause if JBB makes the difference, the mobs you are soloing ain't worth squat for exp... imo :P<br />
<br />
I hope you get happy with what ever you decide :) and wish you all the luck  :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I am facing this decision fairly soon as well.  I was saving up for an Iksar BP, but broke down and bought the wifes Rogue a barbed Ringmail BP.  I am nearly back to the point where I can afford the BP, and noticed that there were 3 JBBs up for sale for 14k.  I am level 51, and the regen BP is something I really feel I need, but if the JBB is all that and a bottle of coke, maybe I should push for the JBB.<br />
<br />
I should say that I only occasionally solo..I am usually duoing with my wife's rogue.  The epic has helped our Duo tremendously, and I would guess that the JBB would be just as big a help.  But that regen BP.....I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">ikkie bp is nice, but not game altering.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, velarius...<br />
<br />
Say you get your JBB at level 45...you are happy, woot!<br />
<br />
You pull w/ slow, click your JBB...32 DPS+puppy damage = dead mob fast...<br />
<br />
WOW, thats pretty good...MUCh better when you were using<br />
<br />
pull w/ slow, VOS, melee,....<br />
<br />
why is the first way better? cause my melee sux, i hit for 20 every other time, w/ my spinechill...ALSO, this way is 10DPS from VOS(400damage/42 seconds approx), and maybe 5 to 10 DPS Melee.  Torgors+VOS is 335 mana...i think), just torgors is 175...<br />
<br />
THUS, you do mobs at 32 DPS instead of 15 to 20, AND for half the mana.<br />
<br />
thats double the pulls w/ out needing to med/canni, and the mobs die in half the time...<br />
<br />
I'd say thats well worth it, in every possible way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have had the pleasure of using the JBB in my mid to late 50s, and it really is nice.  Its usefulness does tail off somewhat,but given the opportunity to have it at mid40s would be a godsend.  It truly does improver your capabilities because it is mana free. Mana free &gt;&gt;&gt; all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Used it through the 50's..dont use it much with epic proc..just epic dot and let dog keep aggro and wack the mob..but is handy<br />

all this time shamans have become too dependant on JBB. clogs your brains so that you can't realize better strats. JBB is just a toy. <br />
<br />
I'll bet you use DOTs.  If you didn't use DOTs, you'd think of different strategies.  The DOTs must go!<br />
<br />
Sure, I've changed my soloing (and grouped) strategies to incorporate the JBB, but the same thing was true in the teens when I realized that my nukes were not very mana-efficient compared to wizards, in my low 20's when I was no longer able to put out decent melee output compared to warriors, in the upper 20's with the first decent DOTs, in the low 30's with the pet, in the upper 30's with the first decent slows, at 49 with Envenomed Bolt, level 54 with epic....  I don't think I'm inclined to give up ANY of those advantages.<br />
<br />
At 50+ with JBB it's all about aggro management and controlling where the mob goes.  Those lessons have been valuable when grouped as well.  And 30dps is 30dps any time, it lets me help out in a group that's a bit short on damage dealers.  JBB + pet is enough damage to make up for being a melee short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">use your dots if you like....it's less mana efficient, you'll have more downtime and get worse xp at least from 45-55. and you don't root+blast with JBB, you slow, tank and blast.<br />
<br />
you have definitely never tried this when you can say that it's just as efficient to stack dots, heal your pet and melee. your dots at level 45 do about 500 damage each for 160/170 mana, since you claim that decent xp mobs have 3k hp that means you'll have to put on at least 3-4 dots on each mob, and then heal your pet? uhm.<br />
<br />
it's completely and utterly pointless to ever melee or casts dots soloing when you have JBB at level 45+. the only exception would be with rabid bear or against cold resistant mobs. and of course for a little variation, i admit jbb'ing gets repetitive.<br />
<br />
jbb just a toy? well if a toy helps you solo EASILY from 45-60 then it's a pretty damn good toy to invest in.<br />
<br />
and sorry if i sound rude...but this JBB denial has to end :)<br />
<br />
edit: if you aren't soloing, then of course you could consider other options. imo a regen tunic will do you very good because it's indirect mana regen, which increases group xp. JBB isn't too useful in groups, a blast here and a blast there maybe, but you won't be chain casting it.<br />
<br />
duo'ing with a wife/friend or whatever, i would also recommend JBB first. you'll be slowing the mob on inc and then it's usually just your partner doing the work - you can chain jbb to help the rogue backstab and increase kill speed.<br />
<br />
i just think you should do EITHER jbb OR regen. those are the key shaman 'thangs' for level 45-59, no other gear with stats will do you as much good.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />
