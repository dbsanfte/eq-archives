<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What do you guys think about the overall levelling rate, and the speed at which content becomes obsolete in WoW.  Has Blizzard miscalculated the Carrot and Stick formula?  Are we all going to be 60 and bored by March?<br />
<br />
It seems to me that I will have a character at 60 in a month without much to do with him.  Time to start that priest I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While a lot of people have claimed that leveling is &quot;Just right&quot; if u ask a lot of level 60's they will tell u that they mostly sit and watch the worlddefense channel or go get some loot from the few high level instances.<br />
<br />
Blizzard should have slowed it down a bit more. It's not like most ppl espected it.<br />
<br />
But look at the other side too. In eq ppl enjoyed characters by leveling ONE character and maxing out as much as they could. This took ages of course (bunch of tradeskills plus flags etc). Then they would have another character and work on that a bit. I realize this has changed a bit in the last 2 years with luclin and pop and insane leveling speeds.<br />
<br />
Now wih wow it will probably end up being a similar story except ppl will make every class and take it to 60 before moving on to the next mmorpg. Besides a lot more content will be added. Still one of the things that made eq cool was the accomplishment and not the fact that u are given something. For example a bard walking around with his epic 3 years ago showed he had to be in a powerful guild and they had to work hard to get that. Not 6 ppl in a group but a lot more on a very long and hard quest. There was achievment and respect associated with that. The closest thing so far here is the horse. The game is still very fun and i have not neaerly explored even a quarter of all the zones so i got a long long LONG way to go. If it stops being so much fun slow it down a tad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally, I like the leveling as current because I don't feel that I'm trapped in any particular class. I actually want to see 60 with my Paladin and then move onto another exciting and unique experience in another class. It works both ways, you can only enjoy something for so long, eventually the carrot withers on the end of that stick from old age.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One word: Replayability</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think that blizzard did miss a lot as far as high-end content. Not enough raids, and the raids that are in are not scaled properly. There also should be more diverse instances, and battlegrounds for faction warfare.<br />
<br />
<br />
The good news is this, blizzard seems to be aware of this issue, and is working to bolster content.<br />
<br />
<br />
One inherit advantage that the poster above mentioned is replayability. Lots of quests you havn't seen before on the other faction's side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im liking the leveling curve.  My one major gripe about the game is the quest rewards.  The armor and weapons you recieve from quests are way out of line with there intended difficulty and level.  Good items only come from instance bosses and a select few tradeskill recipes.<br />
<br />
I'm also eagerly awaiting the battlefields and some PvP rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One word: Replayability<br />
<br />
Bing....right on.<br />
<br />
Never understood, even in EQ, why people maxed their character, and played 300 days on them, never trying others or experiencing anything else. I have alot of alts, fun to work them and let rested exp built on others, etc.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good items only come from instance bosses and a select few tradeskill recipes.Which is exactly the way it was intended to be.<br />
<br />
From the outset Blizzard maintained that the best gear would come from instances and professions. The Green Gear   obtained from normal dungeons/mobs is enough to get you through the game, but if you want to have the &quot;special&quot; gear, you have to put a little more effort into it, but still not as much of a mind numbing effort as EQ requires to get even a mediocre piece of gear &amp;lt;cough!&amp;gt;Glacial Bear&amp;lt;cough!&amp;gt;Totemic Helm&amp;lt;cough!&amp;gt;.  Nah, I think it's balanced nicely.<br />
<br />
And Faern nailed it. This is the first game I can actually see myself hitting current level cap in a reasonable amount of time. However, once I do that I've got several alts that I'm really looking forward to trying out. I know I'll play my Tauren Shaman quite a bit, but also liked the Warlock class when I played it during ST2/OB. The quests for their minion upgrades is fun and interesting.<br />
<br />
I think the carrots are still there. Just implemented differently than Sony did with EQ.<br />
Level 58 last night on rogue.Congrats Mill. How soon to 60 ya think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've been playing since December or so (no open or closed beta for me).  Have three toons so far:  lvl 22 Warrior, 20 Mage, 20 Hunter.  I'd say the leveling is just about right.  I don't see how some folks managed to get to 50-60 so quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh wow.  I get called a retard in a negative reputation bump for playing more than one toon.  Did I complain about how long it was taking?  Hell, I am having a freaking good time.<br />
<br />
Read the post again.  &quot;I'd say the leveling is just about right.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah i'm about to hit 52 and with 60 in vague sight not really bothering me. I still have my shaman , hunter , rogue and wizard to play yet. Two of which are horde and a whole another side. <br />
<br />
Ive always been one to play alot of toons so this works well for me. Had 4 almost lvl 70's in eq (might all hit 70 not sure havent eq'ed in months)so i'm sure wow will keep me busy for a long while yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I figure after playing for just over a month that having 3 toons lvl 20 is just about right.  Even if I played 1 toon, I doubt I would be 60.  Taking my time, enjoying the ride.  Besides, with all the complaining about the end game not being fleshed out, why rush it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't mind the leveling speed, my gear goes obsolete fast but at least I feel like I'm making progress.  I'm also missing out on tons of quests in others areas as I tend to stick to the human lands and ignore the dwarf/night elf/neutral quest lines.  <br />
<br />
My only major complaint is discovering how much more rewarding it is to grind on humanoids in ore rich areas vice questing.  Instead of wasting 30-45 min a night on griffin rides I'm getting mountains of loot, cloth and ore as well as incredible exp with no wasted time.  Questing is only worth it as far as I can tell if:<br />
1) you want a change of pace<br />
2) the reward is something you want<br />
3) you're going there anyways<br />
<br />
Nothing beats the &quot;run to the far side of the moon for 1000 exp&quot; quests when I can kill 5 mobs right in front of me in 2.5 min for the same exp instead.  Errrrrr....<br />

Exploring = interesting adventure. Grinding = mind numbingly boring to me.<br />

And fighting is fun in this game, even now I get great satisfaction from that 1500 + point crit ending a mob's life. It just doesn't seem like grinding anymore, it is fun to do.<br />
<br />
we have quest weirdos in our guild, that will spend an hour for a quest that gives 3000 exp, and get killed many times in the process and travel all over, good for them, that is also why they are stuck in the 30's and 40's hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">good natured name. We have a warlock in our guild, a very old friend and a funny guy, he is always questing. He also is the most death prone character I have ever seen and he is proud. He convinced 4 others to join him in badlands for questing, needless to say, couple hours later, very little done, many deaths, hardly any exp, the guild chat was funny.<br />
<br />
It's all good, and if there was a quest worth doing I would do it. I will go back and do all the quests I can to build up various factions, who knows what the hero classes will require in the future, eh?<br />
<br />
I do quests that are grouped together, a bunch of em I did in felwood, I was there anyway, it is like a nice bonus. Couple require killing things in winterspring, once again, you have to fly to felwod to get to WS anyway, so turned quests in on way there, etc. I just don't go out of my way to get 3-5000 exp when the travel time is sucking off more than that alone.<br />
<br />
The quest reward for one badlands quest I think our death sucking warlock linked was a &quot;chainlink towel&quot;, under it it said &quot;Now even less absorbant!&quot; hehehe.<br />

I couldn't agree more, though I tend to do my grinding deep in out of the way outdoor dungeons/caves to avoid the E*Bay farmers.  The risk of dying and the chance for ore/chests/loot tends to keep my ADD attention span focused.<br />
<br />
Even though I play on a PVE server, I'm trying to level fast so that my crew can complete our instances easier.  I'm also in a mad dash to hit 40 before the next content patch just in case Blizzard puts in the quest for the paladin mount.  <br />
<br />
Ahhhhhh, sweet, sweet 40- weaponsmith, mount, plate mail and all the new spells.  I will have you, my preciousssssssss....  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I tend to avoid sitting in one spot, but I think grinding has it's place.  I love questing, and usually that includes a bit of grinding.  But at least I can roam while I grind.<br />

Grinding is important for skills at least.  I don't know about anyone else, but I like keeping every skill I have up to date.  And that takes time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I *love* the pace of WoW.  My regular group of 3 hit 35 last night and we've done just about every quest we've come across (dumped a couple that seemed to just be filler).  I actually read the text quest (and enjoy it!) - we've found some out of the way quests like guarding the kodo caravan, and tracking down the treasure chest of a long shipwrecked captain (yaay, ship wheel shield!).  We've done all the instances up to this point, and kept up with tradeskills and class quests (dang that warrior).<br />
<br />
I love it.  I wouldn't change a thing.<br />
<br />
Then again, we're MORE than happy to abandon our EQ routine, which was &quot;log on for at least 5 hours a day or fall behind all your friends and become known as one of those guild slacker leeches&quot;.  I love making reasonable progress on a couple of hours a night... I can actually get all the other stuff that I need to do DONE.<br />
<br />
I guess it depends on how much you want out of your video game and when.  I'm not worried about hitting 60 because after my shaman, I want to work up my hunter, and then my mage, and possibly my warrior (because my femme tauran is just so GOOD LOOKING in mail armor).<br />
<br />
I'll keep playing as long as the magic's there.  I don't get why anyone who's not 60-and-bored would bother worrying about it now.  I feel kinda bad for the 60-and-bored crowd, because I feel like there's so much entertainment in the game that they missed (but that's just me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">PvP server laughing? That makes a big difference, if you are slow to level you get your butt kicked, and that does motivate alot of people.<br />

Other than that, I am not rushing really, I just have a huge amount of time on my hands right now and can't be drunk downtown every night.<br />

Quest rewards need to be usable, at the level they can be done, most of them are junk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I can't think of a single quest reward that I have gotten that I could not equip right then and there.  Except for those quests that only offered things I could not use due to class, weapon or armor type.<br />
<br />
I've been able to complete every quest I have gotten so far solo, except for Van Cleef.  I'm only 20 (on my current toon, Hunter) and will be trying Ol'Sooty solo tonight.  :)  Found him once at 17 and died horribly.<br />
<br />
I don't visit the AH much, if at all.  Gotten a some things from guildies, but all in all I've enjoyed every minute that I have played the game.<br />

To each his own, and all that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Aww heck no, Mill.  I'm pretty confident I'll be spending a lot of time in the Battlegrounds when they're released, PvP is a phenomenal rush.  But I want to pick the time to PvP and the time I'll be PvE'ing.... probably some type-A personality crap.  ;)<br />
<br />
I also equip about 80% of the quest rewards that I can - and a lot of those I sell only because my man is a leatherworker (not in chain for 4 more levels).  I imagine at the higher levels things may change.<br />
<br />
Up to this point, they seem to have things nailed pretty dead on for me, quest-reward-wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If people skipped a lot of quests, it may be hard to get faction up later.  I am currently honored with all 4 horde factions and 3/4 of the way to exalted or revered or whatever in Org and TB.  I'm also Friendly with Ratchet and Booty Bay and neutral with some I don't even know where they are.<br />
<br />
If you wait until quests are grey to you, you get a tiny fraction of the faction impact you would get if you did the quest when it was yellow, orange, or red to you.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if faction is important to you, skipping all the quests is not a good thing.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Also, getting 5k xp for a quest turn in is pretty nice and often times quest xp gets me most of the way through my levels.  Sometimes for multiple step quests it adds up to a lot more even.  I've quested exclusively, grinding only in conjuction with a quest.  I've also equipped about 80% or so of quest rewards, selling the rest, but then, hey... it's decent money.  Several quest rewards have sold for 1-2.5g so far.  I've made it to 46 this way so far, I just think people are missing out on a lot by not doing quests, but that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">lot of fairly short quests in Winterspring, Eastern Plaguelands, and Azshera that can net you 7k+ xp even at 50+. skipping them makes no sense at all, since you are also getting xp from the mobs you kill for the quest. I soloed the 4 cauldron quests in Eastern Plaguelands yesterday in about 90 minutes. the xp from the quests/creeps took me from just barely into 57 to over halfway to 58, plus I scored a nice cloak upgrade from a side quest I stumbled onto while there (sick Tauren in a house near one of the graveyards, kind of hard to see), and also made quite a few gold from the stacks of runecloth I picked up. pretty worthwhile, imo</div></div><hr />

10 bubbles of pure exp last night in 2 hours, 3/4 way into 58 now, rested exp straight grinding. Whole level, unrested, would take me about 9 hours, grinding, no rested exp, I can handle that. Spend too much time screwing around in pvp though.<br />

Even quests, elite quests, when they are orange and even red, are almost never a gear upgrade, people must have some ugly gear to where what they quest.<br />

PvP Horde shaman, only lvl 27 ATM though.  My playstyle is mostly solo, but sometimes my guildies pop in if I really want to nail some ?? con alliance ganker who pisses me off too much, or they slum it with me on the occaisional elite quest.  Anyway, I find the quest loot, especially on elites is pretty decent at my level, but gear in WoW is more liquid than in EQ as you upgrade a piece every 2-4 levels.  I haven't been able to find (nor seen linked) better usable gear for most of my slots ... again, at my level.<br />
<br />
Rested exp is sick, but really, if you play nightly, it seems to expire quickly.  If you don't log on for like 3 days you level in bursts.  It's very nice.<br />
<br />
As for Booty Bay, not going near there without a guild escort.  I know what I've been doing to Alliance in Ratchet, and what they've been trying to do to me (ghost form rocks for escaping much higher level advisaries) and can only imagine what waits for me in booty bay.  The alliance on our server is on a mission because an open raid of mostly lvl 30-40 folks took SW and they haven't been able to take a single major horde city.  I've seen them setting up complex ambushes in horde quest areas and they've been overrunning horde outposts in contested zones with bloated raid groups rotating from zone to zone.<br />
<br />
This battle ground stuff seems like a great idea.  I plan on helping out and hopefully it keeps some of some of the more frustrating individuals on my server busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Perhaps it is because I am a  rogue, there isn't hardly any decent leather rewards, and almost no daggers or good one hand maces. Tons of chain, plate, wands, staves, crap like that.<br />
<br />
Rogues are the forgotten class because of gear, I do not even keep daggers maxed because I literally cannot find a dagger even worth equipping to practice with. Been using same mace for almost ten levels.<br />
<br />
There is a couple quests, like the gnomeran that can be good if you do them at the right level, but in a few days you can already buy better from AH.<br />

Blizzard is going to have to crank out some serious content additions and expansions to keep the power players interested, imho.   To me, replayability only goes so far.  Diablo II (or whichever it was- the bnet one) was like that, and I lost interest rather quickly after capping a character.</div></div><hr />

This just caught my eye.  We have had only one epic drop in our guild as well.  Although we only have about 8 people on a night and only a handful of us are even high enough level to fight mobs with a chance to drop them.<br />
<br />
That brings up my topic... I find it kind of annoying that a lot of these drops are so-called &quot;world&quot; drops.  That is, there is like a 1% chance for any mob of the appropriate level (48ish and higher I think?) to drop a purple item.  On the one hand it is good, because it doesn't matter where you are fighting, but on the other hand, you don't have the glimmer of hope that you had in EQ that if you fought a group of mobs in one area/zone, you knew eventually you'd probably get the item.  Does that make sense?<br />
<br />
Any other opinions on this system?<br />

I actually like this system for a change. In my mind it keeps people from packing into one zone all the time. I like i can hunt in any zone that gives me exp and still have a chance for loot. In eq i tended to either hunt for exp , or loot or farming. Granted wasnt always the case when they added a zone like drogna and some of the pop places. <br />
<br />
I guess I look at the epic/purple weapons like unfound relics or fossils in the real world. They can pop up at the weirdest places (the fossils) but you dont hear about it real often. Plus if i really wanted to i can at least save up and buy on of the overpriced purple items in AH. <br />
<br />
Wow at least has some rare spawn loot droppers that ive found. Just killed one in Eastern Plaguelands for a nice blue sword i'm using. Is nice to finally get a drop that I'm actually using. Should of seen the rolls ive had when nice group loots have dropped. Could i roll any lower? Almost not possilbe lol. But thats another story.</div></div><hr />
