<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe i missed someones post on this but seems i can now grow my pet but cant shrink him. tiny companion or what ever the spell is is usless. even shrink which i realy use doesnt work( never use other spell since same mana cost)<br />
<br />
<br />
I can grow him yay soe fixed that but now i cant shrink him and the damn mut gets in my way all the time. <br />
<br />
in closeing /rude soe. Why the F cant you test your patchs ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ya this is pissin me off too. I hate running around out of pets way to target stuff because pet is always in way it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/pet guard here is your friend. <br />
<br />
I agree, though, not being able to shrink dogdog is just plain annoying (especially since I can think of no reason whatsoever why I would EVER want to grow dogdog).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Morel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This must really be hurting beastlords. Some of their pets are HUGE to begin with!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can shrink pets, but their size-when-summoned is also their minimum size. Try growing pet, then shrinking it back down. Shrink does work.<br />
<br />
The minimum size being so large needs to go, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kankan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, I have to disagree that our pets are already at minimum size. Unless this has just been changed recently you have always been able to shrink your pet once. Im guessing there is an issue with a patch recently and I hope it'll be fixed soon. As for trying to grow my pet and shrinking him twice, I have yet to try that. I doubt it will work but I cant put anything pass SoE anymore.<br />

I found I can shrink a BL pet but not my own.  What is tiny companion for is shrink works on pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For classes like necro and magician that dont get shrink.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This thread would not exist if it had not been changed recently.<br />
<br />
The size you summon your pet at is the smallest it can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, whether or not that's true, it needs to be changed from the way it is. I'm sick of targetting my dog every time I click :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ya, I thought they just screwed with the regular shrink spell and ran out to buy the official &quot;pet&quot; version of the spell only to find that it is bugged as well.  <br />
<br />
Maybe they should stick to fixing doors instead of breaking useful spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shrink on doggie worked fine until the patch that screwed up beastlord pet size.  After the fix to get bl pets down to normal size, i cant shrink doggie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">But it was fun growing my pet and the BL's pet over and over....<br />
<br />
they got to 1/2 giant size in bot the other day... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>woonie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Any idea if they plan to return the ability to shrink pets to the way it was?<br />
<br />
I am tired of my pet being larger than me in dungeons when everyone else can shrink their pet.<br />

I'm sure they do, otherwise we'd have a completely pointless spell in Tiny Companion (Although Winged Messenger was in game longer than it should have been. ;) ).<br />

Hush!<br />

They better not even think about taking my ogre pet away...</div></div><hr />
