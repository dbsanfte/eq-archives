<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nekoken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Kaesora has the most insane exp bonus I've ever seen.  I didn't even know this zone existed until I went there a couple of weeks ago.  In a duo with my best friend's bard I did levels 42-45 in like 8 hours played.  Good loot too.  I think we made like 100pp per hour just in coins.  Note, spiders suck and are far harder to kill efficiently as compared to the undead.<br />

I've never really appreciated Kunark properly until I spent 35 in Warsliks Woods and the aforementioned levels in Kaesora.  When I came back to EQ both Kunark and Velious had been released and Luclin came out a few months later.  The world is totally huge nowadays.  Back in the old days (pre PoF, PoH) I literally had been to every zone except like 2 in the entire game.  Nowadays I can't even guess how many zones I haven't even zoned into.</div></div><hr />

It's a shame no one goes there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xycon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went and checked it out today....I was the only one there...and as soon as I entered, pulled up track....everything blue.  But it looks like it's a pain in the butt to get out if you drop down those holes.  One mob did aggro me, some iksar ghost, slaughtered it and got 2% exp, with no dumb fear kiting.  Too bad I don't know enough people to come and grind here with me.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it is a pain to get out of there.  It follows the standard Kunark one-way dungeon thing.  When we were ready to leave we had a druid port us out.  I could have just snuck out (was playing my rogue) but that would have left my buddy high and dry.  Actually, Kunark dungeons are the perfect place to use ye olde Thurgadin gate potion.</div></div><hr />
