<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well lately I have been thinking about transfering to FV from BB to join up with some friends who have started a guild there. Though I would like to retain my current gear that I have now.<br />
<br />
I was just curious if anyone has or knows if the SH switch trick still works? (Trans to legends, cancel subscription, transfer to server of your choice) <br />
<br />
Just want to get at least 95% sure it will work before I attempt it.<br />
<br />
Thanks any input in apreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not supposed to work. And regular transfers to FV are not supposed to work either. Notice the supposed to in both those statements. Supposedly someone can petition to send you  back to your orginal server if you transfer either way to FV.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't work anymore, I tried. As of this time, there is no way to transfer a character to FV unless you START the character on Legends or start on FV &amp; transfer to Legends, then transfer back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mojarda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Never tried this nor have I heard it being done but..<br />
<br />
You could transfer to Stormhammer and have your friend transfer a toon from FV to Stormhammer as well.  Hand gear to your friend.  Cancel Stormhammer and both go back to original servers.  Then, do normal server transfer to FV.  And get gear from your friend.<br />
<br />
Of course, NO DROP couldn't be done this way, but dropable gear would get there.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.  &lt;shrug&gt;.<br />

It's been like this since inception.  I've moved my mage, wizard and enchanter between accounts on the same server and kept all their gear.'</div></div><hr />

As a special rules set server you can not transfer to FV from BB.  Oh and for those wondering they track gear now, a friend gave me equipment on BB I went to SH and he sent a character to SH from TP when we swapped gear and cancelled the moves were denied due to the item transfer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here is one reasonable sure-fire way to do xfer droppable gear (albeit an expensive way).<br />
<br />
Hand gear to some mules on a SPARE account.<br />
Legends enable spare account.<br />
Move mules to Legends.<br />
Create NEW mules on Legends and give them the gear.<br />
Level the new mules slightly so they dont look *quite* so fake.<br />
Xfer your main char naked to new server.<br />
Cancel Legends on spare account then get the mules sent to the SAME server as your now naked main.<br />
Hand the gear back.<br />
<br />
Note the extra step of making NEW Legends based mules (which are allowed to PICK a destination server when you cancel Legends).<br />
<br />
Yes its expensive, yes its a pain but when you are xfering gear for yourself + some friends characters at once its not so bad.<br />
<br />
This is how I xfered myself and a few friends gear. Some people just sell their old plat and then buy new plat on their new server (if they cant find someone willing to trade). Thats kind of risky though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I had an acct on legends with 4 toons, 3 were born there and 1 wasn't. I tried to transfer all 4 toons to my server I'm on now, but the one who wasn't from SH went back to its original server. I even tried the all my toons were born on sh can ya move em all to torv trick but they tracked em down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just curious, a friend of mine said that the price for Characters being transfered from one account to another has increased from $50 to over $100.  I cannot get to Sony's webpage from work (blocked by websense), so I cannot verify this, but could someone post the current price for transferring a character from one account to another on the same server?<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I think I may have just found my answer, it looks like my friend just heard a rumor and it was incorrect, glad it was only a rumor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>chmodux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">edit: nm reading comprehension &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me just caught the FV part</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I moved my character, albeit naked, to FV.  It went off without a hitch.  However, my brother tried to do the same, and his request was denied, saying &quot;you cannot move a character to FV&quot;.  This was before the full equip transfers.  <br />
<br />
Sony CSR's just aren't using the same set of rules.  Apparently some will, some won't, move.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I doubt seriously you could move with full gear.  On the plus side, its not terribly hard to equip on FV, since there is not much no-drop.</div></div><hr />

1)  This is a 6 month old post you drug up =P<br />
<br />
2)  Yes, that is partly true.  SOE recently revamped their scheme for server transfers.  The price has gone up from $50 to $75, but you keep all your gear, inventory, and bank in the process.  I assume this applies to same-server account switching as well as cross-server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Garreth Lawbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">[It is still 50 bucks for a same server account split.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sorry for dragging up an old post, but I used search and just found a topic that was somewhat related to the question I wanted to ask.  I wasn't sure which forum would be the best to ask that question in so I just added it to a thread that was slightly related :)  I didn't pay attention to the date :0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Who cares how old it is. The guy used search. Congrats for you :D If only more people did that lol :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fateholder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">just wondering what your views on the PvP servers and what will happen to them with this new transfer allowin people to come and go.  you think they will lose tons of people or gain?  they are already low populated...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The Zeks are going to gain population. These servers aren't as hardcore pvp as they used to be. With pvp safezones, the whole LDoN instancing debacle and safety from item loot (RZ) you do not loose anything really by pvping. Not that you ever did, but most people thought so. Also, alot of players know of at least someone who plays on a Zek and have slowly come to the realization we aren't all 12 year old smacktalking griefers. They make an alt on a Zek and it grows on them, and then they decide to movelog.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, EQ is in a receding downwards spiral. People will want to try all it has to offer before the ship sinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fateholder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">well no one carries more then like 100pp on them while running around so u dont lose much from Sullon.  With augs i can see Rallos Zek being pretty a no lose situation too.  <br />
<br />
Most of the gains on zek servers will be from people who are bored of the high end game(cause once u get lvl 65 all the AAs and gear u want nothin to do).</div></div><hr />
