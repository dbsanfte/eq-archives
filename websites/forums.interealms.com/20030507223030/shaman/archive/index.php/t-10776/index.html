<br />
Shaman or Druid? I'm not interested in playing a necro. I've already got some decent gear for wis based class.<br />
<br />
Thanks I'm gathering information and this board is one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">druids by far are better at root rot as you put it. Snare on the mob so when root breaks he doesn't move as fast and dots with no initial dmg so no chance of breaking roots.<br />
<br />
Up until 64 all shaman dots have initial dmg that get a chance to break the root. Pre 60 tho most shaman prefer the slow and tank method since it allows you to use you hasted dual wielding pet for extra dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definitely, the druids. Between our dots breaking root and our root spells not being the most reliable, I used the slow-tanking method, with puppy fighting by my side (well, behind the mob ;) ). The new PoP root spells are supposed to be pretty nice, and since the mobs hit so hard, maybe I'll use the old root-dot method from now on (well, after I turn 62 so I can use the new root). That is, if I solo. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ok, i hate to say it, but i agree. druids are better at root/rot.<br />
<br />
on the other hand, I would say we can easily kill 1-2 mobs faster. I can root one and toss a dot on it, tank the other no problem.<br />
As i see it, it's alot more fun to tank mobs in Teh FacE! anyhow :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The better queston would be which allows you to keep your dignity. Druid does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think we do better...slow it, stack your top 3 or 4 DoTs...root it...it dies. Normally root won't break untill max duration is hit or IF you need to refresh DoTs. Just never use your newest root.<br />
<br />
Druid can't do it as fast...though they also use less mana, but we can cann it back. Maybe about even in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Root/Rot isn't a very good shaman tactic, not, at least, until Tier 2 PoP mobs and generally experiance is that you do better in a group then anyway - and druids will be charm-soloing in PoN.<br />
<br />
Druids are better at root/dot because:<br />
Druids have snare<br />
Druids have DoTs that don't break root<br />
<br />
Shaman do better tanking mobs because:<br />
Shaman tank better (slow, chain AC)<br />
Shaman have torpor (at 60+)<br />
Shaman have a pet that does significant DPS but can't tank<br />
<br />
If you want to root/rot, start a druid, not a shaman. <br />
<br />
P.S. Not sure why the post is just about one tactic - but if that's what you want to do, so be it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">tann,<br />
not sure what root your useing or what dots, but at lvl 65 my root hardly ever goes to duration even when i don't damage a mob (even on super green mobs durations is iffy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oops. Double post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You guys are nuts. Shaman root/dot is our bread and butter method of soloing and is very effective depending on your level of pet and dot. So what if our dots break root, when a mob is slowed so much you got plenty of time to reapply it. <br />
<br />
With pet+dots eating away you can sit back and cannidance to regain mana which a druid cannot. We can tank if we want depending on how hard the mob hits.  The 49, 55 and 61 puppy can tank some amazing stuff once you get Turgurs. We are also much better prepared to deal with adds. Slow+root park them out of the way. If it's a caster add, back pet off current target and make it attack caster add it so you don't get nuked and then finish off the one pet was originally on. <br />
<br />
Druids are more effective at quad-kiting anway and wear that crappy AC leather stuff. I don't care if they have a nice snare and dots that don't break root because I still wouldn't want to be one of them.<br />
<br />
Slow &gt; all. A slowed mob means puppy can tank it and gives you time to reapply root if your dots break it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i would have to say druid as well (though i hate to admit it).<br />
<br />
Druids dots dont breat root and they have much better root spells.  Their roots break less cost less mana and are fast casting.<br />
<br />
Our advantage is lack of downtime and slow.  Lends more to us tanking for dog dog instead of rotting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Folks forgot to mention that alot of druid dots are near lure so arent resisted near as often.<br />
<br />
Still won't catch me prancing about in leather.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Druids can root/rot 1000x better than shaman. <br />
<br />
I have to lead with malosi or root then malosi + turgurs before I think about dotting tough mobs. Then I can't tell if this is right or not, but everytime my ebolt runs it's course I think it does another little bit of dd because root seems to almost always break (if it held that long). The dog gets chewed to pieces so it's really only good at dps from behind hence can't be used to root/rot. <br />
<br />
It's gotten to the point where I malosi sick dog turgurs then take the beats while I jbb. We're just not good at root/rot AT ALL from what I have experienced. Tanking isn't really an option for us in the planes 3000 hp with virtue gets eaten to shreds even if the mob is slowed you get an add and try landing 12 seconds worth of malosi and turgurs before you die. <br />
<br />
So if you want to make a casual character and take it to the 60s without playing too long at a time, then druid is definetly the way to go. Root/Rotting is VERY fun when I was able to do it and I prefer that &gt;&gt; anything else.<br />
<br />
The down side is that I find myself never wanting a druid in my group because they don't contribute enough. (They can solo anyway so they don't usually care).<br />
<br />
Also if you want a group in the planes, then being a shaman is definetly not good. We are vital for the survival of a group, but an enchanter can slow + mez.  Any group wants ONLY 1 shaman so at times you are being fought over but at other times you are /lfg on fighting somewhere :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At lvl 60 I was runnin around ME killing toilers...with KEI I would keep 4-5 rooted at a time, had epic DoT on all of them and droping a pox now and then. <br />
The exp was better than my groups with rogue/ranger/monks only.<br />
<br />
I use enstill..the lvl 34 root still for root doting. I used regular root untill high 40s before enstill starting holding well. The lower lvl the spell the more likely it is to go full duration, downside is lower lvl ones don't last as long. I don't like immobilize for root doting because it seems to be near same duration as epic (have never actually looked at duration times) I often get stuck mid epic cast when immobilize wears off.<br />
<br />
Druids are better at root/doting stuff near thier lvl...shaman do best picking on the mobs that are nearing light blue, we kill more of them in less time.<br />
<br />
In the end I doubt there is much difference in exp to be gained in strait up root DoTing...druids have us beat with the charmed animal stuff for soloing in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not sure here.<br />
<br />
I'm only lvl42, but while killing Ulthoruks in EW I've been able to root/rot 3 Hunters at once while the druids kite 4 mobs.  Thing is, I'm done first, so I'm pulling again while the druid is still kiting.<br />
<br />
At lvl40, stacking Scrouge, Envenom of the Snake and Envenomed Breathe equals one dead Ulthoruk (I do have an Extended Afflication item too).<br />
<br />
Most times, I would just root, dot, dot and dot, then run to my next Ulthoruk knowing that the first one would be dead shortly (normally before root broke).  I'd then run back to loot after I started my next root/rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The dog gets chewed to pieces so it's really only good at dps from behind hence can't be used to root/rot.<br />
<br />
Huh? What are you fighting? The 49+ pets hold up very well on slowed non-planes mobs. Takes the 61 pet for planes but prior to that you have plenty of options for hunting with pet where he can hold his own while you dot. CoM/Seb/Chardok/Hole/Katta have mobs with totally gimp resists and pet tanks just fine on slowed mobs while you dot and canni/med. The 49 dog tanks just fine in CoM, The 55 dog holds well in Seb/Chardok/Katta and the 61 dog will allow you to solo many camps in Seb.<br />
<br />
I have to lead with malosi or root then malosi + turgurs before I think about dotting tough mobs.<br />
<br />
Depends where you fight. When I soloed in CoM in my low 50s hardly anything required a maloX , turgurs usually landed on first cast. As you level up you'll see the same thing with mobs in Chardok, Sebilis and Katta. Most mobs in those zones have low MR and slow lands easily. Notable exceptions are shrooms in Seb which can be a royal pain to land a malosini and slow depending on your level.<br />
<br />
We're just not good at root/rot AT ALL from what I have experienced.<br />
<br />
Let me ask again where you are fighting? From 49 to my current level it's been total cake to solo using root/dot/dog techniques.  Prior to 49 I agree it's a bit tougher.<br />
<br />
Tanking isn't really an option for us in the planes 3000 hp with virtue gets eaten to shreds even if the mob is slowed you get an add and try landing 12 seconds worth of malosi and turgurs before you die.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course tanking is not an option for you in the planes at 52. You got plenty of other options out there where you can tank mobs or just sit back and med while pet tanks it.<br />
<br />
Planes are boring anyway, I prefer  dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Having played both, I'd cast my vote in the &quot;Shaman are better&quot; column.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The druid &quot;bug&quot; spells have NEGATIVE 100 resist checks and now stack just as well as shaman dots stack.  Druids also seem to get more clicky-dots on their gear than shamans do.  <br />
<br />
I have to vote druid on this one.  They can root/rot higher level mobs with lower risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I totally disagree that druids are better post 60. Before lvl 60, with no torpor or cann5 then I can see how druids would be better. But once you have torpor and cann5, shamans own. We can outdamage the hell out of them with dots. They kick our ass with nukes, but for root/rotting shamans own. We can generate mana so much faster than them that we have minimal downtime. <br />
<br />
The question is, who still does this heh? I have recently for quest pieces and things but not for xp. A good PoP group still much better although root/rotting several mobs at a time in HoH is pretty good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Druids may get more clicky DoTs on thier gear...but most of them are lower lvl versions that don't stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Druids by far root better than we do....not only does their root last longer by design, it is harder to break and usually lasts its entire duration (this is from 24ish levels of duo work with a druid); also their dots do no initial damage so they have almost no chance of breaking root.<br />
I prefer my way, in the face tanking after a slow...add JBB and DOTs and alpha pet and its all good :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Talamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ok i will give it to the druid on outside zones due to snare. But in inside zones or close quarter fighting there is no competition. We have higher AC/HP and with slow we can neutralize most dungeon mobs pre pop. Yes our root breaks due to our dots damaging on impact but even with a mob in my face i can get off my dots once the mob is slowed. It really comes down to playing style.<br />
<br />
If you want to snare the enemy and run around praying it doesnt catch you and beat you like you stole something then by all means play a druid :P<br />
<br />
If you want to confront your enemy face to face, slow them, cripple them, poison, and disease them while they stand there wondering why they can barely swing at you and rott in place while you laugh and roar your praise to your god then play the Mighty Shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The question was about root rot.  It is very true that if a druids root breaks and the mob catches him they are dead.<br />
<br />
For shaman since all of our dots pre 64 have a direct damage component we have a much greater chance of breaking root.  Which leads to dont dot rooted mobs.  Or at least know that when you dot you are very likely to break root.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">tanking PoP mobs in teh face (2nd and 3rd tier) just isn't a viable option.  I tried a BoT giant solo the other day and mostly got my ass kicked.  I didn't die but had to ask a monk to help finish it off.  500s and 600 hits just can't be healed with Torpor.  Ended up having to put too much mana into keeping myself alive and not enough left over for doing damage.  Might have helped if I'd had a pet up or something, but I don't really know.  It wasn't a good option, I do know that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Druids are, in my opinion, abviously and significantly better at pure &quot;root n rot&quot; (snare is just too big a factor). Nevertheless, they are, in my opinion, significantly less versatile than shaman. We have the option to slow n tank, they do not. We have a viable pet option, theirs is a joke. Our roots are weak compared to theirs, but in a serious dungeon crawl, ask your 'chanter who they would rather have backing them up! (remember, every druid root spell has a DD component that will always break Mez)<br />
<br />
So, yes, druids win at root n rot, and win comfortably. But on balance, shaman are more versatile through the whole spectrum of tactics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm really just not sure about this.  Chances are that a druid is not gonna sit and root rot all day long when there are better options for him.  I would think that root/rot is one of the only options available to high level shaman in PoP if you're going solo.   Pretty sure that even at level 49 my shaman could out dot druid easily (remember all our PR dots stack, all our DR dots stack ...).  <br />
<br />
shaman can lay the smack down if they want to, and then tank it slowed if it breaks root and even canni in the face (I do this all the time).   Druid tries this and he's running backwards across the zone.  Hands down shaman own druids when it comes to root/rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">At least through level 47, all of the druid dots seem to stack also.  This was not always the case, as I understand it, but it certainly seems as though shamans are no longer the only class who can stack dots in the same lines.</div></div><hr />
