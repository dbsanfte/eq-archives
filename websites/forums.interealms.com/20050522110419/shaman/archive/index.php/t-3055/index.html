<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thordan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Although I do not have a huge post count here, I had been visiting this board for 2+ years. I am leaving the Army after serving 4 years and going on to concentrate on my next goal which is to make a ton of money. Somehow EQ does not fit into that equation so therefore I am going to be quitting. <br />
<br />
Shaman are the best class in the game hands down. I never thought about playing another class, and I never twinked in the 3 years I played a Shaman. Anyone can argue about the stupid petty things about the class but to people who have played a Shaman for awhile we are very fortunate to have the class like it is right now. There could always be ways of making it better or changing it but I have always felt that Verant balanced us out pretty good.<br />
<br />
If any of the old Eci players read this such as Brocht, and Mallaur and anyone else I have missed, I wish you all the best. I will always remember the times we had up in hate years ago, and I hope everything works out well with you both. Also Qualm and Rathelon, even though I didn't know you two very well I still respected you as good, old-time Shaman I wish you both the best.<br />
<br />
I wanted to say one other thing. If Bearpaws is still out there, he is the reason why I chose to stay with being a Shaman. I remember back when I was around lv30 and killing dwarfs in BB he showed up with all of his shiny armor. We chatted awhile and I inspected and tried to get every piece of gear he had. I doubt you remember that, since we really hadn't talked since but thanks again.<br />
<br />
Thats it, thanks for keeping Verant on their toes about our class, and enjoy the game. I wish you all the best.</div></div><hr />
