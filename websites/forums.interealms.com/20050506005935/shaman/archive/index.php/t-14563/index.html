<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guess what... after collection Torpor research components for a few months, and keeping my eyes always open.. someone was selling Yaeth's 118 (R) for 7k... first time I saw it for sale, so I got it..<br />
<br />
Spent 5k on words of Sapience, and 3k on words of Revenant, I found the 107 in Veksar.<br />
<br />
I'm excited... I find my chanter friend online, whoring out c3, he has max skill +5% if it matters at all... <br />
<br />
It takes him half an hour to get the supplies needed from LoY... comes back, I happily hand him the research components, thinking I have a good chance.<br />
<br />
Icastalot was not successful in making Spell: Torpor.<br />
<br />
/writhe...<br />
<br />
/angst...<br />
<br />
/wallow<br />
<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
It's all good though I guess...<br />
<br />
1 blue from 64, then there's the final hell to get 65... <br />
<br />
Quiescence sells often in Bazaar for 35k... and I have just enough for when that happens.<br />
<br />
Made me think twice before considering looking for Words of Retention.  Some idiot selling for 20k.<br />
<br />
My basic testimony: You can rely on getting Quiescence at 65 usually. You can't rely on getting your 60 spells through research, although I congratulate those who did successfully get theirs. Esspecially with all the effort I put into looking for the research components.</div></div><hr />

/Agree, Research sucks rocks. The components are rare enough to ensure it has little to no impact on the availability of most spells we care about. <br />

It also makes RGC, which is definately worth it.</div></div><hr />

Ahhh, THAT'S the reason it's so expensive.....  RGC is running 150-200K on my server<br />

Last time I saw this for sale on prexus it was 100K, damn sony for making this page shared between PE and RGC.</div></div><hr />

Just saw it in the Bazaar on 7th......100K, bet it was the SAME page too :(</div></div><hr />

Went to vek... got sweet lewtz...<br />
<br />
sold sweet lewts to cover costs of failure, and then some.<br />
<br />
Seeing as I'm not one of those 'I'll NEVAH tell you!' people... there's a named in Vek that we can solo (albiet slowly, with pet/epic/ice dds), past the nobles... <br />
<br />
Drops a dagger, 14 23 +5% Backstb mod, +155 dd proc, +60 HP, +stats...<br />
<br />
You can guess how much that'd be worth to a hardcore rogue ;).<br />
<br />
Would be 1000x easier with Quiescence/Torpor tho...<br />
<br />
/writhe yet again.</div></div><hr />

14/23 isnt going to be worth crap to a hardcore rogue.  Any decent rogue has 15/20 at least, and 12% backstab mod.</div></div><hr />

We had a 58 Rog and a 65 Warrior who had their weaps upgraded by this hehe.<br />

That sucks that your torpor didn't combine, but in a way I don't feel sorry for you since you are so close to 65 and can get Q for 35k.<br />
It sells for no less than 80k on Drinal, which is a huge rip off IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Welcome to 7th hammer, please hand over 100K, kk thks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got Yaeth 73R for 200pp a couple of weeks ago - some people don't know or don't care the value of the spells they can make - or maybe just look up the enchanter versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hail Steelbear,<br />
No spell is worth 15K, in my opinion. Maybe the spell is great, but I wont line some greedy s.o.b. bank account to get my spells. <br />
I used to feel that way as well.  But I'm at the point now where there really isn't that much I NEED to spend my money on.  I'm still missing some spells in my book.  RGC, Everlasting Breath, Malos, Ancient Feral Avatar &amp; Primal Avatar (neither of which matter since I have Ferine Avatar) Ancient Bane of Nife (no drop), and the LoY group cure which I still have to quest.  Except for RGC and Blood of Nadox, none are important to me.  Most of my potential gear upgrades that are tradable are extremely expensive and simply not worth it to me to buy because I raid enough that I'll get better upgrades by spending DKP's.<br />
<br />
I recently was very fortunate to trade 2 bags of tinkering supplies (saved from Xanamech runs and farming bundles of wire solo for the Cloak of Greater Pernicity quest) with a gnome friend who gave me Levitation in exchange.  I'm hoping to pick up Everlasting Breath w/ another trade like that, but it isn't really a priority for me.<br />
<br />
I paid 60kpp for Fot7, 20kpp for Ferine Avatar, and bought chainings for 2 more Rune spells (35kpp and 40kpp) which ended up giving me Quiescence and Blood of Saryn.  Since I have Malo, I won't be paying that kind of cash for Malos, &amp; hope to eventually luck out and win a rune on a guild raid.  It was worth it to me to fill in my book with those critical spells, which do make a world of difference for both the guild I'm in and my own enjoyment.<br />
<br />
If I could pay to get RGC, I would.  But it is going for 90kpp+ on E. Marr and that's a little too rich for my blood.  If it was 15kpp though I'd buy it in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
I HATE spending my hard earned platinum for spells, but that's how it is for the hard to find/acquire spells.  The good news is that prices are coming down slowly. :) <br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Believe me, you don't want RGC anyway.  When I'm on a raid where we deal with greater curses, I have ot sit and chain cast the silly spell the entire boss fight!  It gets REALLY boring.....  (let a guild dr00d loot it  :))<br />
<br />
As far as if any spell isn't worth 15K, BUNK!  How much effort does it take for you to get 15K?  Now, is that effort worth it for a spell of the quality of Quiescense or Focus of the Seventh?  I THINK SO.  Now, are they worth 150K?  Not on yo Momma's Pelt!</div></div><hr />
