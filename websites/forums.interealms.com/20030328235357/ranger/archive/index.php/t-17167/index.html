<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've just gotten back from X-mas break and I'm about to pick up Pop. Previously I'd been xping with a friends 60 shaman 2 boxed that he uses for his SK. Now I'm back and looking to xp to 65 but due to school starting up soon I'd like to max my play time and get up lvl so I can get my AM3 and EQ and start reserve my time for raiding again.  So with my current equipment<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=557035 could I get flagged for Plane of Valor and Storms (since I've heard that's where the xp is at!) Could I 2 box and PL myself up to 65 there?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx<br />
<br />
PS: Would it be better to use my COF with a borrowed Windblade... since I've heard it's much better to use 2h weapons that DW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Muvandog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most definitely.  A shaman really is the preferred bot class for PoP in my opinion.   I use a cleric, which works, but getting in an early slow really makes things more efficient.<br />
<br />
You don't necessarily need to get keyed for PoS/PoV immediately, either.  Up to level 63 you'll get very good xp in first tier zones - PoD, PoN are good 2 box zones, and good &quot;intro&quot; to how PoP mobs hit :).  At 63 and above, PoV is doable, PoS is hard work &amp; not really efficient for me but likely easier &amp; more efficient with a shaman.  Another possibility is CoD (Crypt of Decay) which is easily accessed via a key quest - I do a lot of XPing there, as the zone is often empty on my server.<br />
<br />
On the DW vs. 2h question, I have tried both.  The problem for me using 2h was slowing, so I experimented with a Swarmcaller - fights ended up taking too long, and I required more heals as a result.  I did notice damage taken over time is more predicable with 2h, versus dual wield.  I seemed less likely to get hit with the really bad streak of 3 successful hits and 2 ripostes for 1.5k+ HP total damage taken, in a matter of a couple sends, while using 2h.  With a shaman bot, 2h is likely the best choice.</div></div><hr />
