<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I recall, Cliff Golems are VERY magic resistant. When I was level 60 I had a lot of trouble landing slow. This may be different at 65 with malos / sinia. Plus they summon and goons will likey agro. <br />
<br />
I think it would be tough to do solo and the rewards would not be worth the risk. They only drop 55-59 level spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They drop level 60 spells. <br />
<br />
They are MR as hell too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
I tried it solo awhile back at 60.  Did alot of running around before getting gate off one time after the first slow wore off, died on another try, and then went on to more productive pursuits.<br />
<br />
The MR on these is very high, making the risk versus reward on solo attempts not worth it.  I think it would be a fun fight just for the inherent challenge, but not worth trying for loot or exp.<br />
<br />
I would think pet kiting could be a viable tactic, but that just seems so cowardly to me.  :p It would also take forever to kill them that way.<br />
<br />
Duo or trio they would be easy I think.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've done them with 5-8 guildmates a few times.  I do not recall having a problem landing slow on them (was lv. 59 at the time).  We did have some aggro issues with the goons.  Golems pretty easy with some help.  There's a PoK book right there in OT, so drag some friends there for a few minutes and check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think they can drop 60th level spells. They are 58th level and I've killed about 30 - 40 of them. Best I've seen was Tigirs. <br />
<br />
They are very very MR. I haven't been able to land either slow even after debuffs but I didn't get a could not be slowed message. I duo with a 65th Warrior and they are cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I solo'd one for fun not too long ago, first attempt fail'd due to him being so MR and not landing a slow. <br />
<br />
Second attempt was like this:<br />
If you pull any CG before roughly 8pm EQ time, you will get an add of a goon or two. I usually waited until 9-10pm to pull the CG close to the PoK port up. Had lvl 61 pet with 2 lvl 62 mage summon weapons, FoSoul and haste on pet. Pull CG with malo, sicked pet, then either cast the lvl 58 malosini for -65 to all resists due to his high MR, then I'd slow. He is also fairly resistant to Pox/BoN, or I was unlucky to get them to land. So I just used JBB, epic and pet. I spot heal'd with Tnarg's (no torpor) or Kragg's. If you get aggro, let him beat on you for a second, then slowly back off, and pet will get aggro. I'd also canni 4 (no canni 5 yet) when I needed more mana, it was easy to do, since pet had aggro and CG's attention. <br />
I fought it before VI &quot;fixed&quot; the Coldain Military Wristguard focus effect, which made it so I only had to slow about 3 times or less. A normal fight would require about 5 times slowing, roughly about every 13-16% damage done to the CG (very rough guestimate). Same with applying malo/malosini. Watch him as he'll enrage at about 10% HP or so, and then he'll run a little bit.<br />
<br />
I've only seen lvl 58 spells, so if he does drop lvl 60 spells, it is uber rare and not worth the fight. <br />
<br />
Also, if you fight close to the PoK portal, you can get out that way if worse comes to worse. You'll be summon'd a couple of times, just keep running to it and you'll get there. Just pray you don't get stunn'd as he'll make a mess out of you.<br />
<br />
Max damage was below 160 or so I believe, at an AC level of about 1180ish. Buff's were KEI, FoSoul, lvl 62 sta, agi, group acumen, sow, lvl 61 regen, and Virtue.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've soloed these guys too. They are very MR, but you have a couple choices here. I found it pretty easy to MD and disease slow, that sticks fast. Or you can malo, then spam malosinia till it lands then own the golem with turgurs. If you can land malosinia and real slow, then you can land dots all day. If you go the disease slow route then you should stick with disease dots or cold nukes. It is best to pull after 8pm gametime because of the good adds. I pull with malo, then send in my dogdog horde with spirit call and spam malosinia until I can slow. Then he's start summoning and its time to start meleeing/nuking. They really are easy. I've not had any good spells drop though. Just a couple ghey enchanter spell worth 30pp each. Waste of time except its kinda fun to solo them once or twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">these do NOT drop level 59 -60 spells. i've killed a bunch duoing with others and unfortunatly they don't drop 59 - 60 spells. they should, considering the difficulty of them. p.s. pull them at night to avoid goons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">they do drop level 60 spells I have seen it with my own damn eyes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">they do drop level 60 spells I have seen it with my own damn eyes.<br />
<br />
Ok... so maybe they drop Mala :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Seen MALO and winds of tashani drop from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You could be right Krakster, I'll admit I havn't fought a whole lot of Cliff Golems in my day. However, my understanding is that in Kunark only mobs that are level 60 can drop level 60 spells. (Emp, Protector, GW's, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cliff golems can also spawn at level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I retract that, I cant recall if they are lvl 60 or not. I do know that mobs lvls 58+ can drop level 60 spells. <br />
<br />
Rare, but possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That would explain why juggs can drop malo/torpor as I don't remember seeing one that was even to me (yet).  Been hunting them for about a month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have heard that before, that 58-59 Kunark mobs can drop level 60 spells. I've never seen it with my own eyes though.</div></div><hr />
