<br />
I am about to visit the Temple of Droga to do the part of the quest given by Atheling in BW. I have read the killing the Iksar will give me a negative faction hit with my shaman guild....<br />
<br />
Did anyone ever found a way to do this part without the faction hit? Any of the keys dropped have been used on the Iksar?<br />
<br />
(I am also wandering how you get the Iksar in the outpost to tell you want he wants in the previous quest, did the turn-in but still curious!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Monssantiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My experience has been that when he was killed, NO faction hits were taken.  This about a year ago when I did it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are two Iksar slaves in the cell. The one for the cudgel quest is on Scaled Mystics faction and gives a negative faction hit. (The other one is neutral and gives no faction hit.) With max faction, I killed the iksar slave and then turned in bone chips to Trooper Mozo until max again. These are his faction hits:<br />
<br />
-20 with Scaled Mystics (80 bone chips worth)<br />
-5 with Legion of Cabilis (20 bone chips worth)<br />
<br />
Not that big a deal, but if you insist on avoiding the faction hits, the only way is to have someone else kill him for you.<br />
<br />
For the previous cudgel quest, casting identify on the skull canopic says &quot;Item Lore: crafted by Vok Nir&quot;. This gives the clue of who to talk to and what to say. If you go to Galdon Vok Nir and ask him &quot;did you craft this Dai Nozok skull canopic&quot; he'll start giving you answers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The faction hit is very minor. You problly get more faction back when you do the turn ins, then what you lose from this one mob. I dont recall my faction lv changeing at all nor did it cause my any probllems. Now if your not an Iksar then you will want to go and replace the faction befor doing the turn ins.</div></div><hr />
