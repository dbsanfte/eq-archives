<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I sit in this lonely field of darkness<br />
Dwelling on a past I should have never known<br />
Ever do I contemplate different paths<br />
Never have I followed a path different than my own.<br />
As I sit in this lonely field of darkness,<br />
the light begins to engulf me.<br />
<br />
A Star's light glimmers in the Darkness<br />
As I approach it I wonder if it will welcome me Home<br />
Of all the things which I have done<br />
Leaving the Star's light seems to be the worst<br />
I step closer yet stumble away<br />
Falling further than I could possibly climb<br />
Yet I walk on towards the Star's light<br />
Wondering if it will welcome me Home.<br />
<br />
I take new steps toward a brighter future<br />
My oaths to myself, promises never to look back.<br />
I see my light.<br />
My light is my own, and it will always light the path in front of me,<br />
Leaving the Darkness behind.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shades of Light and Darkness align to determine my fate<br />
yet all that matters is the grey...</div></div><hr />
