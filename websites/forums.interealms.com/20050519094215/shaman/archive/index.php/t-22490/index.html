<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure how many of you are familiar with the class top 10 lists over at the EQ Live forums, I know some do watch those forums.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the Devs answered the original top 10 list here:  Top 10 Answers (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=2333)<br />
<br />
Since three of the issues in that list were marked as &quot;No change planned at this time&quot; we now have the opportunity to add 3 new issues to the list.<br />
<br />
You can view our current list, and discuss additions here:  New List Ideas (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=2518)<br />
<br />
I highly encourage y'all to be involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, some of that stuff on the list is kind of Bogus, since I don't think there is any real issue with our healing up through PoP. Shaman did/do fine with Tnarg's on everything up through Quarm.<br />
<br />
In particular:<br />
<br />
<br />
Some sort of faster, larger, and more efficient quick single-target heal,   more on par with PoP mob damage (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
<br />
That should say GoD mob damage, not PoP mob damage IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea - thats a leftover from when the old &quot;One Voice&quot; thread was used as a template for the first list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's somewhat disappointing to see that after all of the suggestions they were only able to come up with 6 items for the &quot;top ten&quot; list.<br />
<br />
Well, I guess that is a little misleading - I would be disappointed if I didn't already have rock bottom expectations from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kvak1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not a very important issue, but getting the lvl 49 spell, Infusion of Spirit, is damn near impossible for an untwinked, poor shaman. A shaman only version from a vendor would be a nice fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You know, I don't even really personally care about better heal for shamans. Sure it would be good to have, since we're lacking too much in this area and haven't been literally upgraded in ages. I'd be happy with group Quiescence spell (basically group HoT spell line) as well. Just upping the shaman heal alone will do squat to improve the shamans as such. 90% of our spellbook is useless. I want more UTILITY and useful spells, i.e. debuffs which really matter and which debuff SKILLS, not the silly stats which affect nothing. Curses which affect the ABILITIES, i.e. curse which hampers spellcasting by raising fizzle/failure chance, curse which lowers the effects, any effect, of the spell, and so on. Basically curses which really matter. I want to have FA as a group spell, with longer duration, and with effects which REALLY matter - i.e. it would raise the skills, add the &quot;focus&quot; effects to melee, allowing them to damage more and better and so on. I want a Focus which would add good amount of HP (I see no frikkin' reasons to give to druids better HP buffs then shamans have, we're supposed to be better in the buff area, only cleric could be better) and in addition to raising melee stats (STR, AGI and DEX) also would add bonuses to melee features, like attack rating or bonuses to all melee skills - offensive and defensive - and such.<br />
<br />
I want our buffs really mean something, and our debuffs also mean something, and get the curses which affect the mos on &quot;spiritual&quot; level, so to say, like above. Some silly single heal upgrade is the last thing I really give a damn about.</div></div><hr />

You misunderstand.<br />
<br />
Our initial top 10 list had 10 items on it.  When the Designers answered that list, some of the items on it were listed as &quot;No Change planned at this time&quot;.  I removed those items from our list.  There is no need to fight a battle over something that they've already said &quot;No&quot; to.<br />
<br />
In fact, our &quot;original&quot; list had like 20 items on it, but it was cut down to 10 because that was what was asked for.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate some help in discussing what should be on the list instead of lamenting over what isn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just because they said &quot;No&quot; to something doesn't mean we should quit asking for it if it falls under the top 10 things a consensus of Shaman want.  Look at how many other things they've said no to over the years but eventually changed their minds...<br />
<br />
Gert</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So, you would prefer to keep something on the list that they said &quot;No&quot; to 2 weeks ago in favor of putting something on there that they may say &quot;yes&quot; to?<br />
<br />
Also, go look at the first list and note what was removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This earlier list seemed better IMO http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=2417 <br />
<br />
I think we could lose the alchemy component rant in favor of something more meaningful and exciting.  Maybe more direct impact from buffs on things like DPS and PC damage mitigation?<br />
<br />
*edit* By &quot;direct impact&quot; I mean increases/decreases to attack, combat effects, avoidance etc.  No need to keep going through some stat &quot;middleman&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, if Group FA, better/more debuffs and a bigger Canni were some of what was removed...<br />

You can leave the upgraded Bear form off tho.  That would make us too overpowering...lol...<br />

Call it Spiritual Harassment or something.  <br />
<br />
Heck don't even call it a slow. Make it a debuff that simply causes 40% of the swings a mob makes miss. Or Any hit is automaticly debuffed by 40 %  Just make so if the shaman is in the group and healing he can apply this so that healing is viable. That or fix the content. If it doesnt stack with Slow lines then we will not be overpowered. <br />
<br />
Just fix this crap. Shaman are supposed to be able to heal thier warriors. Not look to some damn Elf for healing.<br />

Looks to be shaman only, but not sure if enchanters get a similar spell only different name. <br />
<br />
Its been said numerous times in the past, but until they throw out the old percentage formula that seperates the priest classes, no heal upgrade they give us will put us on par with the other priest classes or with the content. <br />

<br />
You know, I posted that idea a while back, and then decided I didn't like it, because mobs that are pratically magic immune would have to be retweaked, and it probably wouldn't be implemented.  But if if the slow percent is 40, then magic immune mobs aren't an issue, because we could have disease slowed them for the same percentage anyways. Are their any disease+magic immune mobs that aren't meant to be slowed though?<br />
<br />
I, for one, don't want our dog to have innate sow.  When an AE goes off at a raid (dont' have pet hold yet), I have a hard time backing him off in time:), however, innate duel wield is great.<br />
<br />
One thing that really surprises me is that there are zero buff ideas on our list, besides endurance, which probably won't be in buf form.  How about these are our last three:<br />
<br />
8.  Buffs that don't rely on stats.  I know its been scratched, but jeez, we are the melee buff kings... How can we not ask for an upgrade to buffs that are largely worthless right now and still be shaman?  Make f07 = druid pot9 in terms of hp, add a percent dmg increaser and percent chance to hit/proc.  At least make our one main buff more useful.  540 hp on a 10k tank with his str and dex capped is pretty much a waste of a buff slot.<br />
<br />
9.  Add an AA that lets all characters increase buff slots by 1,2 and 3.  Ok, not a shaman specific item, but it will benefit us quite a bit.<br />
<br />
10.  Mind buff.  Ok, if we can't have mana regen, can we get a focus effect buff that helps casters in some way?  Perhaps a 10% increase to DD and dot dmg, only stacks up to 5% with other item based focus?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So I take it you are a non-raiding shaman, right? Or maybe a bot and you play your main during events?<br />

<br />
Right, and you are probably a shaman, who's in CH chain on raids, right?<br />
<br />
My &quot;main&quot; is my shaman since early beta. And I am in raiding guild, we have certain days during which we raid and rest of the days are for anything else. Maybe that's why, unlike you, I want to have more utility for shamans, rather then become a &quot;member&quot; of CH chain, what seems to be your goal. Utility is what we're lacking, on the raids and also in usual groups. Better heals, simply because we haven't got the appropriate upgrades over the time as we should have, would be nice, but I wouldn't mind the lack of those heals if I could do &quot;real&quot; shaman stuff and have the utility on the raids and in the groups other then the slower and nothing else (on raids, in XP groups other classes can slow as well and offer more utility) and Focus buffer.<br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned, I think that we'd be much more desired class in any group, in any situation, if we had utility spells which really matter something for the group and in the group, and at the same time, would not make druids and clerics scream, how we take their meaning of life away because we suddenly can heal a bit more then we used to.</div></div><hr />

This isnt a bad idea, but there is a basic problem with it, and its the same problem we have been seeing over and over. If this spell was in the game, content would HAVE to be balanced around it, making Shaman almost a NECESSITY for all groups. I really dont want that. <br />
<br />
There has to be a difference though. Our slow has to be more than a fraction better than the alternatives. I am just not sure what the solution is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The new slow ( unresistable ) would make us a good fight in pvp battles too, currently any melee with 250MR+ can resist turgur / bonihil easily. Even tossing malos gets me alot of resists. I think an unresistable slow is a good idea BUT there needs to be consequences for casting it, maybe a large recast time or a 400 mana cost or even a large cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">long recast time on this slow wouldn't be too bad .. a long casting time would .. the whole idea is to get the slow in early before tanks decide to start dying from unslowed DPS</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I said &quot;upgrade&quot; to Cripple, I meant something that actually has a useful effect. Taking 80 STR off of an 800 STR mob doesn't do a damned thing. Give me a Cripple variant that reduces his raw ATK, or one that reduces his Max hit, or something like that, and THEN I'll actually load Cripple again in one of my precious spell slots.<br />
<br />
I can pretty much guarantee that none of the shaman in my guild would ever bother loading either of the two spells currently on Lucy as Cripple upgrades.<br />

<br />
<br />
A raiding guild is one that raids upper tier pop and god zones. If you are doing Velious era stuff with POP spells shame on you for complaining. What we see are defined roles, you want enough utility to pull a 500 hitter off of the cleric and off tank it long enough for mt to regain aggro.. well a 500 hit means the mob kicked you where we fight and that's not going to happen. This thread is not to improve shaman in trivial content. <br />
<br />
When you cast a spell and you know it made absolutely no difference you know something is wrong. You got 10 clerics keeping the tank up, and your slow bounced 3x just like the other shaman. You sit back watch and notice that if you weren't there NOTHING would be different.<br />
<br />
You crit heal for 4000+ and then you think, wow that made a difference, then you see a 6k crit or a 9k crit heal and then realize what a chumpp you reall are. Most of the clerics heal w/o crit what you crit for and the druids almost as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Until SOE defines what they think the role of a shaman is supposed to be we are hunting snipe.<br />
<br />
It's just a waste of energy asking for a hundred things that we will never get.<br />
<br />
Our list should contain one point until it's answered<br />
<br />
1. Define the role of a shaman.<br />
<br />
Besides, as long as Rytan is the spell guy we won't get squat.  I think a shaman stole his girlfriend and kicked his dog or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think if anything the devs are looking for ideas that don't revolve around slows. From their perspective, I'd think by now slowing a mob is such a major effect that they'd rather work on fights without worrying about if its slowed or not. I know this is a forte of ours, but instead of beating a dead horse lets try to think of something else. The mitigation is there for a reason and I doubt we're going to get it changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">1) faster casts on debuffs and dots. Note this isnt improving what our debuffs DO per se, but getting them out faster. Mobs spend more time un-debuffed than debuffed, reducing their impact. Dots dont deal any damage until a tic after they land, in which a wizard can throw 2 3k+ nukes before bane does its first tic of damage. New AA, called &quot;not sucking 1,2 and 3&quot; that reduces cast time on detrimental duration spells by 25, 50, 75%. IMO, debuffs shouldnt take over 1-2 seconds to cast in todays game.<br />
<br />
2) The cast time on our Ice DD has increased as we rise in level. Any reason why? Lower it back to 5.8 seconds like it was in the good old days.<br />
<br />
3) Increase survivability of all priests. Casters avoid/mitigate as well as us for practical purposes, and enchanters have a rune that gives them more hp to chew through. I'm waiting for Omens exp mobs to 1 round any non tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">So, they said no to group FA. Okay, how about extended duration on FA? It is completely ridiculous to keep this spell 6.5 minutes. Do they really think FA is more powerful than haste (vallon's quickening 42 minutes) or clarity? (KEI 2 hours 30 minutes;  Voice of Quellious 1 hour 20 minutes).<br />
<br />
Either extend the duration or kill the lousy 1 minute recast time. I want a spell I can mem, cast on a party and then de-mem for something else. I hate being a slave to FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, I HAD seen those &quot;upgrades&quot; to Cripple. As far as I am concerned, they are garbage.<br />

<br />
I'm with Fuda on that one, and we are not in the same guild.<br />
I'm kinda tired of useles spells. Stats buff are useles, why a stat debuff would not ? I don't know the stat of mobs, but they aren't cap'd at 305 for sure !<br />
<br />
*edit* grrr posted too fast !!<br />
<br />
I want some debuff that really do something, not a mitigated new slow or useles cripple.<br />
Mob can single, double, triple or quad : what about a debuff that makes a quadding mob tripple for .. hmm dunno 20 sec? let's have it not land on mob that only double and below etc. <br />
Mob rampage and flurry : what about a debuff that REALLY slow the rate of rampage or flurry ? hell, mob could even mitigate it if you want !<br />
What about a debuff that prevent mob to cast a spell or AoE ? Could be a % of spell  or only the next spell casted by mob<br />
And there are plenty of other thing we could debuff like Fuda said : raw atk, max dmg etc.<br />
<br />
Those are just exemple, not something I want or think beeing realistic to ask. But I m tired of the Slowing shaman role.. hmm lemme rephrase that. I m tired of casting a mitigated to hell spell on a mob that dies too fast for my spell to have any effect.<br />
<br />
I want a class definition from SoE, then from that point, we can work on a wish list.<br />
Beeing the &quot;priest of the dumb race&quot; is not enough to me to figure what the f*** they could possibly start to begin to think they might one day consider giving us.<br />
They said so many things in the past about shaman / heals / debuff / buff that now, I kinda lost &quot;Teh Vision(tm)&quot; and I don't think I m the only one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get me some data on Crippled vs un-Crippled mobs.  I don't load Cripple because I don't &quot;feel&quot; that it's benefits outweigh other things I could have loaded.  But I don't have the actual data to back that up.<br />
<br />
When you start a debate with &quot;I don't think . . &quot; you leave a lot of wiggle room.  When you start a debate with &quot;The numbers show . . &quot; you don't leave a lot of room to argue.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that &quot;we&quot; are all in agreement that Cripple doesn't &quot;seem&quot; to be worth a spell gem.  What I need is the &quot;proof&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what good it will do.  I really don't.  I do know that without the proof we can be blown off with a simple &quot;no&quot;.  With proof we can at least ask for a refute of our information.  I can't say we'll get that, but we can ask for it.<br />
<br />
As far as dot's go, it may pay dividends.  In the Necro list, DoT's are listed as &quot;Currently being evaluated&quot;.  They have our information to add to their own and we can hope that it will pan out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Content wouldnt have to be designed around the 40% unresistable slow.<br />
<br />
It is only 40% How about this. Have it take up 20 debuff slots. Or 35 Debuff slots. Then raid wise it wouldnt be more than a quick placement Unless it was really needed for the encounter. Before being overwritten by a real slow. <br />
<br />
Or make it overwritten by Mark of Kharn And Druid debuffs. and many other class based debuffs. So that if a shaman is the healer of the group It is used but not other times when more benifical things are needed on the monster. <br />

The whole point is I can do my job perfectly. And tanks that are suited for the content still die. So we need better tools That are not much less efficent Time wise or variable wise to the classes that can perform the job (Clerics and in some cases druids.) Or fix the content.<br />

We need better tools. Or fix the content. I can't stress this enough. <br />

I don't load Cripple because I don't &quot;feel&quot; that it's benefits outweigh other things I could have loaded.  But I don't have the actual data to back that up.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that &quot;we&quot; are all in agreement that Cripple doesn't &quot;seem&quot; to be worth a spell gem.  What I need is the &quot;proof&quot;.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
What proof do you need exactly ?<br />
The numbers should be enough to figure that it doesn't do jack.<br />
If we all agreed that the stat bonus of focus of 7th are not doing anything on a player, why can't we agreed that debuffing for less than what soul add a mob with higher stat than a player would do anything ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I simply want some ammunition in case, against all odds, a Designer comes back and says &quot;What do you mean it doesn't do jack?  It knocks mob DPS down by 20%.&quot;<br />
<br />
I want the ability to throw the [shenanigans] flag immediately and with the full flagrant penalty attached.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I don't know what good it will do. I really don't. I do know that without the proof we can be blown off with a simple &quot;no&quot;. With proof we can at least ask for a refute of our information. I can't say we'll get that, but we can ask for it. <br />
<br />
The real truth is, they can use the &quot;no&quot; arguement regardless how much &quot;proof&quot; you show.  Thats why the discourse with SOE is so difficult.  The players go through a lot of effort and parsing and testing and compile the results, and the only thing we get back sometimes is &quot;no&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can't remember the most recent thing atm, but I will find it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">All I'm saying, when I was at the summit having casual off the cuff discussions with devs, several of them were saying that they hated having to deal with slows. When I've beta tested I've heard similar comments.<br />
<br />
It is entirely possible that this was in jest with me, as they knew which class I played. But at the same time I can understand the frustration of trying to reach a very small limit where a mob is killable without any slower, god forbid requiring a shaman, and a mob that is not trivial with a shaman there.<br />
<br />
We've bitched about having clerics *required* for fights. Why are we trying to impose that shamans should be *required* as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Right, and you are probably a shaman, who's in CH chain on raids, right?.<br />
<br />
No shaman with his mind still working wants to be in CCH. But I want to be able to at least have a chance to patch heal the ramapge tank. Which I cannot.<br />
Utility all is good and fine ... but stackability and things to do on a raid needs to be looked at even more because it's this spot where we seriously lack.<br />
Apart from that, I like buffs. But buffs don't make me do anything. Shaman can be and will be botted for this if it's the only reason you need us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Dealing with slows.<br />
<br />
Lets see who can slow.<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Enchanters<br />
Beastlords<br />
Bards<br />
Rangers (Swarmcaller sword, Epic hello WA 5)<br />
Thieves (Locustlure, Poisens and lots of others again WA 5)<br />
Warriors (Two handed hammer from Seblis and tons of other weapons Plus WA5)<br />
Paladins (Few weapons and such plus can Stun as well to slow down attacks)<br />
Shadowknights (Few weapons but not as many as some)<br />
Necros can slow undead<br />
<br />
Balancing around slow is utter and complete bull**** now. Mitagation. Hello.. MR immune. Specific spell immunity. Slow immune. <br />
<br />
There are ways to deal with any of the above slows. And they are effective. What is lacking is the tools to allow the specific class that has been tuned with slows in mind from dealing with the effects of those balancing changes.<br />
<br />
Yeah Shaman can slow to 75% Yay us. It is too powerful Yes. But with the ability to mitagate I do not want to hear it. They could slap 50% mitagation on every single mob in an expansion if we had the tools to compete. But it keeps coming back to we would be overpowered for other content if we get better tools. <br />
<br />
Ever see a thief Run rampant in Upper seblis with Assassinate? How about headshot with rangers. Or the ability of a Chanter cleric duo to Maul any old content with Dire charm and C heal?<br />
<br />
Fix the current content or Give us the tools. Put up or shut up about we care and where is our proof it buys you time at the cost of goodwill.<br />

<br />
<br />
And none of the people on that list can lure slow, slow without mitigation, or any of the other ideas passed around on threads lately.<br />
<br />
I am happy with our current ability to slow mobs. Our advantages over other classes on there is enough for me. I feel that trying to beat over getting a bigger and better slow is not productive. I think we should be trying to come up with other ideas other than coming back to this idea. We're the best. I'm satisfied with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I understand why so many people are hestitant to put data together, but Sudedor is absolutely correct on what will happen if you don't.  If the community collects and puts data in a central location that's accessable, or that can be tossed back at SoE developers, you stand a better chance, no matter how minute the chance is, to be listened to.  Something, no matter how small, is better than nothing.</div></div><hr />

This made me think a little bit, perhaps I just hit a huge tangeant here . . . you guys decide.<br />
<br />
There are three basic classes who can &quot;Slow&quot; a mob.  Shaman (75), Enchanter (70), Beastlord (65).  I hesitate to add Bards because they are probably even more difficult to balance in the content that Shaman are.  Regardless, on with the story.<br />
<br />
If you use Shaman as the baseline for the ability &quot;Slow&quot;, you then come up with 100 / 93 / 86 as the percentage breakdowns.<br />
<br />
Seems to me that we should be asking for our ability &quot;Heal&quot; to be somewhat in line with the encroachment of our leading ability &quot;Slow&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">The two highest on my list:<br />
<br />
1.  A buff we can cast that increases healing by a nominal percentage<br />
<br />
2. An AA ability rune or disc similar to Protective Spirit to keep us alive after we get aggro and no one is there to take it off of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I would really like a improved Canabilize AA that effects all pre 65 canni spells increasing by 5% 7% and 10% ( just tossing numbers ) Thats a GoD ability or PoP. For OoW either increase in thsi ability, a level 2 sorta thing or just let us actualy be able to get our canni spell.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Secondly, how about a lifeburn kinda thing ? Take out HP, divide it by what, 4  ticks and have out life drain per tick as its taken form the mob. So if i have 4300 hp, i get a 1k a tick DoT or something.<br />
<br />
You guys can figure out the math, but i like it.</div></div><hr />

I could not agree more with this.  I would LOVE to see Brenlo's response to this.  That said, it'll never happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes the ratios for our heals, should be the same as the ratios for SLOW.  Now its not my decision if our heals will be raised to match, or other slows will be nerfed to match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Well, I make it a point to never ask for another class to be nerfed.  It fosters far more ill will than simply asking for a boost in your own class abilities.<br />

<br />
<br />
Funny thing, but yes.<br />
<br />
It's looking like the whole thing is just another waste of time imo, class correspondents are quickly turning into class representatives(you're chatting with devs and other reps about issues? I thought you were simply supposed to sift through info and point things like the one voice thread out)..and that's pretty sad given their choices.<br />
<br />
I'm not directing that soley at you(although you do have little experience as a shaman to work from), they did worse to other classes. The warrior rep for example is an alt of a druid, they don't even play the class as their main.</div></div><hr />

Somehow like bards that can haste / boost stats / boost atk but also have songs that improve damage on dots/DD.<br />
Group FA is not that much needed...  it would only help 2 to 4 players in the group anyway(unless mgbed).<br />
Our direct damage spells are already the weakest and I dont see why the casting time is kept that high. 7.8 seconds to do 925 damage? It's kinda a joke but in short fights it's one of the few spells we can use.<br />
