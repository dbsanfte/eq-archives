<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Simply put, exactly like the nuking subtlety that wizards and mages (any others?) get to reduce the aggro they take from nukes - we really ought to have something to lower our dot aggro.  (thanks for the post reminding me I wanted to bring this up, Frekkels)<br />
<br />
This suggestion is perfectly in balance with the system in place, as far as I can see.  Spellcasting subtlety (if I'm remembering the name right) is arguably THE most important wizard/mage AA because often their mana is far from what's limiting their DPS - it's their aggro.  Take away the aggro and they can chain nuke for a lot more than they'd tend to crit for - and still have plenty of mana.  Affliction subtlety wouldn't even be this significant of an ability.<br />
<br />
I expect it to add something interesting to do for those (fairly rare) encounters where we're left with our horrid little nukes, because it's not worth the risk to stack on all those dots in a sad little effort to make a difference to the fight while not pulling aggro and making a mess of things.<br />
<br />
The problem is that it'd almost have to have a toggle, as there are some situations (tanking for a rogue, aggro kiting) where it'd help to turn this off.<br />

Mostly I was curious if any others wondered why this ability hasn't been implemented yet.</div></div><hr />

All 4 INT based casters get that ability, and it works on more than just Nukes. It is all detrimental spells - nukes, dots, debuffs, root, snare...</div></div><hr />

It is not specifically limited to nukes, and serves to reduce aggro generated by any spell casting (debuffs, dots, nukes, etc.) by 5, 10 and 20%.<br />

I never really understood why they didn't make this available as an archetype ability for priests.</div></div><hr />

Aye. It's unfortunate that SOE still has this conception of us.  See Helora's post here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showpost.php?postid=203938&amp;postcount=44) for a good breakdown of caster regen abilities.  <br />
<br />
On the post idea though, its a great idea.  Its an AA that Ive wanted since I first read about INT casters getting it.  I'd prefer it to be a blanket agro reduction simmilar to SCS, but I would happily purchase a DoT agro reduction AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I suspect the &quot;logic&quot; behind it was that priests can take a hit better if we do happen to get aggro, although there's probably less of a distinction there now than there once was.<br />
<br />
I'd definitely love to get something like that though.  Preferably affecting all spells, but even just dots would do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, i respect your point of view, but this wont happen im sure. There is too much conflict as to whow ants it and who doesnt to begin with. The style shaman i play i use my aggro and since i dont have a taunt button or a hate spell/proc then its my only means to hold aggro when tanking.<br />
<br />
As a AA though, i guess i cant be opposed to it now that i really think about it, cause its not like i have to spend the AA points, no one is holding a gun to my head. So yea, as a AA i would support it, but as a addition to a spell, i would be incredibly pissed. I still doubt it though, cause its not somethign we really need. Shaman getting DoT aggro in places other then VT or something like that is not really a large scale issue like a wizzy nuking.<br />
<br />
Though i can see maybe getting this as a &quot;throw them a bone&quot; AA. That would fall under the category of giving us somethign to shut us up, even though its not what we need or asked for, so they can say they dont neglect any class. So who knows.</div></div><hr />

I put BoS, BoU, Bane on fennin ro and kept it up the whole time, I did not nuke until the end but I was tnarging pretty constantly, and I did not outaggro our tank.. <br />
<br />
basically if you want to stack 5+ dots is usually when you get summoned by boss mobs and our dots aren't really good enough to stack 3 then cast a spell that reduces aggro then stack 2 more cast the spell stack cast.. *** I want to dot and do other things in between not dot and reduce my aggro.. <br />
<br />
or I may be wrong and the thing is innate hate reduction? ie passive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm far less versed in AAs than most of you and ignorant to many of them, so I don't know about many of the extremely powerful AA other classes get, but I think I can see why we get no such AA.<br />
<br />
While shaman have some offensive abilities, and some play shaman more offense-minded, I feel we are a support class.  Casting DoTS or DDs is not our primary function, it's just an option.  This AA would be overpowered for slowing because slow is one of the strongest spells in the game - since it drastically recudes a critter's effectiveness - and it should cause aggro.<br />
<br />
I just picked up Anethema (sp), one of the curse DoTs from LDoN the other day and it doesn't seem to cause much aggro at all despite packing a nice punch.  It's a nice additional option.  I can cast it immediately after slowing and not aggro, which is a far cry from what'd happen if I cast a poison DoT immediately after slowing.  In fact, I don't think I've gained aggro yet from the curse DoT, whereas I could be aggroed on and off til a critter died from a poison DoT.  I look forward to getting Bane in the future.  I think the cursed based DoTs from LDoN are decent compensation for poison DoT aggro.</div></div><hr />

I find it odd how people try their best to mak every class group the same, Priest classes, pure casters, Hybrids, and Pure melee, and even worse to make all classes have the same stuff.<br />

Lets keep a bit of the diversity going here. They have their spells, we have ours.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Once more on this. It has been one of the best things that they have ever done when they started puting in Pure Hybrid spell lines that were not just bastardized versions of their parent classes.<br />

So, why must every single class that happens to cast a spell have every spell casting possibility?<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is the Slow Lure spell for wizards?? HUH? HUH? Chanters have slow... clerics have undead slow... necros have undead slow... shaman have slow... where is our slow????&quot;<br />

In essence you &quot;pay&quot; for getting better at using detrimental spells without getting attention from the mobs.<br />
<br />
But why should a Malosinia cast by a mage be less aggro than one from a shaman? I would say that shamans are the &quot;masters&quot; of this line of spells yet we are not as good at casting it as mages?<br />
<br />
And I bet that SoE takes this AA into consideration when determining aggro generated by certain spells. So for the shared lines of spells the classes that dont get this AA are getting punished for the fact that other classes do have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Asking for Affliction Subtlety is retarded. The problem is the ****ed up code!<br />
<br />
Fix the code, then we can talk about Affliction Subtlety. As it is, a SCS for DoTs wouldn't suffice to bring DoT aggro in line with DD aggro(in fact, DoT aggro should be way lower than DD aggro).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks for the correction, I didn't realize it applied to debuffs as well.<br />
<br />
And I find Spiritblood's logic hard to argue with.  While Malosinia is minimal aggro, it DOES seem stupid that a mage is safer casting it than a shaman.<br />
<br />
&quot;SCS allows casters to do what they do - but more often&quot;... I'm not quite getting how shamans should be left out of this.  I'm assuming an enchanter could use SCS aa to get less aggro from slowing?  From tashing?  There was this thing called balance, once.  And it meant that enchanters could slow, but they took a lot of aggro to do it.  This danger was offset by little things, like mez, runes, the AE stun line.  Small things like that.<br />
<br />
I'll be first in line to support more diversification between the classes.  I'm one of those few who think that it's perfectly okay for shamans to have pathetic nukes, for example.  Cripes, look at the SK spell Scythe of Innoruuk - 45 less dmg than our best nuke, for 60 less mana, AND a negative resist modifier.  It's part of that quirky BALANCE thing again.  For the most part, I accept being a worse nuker than a hybrid.<br />
<br />
I suppose I just find it irksome that I can draw aggro after having done about half (being generous...) the damage with dots as the crit-nuking wizard over there.  Of course, not everybody runs into this - I'm certainly not in elemental planes, the melees are obviously not keeping the critters' attention as well as those in some of your guilds (or whatever myriad of details contributes to it) ... but it'd be nice to have that aa option available.  Even if it IS solely for affliction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but the initial request in this post was an 'affliction subtlety'.  That would be reduced agro on detrimental spells only.  Heals wouldnt be affected, but slows and nukes (as if this were a problem for us) and dots would be.<br />

Going by what is said here, SCS affects Detrimental, thereby not affecting our heal aggro.<br />

Their logic would have to be a bit faulty (as if thats unusual).  Imagine my chagrin when I take a look at my shadowknight's aa list.  Yup, there it is, spell casting subtlety.  Not much use for a sk, but I can assure you he can take a hit better than the shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DoT Agro<br />
K, while back I was reading in a warrior thread how agro is figured in the book version. One thing that caught my eye was the most recent dmg done bonus to hate. Dots hit at the end of the tick, makeing them always the most recent dmg done when figureing out hate for the next tick, therefore dots get an inherent HATE BONUS which gets carried from one tick to the next. <br />
<br />
This seems to me the reason Dot agro is so huge, perhaps code it to where the dot hits every 6 seconds from when it first hit? If it hits end of tick, so be it, if it hits middle of tick great. Codeing it to hit mid tick seems somewhat simpler and a good fix.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've never heard that before, Jenguran, very intriguing.  It would make a lot of sense, though.  Explains a few things if that's the case.<br />

<br />
Oh please.<br />
<br />
I saw your last log and what you call &quot;stacking DoTs&quot;, that's enough to know that you are talking out of your ass. Very few mobs in this game allow this DoT stacking with their current aggro issues and the current gear.<br />
None of them are &quot;current&quot; content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">i have no idea why we are arguing over this.<br />
<br />
why should a shaman snap agro from a knight for casting a poison dot that did an initial 200 dd, when a wizard or mage can crit nuke the same mob at the same time for 4k damage without making the mob even glance in his direction?<br />
<br />
that's what needs to change.<br />
<br />
dots by nature, should generate less agro and be more efficient than any nuke, and right now, they're not.  don't ask for aa that reduces dot agro, ask them to fix dots!  why in the hell should i have to spend aa to fix their broken content?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">and jenguran, it'd be a simple thing for them to code it so that our poison dots generate less agro.  look at the dots of other classes which are very low agro.  this is not a universal problem with dots, but it is a problem with poison dots.</div></div><hr />

I dunno why you take it so personal, you just want to have something to complain about. You said impossible to BoS/BoU and nuke on fennin so I did it. THEN the next time (no log but not hard to make one on our next fennin) I did BoU+BoS+Bane no nuke but we only had 5x people so I was healing a lot more, I can get a log if someone thinks I'm lying.. <br />
<br />
Anyway my question is, what else do you want to put on there that would make you think the dot aggro is not that bad? Or do believe fennin ro is a special case with very little aggro..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Its a problem with poison counters in general.  Tash generates much more aggro than is warranted (in comparison to malox) as well.<br />
Dots do indeed generate aggro each time they tick.  Many is the time when I've casted a dot and the warrior taunt and regain aggro.  Only to loose it again on the next tick without me doing anything in between.  I've always suspected either most or all of the spell aggro was being added each tick, rather than all at once.<br />
On the upside, makes a great hate builder :D  A whole bunch of aggro for the tank to gain via taunt (when taunt works).</div></div><hr />

In case somebody doesn't have the time to go over your log, you cast your first poison DoT 90 seconds into the fight(after a BoU resist 15 seconds before that), then you apply BoU and BoS runs out and isn't going to run on the mob for a long time. <br />
After some time you cast another BoS and get a resist and reapply BoU once. After some time you apply BoS again, which runs out and never is reapplied again in the 7 min fight.<br />
So, to sum this up, do you think the fact that you weren't summoned and killed from 2 lousy BoS's and BoU's(when you started to cast your DoTs 75 and 90 seconds respectively after the mob is in camp), is enough to come out and question the utterly ****ing broken aggro on our DoTs ?<br />
Ok...<br />
<br />
[/quote]THEN the next time (no log but not hard to make one on our next fennin) I did BoU+BoS+Bane no nuke but we only had 5x people so I was healing a lot more, I can get a log if someone thinks I'm lying.. <br />
[QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Lieing? Hell no, you are just clueless and you probably think DoT aggro is fine for getting away with 1 BoS/BoU/Bane and the occasional VS in a course of a 7 minute fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">as for what DOTS you would stack if this would go live you say?<br />
<br />
well for one this is my normal dot stack on stuff:<br />
<br />
BoS, BoN, BoU<br />
<br />
now if I had all spells my stack would be<br />
<br />
BoS, A:BoN, Bane, ( +maybe BoN, anthem )<br />
<br />
now any spare time I have I am clicking my spear and my bone of bertox ( some times it sticks some time it dont )<br />
<br />
now on boss mobs in VT I stack right now:<br />
<br />
Spear, Bone, BoU, BoN, BoS<br />
in that order for aggro resaons and I still get summoned 3 to 4 minetes in to the fight (with the dot damage reporting I do get to make sure my dots land right as thay wear) some times I also get crazy and add Ebolt and Pox in there.<br />
<br />
now if your wondering on the raids I was on I was the 6 or 7th shaman on the raid and me being specalized in CONJERATION (only one I know on server) I always lean to my dots for damage. when I go full bore damage (was in a 2 pally/ 1cleric/ 1druid/ 1bard(was on AoE resist) group) was keeping up spear, bone, BoU, BoS on the yard trash and I was some times getting summoned and partial tank these guys even after I just stoud there and let the dots run off. and on the bosses I would dump Spear, bone, BoU, Pox, BoS, BoN, Ebolt and most of the time I would die 3 to 4 minetes later even if I waited about 1 to 1.5 minetes before starting my route ( doing nothing but standing with the nukers ).<br />
<br />
If I had all spells and the aggro reducer I would try and stack up:<br />
<br />
spear, bone, BoS, ABoN, BoN, Bane, Anthem, BoU, Pox.<br />

IF I was doing this I would HAVE to relie on someone else keeping me upright becouse I would be doing nothing but casting dots and CANNI4/5. I sould be able to sustaine around 250dps to spikeing around 280dps with the dot critting thing, BUT I  can alsmot garentue that I would STILL probley be summoned around 2 minetes in.<br />
<br />
We as shaman can thearedicly can do a sustained damage ( agian with proper gear [ aflition foci (haste, damage, MP), dot extinition, a decent amount of FT ], and AA/specalization ) but we can not realisticly keep up realy anymore then around 110's with out writeing out and signing our death warrent becouse once we get aggro from dot stacking no force on this earth can stop your death to a critter of any siqnificatnce right now. thsi is becouse our DOTS have a high inital aggro and a decently disprapotanal per tick aggro to the damage thay do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Quote-&quot;Anyway my question is, what else do you want to put on there that would make you think the dot aggro is not that bad? Or do believe fennin ro is a special case with very little aggro..&quot;<br />
<br />
I believe FR is a special case for what ever reason it may be. I 2 box a Necro/Shaman pair and can stack same dots as you put on and with Necro do the same, stacking 4 of our most nasty dots and never, ever get summoned. I suppose if I started tossing in some 2000K + critical poison nukes I &quot;might&quot; get summoned but try doing the same on ..lets say Rapem or any of this other buddys. Chain casting dots on any one of those mobs will more times than not end in a summon.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Subtlety even at the 3rd lvl does very little for my agro as a Necro is concerned. I still need to constantly be FD'ing to keep agro off..which works wonders but doesnt help the Shaman out if they want to pour on the dots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That only backs up the argument that poison dots cause undue aggro.  I know that ONE level of SCS on a mage has about doubled the amount of damage he's able to do on boss mobs before he's summoned.  Sure would be nice if they'd simply fix that aggro issue, but if they refuse, I'd enjoy the option of an AA for it.  *shrug*  Much like pet discipline, which allows your pet to act the way it ALWAYS should have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Been trying my best to look up on the warrior boards the posts I remember reading bout the pen and paper version of agro.  Found 2 by gunrack in warrior taunt thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=1811&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=2) but unfortuantly doesn't discuss general agro much.<br />
<br />
Anyone happen to have the pen and paper version of eq who would be willing to list the different ways agro is figured?<br />
<br />
and jenguran, it'd be a simple thing for them to code it so that our poison dots generate less agro. look at the dots of other classes which are very low agro. this is not a universal problem with dots, but it is a problem with poison dots. <br />
<br />
Yes, the poisen counters, which well for pvp many would prefer them to stay so they are harder to cure I guess /shrug.  I imagine you were refering to druid dots which are magic based and have no counters afaik?<br />
<br />
 Many is the time when I've casted a dot and the warrior taunt and regain aggro. Only to loose it again on the next tick without me doing anything in between. I've always suspected either most or all of the spell aggro was being added each tick, rather than all at once. <br />
<br />
I think that goes along with what I said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Yes, Shadow Knights also get SCS... Now tell me, isn't that the stupidest thing you've ever heard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Alright, dude, here's your log:<br />
<br />
... log here ...<br />
<br />
In case somebody doesn't have the time to go over your log, you cast your first poison DoT 90 seconds into the fight(after a BoU resist 15 seconds before that), then you apply BoU and BoS runs out and isn't going to run on the mob for a long time. <br />
After some time you cast another BoS and get a resist and reapply BoU once. After some time you apply BoS again, which runs out and never is reapplied again in the 7 min fight.<br />
So, to sum this up, do you think the fact that you weren't summoned and killed from 2 lousy BoS's and BoU's(when you started to cast your DoTs 75 and 90 seconds respectively after the mob is in camp), is enough to come out and question the utterly ****ing broken aggro on our DoTs ?<br />
Ok.. <br />
<br />
All true if you over look some facts... please answer the first question I'm interested in your answer..<br />
<br />
I cast my first dot 75 Seconds into the fight because I was healing the tank, debuffing and avataring melee, when would you want to be able to do it to be satisfied?<br />
<br />
I don't understand why you want to make it sound like I barely dotted. BoS ran out when the monster raged (35 seconds before he was dead, ya fight was 7 min) and I decided to nuke instead of reapply BoS! <br />
<br />
Then BoU yeah it is true that I only reapply bou once.. you know I don't reapply dots until they run out I don't see the need.. and since it had not run out by the time fennin died I didn't feel like recasting it.. <br />
<br />
And the reason bos was kept on him at all reasonable times, like if you noticed fennin resisted bos 3x in a row of chain casting it, so I decided to malosinia him nuke him and then recast BoS.. what would you have done instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Litgruv - I have SCS3 on my necro, and let me assure you when I want aggro (and I often do for a variety of reasons), I can take aggro without much effort.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well are talking about shaman, not necros. <br />
<br />
Yes a shaman can steal aggro if he wishes, but i tend to let that fall under skill of DoTs. I mean its kinda like telling a wizzy to nuke everytime that button refreshes. I think everyone here knows a wizzy that gets his kicks by getting summoned by over nuking. Just know your tools and your ok. I mean, i have never had a summon problem so bad that i felt a AA was needed to help me cause my DoTs caused too much aggro. Frankly I think they cause just the right amount of aggro, anyless and i would have trouble tanking.<br />
<br />
See form my view, i can get bane/BoS/BoU/Epic/Pox all on a mob and nuke and keep my aggro at such a fine like that i will get summoned for maybe 2-3 ticks of damage thent he MA will get aggro back, then illw ait till i feel my aggro doesnt out weight the MA and repeat. On mobs in VT i worked this down to a science and was a game i would play to keep it intresting. I cant see why certain shaman feel this is either too hard fro them to do or that our DoT aggro is broke cause we have to manage it. Its purely a skill in my book.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are arguing that DoT aggro isn't broken to an extent that it needs to be fixed immediately. Your post says you DoT'ed like mad, yet you did like 12 k in DoT damage over 7 minutes. That's less than 18 dps and based on that, you are arguing that DoT aggro is fine?<br />
<br />
Fennin is indeed a strange animal, as are most, if not all, mobs with a huge model. Big models are usually heavily influenced by proximity aggro, but even if we weren't talking of Fennin, your point and your &quot;proof&quot; are invalid to say the least.</div></div><hr />

Was that a serious reply ? I respect your style if it is, but i just couldnt tell if that was a joke or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Seriously, this isn't a style question. If we were in Kunark I'd agree with you. Torpor was absolutely closing the gap between a Shaman and a Warrior on a slowed exp mob. But nowadays, unless you are really bottomfeeding, the Shaman isn't an option for tanking.<br />
<br />
There might be 3 to 4 classes in all of EQ that tank worse than us, but the discrepancy between a real tank and a Shaman is just huge nowadays, no matter how well equipped you are(trust me and don't try to point me at 7 k HP magelos, because I know very well what it means to tank as a Shaman). Even Beastlords/Monks with less AC just outtank us, let alone Rangers or even Rogues.<br />
<br />
So unless you are bottomfeeding and exping in a zone, where it doesn't matter who tanks(in which case this discussion is moot already), you are way more effective and efficient, when you are not tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Answer that one first, just to so I can know what you want to be able to do to be happy..<br />
<br />
The dps you are calculating is just dot dps first, and 2nd has nothing to do with aggro, I stacked bos/bou/bane so that's even more aggro and still did not get summoned. <br />
<br />
If you want to calculate how much dps I did on a mob when I was healing and buffing and debuffing for &gt; 50% of the time and come to a conclusion like your dps sucks then it is time for me to throw in the towel.</div></div><hr />
