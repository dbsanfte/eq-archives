<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As a recruit, I have searched for guild events to join for my recruitment process.  However, the lack of lower level raids has forced me to start a raid of my own, since I am only level 37.  I have been informed that many KoE have alternates in the guild which are about this level, which is why I believe this can achieve all of my goals: 1. Be with KoE members during an event for them to play with me and judge me   2. Create an event which current lower level recruits can also join   3.  Have a successful raid- gain some experience and perhaps loot some cool loots   4. Have fun with the mixture of KoE members and recruits!<br />
<br />
I hope this develops successfully.  Personally, I have never led a raid myself which is why I might ask for some help.  I welcome everyone on this raid, even some high levels for safety reasons :) hee.  Perhaps a high level cleric would be nice for ressurections?  I'm not sure, but I admit that I might need another's help (most likely another KoE member who has led a raid, or perhaps a KoE member who could be my sponsor?  I don't have one yet.. :P )  Personally, I would invite mostly your alternate characters, levels being around 35+  or so, probably..  I believe there are some high level mobs in Kaesora, and I don't want too many deaths.  However, again I have never led a raid before and my level assumption might be too high.  I sincerely ask at least for some suggestions from you 50+ KoE members, for I need to develop my leadership skills :P<br />
<br />
I am aiming for a few groups, I don't expect this to turn out to be a huge raid or anything.  I have around 2k in the bank, if raids such as this cost anything.  Could anyone point out any expenses which might need to be met?  I am willing to give all my money if needed towards this raid, however since it's not that dangerous I don't really see any big preparations for it nor any large costs.  The groups I'm hoping for should be in the 30s or 40s, and I sure wouldn't mind one or two (or more) 49+ people who want to come along for fun, especially a cleric.<br />
Also, I think there are a few good loots in Kaesora, and I might need some suggestions on loot handling?  I do not believe in rolling for loot just as KoE does, but I am not sure how else to distribute the loot.  Any suggestions if we happen to come upon a few good weapons or something?<br />
<br />
Anyway, maybe I've talked too much about it already, but is anyone willing to develop the idea?<br />
It would greatly help to have a sponsor, which is also required for the recruitment process &gt;_&lt; so I hope to find one soon.  If not, I'll rely on KoE member's suggestions and try my best! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok.. I was about to close the browser until I read that many of you will be meeting next weekend, so you won't be here on Friday?  Hm, I wonder how many people are actually going and how many people are going to be on who would be interested in the raid?  Just saying that the date is very flexible so if anyone wants to change it it's A. OK. :)  Sorry for posting so much, I'm kinda hyped! hehe</div></div><hr />

This raid won't cost you anything.  You don't have to buy stones to get in and if it goes really wrong, there's nothing in there that a crazy chanter or two that I know can't get past to get you out.<br />
<br />
Kaesora can be dangerous, especially to a group at your level, but it is doable.  Make sure you get a map (it's very confusing at first) and I'd recommend having an evacer with you to get you out if there's trouble.  If you've never worked with multiple groups before, I'd recommend sticking with no more than 2 groups (but I have a feeling you'd be hard pressed to gather more than one or 2 groups of out secondaries).<br />
<br />
As to loot, what we normally do is give it to someone who can use it.  If nobody is with us who can use it, it's really up to you.  In this case if nobody can use it, I'd prolly say to roll on it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I don't have any characters around that level, or I'd come join you.  I'd offer to bring Lud down there, but a warrior won't help too much I don't think.  If you need any advice feel free to send me a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That would greatly be appreciated Sin! :)<br />
And thank you for your advice Ludaian.  I'm basically inviting anyone here, so even if you'd like to come, sure!  The focus of this raid is not really for exp or loot, to me the focus is to introduce my character to KoE.  So far, not many people have spoken interest in coming, so I'm not even sure if it will happen.  I'm inviting everyone because if we don't have enough alternate characters that want to come we can still go if some of the 50s come with us :) heh<br />
Anyway, I will just wait and see what happens, if suddenly a lot of people have interest that would be great, but if not, it might have to wait until another night.<br />
How would you plan on helping Sinsemsinfutura?</div></div><hr />
