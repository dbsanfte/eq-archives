<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In some past expansions, items dropped like candy for the first few weeks and then the nerf bat hit. Will that happen again? Or are we going to be seeing 100hp items and high raid quality weapons for cheap which is the path things seem to be headed towards.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what I think is best personally. What do you all think will happen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think having 100/100 stuff cheap is a good thing. You're talking ssra level gear for the most part, an expansion that is three years old and finally non raiders are catching up too.<br />
<br />
I also think they will nerf it because they have in EVERY SINGLE EXPANSION. <br />
<br />
I don't know how they could nerf spell drop rates, they're already fricken ridiculous. Killed 10 names in dranik hollows the other day and got 1 rune for the entire group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've seen about 10 runes drop - killed about 30 nameds in Murk Hive and in WoS.<br />
<br />
Lost every single roll - even guild groups need to roll for spells between casters :(<br />
<br />
Lvl 67 and still not a single 66+ spell - sheesh i thought this was going to be better than PoP :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have ready about a drop rate nerf in the Dranik instances, where it was about 1 rune / hour now it's upwards of 1 rune / 4+ hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ive got a drop nerf for ya ...leave it to sony to make alchemy a usefull skill again..(changing augs) and make the only droppable component FRIGGIN RARE AS HELL screw you and your slugworms sony...youll be lucky to ever see another dime of my cash</div></div><hr />

suuuuuuuure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">had a 9 h dh hollow instance: 4 spells in first 2 h, 2 in next 2, 1 remaining 5.  Highly varaible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah I&quot;m not sure about runes/spells, I was more asking about items. It just seemed like ridiculously godly items are relatively cheap now. I guess it's just the way the game is going to be. I never thought I'd see the day when you could buy a 43 damage 30 delay sword for 50k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well if you dont belive me...anyone know of a place that slugworms DO drop// seen any besides one maybe two if your lucky, and no im not gonna buy em in the bazaar when schmucks try to sell em for 25k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At this rate they really need to unnerf the rate runes drop at. Bit dumb having runes drop only from nameds when there aren't really that many nameds per camper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tonight in murk instance.  5 rune drops in 6 hours with 68+ mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tonight in murk instance. 2 rune drops in 2.5 hours with 68+ mission.<br />
<br />
Not too horrible.  And 3 loots and 1 25hp aug.<br />
<br />
Purdypog<br />
<br />
PS: The developer chat indicated that 1 rune per hour was what they were shooting for in the instances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tonight's Murkglider instance ... 1 level 68 spell, 1 level 67 spell. Three hours, had a bad run of placeholders. <br />
<br />
Previously, in one night, we've gotten four level 68 spells, 1 level 67 spell, two +25 HP augs, a Bloodsoaked bracer and some of those caster boots (they drop ridiculously often, lol. Tribute fodder!). That was about an eight-hour jaunt, I believe. Not TOO bad.<br />
