<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lycanthrope33</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok next round of Help the Somewhat Puter Literate....my wife and I both play eq and her computer is so laggy neither of us really ever want to play on it so we have a second computer but still the same issues as before.  I'm trying to see if there's any way to connect my Pent4 windows XP computer on the DSL with her Pent3 windows ME (currently running dialup) through a home network.  Do we both need to have the same OS (somehow I think I already know this answer) and what are the cheapest ways to accomplish hooking the both of these computers up for the one DSL modem...xtra info my puter has a NIC hers doesn't.  Well that's all I have right now if you need anything else to piece together a solution let me know and I'll tell you what you need to help me figure out my dillema.  Thanks for any assistance :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, no, the computers do not have to be using the same OS, in fact you can have as many OS's as you want, because the computers are going to be talking to the internet gateway, and not directly to each other.  Of course, if you want them to talk to each other, they need to at least be on the same stucture (i.e. in your case Windows based, which you already have).<br />
<br />
Ok, on to the fun stuff.  There are a couple ways you can set this up.<br />
<br />
================================================<br />
<br />
One option is to have the DSL go into one computer-1 using a NiC card (like you have now), and then computer-1 has a second NIC card that is used to connect it to computer-2 (directly NIC-to-NIC or put a hub between the 2 computers, if you have more then 2 computers then the hud is required).  Each computer needs to have Microsoft's Internet Connection Sharring software installed for this to work (ICS come with ME and has an option to make a diskette to enable other computers to talk with it, even if the other computers are not on ME).  With ICS, 1 computer is set to be the 'internet service provider' (this computer must have ME or Win98-2nd edition) and the other computers are set to be clients that make requests.  In this scenario, computer-1 becomes the traffic cop for the other computers, and computer-1 MUST be turned on and running for anyone to talk to the internet.  This puts an extra load on computer-1, because it is now processing and routing the internet requests for all of the other computers, but this is not usually a problem as long as computer-1 is fairly up-to-date computer.  Also, if computer-1 burps or crashes or reboots or locks up, then ALL other computers loose their connection.<br />
<br />
It would look like this:<br />
<br />
DSL line-----DLS modem-----NIC1.....NIC2----------NIC<br />
.....................................................Computer-1................Computer-2<br />
<br />
================================================<br />
<br />
Another option is a hub-central design, where each computer and the DSL all connect to 1 hub and they all share the DSL gateway for talking to the internet.  Each computer makes requests directly to the DSL and the computers themselves are not effected by the status of the other cmputers.  In this scenario, you don't have to mess with any Internet Connection Sharing, you just set windows to access the Internet via LAN instead of Dial-Up, and it automatically figures out the rest.<br />
<br />
It would look like this:<br />
<br />
DSL line-----DLS modem-----HUB----------NIC of Computer-1<br />
.........................................................^------------NIC of Computer-2<br />
<br />
With this method, the problem comes if your DSL provider has a restriction to how many computers you can connect to their DSL, or charges extra for each additional computer.  If this is the case, you can buy a Router that goes between the DSL modem and the hub.  The Router will watch the hub activity for any computer that makes an Internet request.  The Router will then forward that request to the DSL and route the answer back to the correct computer when the reply comes back.  What the router is doing is acting like a liason between the computers and the DSL.  The DSL (and your provider) think it is just 1 computer because all of the requests are coming from the 1 Router ID, but the Router is actually funnalling multiple requests from all of the computers on the network.<br />
<br />
It would look like this:<br />
<br />
DSL line-----DLS modem-----Router-----HUB----------NIC of Computer-1<br />
............................................................................^------------NIC of Computer-2<br />
<br />
Many Routers actually have a hub built into them, so you don't need your own hub, the one box has both the router and hub all in one case.<br />
<br />
So it would look like this:<br />
<br />
DSL line-----DLS modem-----Router/HUB----------NIC of Computer-1<br />
.......................................................................^------------NIC of Computer-2</div></div><hr />

I lack a home with pre-installed ethernet capabilities, so I went this route. I also went this route because my wife said &quot;I don't care what you do as long as I don't see any new wires&quot; :D<br />
<br />
This allows me to now share any pc in my house as long as a phone line is near it. It has no effect on your phone whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I spent about $65 total on the equipment. You can get it cheaper at http://www.netgear.com/categories.asp?xrp=9&amp;yrp=21.<br />
<br />
I set it up this weekend, and it took a total of about 9 hours (Note: A lot of my time was spent learning how to use ICS with PPPoE).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarkaukar</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best bet is to use a multiport router like Linksys/Netgear.  What makes it nice is later on, if you pick up a 3rd computer(possibly a cheap one to surf web for maps/info etc), hooking it up is just a plug in the cord, a few simple changes and away you go.</div></div><hr />

My wife's P3 just got updated with a Geforce 3 couple of months ago and is topped out on ram, yet still runs into trememdous lag at times...will this finally solve that issue or is there somewhere else this is coming from?  I notice it with large groups of people and spells...or in an inventory pane in high player areas...am I outta system memory and need to start cleaning house or would a connection upgrade finally solve this? Again thanks for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In everquest the answer is no you will not notice any drop.<br />
<br />
I have 5 computers connected to a cable modem which is less bandwidth then your DSL and I can download files on two comps and play eq on 3 and not notice a decline.  I don't have a router or switch, etc.<br />
<br />
But connecting two up via your DSL may not be the solution to your lag problem.  Describe what you mean by lag.  Some people attribute slow framerate to lag.</div></div><hr />

Even typing is incredibly difficult...even with spell effects off and clip plane down to lowest setting.  And on rare occasion my Green bar looks like a swarm of ants it's so choppy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumahim Ashenbane</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the speed of your processor and how much RAM is there?  That's all video lag.  You say it's a P3 and that should be plenty, GeForce 3 of any kind should be fine.  Only thing left is the amount of RAM and I couldn't imagine a P3 system without the capability to get it up to 256 MB of RAM, and that should be plenty.<br />
The only thing I can offer right off hand is make sure to have low texture quality on and no new models.  You say it recently got upgraded to the GeForce 3.  Maybe there's some leftovers from the previous videocard drivers that are causing a conflict.  Or maybe the drivers being used are just not cutting it.<br />
<br />
<br />
On to the network.  Personally I have my DSL line coming into a DSL modem (have had both external and internal. matters not).  My P4/XP comp is connected to the modem through USB.  I also wanted to network a little bit so I went out and bought a cheap hub from NetGear, $40 maybe.  Oh, and 2 ethernet cables.  Pluged in both computers to the hub and ran the network setup on the P4/XP.  Internet connection working there.  Then I had it create a disk to set up the network on the other computer (P3/ME).  Ran that, restarted, it found the connection, boom.<br />
<br />
Some suggestions that I've learned.  The computer with the newest OS generally has to be the computer to be the server.  Older versions of an OS are unable to set up the networking correctly to work in such a set-up.</div></div><hr />
