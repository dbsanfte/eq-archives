<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So Im lvl 61 Now..Nearly a god and Im hanging out with some buddies...Mostly other demi gods like my self when I get the call from a friend to come down to MM and help PL her..She's hot, so I agree..Well, her toon looks hot so I agree...Not sure what she looks like, but she types really sexy....Anyways..I got down there and Im sitting on my drog, who is a sexy beast as well when I notice this little Dark Elf just standen there..Names Hirod..Then it hits me, She is an NPC and EVIL...!!  I was like..&quot;Hey, you guys gonna wack her or what?&quot;...Some dude who was in my friends group was like..&quot;Whoa dude, no way, she will own you!&quot;<br />
     I thought about deuling him right then and there..Didnt he know I was a lvl 61 Oracle...Nearly invincible...Truely wonderous in my scope of power and EQ Knowledge....WEll I had to save face so I summoned scoobie, buffed em, buffed my self and shot Hirod a wicked grin...&quot;Lets get some baby&quot; I said as I sicked the pooch and cast slow.............<br />
<br />
WEll...she is immune to speed changes, resists everything you throw at her, summons, and generally kicks some serrious butt...Any know how a green mob, once thats been green for ages can wield soo much power?..Send me a tell, Im very currious.</div></div><hr />

Her name is probably Anthony or Bill, in real life. Good luck with the relationship though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL.  I posted a few months ago about this NPC.  Same situation, except I was going to kill the Black Dire for my epic, and was waiting for my buddy to get there to help me out.  I was 55, feeling uber, and just killing the green conning DE's for fun.  Put doggy on her, and dog started to get powned.  I tried to land slow, well, you know the rest.  Got summoned, and with no buffs or slow, started to get worked.  She was max hitting me for over 150, but usually lower, only thing that saved me.  But damn, what a pain in the arse.  And even conned green to me at 55!  Well doggy got ate, I got summoned 3 times while trying to stay out of melee range, and took me a good 5 min to kill her.  I was totally unprepared and shocked to say the least.<br />
<br />
Worse part is that my buddy in RL, a 65 druid, finally gets there and just sits on his drog, laughing his butt off and egging me on, while I fight for my life.  He was too busy enjoying watching me get worked by a green to help.  Although I know he would not have let me get killed, it was embarassing.  We laughed for the rest of the night.<br />
<br />
I looked her up on Ala, funny to read all of the similar posts.  She is only level 30?  but part of a quest.  Go figure.<br />

Like I told my last wife, I said, &quot;Honey, I never drive faster than I can see, and besides... it's all in the reflexes.&quot;<br />
<br />
When some wild-eyed, eight-foot-tall maniac grabs your neck, taps the back of your favorite head up against the barroom wall, looks you crooked in the eye and asks you if ya paid your dues, you just stare that big sucker right back in the eye, and you remember what ol' Jack Burton always says at a time like that: &quot;Have ya paid your dues, Jack?&quot; &quot;Yessir, the check is in the mail.&quot;<br />
<br />
All I know is that this Lo Pan character comes out of thin air in the middle of a goddamn alley while his buddies are flying around on wires cutting everybody to shreds while he just STANDS there waiting for me to drive my truck straight through him with LIGHT coming out of his mouth!<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying that I've been everywhere and I've done everything, but I do know it's a pretty amazing planet we live on, and a man would have to be some kind of FOOL to think we're alone in THIS universe.<br />
<br />
Okay, I get the picture White Tigers, Lords of Death, guys in funny suits throwing plastic explosives while poison arrows fall from the sky and the pillars of heaven shake, huh? Sure, okay, I see Charlie Chan, Fu Manchu and a hundred howlin' monkey temples, and that's just for starters, right? Fine! I'm back! I'm ready, goddammit let me at 'em!<br />
<br />
I feel good, and I'm not scared at all. I just feel kind of... kind of invincible... Is it getting hot in here, or is it just me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I read the post 5 times at least, never saw a reference to Jack Burton... *** are you guys talking about?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I thought it was funny Ghost :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">eriod is one of the greatest things to happen to MM...shes charmable, with 2 weapons and chanter haste shes a blender on the run.<br />
<br />
I like to drag her to the ZL then hit her with Collaberation on my chanter, (zone out then come back) then when the random evil/n00t comes in and takes a swing I just go for the root park on them while she does the ganking.<br />
<br />
yeah shes mean as hell, I'm not sure I could kill her with my 65 shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">diabalein, what level is your chanter?  was curious if i could take my toon chanter (lvl 30) down there and use this broad to powerlevel.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Howler She is charmable at lvl 30 (or around that lvl) yes she is an ungodly pl pet, the flip side is that you are gonna die to her alot so bind outside<br />
<br />
<br />
my chanter usually uses her to help defend the zone since I am on a zek but I used to use the...the...ah crap I cant think of her name. theres another mob in mm, unique female with a pet Dark huntress, shes also an undercon although not nearly as much as Eriod is. I have witnessed Eriod destroy a 60+ zerker while I kept him rooted, he went from full hp to dead in under 30 seconds and she was still over 80%, I tried to kill her once by charming her and just sicking her on every mob I came across...didnt work she never fell below 95%.</div></div><hr />
