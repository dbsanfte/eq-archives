<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shawn280</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I played EQ for years on Quell as a cleric in EHL. I retired from the game about a year ago (life had better content than EQ). About one month ago the wife and I were talking and she expressed an interest in finally playing EQ, so we started a couple chars.<br />
<br />
What i am looking for is some named folks that the wife and I can pull off as a duo. Please list any named you think are fun fights, strats to take them out, and what level gear is appropriate to be able to do so.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help,<br />
<br />
Barltok &amp; Adaaru<br />
SHM &amp; SK respectively</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Need magelos, or at least levels and aas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shawn280</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Currently, the wife and I are level 40, but 65+ is not that far off. Mainly, i am looking for named up and through the PoP Expansion.<br />
<br />
As far as gear, levels, and AAs go, we will have Baz quality gear, level appropriate for each named, and will have minimal if any AAs for some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">at level 40, you have no AAs outside of leadership. grind a bit more, getting to 65 doesn't take long, but don't expect it to be a one-night affair. it will be a few days to a couple of weeks of hard playing.<br />
<br />
at your level, get keyed for old expansion zones. try and go spelunking on Kunark, Velious, and Luclin (original EQ dungeons aren't a bad idea either.) PoP isn't an option at all until 46. and even then, you won't be killing &quot;names&quot;.<br />
<br />
grind to lvl 60+ range (65-70 is really preferable) if you plan on taking on any larger mobs.<br />
<br />
you'll see plenty of upgrades soon. Magelo is a good way for you to keep track of your progress, as far as upgrades, AAs and where you want to go with them. takes very little time to do, and it really helps us in knowing what and where to recommend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shawn280</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the heads up.<br />
<br />
Mainly what i was aiming for was a list of things that are possible for a SHM &amp; SK duo. I dont intend to go after anything until wife and I hit 65.<br />
<br />
I was thinking that there has to be some old world, Kunark, Velious mobs that i could hit once we arrive at 65.<br />
<br />
If i could start compiling a list of said mobs now, then i could do the research in regards to strats, spawn times, etc. while we are grinding our way to 65. I dont expect the grind to take much more than another month or two. Birth to 40 took 3 weeks of casual playing, so i figure 40-65 will take about another month or so.<br />
<br />
So far my list includes:<br />
<br />
Trak<br />
Venril Sathir<br />
Phinny<br />
Rhag 1<br />
RumbleCrush<br />
Doomshade<br />
Sebilis-Crypt Area and Blood/Emporer?(The ghost guy)<br />
Velketor<br />
Lodi<br />
RageFire<br />
Nathyn<br />
Faydedar<br />
Woushi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your list is significantly off.  Dont take offense, but you might have a slightly inflated impression of what is capable at what power levels.  I say power levels because once you pass 65, gear and AA starting make huge differences.  A bazaar geared person is not going to be able to solo or duo everything a time geared player is.  Now add in AA's, such as defensive AA's, pets, crit dots, nukes, etc etc and the gap increases even further.<br />
<br />
you are not going to be taking Trak, Venril Sathir, Rhag 1, Rumble Crush, Doomshade, or Woushi anytime in the next year to 18 monthes.  You wont have the gear or AA's.<br />
<br />
Phinny is a possibility. Sebilis is VERY doable and probably where you should concentrate (minus trak of course).  Howling Stones is another place to hone your skill with several named.  Lodi can be soloed by a shaman past 65, so thats an extremely easy target.  Nathyn i assume is the vamp in katta, never fought him personally, but think he will be out of your league as mentioned above, but cant say for sure.  Faydedar is probably doable, but i would put that between 6 months and a year down the road.  Ragefire I would put in the same category as Faydedar. <br />
<br />
Velketor i dont remember that well, always disliked it, but most of the bigger named (which is what you have listed here by comparison) your not going to be able to take on.  The normal random named shouldnt be a problem though.<br />
<br />
A nice area to play in is Western Wastes.  the static dragons in the nests are extremely easy. Some of the roaming dragons are to, but some of the roaming ones will kick your butt, so I would research which dragons are which.  The trench dragons by ToV are a good stepping stone in power levels.  they are a good step up from the nest dragons and provide a good strategy learning curve.... nothing like learning how to fight while silenced (means you cant cast ANY spells).  They also drop some decent gear for that level if you are cash strapped (top end spells can still get expensive).<br />
<br />
Good Luck, remember its a game and dont get frustrated if you cant kill everything you think you should be able to.  Come back later when you have more AA's and better gear.<br />
<br />
edit:  a couple obvious (to me) misspellings</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">your list is very ambitious....<br />
after you hit 65, you'll want to gear up better, do a good few AAs.<br />
<br />
many of these are Soloable by the highest geared shaman. BUT, there is a large gap between someone who just dinged 65 and someone who just dinged AA 600.<br />
<br />
gear makes the biggest difference in solo/duo ability. I don't know if you plan on any raiding, but you'll need either to be compeletely OoW geared or elemental flagged to take on some of the larger bosses and expect to win. (Trak and Rhag, for example.)<br />
<br />
this will take MUCH longer than it will take you to get to 65, unless you have a friend in a larger guild willing to gimp you into time to farm gear for you.<br />
<br />
I would set smaller, more intermediate targets. Gore, for example, is very duoable with the right approach.<br />
<br />
don't give up hope of doing these targets, they are very interesting, and I'd like to see how things pan out for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anyone level 65 can solo Phinegel in Bazaar gear np.  Might do it nekkid.  Dude's only a level 53-54 wizard (don't recall exactly, but red to 50, and not 55).<br />
<br />
All of Sebilis is duoable, with the exception of Trak, easy.  Crypt, Emp, Juggs, Tola, Prot, np.<br />
For real, the dungeon was designed to challenge level 55s, not 70s.<br />
<br />
Lodi is shm solo at 60, without aa even.  The only challenge to that turtle is finding him up.<br />
<br />
Rhag1 is within range with 300ish aa and the higher end of Bazaar/single group gear.  300ish meaning full defensive stuff for the tank, and healing and mana stuff on the shaman.<br />
<br />
Nathyn in Katta is not something you want to try duoing.  Dude has like 800k-1mil hp, and casts charm.  Without quite good gear, his charm will land every time and you'll end up having to zone, so he'll regen to full.  Even if your tank manages to resist every charm, it would take you maybe 30-40minutes to kill.  Oh, and his loot &quot;isn't the best.&quot; <br />
<br />
West wastes dragons are a cinch, and fun :)  Killing dragons is what heroic fantasy is made of!  You'll be able to duo all but the gflux guys, Klandicar, and Sontalak.  You can play around out there long before you finish off defensive stuff, too.<br />
<br />
Gear will play a rather big role in what you two are capable of.  At the high end, either character could solo all of the mobs I mentioned above, and even more.  You'll have to work on those levels, aa, and collect the gear you can, and then test your own limits</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Really think you guys are overestimating Rhag1.  He's no Arch Lich.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Depends on what Bazaar gear you are buying I guess.  Like, if are buying 100k pieces of attunable bazaar gear (100hp VT quality), then some of these are possible.  But if you are buying 5k-10k pieces, with 30-40hp on them, you still won't be able to do some of the old stuff. <br />
<br />
Trak - Not with bazaar gear and minimal AA's.  Banishes, so there will be stretches where each of you will have to fight him solo. <br />
<br />
Sebilis-Crypt Area and Blood/Emporer?(The ghost guy) - Can be duo'd easily with Bazaar gear.  With the right strategy, can be solo'd by a lvl 65 shaman with bazaar gear. <br />
<br />
Even the older content bosses are tough if your resists are low.  You really need your sk tank to have max defensive AA's, as well as both your resists to be very high to tackle some of the mobs you listed.  <br />
<br />
Define what level of bazaar gear, and it will be easier to choose your targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yesl, Western Wastes can be fun - until you get a bit cocky and start hitting a_random_wandering_dragon_05, which turns out to have a 1200 dd with knockback that makes getting spells off really tricky :).<br />
Rumble would be a tough duo, even slowed he's got quite a bit of DPS, and I don't think without AA/focii you will be able to keep your tank up.<br />
Trak is one of the mobs you need to single - the trick is that you get summoned back as soon as you're banished.  Doesn't work duo.<br />
Rhag1 is possible, but you will need a lot of time. He's got Luclin tye HP.<br />
Venthril Sathir, unless you can resist his lifetap you will never be able to do any real damage to him.<br />
Ragefire is similar to Trak in difficulty in that he fears. If you're alone he doesn't do damage to you while you're feared (but your dots keep running).  With 2, unless your tank has the fearless AA, you get summoned when the tank is feared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">RumbleCrush<br />
Soloed him again a couple days ago. Had to warn a group near the zone not to touch him. Cleric in thier group sent a hammer pet at RC, and got promptly splatted by rampage. There are extreme discrepencies as to what is doable and what is not, depending on gear/AAs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Different Trak Trick: pull him to the banish spot.  He looks funny going through the small tunnels, but he fits, promise.  Best to have the SK do it, since FD is pretty much required to get him out past respawn.</div></div><hr />

So at 65 with both players owning 1/2 a suit of Ornate from PoP, what would you folks list as targets we could try to hit?<br />
<br />
So far i hear:<br />
<br />
Western Wastes<br />
Sebilis - All except Trakanon<br />
Phinny<br />
Rhag 1 - Possibly</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a month from 40-65 is wishful thinking at casual play. NOt saying it's not doable but exp slows down painfully from 50+.  60 and 61 might go pretty fast, but then it starts slowing down again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nah, I bet they can do it.  Even duo, though groups would be faster.  Like, Lower Guk to 51, PoJ to 58 (if they're just duo, he'll need the larger heal to move on), then off to Noble's Causeway, I think.  I'm not sure where Dranik's Scar fits in, but I've heard that exp is good, too.  ANYhow, if they're pounding out exp in a dedicated way when they're online, they'll get there in a month.  Most people do a TON of d*cking around is why they take so long.  lol, I know personally I spent like two months level 61, before busting out 65 &amp; CanniV in two weeks.  Man oh man, aa's used to take SO long in low-tier PoP &amp; Luclin...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I can't imagine agro ever being an issue for these two.  The partner is a *shadowknight* afterall.Aggro is not automatic.<br />
<br />
It requires skills that must be learned.  The process must be managed.  People don't know how to do this automatically.<br />
<br />
If the SK is just blissfully whacking away with melee when the shaman puts on 3 dots and then pops a heal, the shaman is likely to get aggro.<br />
<br />
If the SK has a relatively small mana pool and runs out during a long fight, the shaman is likely to get aggro.<br />
<br />
So the two of them need to learn together how much of what causes aggro issues, and they need to learn how to manage that.<br />
<br />
Skyfire Mountains is a good place to learn these things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If both of you are 65, with some AA's, say, 50ish each, I would put cash that you could duo trak.  He's not really that difficult of a mob.  The key, like stated above, is getting him to come down to the banish point.  This is tedious work, but not difficult to do.  You have to be able to clear trash mobs, fast.  Clear all the mobs between the banish point, and him.  There's not a whole lot.  Have shaman return to that spot, and let SK continue on to trak.  Once ready, SK engages trak, get's banished.  After a short amount of time, you'll see trak come cruising up.  His DPS is horrible, and he really doesn't have a lot of HP's.  We single grouped him, and it seemed trivial.  At the time, we were heavily bazaar geared, with some luclin gear thrown in there(ssra and VT mostly).   <br />
<br />
If two boxing for you is an option, I would suggest adding possibly a ranger to your team.  Your still low enough in level that you could catch a ranger up in short time.  This will allow your shaman to conserve mana for heals mainly, without worrying about DoT's so much, or at least until you get higher level with a larger mana pool and more efficient DoT's.  The AA I enjoy the most is the crit DoT's.  It gives you the chance of scoring a crit hit off a DoT on each tik.  My highest Bane crit has been 1050, and you can count on critting a few times per fight.  Most AA's work hand in hand though.  Keep in mind, these generate massive amounts of aggro, so spell casting subtely is a must.  <br />
<br />
Each encounter presents new techniques.  They are not so drastically different though.  Your basic jobs are still there.  SK gets and maintains aggro.  Shaman slows and heals.  Don't get too caught up in trying to learn the secret squirrel way of killing Random_named_01.  Learning the event is fun, applying what you've learned and beating the mob down is the best.  Focus effect items make events easier, yes.  As a shaman, you can max out your alchemy and work on making your own focus effect augments.  Omens of War provides great HP/mana and other stat items that drop at single group content.  Myself (68 shaman) and my guildie (69SK) duo WoS mobs (yes, even namers).  You can get some really nice gear there with great focus effect and stats.  <br />
<br />
It's all about what you put into your characters, as to what you can get out of them.  You know this.  All you need to do is apply what you know.</div></div><hr />

I thought SCS only worked on instant spells, or the INITIAL tic of DOTs - so the other six, 15, 30, however many tics of your DoT would not be modified with subtlety - has this been changed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'm pretty sure velketor wouldn't be douable. I redid him relatively rescently for the new oracle quest and he was still a pain. He's not immune to slow but so resistant that I never managed to land a slow even with chanter, shaman and bard debuffs and balance. Disease slow didn't land any better either. His dps was still pretty substantial. Even with a pretty hefty tank (elemental/time geared at the time) we wanted 2 clerics when we where going to do it and was well beyond my ability to heal as a shaman. Sure OoW and DoN will have made things easier but this would require a major step down.</div></div><hr />

looking at my magelo and that he's a 70 sk with around 9.5k hps buffed his 1.5 and right around 150 aa's do you think that it's duoable?  I mean if Grizz can solo him, we can duo him right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm not 100% sure how it affects DoT crits beyond the first tik samanna.  I've only recently acquired the AA, and have been only hunting in the WoS/RCoD area. (farming runes and gear upgrades for guildies)  If I'm not main healer, I stack 3 DoT's on the mob and keep myself healed while getting beat on until the mob dies.  Very rarely, if ever, will I get summoned now with only Bane on the mob.  Bane + Blood, very good chance, add one more, your getting summoned.  WoS trash is fun to mess around with, so I don't worry too much about aggro there.  I'll keep an eye on what happens in MPG on a namer though, and post what I find.</div></div><hr />

I'll have to see if I can scare up the log for this.  Duo'ed Velk about a week ago -- with a monk.  Monk tanked, monk + dogdog (Leopard'ed) were the sum total of DPS (well, plus the one petswarm, of course).  My time was largely spent chain-healing in between recasts of Leopard and Canni, when available.<br />
