<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Will these things remove slows from your tank now?  I'm not quite sure how the disease counter thing works.  So big slows, add a lot of counters and might take several doses of cure disease to remove?  Anyone played with these?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haven't tried it yet, but I've been tossing this one around in my head as well. I could see, maybe soloing monks and the rare soloing warrior going for it. <br />
<br />
In all actuality though, there aren't that many mobs that slow except for up on Luclin and more than likely the melee is gonna be grouped unless he/she is very well equipped.<br />
<br />
I'd say we'd probably get a few bites here and there but it'd still be marginal. Though since there aren't very many shaman out there right now marketing cure disease potions it may be in a persons best interest to try the market while it's still fresh. <br />
<br />
As to how many potions it would take to cure a slow, I couldn't tell ya. <br />
<br />
So... yah... glad I couldn't answer your question. Maybe my thoughts will help you out on yours though. *shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While it would work to use cure disease potions to get rid of slows... I doubt you'll sell many.  Beside the shaman community, who else really knows that the slow has disease counters?  I guarantee you that 90% of the tanks out there don't - and the other 10% prolly won't by the potions anyway.  *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Other problem to keep in mind is the cast time - not sure what it is, but what tank will sit still for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1) It takes two sips of our Counteract Disease potion to cure Togor's or Tugur's Insects.<br />
<br />
2) The drinking time is relatively quick--2.0 seconds each.<br />
<br />
3) I made a 10-dose, but I haven't had a chance to see if it gets any interest. I think I'm going to advertise them as &quot;5-dose Cure Slow potions.&quot; =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, i just click my SS legs to cure slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you show-off, Zoichi.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think cure disease would be very useful for certain raids, like Gorenaire.  I may make some to hand out to our tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It does cure slow, my monky friend keeps coming back for more.  also saved his life after we killed zlandicar. i wish i had a potion i died with about 1 second left on the cast from my runecrafter legs, 11 second is way to long of a right click.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is there / Was there not a instant cast old world cure disease.  Would stand to reason that that potion would not require a cast time.  Though have not made one those.  Do the old world potions now have cast times on them?</div></div><hr />
