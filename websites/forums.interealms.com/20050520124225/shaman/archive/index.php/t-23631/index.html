<br />
Well, as I suspected, people just seem to THINK that Shaman are completely awesome, and need nothing whatsoever. Here are a few of the &quot;low-lights&quot; from some people:<br />

I completely understand why your the worst healer. You have the most group utility as a class. Only class I know that can Heal slow and Haste at a marginally decent lvl. <br />

On the low end that's at least 5k in damage, which beats your Ranger friends' &quot;uber nukes.&quot;  What's the problem again?<br />

YOu keep whining about healing, but shaman isnt a healing class. yes your priest, but priest in the means that YOUR SUPPORT.<br />
<br />
Healers, are Druids and Clerics.  never in any fanstasy setting has shaman been a main healer.<br />
You have the best buffs the best slows, and IF You'd notice for a minute... GoD fights in RAIDS (last time i checked your in a raiding guild) last way more thatn 45 seconds, yet you keep complaing that your slow sucks. in fights under 45 secs... if the fight doesnt last a minute why are you BOTHERING to slow the freaking mob in the first place.  2ndly i've seen shamans heal FINE in ldon on unslowed mobs.  I've seen shamans heal fine in other situations with slowed mobs.  Your rants have no beef to them, you just wanted something to whine about.  Shaman is still one of th best classes in the game.  Ever notice people PREFER shamans over say enchanters... or druids? why is that you ever stop to think? No you just whine whine whine, your as bad as furor thank god he quit.  <br />
LOL.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Callius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not really quite as relevant if you malos and slow and do nothing else then its wasted time ?<br />
<br />
Meleeing i can do 230dps , it takes 2 seconds to cast and approx 1/2 a second to reset your swing.<br />
So lets say 2.5 seconds lost melee, equivalent to 590 lost dps.<br />
So a 800 nuke gives me extra 200 damage, and as your aware with your cold nukes there resist rate can blow ass.<br />
So tell me is 200 extra damage &quot;maybe&quot; worth risking most of the time ? Hoping for a small chance no resist and maybe even a crit ?<br />
With 30 second recast thats approx 6dps increase IF no resists ?<br />
<br />
With new oow aa + lvl + skill caps will be seeing 300dps as the norm im guessing so what what a 900hp nuke is the equivalent of our lost melee ? <br />
So wow we get a 1K DD, so we gain 100 damage over the 30 seconds recast so wow its a 3dps increase so 1% ? IF no resists.<br />
<br />
The issue is if a shaman is waiting for the next mob to come, as we know shaman mana is hardly an issue in xp grps, What are they going to do with there time med, canni when there FM ?<br />
<br />
If you malos then slow a mob you have enough time easily to drop a PR and CR nuke on the mob before it dies, And im DAMN sure your increasing your dps output more then the ranger would nuking.<br />
<br />
And on a side note, they changed spells in oow so some are on the SAME recast timer so ranger now CANNOT mem more then 1 fire 1 cold nuke so its even more pointless.<br />
<br />
ohh and oow xp mobs hit alot less hard and have more mitigation/hp's than god, fights last longer which will be a HUGE boost to the shaman class in its effectiveness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Really its quite expected from other people.

<br />
What kind of crack are you smoking?<br />
<br />
So just because our melee sucks ass our nukes are fine?<br />
<br />
Be glad that your melee is actually that good. Be glad that you can nuke at all considering your melee DPS, which gives you some sort of versatility in case of high AC/mitigating mobs and a limited way to generate burst DPS when needed.<br />
<br />
Holy ****.<br />
<br />
Do you actually know how much mana a Shaman has to spend per mob if he's Malos'ing, Slowing(assuming no TA) and nuking? <br />
<br />
The issue is if a shaman is waiting for the next mob to come, as we know shaman mana is hardly an issue in xp grps, What are they going to do with there time med, canni when there FM ?<br />

<br />
Callius's point centers around the idea of &quot;opportinty cost&quot; for a ranger they are given up tons more melee dmg.  So thier nukes add very little to thier DPS.<br />
<br />
He mainly was just disagreeing that Ranger Nukes, add a lot of DPS and shaman nukes should be like ranger nukes and more dps.  Truth is rangers get very little additional DPS by nuking.  So asking that our nukes add to shaman dps, like ranger nukes add to ranger DPS, would probably nerf us, not improve us.   Ranger Nukes suck and that class is probably suffering as much as ours.  It's easily in the bottom 5.<br />
<br />
Change Blazz's arguement, that if we had a line like Rangers, which while sucky for Rangers ((Cause of thier lost melee)) would fit Shaman well<br />
considering we dont nuke till late in fight, then the arguement makes sense.  As it is, Blazz's premise was off.<br />
<br />
BTW: not all those quotes Blazz are totally on target.  Bartmeista for example, is a Shaman with about 600 AA and Uqua/Time.  So not exactly clueless about the class.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt want to trade my Poison Nuke Line, for the Ranger Nuke Line either.</div></div><hr />

A 600 AA'd shaman said this???:<br />

No amount of 'slowing Time itself' will allow you to malos / slow / nuke 6 times in 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />

Corlathist, can you please, after reading this sentence, repeat that a 600 AA Time/Uqua Shaman said that ?<br />
<br />
Making 5k+dmg with 6 to 8 nukes = only 1 nuke : Velium Strike.<br />
<br />
Velium Strike = 7,8 sec cast time, let's say with uber spell haste and BoR, 5 sec cast time.<br />
<br />
5 sec x 6-8 = 30-40 sec (with recast time, more likely close to 1min10).<br />
<br />
I'm not saying he is a moron at all, I don't know him, but this sentence has been writen by a clueless person, that's certain :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Neither did I.<br />
<br />
My point was Blazz took Bartmeista somewhat out of context unfairly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blazz's in the original Berthall thread said we'd be better off with Ranger Nukes because they are a little higher than our poison nuke, even though they have insane recase.<br />
<br />
Bart pointed out you could do things like Malos/Slow on incoming.  Freeing up 5-10 seconds.  So even in a 30 Second fight.<br />
our poison nuke is 4.2 with 2.25 Recast.  So unhasted your looking at 6.5 or 4 Nukes in 30 Second fight.   Which would be more than casting<br />
1-2 (if seperate lines) Ranger Nukes and then waiting on the insane recast.<br />
<br />
With Max Spell ahste 23+10 cleric buff.  4.2 becomes 2.8 + 2.25 or 5.1<br />
so about 6 Nukes.<br />
<br />
Again, don't bash the people on berthall too much, because Bartmeista, a fellow shaman, rightly pointed out that switching our 2 Nukes for a Rangers 2 Nukes would nerf our Nuking.<br />
<br />
In 30 Seconds, Ranger might get in 770 + 612 + 700 if they altenrate thier 3 nukes.  Total Damage 2082.<br />
<br />
4-6 Poison Nukes: 675 *4-6 = 2600 to 3900.<br />
<br />
Then Add in Nuke Focii, Crits, Etc.  <br />
<br />
Once Omens is out, theres a rumor of a Nerf that spells of same line grey each other out.  If thats the case, Blazz's trade really sucks<br />
because it will nerf rangers to using only 2 Nukes: 910+795<br />
<br />
While we can 878 4-6 times in a 30 second fight.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Now all this said, shaman still suffer from burst dps problems.<br />
But, asking for Ranger like nukes with insane recasts IS NOT the solution.<br />
<br />
They would have to be like 1500 with a 30 minimum to be useful</div></div><hr />

Nah, just add in focii and crits.  And 2400-3600 Base when you add in <br />
15.5% for 30 Base Focii's random.  = 372 + 558.   Then add in 14% more damage from maxed crits and criting.  336 + 504.   <br />
<br />
His numbers were a little off, because he didnt crunch them out.  But shaman can put out around 5k damage 4642 in about 30 seconds<br />
with right focii, and AAs.<br />
<br />
Which is still better than what Blazz was saying, that we should trade our nuke lines for Ranger Nuke Lines.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yes trading the nuke lines wouldn't be good or us, but in your calculations above you are forgetting the 2.5 second recast time for the nukes. And my problem with doing somethign like thisin a exp situation is that you can't sustain it. Well atleast I can't sustain it or anything very close.  If mobs are constantly incoming I will need to be cannibalizing during that nuke time so that I can maintain my mana pool for the next mob.</div></div><hr />

5.2 becomes 7.5 or exactly 4 Nukes in 30 Seconds<br />

A hassle it may be, but Cann5 works out to something like 80/tick all on its own. No other class can come close to this, even with a horse. Of the other classes' self-buffed sources of mana regen, the cleric is one of the best at 22/tick; all other sources of mana regen are shared with the shaman. That you must actively cast it does not diminish its huge relative value, and it's still less hassle than the cleric's source of active regen.<br />
<br />
I'm not complaining about our mana regen either (except for it being active) but it's irritating to read people who speak about something they are so completely incorrect about.<br />
<br />
Canni5 = 1066 mana - ~220 (cost to heal, quiescence, after mana pres and spec checks) = 846mana returned<br />
<br />
846mana/30ticks (3 minute reuse) = 28ish.<br />
<br />
Add that 28 into the total a typical shaman mana regen including all other mana regen buffs, effects, and aa, then compare it to a similarly buffed, equipped, and aa'd caster and the difference is decreasing rapidly.<br />
<br />
Also, Blazz, you may want to adjust the way you talk about DoT's and DPS.  Technically, as soon as one dot ticks once it has contributed DPS and can be measured (bane is 70dps for example each and every tick).  What you need to focus on is damage per mana.  If we can contribute 70dps with a DoT that's great, but when it lasts say 3 ticks and is 455mana (adjusted for mana pres 4) then it's effeciency is abismal at about 2.8hp/m.<br />
<br />
In comparison, Envonomed Bolt (49shm poison DoT) bases at 3.5hp/m with no focus applied (320mana cost, 146/tick for 7 ticks + 110dd when cast).  Back then, there were no focus anyway and it was very unlikely for a shm to specialize in conjuration, so it would be basically full mana cost.<br />
<br />
Bane, focused with mana pres 4, running 3 ticks (which would actually be a pretty good average on xp mobs) is less effecient than the best DoT we had in *ORIGINAL* EQ!  /cry :)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, bane is 70dps and EB is 43dps first tick, 24dps thereafter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Excellent. <br />
Another great way to **** over the DoT classes. As if DD classes didn't have enough advantages already.<br />
<br />
It would be very unlikely that this change would apply to DoT's.  Afterall, we have always been able to stack every single DoT we have unlike other DoT classes where they actually have DoT &quot;lines&quot; that do not stack.<br />
<br />
The change sounds much more like it will be to affect the Canni line and maybe some other line like Diving Aura (although that would cause a serious uproar for Clerics).  I can't really think of any other lines that this would specifically affect.  SK feign death spells maybe?  Dunno.<br />
<br />
If it means that I can't twist canni3 with canni4, uh, that's perfectly fine with me since it isn't something that's beneficial to do.  However, with this change it may mean that I will be able to obtain a canni of ACP level or higher without having it be an ancient spell!<br />
<br />
Some changes to the game really are new features and not nerfs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Technically, DoTs can't be measured in DPS for various reasons.<br />
<br />
1. People forget to add the initial cast time to the equation<br />
<br />
2. It takes 0.1 to 5.9 seconds after the spell landed before the spell actually starts doing damage. And that's additionally to the cast time of the spell itself.<br />
<br />
3. As Soon as you let a DoT wear off, even if it's 0.1 seconds late, you just lost 6 seconds of DPS<br />
<br />
4. To achieve the same DPS as a caster chaining a single DD, you have to stack multiple DoTs. This requires time and every single DoT in this process is affected by disadvantage 1-3 I listed above on its own. <br />
<br />
These are just the most important ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Giac, if you are talking about calculating ceiling dps then your rules do apply.  However, since this is a practical comparison the per tick basis is adequate.  Once the DoT is applied to the mob, it will do X dps for comparitive purposes once the first tick has been reached.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Callius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Some replies here on the button, to say a ranger nukes better than a shaman us plain wrong thats all i was saying.<br />
<br />
And yes on beta spells of the same line have joint recast, so from noone rangers can use 1 cold and 1 fire nuke.<br />
Which is pretty bad, rangers get very little from there nukes especially with the resist rates as shaman know only to well with velium strike.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 shaman with 100aa ep flagged, i do know some stuff about shaman, i try to make myself well versed on all class's as its my role as raid leader/guild leader to understand how we can best usethem and equip them.<br />
<br />
Not once did i say shaman are overpowerd, though i do understand the issues about healing from both sides. I know most of us remember the days when clerics could hardly get a grp and even druids to some extent because a shaman could heal haste slow etc plenty for a grp to live with.<br />
<br />
In oow mobs have have higher hp's/mitigation not quite to luclin levels but enough to make xp fights longer and  for slow/dots to be more worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Soe has done ALOT in this expansion to help shaman now some in the end may well have a minimal impact but there have definately tried. I know they say they will not change  healing across the board untill they see how oow works out and in reality you cant blame them, i DO feel the 2K heal should be a normal spell and ancient be 2300 or 2.5K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Nah, just add in focii and crits.  And 2400-3600 Base when you add in <br />

<br />
His numbers were a little off, because he didnt crunch them out.  But shaman can put out around 5k damage 4642 in about 30 seconds<br />
with right focii, and AAs.<br />
<br />
Which is still better than what Blazz was saying, that we should trade our nuke lines for Ranger Nuke Lines.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">OK A few points, and since I am lazy and in a pissy mood, I am not gonna go back and quote. I am sure you will know if my comments apply to somehting yuo said. <br />
<br />
1. Callius, I am willing to concede that Shaman nukes are not worse than Ranger nukes. You make a powerful arguement, and since you play that class, and I do not, I will give you the benefit of the doubt. BUT, I will say this. In the CURRENT game of EQ, speed is the king, and Shaman have VERY little to contribute to this speed-game. All I want, in reality, is a 1200 damage POISON speed nuke with a reasonable recast time. Is that unbalancing? Will I take group slots from Wizards with that? Will it help me solo better? No, no, and no. 878 is a good nuke, for a lvl 65 Shaman in BoT. Its not a great nuke for a lvl 70 in Whatever OoW zone I will be in then. <br />
<br />
I will also concede the point that improving our healing dramatically would hurt the Clerics chances to get groups. I am FULLY in support of giving Clerics a bit more &quot;single group&quot; utility, and some more soloability, to compensate for this. But its my FIRM belief that 3/4 of the dependancy the game has on Clerics could be eliminated if they would JUST up the healing of druids and shamans to a more reasonable ratio, like 100-80-65.<br />
<br />
2. Bart has a Shaman, that is true. Its a bot now, though. He is a WARRIOR, the MA of his guild often, and a WIZARD, who contributes to the DPS of his raids. In your typical 30 second fights, my time is spent on Malos, Slow, Quies the MA, then . . . I want something for that last 10 seconds. I would rather NOT have to keep an Ice Nuke memmed, since there are a LOT of cases where I will not get time to cast it. And being on a mount, usually, means I cant interupt it effectively. Long casting times SUCK the way EQ is set up right now. <br />
<br />
Besides, I am not some ice-luvin, Frozen Tundra Barbarian, I am a TROLL, we dont have Ice where I come from. How they decided to give Shaman Ice nukes is beyond me. ALL our nukes should be poison or disease based, IMHO. <br />
<br />
3. Cor, I dont WANT the ranger nukes, but by god, if I have to accept a 30 second recast so I can get a fast nuke over 1200, I will. I only get ONE PER FIGHT ANYWAY. Why is it so horrible to want to actually contribute to the death of a mob with a bit of DPS that doent look like I stuck a thron in the mobs foot? I drop a Spear on something now, and its hps BARELY move. <br />
<br />
All in all, as I said there, and here, I think we are VERY close to being a good, solid class in even the most cutting edge content. But its ridiculous to punish us for being the kings of trivial content. Its annoying to accept nerf after nerf, even if they are &quot;Nerfs by Ommission&quot;, and watch other classes SKYROCKET in power and usefulness, like Druids and BLs. Most XP groups we get dont &quot;need&quot; our healing, and we all know it. Its nice that its available, but we are being added to groups for malos and slow, period. Sorry, I want more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Callius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">My kid always wants more, so i tease her, /cough<br />
<br />
But i understand no reason why the cast time shouldnt be short butincrease recast time to compensate, thus you cant nuke any faster but can nuke quicker, thus no imbalance.<br />
<br />
Like i posted earlier oow fights seem alot longer than say KT so likely the shamans skills will be more useful in general.</div></div><hr />

Bartmeista retired for a little while, for like a 3 month break.  But his only other char is a monk 2 box.  Bartmeista was his only main ever.  You must be thinking of some other Shaman Blazz.  He's in OSW btw Blazz if that helps ya realize who you are talking about.<br />
<br />
My biggest point, was that having Ranger Nukes would suck for us.  they are too small with thier recast for us to handle only 1 nuke per fight.  Theyd have to be like ya finally said at least 1500 with a 30 sec recast for them to suit shaman.</div></div><hr />

Blazz's biggest argument on the other forum was that ranger nukes &gt; shammie nukes.  Which I couldn't help but laugh at, and he now has half taken back (wh00!).  Go read his gazillion pages of stating the same hogwosh over and over and over and over and I hope you have a small hint of why I finally replied to them.  Did I exaggerate a hair?  Prolly, but certainly wasn't stretching real far.  If you can't get off at least 2 VS's or 4 Spear's in a fight these days, something is wrong.  Additionally, so what if Bane doesn't always get every last tick of damage in?  My thought process is to get Bane on almost immediately after debuffs and then blast away as time permits.  Obviously throw a Heal-over-Time in depending on the group, and throw Tnarg's for spots as needed.  I've rarely had an issue in keeping this up continuously and feel happy in my contributions to the group.<br />

Only because you don't realize that your contribution isn't adequate, doesn't mean you've got a point. The clueless whining, as you are putting it, is usually a result of sensible discussions, comparisons and parses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">All this talk doesn't change the bottom line about shaman.<br />
<br />
Of the three Priests:<br />
<br />
1.  We have the weakest heals.<br />
2.  We have the weakest hp buff.<br />
3.  We have the weakest nukes<br />
<br />
What used to &quot;balance&quot; us against being weak in the above items were two things:<br />
<br />
A. Our buffs and<br />
B. Our Slow<br />
<br />
Our buffs are largely worthless considering the majority of them rely on stats.  And all players in the higher game have maxed stats.  FA is of dubious value, but certainly has a high annoyance value.  Our group haste is 10% slower than our single target, just to add insult to injury.   Since all our buffs (except haste) can be obtained on gear, our buffs constantly dilute in power with each expansion.  <br />
<br />
Slow.  This should be obvious.  They nerfed slow across the boards, and we didn't get anything in return.  Our heals, balanced around our ability to slow, didn't get any improvements relative to the other priests, so we fell behind.  <br />
<br />
Up until oow, we were the only priest to not have a group heal.  But, of course, our hybrid cousin does.  <br />
<br />
I'll agree that we have better nukes than rangers... but isn't that a little sad.  We're debating about our nukes in relation to a melee class?  What the heck happened?  We are a pure caster class, and at some point SOE thought it would be a good thing for melee to have nukes even remotely close to ours?  At any rate, yes, we still nuke harder than a ranger.  But we don't nuke harder than either a Druid, Cleric, Enc, Wiz, or Mage.  Yep, dead friggin last again.</div></div><hr />

yes something is wrong, you haven't been around in GoD long enough to catch the speed of kill, i can get 1 VS off max, and maybe another if i have a gimp group and they have no DPS.<br />

I've spent plenty of time in GoD to know &quot;it's pace.&quot;  I did vxed/tipt, and ikk1-3 before my little vacation, and I've spent the last week or ten days in KT.  Yes, it's faster paced, but the above-mentioned &quot;line-up&quot; still works for me just fine.  Bane usually doesn't finish, but that's ok, it still does at least 2k dmg, potentially more depending on crits, all the whilst I can nuke /shrug.  I agree it's faster paced, I like it but also dislike it.  I think you're right in that it's a bit too fast at times.  <br />
<br />
And with respect to the warrior topic I still don't understand... the only two I've ever played were lowbies.  Think I got the gnome up to ~20, for tinkering stalking probes for my monk.  The other was an RZ worshippin' ogre for Kael tracking.  If you want to call either of those two &quot;mains,&quot; then by all means go ahead, but I'll stick with calling myself the main, thanks.<br />
<br />
Oh and Ungkor, I totally agree that the ranger/shaman nuke argument is sad, quite actually.  I just didn't agree with Blazz's side of the argument.  But yes, sad they're compared indeed.   :(</div></div><hr />

Edit: Okay, I lied, Here's Ranger vs. Shaman nuke numbers. Highest level possible, non-ancient, buck naked.<br />
<br />
Shaman: Ice Age, level 69 nuke. Cold-based, 375 mana for 1202 damage. Normal refresh time, cast time of 7.8 (3.2 damage per mana, 154 DPS. Each mana point spent deals 246 damage for every second used to cast.) <br />
<br />
Chain-cast twice: 17.85 cast time, 750 mana for 2404 damage. (Same damage per mana, 134 DPS, or 214 damage per mana per second.)<br />
<br />
Ranger: Hearth Embers. level 69 nuke, fire resist. 275 mana for 795 damage. 30 second recast, 3.5 cast time. (2.8 damage per mana, 227 DPS. Each mana point spent comes deals 317 damage)<br />
<br />
Chain-cast twice: 35 seconds cast, 550 mana for 1590 damage. (Same damage per mana, 45 DPS, or 63 damage per second per mana)<br />
<br />
End analysis: Single nuke, the Ranger is more efficient. Chain-nuking, the Shaman wins by a large margin. Now to find a member of either class that wastes their time chain-nuking to confirm the results...</div></div><hr />

First, we don't regen mana best in game, necros do that. At the same time, every other class nowadays has very good mana regen from AA's, FT items, various self buffs with mana regen part (i.e. clerics and druids) and various other buffs with mana regen component, which all STACK. Add mounts to it. And bard mana songs. And you know what? UNLIKE shamans, all those other classes can do whatever they were doing while regenning mana, that is fight, nuke, heal, chat and so on. Shamans can't do anything at all while using their 'uber mana regen'. Nothing. So ex-frikkin'-cuse me, but the days of shamans having an 'edge' due to big mana regen are long gone.<br />
<br />
Other then that, getting 6-8 nukes out in 30 second fight... Sheesh, what the heck are you smoking? Ever seen the cast times on shaman nukes? The little damage and big mana cost? The big recast time? Screw your calculations with best focii's and such, over 90% of shaman community doesn't have those and those few who do have are exceptions, not used in calculations of the issue anyway. If those focii's would be available to majority, then yes, there wouldn't be any issues. Numbers can be crunched in any way in ranger case as well, taking into consideration all the focii's and so on. Touche, treehugger. Next time you calculate the shaman &quot;effectiveness&quot;, using all high end items and stuff, with other classes, don't forget then to use the same items with those other classes as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">To be honest, I've never been bothered really by the nukes a ranger does.  I think the nukes a ranger has add a little fun to the class letting them do something other than shoot a bow or hit in melee.  the 30 second recast timer is a crippling limitation on them from a Shaman PoV.  Rangers do loads of damage with bow/sword, the nukes give them a 'spike' and a slight DPS peak - that's great, that's what they are all about DPS.  <br />
<br />
Shaman issues of our own dps/heals are what concern me.  <br />
SOMEONE has to have the lowest nuke dps.<br />
SOMEONE has to have the lowest DoT dps.<br />
SOMEONE has to have the lowest Heals.  <br />
<br />
and that's us, because we have all 3.  I can see that as balance, but balance needs to address group issues and roles as well - and that's where I think it falls down.  Personally I think the heals shoudl be bolstered as that is our archetype function - the other functions of doing dps is something everyone can do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's assume for a second that, that the Necro ancient didn't exist and compare our upgrade to the Necro's.<br />
<br />
I know that I use 2 curse DoTs, when I am stacking DoTs(Bane(level 64) + Anathema(level 54)). The 2 best Necro curse DoTs before Omens are Horror(level 63) and Imprecation(level 54).<br />
<br />
Let's check out the numbers:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Bane(420/tick) + Anathema(278/tick)<br />
<br />
Necro<br />
Horror(430/tick) + Imprecation(190/tick)<br />
<br />
In my picture, pre-Omens, the Shaman's best Curse DoT was inferior to the best Necro one by about 2.4%. When both were using their two best Curse DoTs the shaman Curse DoTs were actually superior by 12.6%.<br />
<br />
Let's take a lot at this same picture while considering the Omens upgrades for the two classes(still not taking the Ancient Curse from Necro into this equation):<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Curse of Sisslak(546/tick) + Bane(420/tick)<br />
<br />
Necro<br />
Dark Nightmare(670/tick) + Horror(430/tick)<br />
<br />
With Omens the best Necro Curse DoT is suddenly superior to the best Shaman's by 22.7%(used to be 2.4% better), but even more skewed is the fact, that by stacking the two best Curse DoTs, in Omens, the Necro's DPT is actually 13.9% higher while it used to be that the Shaman's Curse combo had a 12.6% higher DPT.<br />
<br />
This alone already shows how the upgrades for both classes were certainly not proportional.<br />
<br />
Let's think a second about the Ancient Curse DoT(Ancient Curse of Mori) Necros get in addition and which we decided to leave out of the equation till now.<br />
Ancient Curse of Mori will do another 800/tick, now, without throwing this in into another useless calculation(only useless because those that don't want to see will not see, no matter what), ask yourself a question:<br />
<br />
Are they going to give Necros an upgrade that is inferior to their Ancient in a future expansion or are they going to base their upgrade on the best Curse DoT they have?<br />
Will they unproportionally increase a future Curse DoT for Shamans to close the gap created by the ancient(apart from the already skewed numbers for the non-ancients)?<br />
<br />
You make the call.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realize that the new non-ancient Canni, that is going to be introduced with Omens and is the same as the GoD ancient, is a direct result of people's(legitimate) bitching that they can't get the GoD ancient? <br />
The new non-ancient Omens Canni is a fix. Otherwise, the disparity between a casual Shaman using Canni IV and a raiding Shaman using the Omens ancient would have been too large.<br />
Take a look at the ancient nukes from Luclin and compare them to the PoP nukes for the respective classes. They are all superior to the ancient.<br />
If you want a DoT precedent, compare Blood of Saryrn to Ancient:Scourge of Nife.</div></div><hr />

YOu keep whining about healing, but shaman isnt a healing class. yes your priest, but priest in the means that YOUR SUPPORT.<br />
<br />
Somebody ask this fektard what a preist is. Hm, if I wasnt a healing class, then why was one of my two starting spells at 1st level A ****ING HEALING SPELL?! This is one of the two main reasons I cancelled my account after 5 years - because I created my shaman in 1999 because I wanted to play a healer, and in the last couple years that role was being taken away from me. Since the devs made it clear that the character I played for 5 years and over 300 days played time was not going to remain competitive as the HEALER he is meant to be - I made it clear that I wasnt going to remain a paying customer.<br />
<br />
Healers, are Druids and Clerics. never in any fanstasy setting has shaman been a main healer.<br />
<br />
Sorry to break it to you, Wallaorm, but shamans were main healers all the time - for a long time in EverQuest - back when we healed exactly the same as druids when the game was first designed. Many of us can still be main healers in easy content - like LDON or old world crap. But we're pretty worthless healers when it comes to end game content - which is patently unfair to those of us who created our characters with the understanding that we were creating a HEALER CLASS. For Wallaorm's sake; this was probably before his time since he obviously doesnt know that shamans and druids originally healed exactly the same.<br />
<br />
Now, if druids were equally worthless in such end game content, then perhaps there wouldnt be so much 'whining' from us shamans (or ex-shamans) - but they arent. Then it would be more like the structure you have with the plate tanks, with one clearly superior tank and two others who are generally relegated to less-than-end-game encounters. But that's not how it is, and that's what makes it unfair. Think about it; would it be fair if paladins could tank just about anything aside from the highest end game encounters, but shadowknights could only tank old world mobs and lower? And to add insult to injury, one of those said plate tanks happens to also be a HYBRID healer that is far superior to shamans at blast healing with their group heals (something we have never had) and 1 second cast-1K heals.<br />

We expect Rangers  to pump out DPS:  and they can.  <br />
<br />
We expect Clerics  to heal: and they can.  And to buff HP:  and they can.  And to rez us when we die:  and they can.<br />
<br />
We expect Rogues  to SoS:  and they can.  And to deal heavy DPS:  and they can.<br />
<br />
We expect Druids  to heal:  and they can.  And to buff HP and mana regen:  and they can.  And to nuke and dot:  and they can.  And to port us around and evac us when stuff goes bad:  and they can.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
We expect Shamans  to slow for 75%:  and we cannot, because the high level game is built on mobs that are immune or mitigate for slow.  And to give us godly buffs, and we cannot because our stat buffs are redundant and our hp buff is the lamest.  And to heal, or at least back-up heal:  and we cannot, because our heals are low since they are built on the assumption that the mob is 75% slowed, and usually it isn't 75% slowed any more.  And to provide some additional dps:  and we cannot, because the fight is over after 2 ticks of a dot, or maybe one nuke for 750.<br />
<br />
I am fully in sympathy with any class saying &quot;Sure, we can do OK at the jobs people expect of us, but we could do it a lot better if we could get XX or YY.&quot;<br />
<br />
What shaman are saying is, &quot;We are expected to do certain jobs, and we want to do them.  We used to do those jobs really well.  But we are no longer being given the tools to do them, as the game progresses.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is why the Time's Antithesis is probably the most unbalancing single item in the game.  The shaman with one have an enormous leg up over those who don't.  One piece of gear shouldn't make up the kind of difference the TA does, but there you go.  <br />
<br />
Obviously I'm jealous and I'd love to have one, but an item that (1) saves a spell slot; (2) saves a lot of mana; and (3) is markedly faster due to no recast is really pushing the boundaries.  Nothing else come remotely close to this kind of impact.  <br />
<br />
Fundamentally, it shouldn't be part of meaningful balancing argument, imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Fundamentally, it shouldn't be part of meaningful balancing argument, imho.<br />
While I agree that the TA shouldnt be a part of the arguement, I will concede that Balance of Nihil should be, which DOES allow a bunch of extra time over Turgurs. 95% of KT mobs can be hit first-try with balance. This DOES leave more time for us to chain-cast our ****ty DPS while other classes hit 1 button and do twice the damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">People must think casting Slow and Malos is free of mana....  It's like 15% of my mana to cast those 2 spells and I have MP4.  And it takes no less than 10 secs for both to land.... more if Slow is resisted.  Most times the mob is below 90% or 80% when I get slow on.<br />
<br />
That leaves time for maybe 2 nukes against a hrisk adv mob, who are not lacking in hps whatsoever.  Our nuke isn't cheap to cast, and takes 5-7 secs to cast, plus recast.  Even with our &quot;insane mana regen&quot; I have a time trying to do that on every pull, on top of refreshing any buffs are spot-healing.<br />
<br />
Our DPS sucks... Before I can DoT, I gotta Malos and Slow... and sometimes Cripple.  2 DoT's after that would be:<br />
<br />
1) massive agro<br />
2) mana drain that even a shaman would have trouble keeping up with.<br />
3) The mob would be dead before the DoT expired, therefore rendering my DPS inefficient.<br />
<br />
People oughtta try playing a shaman before they comment.  Our insane mana regen is &quot;partially mitigated&quot; by our insane mana costs and casting times.  We are pretty good at support up 'til certain areas.. but even in my non-raiding form, my DPS isn't all that.  Melee DPS?  HAR!  Like I got time to melee, and when I do, my single-stab for 60 every 5 seconds isn't worth a ****.</div></div><hr />

Malos + TA = 8 seconds (without spell haste, since it doesn't matter)<br />
<br />
Malos + Balance of the Nihil = 8.75 seconds (without spell haste, since it doesn't matter)<br />
<br />
Nihil has the advantage that it's harder to interrupt due to the shorter cast time and that you can actually move between Malos and Nihil casts.</div></div><hr />

I think that fundamentally assuming that a Time dropped piece of gear (and a rarish one at that) is part of the shaman starting newbie gear quests is a bit silly. Also assuming that it helps balance the class out in comparison to other classes is more than a bit odd, what other class has to have a Time dropped toy to be balance?<br />
Time Antithesis is a beautiful item, something that my little shaman fingers have dreamed of for years now, making it a reality was icing on the cake for me, but making it as difficult to access as it is is its only balancing factor...it is a very powerful item and its rare for a reason.<br />
Now because I dont have access to Time, and likely never will, I am, at least by your description of how I should do things, gimped. <br />
The thing is I do well in the content I stomp around in, I have total domination over trivial content...grats me.<br />

This DOES leave more time for us to chain-cast our ****ty DPS while other classes hit 1 button and do twice the damage.<br />
Blazz, love ya man, really respect your passion and love for the class, but I have to disagree with you slightly on the Nihil point...straight out of the box, no outside spell drops, just using vendor purchased spells (not bazaar purchased) is the only way to really look at a class and see if it is balanced or no. Using a dropped spell or item to say that X class or Y class is now balanced is foolish as not everyone of that class will get that spell or item.<br />
I dont have Nihil, and unless I start doing more GoD I will never have it...my RL friends are the only people I play my shaman with now though...they are a slow moving low DPS group, so my spells are actually a good contribution and I feel worthy and useful. When/if I go LFG and get a random sewer group I feel semi useful...slow is actually useful there...get into Vxed though and I am just a Malos whore and some limited CC with VP for when the pet goes awry.<br />
My point is that I feel the same crunch and uselessness that other shaman do, and we all feel it on a different level.<br />
I dont really care if someone out nukes me.<br />
I dont really care if someone out heals me.<br />
I dont really care if someone out buffs me.<br />
But for ****S sake make me useful in some degree thats not trivialized.<br />
Its the nature of the game that people will be better at things that your not so good at, its why there are a multitude of classes, but when one class (cleric) is SO over specialized and another class (shaman) is so underspecialized and they actually have pissing contests over why the other doesnt need this that or the other thing, or when a hybrid is even in comparison in a broad way with a caster about nukes and the DPS they offer, there is a fundamental problem.<br />
I dont offer melee DPS for squat, hell I miss as much as I hit on crap I killed at level 12 for exp. Rangers do very nice high end DPS (yes I know they have some issues too) the nukes they have are useful for a nice eye candy blast and to give a nice jump in DPS over a short period of time. I, as a shaman, do not have nice melee DPS(never will) and me even comparing my nukes to a ranger is goofey as all hell..there should be no room for comparison.<br />

However, just be warned, that to Corlathist, Shaman are always going to be overpowered, no matter what the facts are. Waste time at your own risk.<br />

[QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Lol, Hyena.  I've said many many times I don't consider Shaman balanced.  And that they are underpowered, in my bottom 5.<br />
<br />
What I refuse to do however, is listen to some people's idea of balance who just don't look at full picture.  For example, looking at Blazz's arguement that we'd be better off with ranger nukes.  Thats silly.<br />
<br />
Shaman are a hard class to balance mainly because of Cannibilization<br />
which is are biggest strength, and biggest weakness.<br />
<br />
I will flat out disagree with some of the earlier posters who say we shouldnt consider Balance of Nihil, you balance classes with full spelll books in mind, excepting maybe Ancients.  Because otherwise, classes with good Gates spells like Balance, become overpowered if u balance them for Malos + Turgurs in time.<br />
<br />
I also fundamentally think, that Play Style and Skill answer a lot.  <br />
I've main healed Kotd with my shaman.   Most shaman sit back and say we can't do it.  Truth is, I've done it.  In fact, I will fly in face of convential wisdom and say as a Shaman, I am a better choice for main healing for XP grinding than a Druid.  ((I'm more efficient than any druid healing, and efficiency = king for the grind.  Named/Burst fights are advantage to druid as HPS becomes king.  But I've succeeded there too.))  Breath of Trushar is a powerful HOT.  enough to stabilize a slowed KT mob.<br />
<br />
Another example, is when u cast malos.  In the average 30 second Gates fight, if you dont cast malos until after the mob makes contact with the tank, by the time malos+recast, you've wasted about 1/4 of the fight.  No wonder, if your waiting to malos, shaman look like suck.<br />
Again, Malos should hit before the tank makes contact.  If necessary, pull with it.<br />
<br />
Hell, Im lucky enough to have a TA.  So I'd say usually Slow lands before<br />
the Tank makes contact.  SCS3 + Bellow of Mastruq and even a Warrior <br />
holds agro from a single slow.<br />
<br />
So, while I refuse to see when people say things like &quot;Shaman can't heal&quot;<br />
or &quot;shaman suck&quot; sure I think their wrong, not because I'm anti-shaman<br />
fixing.  But because I have done it.  And I hate being insulted by people telling me I can't do something I have done.<br />
<br />
So that said, what do shaman need fix wise?  They need a big fix in debuffing.   There needs to be a clear advantage of Shaman &gt; Cht/Bst<br />
in debuffing where u can notice it.  I used to be able to notice it.<br />
I can't anymore.</div></div><hr />

On top of it, we lost ground with healing power, buffs never really mattered much, in HP buff area we're losing ground all the time, in slowing area - with all the mitigation and slow immunity - we've lost a big friggin' chunk of land and our 'edge' in mana regen is not an edge for ages already. Because we can either regen mana OR cast spells, while other classes can regen mana AND cast spells. Or do wharever else they were doing. Sure we rule the trivial content, but who the heck cares and wants to stay in it anyway. In higher end area, if I was not a shaman and would make, say, GoD group, and would have a choice between shaman and chanter, I'd take chanter at any time.<br />
<br />
I don't personally even care about the increased healing that much, although I want the shamans to be viable healers again. I don't want shamans to be a part of CHC, but bloody hell, shamans should be also able to heal in a single group effectively as well. But, anyways, I mostly want utility. I want shamans have buff what others would really like. Buffs which raise damage directly, buffs which rais defense/avoidance directly. Buffs which directly raise skills above the cap. I want shamans to have debuffs which matter - not the stupid stats debuffs which matter nothing - debuffs which directly lower the targets ability to deal damage, sustain and mitigate the damage and effectively lower the targets ability to use some skills. Curses like this, curses which cripple the health and mana regen of the mob and related casting and melee skills. You know, the REAL curses, not the joke we have right now. And these should be shaman only, since it's simply shaman area. Now this kind of utility would make shaman wanted in the groups, anywhere, even if we don't heal as well as druids or clerics, even if slows are mitigated or the mob is immune. We'd still raise the effectiveness of the group a lot in such case and still would help to turn the tide of the fight by effectively affecting the target.<br />

Not this crap we've seen so far being given to shamans... SOE's full of clueless and fantasyless people, as it seems, when it comes to spells and something unique for each class.</div></div><hr />

Shamans were NEVER lowest DoT DPS class in the past, shamans had some of the most powerful DoT's. Back in classic EQ era, we got some of the most powerful DoT's before necromancers. We never packed any DD DPS, but absolutely no one had any doubt that in DoT area, shamans were extremely powerful, and it was liked by all, since it had great use.<br />

Good post. <br />
I just wanted to add, that I do not believe that SoE's developers aren't able to be innovative or lack fantasy, but that it's simply their current philosophy to maintain the status quo for as long as possible for the fear of ****ing something up, that in their mind is working perfectly fine.<br />
<br />
Everyone can see that there is no way of balancing content for the 3 healing classes when the disparity is as large as it is. You either make it too hard for the class at one end of the spectrum or trivial for the class on the opposite end of it.<br />
Everyone can see that. My 6 year old brother wuld see that and Clerics are already complaining how easy Omens is. So easy that they are bored with it.<br />
Once Clerics will quit, because Druids and Shamans are taking up their spot, the developers will redesign healing in EQ. It's inevitable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, Druids weren't great nukers back then either, If I remember correctly many of their better nukes had the &quot;outdoor only&quot; restrictions. But times have changed. <br />
Druids have been able to get upgrades to both, their offensive and defensive capabilities. Unlike us, though, they managed to not only not falll behind in one of those areas, but to actually catch up some to Clerics(healing wise) and Wizards(damage wise). <br />
On top of that, they have grown to be very valid debuffers, so much actually, that they are able to debuff ATK(Shamans and Enchanters do not have this ability) and fire/cold noticably better than us.<br />
<br />
The evolution of the Druid class is definitely amazing.<br />

Debuffing strength (from the cripple line) does debuff ATK, 1 strength = 1 atk.  Check it out on yourself.</div></div><hr />

Gaining and lowering of strength, while it does lower/raise your visible atk, actually does little toward actual large jumps in either direction for DPS....especially when dealing with monsters that likely have 500 strength, taking off a pittance (what 50 or so from cripple? too lazy to check Lucy) from their DPS...for players a cranked up str just means that you hit for larger numbers more often, and even thats subject to some debate.<br />
A &quot;pure&quot; atk debuff such as the Ro line is inherently more valuable as it takes pure atk off the top, toss in cripple and it may actually have an effect on a mobs DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, no. Even if it had the same effect on PCs, there are fundamental differences between PCs and NPCs in regards to stats. A PC's strength for instance will determine his max hit, while the min and max hit for NPCs are set(fixed) independantly.</div></div><hr />

Newb.  I know you started playing when LDoN was launched, but some people here can remember when Shamans were the equal of Druids in healing AND Damage.<br />
<br />
Imagine that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And those days are (sadly) LONG gone and show NO signs of ever returning.<br />
<br />
The occasional 'bone,' like a carcass left to the Hyena's after the Lions have done feeding is just enough to sate the starving Shaman and keep them hanging aroung hoping for further nibbles.</div></div><hr />

But you really should try to refrain from commenting on things you obviously don't understand.<br />
<br />
When I started playing this game shaman were among the most desirable classes, we were mentioned along with necros in &quot;who is king of dots&quot; type discussion, our heals were comparable to other priests and as far as slowing went we were gods.<br />
Nowadays we're a very very pale immitation of what we once were.<br />
<br />
Or to put it another way, back when I made my shaman the only way to get off Kunark was to sneak around the walls of the OT camp and swim out to a boat, then jump ship at the other end and sneak out through Freeport at the risk of death.  Seeing an Iksar off of Kunark was a rarity.  Velious was the land of plenty and raiding Kael arena was something of significant note.  Oh, and rangers couldn't get a group because everyone thought they had the bad aids.<br />
What I'm trying to say is that just because you have not seen these changes does not mean that they did not take place.</div></div><hr />
