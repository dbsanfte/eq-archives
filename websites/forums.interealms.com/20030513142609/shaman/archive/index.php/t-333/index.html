<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>illieanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">greetings! i am a human mage, and because of one careless kill (gnome at bb docks) i am now kos to truespirit faction. i am hoping some of you will have some ideas about how i can improve my faction. an enchanter friend of mine suggested charming the mobs for the beginning of the shaman epic quest and doing the gem turn in, but i am not sure that faction will change if the mob is charmed.<br />
<br />
any thoughts/ideas on this would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
thanks so much!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why, exactly, would you even care about your Truespirit faction as a mage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Look at a walkthrough for the shaman epic and do any of the easier parts.  The beginning part with the gem, or killing the guys for woe/envy would be the easiest parts.<br />
<br />
But yeah, truespirit faction is completely useless to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">a walk through isn't going to do her any good if she's kos, gotta have non kos to even do parts of it.  There is NO mob in the game you can kill to raise truespirit.  The only way you could possibly get it up is have someone charm one of the shaman NPC's and do the hand in then.  But then again why the hell do you care what your truespirit faction is as a mage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>illieanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well it is true that the truespirit faction does not affect me directly, but there are some npc and mobs on this faction that make it annoying to be kos..such as one of the trainers in the casters guild in firiona vie, for instance. and i would rather not have to worry about aggro from mobs like rak on CoM raids, and Kirn on Hole raids. <br />
<br />
heh i am mainly just pissed at myself for screwing this up and would like to find a way to fix it.<br />
<br />
last night an enchanter and i spent the evening doing the first part of the shaman epic, to no avail. got the gem from the spirit in oot (while charmed), and then charmed the barb in the nfp tunnels and did the turn in. i got exp, but no faction change. :(  i am still threatening to truespirit mobs.<br />
<br />
ah well, i will keep trying to find a way to improve it. thanks for the suggestions!<br />
