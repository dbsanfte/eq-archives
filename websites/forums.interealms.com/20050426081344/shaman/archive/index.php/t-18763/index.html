<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Velks, I still have yet to  find a place better then this for a duo. Mobs hit like sissy's(low 100's) and they don't have many hp's. Just have see invis up and your good to go, some do however have pretty high magic resistance so landing slow can be more trouble then it is worth sometimes. You can easily get 3 adds and it isn't that big of a deal, if you have tigir's it comes in handy. My favorite spots was in the back room a new named spider drops a nice 10ac 8wis 50hp/mana ear. I would say hang out in velks at least untill you get the ear piece, hang on to the velium too as it yields good pp they all sell for 50-80pp a piece.<br />
I do hear the hedge is good exp too, as mentioned above</div></div><hr />
