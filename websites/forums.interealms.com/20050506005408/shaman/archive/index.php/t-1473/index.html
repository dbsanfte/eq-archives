<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I quit EQ about a year and a half ago, and after several stints in different games (AO and DAoC), I think I want to come back to EQ one more time.  I am thinking of either starting a BL or just go back to doing what i know and enjoyed, playing a shammy.  <br />
<br />
So, two questions: <br />
<br />
1.)  Does anyone know any good Beast Lord sites?<br />
<br />
2.)  And which server would you recomend? I used to be on Inno, but hardly anyone I knew still plays.  I am looking for a lowbee friendly server =)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />
<br />
Widda Frosthammer,  Inno, ret.<br />
Widda Sporehammer, Palomides, ret.<br />
String Quartett, Palomides semi ret.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
<br />
I am really torn between either doing a Troll Shaman or trying a Va'Shir Beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Follow up question:<br />
<br />
Is Lucin worth buying if I deciede to go the Troll Shammie route?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hi Widda...<br />
<br />
Don't know about newbie friendly server... <br />
<br />
But Luclin is great for a troll shaman... little in da way of faction issues and great zones for xp....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1) www.eqbeastlord.com is the only one that I know.<br />
<br />
2) Luclin (my server) has skyrocketed in population...we used to be pretty low population but since SoL came out we are usually one of the servers with the most people online.<br />
<br />
Follow Up) Yes...for so many reasons.<br />
<br />
Personally, play the BL for a while and see if you enjoy it.  They are a fun class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't know any Beastlord sites, but I do recommend Luclin - IF you have the computer to play it.  It does take more computer than the other expansions.  Transportation is one key - the Nexus can get you to any of the conitnents on Norrath.  The Moon also has some great zones for leveling up (Paludal for early to mid-teens, for example) and a Troll has a lot fewer faction problems there.  I got to ally with the merchants of shadowhaven by running a delivery quest  maybe 30 times while waiting  for rezzes.  One time through the quest  is enough to be able to buy and sell in shadowhaven (no, not all vendors, other end of town needs a different quest).  The vendors in the Bazaar start off as indiff anyway.<br />
<br />
The Tribunal server is pretty lowbie friendly, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ive had good experiences so far in Fennin... there is the normal population of children and trainers but not nearly as much as my old server, Solusek Ro.  I would recommend Fennin although it is the oldest server of them all but my newbies and my main have had good experiences on it.<br />
<br />
WB!<br />
<br />
About Luclin... I like the moon I am bound in the bazaar which lets me sell, bank, supplies, make all potions in close proximity and then I can teleport to any continent via the spires.  I havent really xp gained on the moon yet (i still do on kunark) but I have gone on some pretty fun raids on the moon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vandulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have been metting all sorts of people this last week that like me, quit for a year or more and then came back.  (Curses the game)<br />
<br />
Well The beast lord is ok, they don't seem to be able to control their pets any better than any other class.<br />
<br />
I'm on the Inny server as well and its about the same as any other server.  I have seen less people in the zones but all in all the same as other servers I have seen.  yet to see a zone with more than 40 players outside of DL.  Was leveling an enchanter in Splitpaw and there were many times we were the only group.  Same for Unrest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Welcome back Widda :)<br />
<br />
Is it possible to get Widda back?  There's still folks about.  <br />
<br />
You certainly gave DAoC a good run it seems.  I just didn't find that game appealing at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gart, <br />
<br />
Thanks for the kind words.  No Widda is no longer available, I checked, so it's back to noobness for me.   Yes, I did give DAoC a fair shake and a good run.  I did have a lot of fun and met some tremendous people, but, alas, in the long run it is just not able to hold my attention.  <br />
<br />
I might just come back to Inno.  It'll feel weird though.<br />
<br />
To the rest, thank you all for your responses and kind words.  In regards to Luclin, what are the hardware requirements for it?  I got a P4 1.6, gf2 32meg, and 256 meg ram, btw.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Widda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Spring for a new video card and another slab of 256 ram if you can.  The framerates in some Luclin zones are brutal.  Shar Vahl is amazingly bad for me.  <br />
<br />
That's a bummer about Widda, I thought they were better about hanging on to retirees.  I can understand the new server fresh start thing though.</div></div><hr />
