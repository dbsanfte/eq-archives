Is it just me or does it make you nauseas as well?</div></div><hr />

I agree with you in that regard, however, its the numbers that make be blink twice. My 50+ days on /played when I dinged 65 compared to 3 days played to l65. However thats not to say that I didn't have a whole heap of fun inbetween.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree Litchbane<br />
<br />
Not to sound cliche'ick....but for me it truly is about the journey, not the destination.<br />
<br />
Bragging rights aside, what's the fun of rocketing to 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">there was a 65 ber on rodcet the day after god release</div></div><hr />

But hey, he (or she) pays their $12.95 a month just like the rest of us. For me it HAS to be the journey as I'm not now nor ever going to reach the end-game.</div></div><hr />

Jumps around doing the happy dance..lol<br />

Ok all sarcasm aside ..Whoopie doo....<br />
 <br />
Sorry more sarcasm.<br />
<br />
Different strokes for different folks. <br />
<br />
And now back to the grind......and loving it..<br />
<br />
woooo</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the people who rocket a new class to 65 in a hurry + AAs are those who've been around the block once or twice and know the game pretty well.  If they want to do that, more power to em :)<br />
<br />
I'm just happy with my 100ish days played and i'm still only 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm of the &quot;good for him camp.&quot;<br />
<br />
exping super fast is fun.  being first is fun.  even camping stuff for twinks and planning how to do it is fun.  getting your friends to help you get it done is fun.<br />
<br />
I'll bet he had a blast... more fun than i sitting in SH dumping plat to get a guise or kicking around pow camping crap for bard which never dropped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Big whoop tee do, he got super PLd by several people...looks like it was more for bragging rights than anything. It doesnt take exploits nor a genuis to do it.....getting him to 46, then a few easy flags (likely already collected and ready to go for MQ) then have a bard kite in HoH or Tactics, maybe someplace higher and boom, near instant level 65.<br />
People did it with a frog cleric and if I remember right did it to a lesser extent with a beastie (Luclin zones dont offer the huge exp bonuses that PoP does now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">3 days play time. I dont wanna hear no one bitching about how they cant start over the next time they hate their shaman  /tease ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Does not have to be for bragging rights, those of us that have rolled Berserkers are very interested to hear the experiences of people that have seen the 60-65 world of the Ber.<br />

Perhaps he did it because he wanted to.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol yer he really saw a lot of the world of 60-65.<br />
Good luck to him but seems pretty pointless to me.<br />
Would he actually be able to tell anyone how the various levels played out for him etc ? NO.<br />
<br />

TO BITCH ABOUT HIS CLASS!<br />
<br />
<br />
Ahhh, the memories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I know I would not want to group with him. After only 3 days of Pl ing, does he really know the capabilities of the class? I wouldn't think so. :rolleyes: <br />

Then your missing out, flat is a tight player and a good personal friend of mine.  Hell of a good guy and he's been around forever.  The guy has some insanely high play time.<br />
<br />
I agree that you miss out on some stuff when you level that way, took me a very long time to hit lvl with howjan and I wouldn't change a thing about it.  But if I were to do another char...there's no way in hell I'd take that long again.  Some like messing around at the mid levels, others don't.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Then your missing out, flat is a tight player... <br />

<br />
Agreed. Flat is a good player. Hes been thru 1-64 a number of times, ive done it a few times, so have a lot of people. <br />
<br />
To some people, the fun is in the journey, leveling up, finding new quests, hunting in the lowbie zones, learning the characters etc...<br />
<br />
For some people, the fun is in the destination, the high end game.. the cool places and tough mobs you get to kill when youre 65.. not the same ol same ol..<br />
<br />
To those people who prefer the end game, the really challenging stuff, 1-64 is just stuff you gotta trod thru to get there.<br />
<br />
As long as youre havin fun.<br />
<br />
And yeah, Id group with Flatnoze the 65 zerker. Ive grouped with his rogue. he knows how to play. <br />
<br />
Ive never played a chanter to 65, but if i had one dumped in my lap and i had to play one, im pretty sure id be moderately respectable at it, because ive played a lot and raided a lot and i know how chanters work.<br />
<br />
I cant imagine a zerker being so totally weird and different then any other class that someone tho knows 2 iotas about how the game works wouldnt be able to play one respectably.<br />
<br />
Bards are the exception of course... =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>FroakesEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Bah!  He probably skipped the first 24 levels with /testbuff if that is indeed the Test server we're talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Probably. Wouldnt you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Oongah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">From what I've seen of the class, I don't think it's going to take a rocket scientist to play one either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I love the game from 1-50ish but the mid to high 50's just burn me out, the insanely slow lvling drives me bonkers when compared to earlier and later lvls, you can burn from 60-65 if you want to but 54-60 seems like eternity. maybe its just me hitting the wall but its happend more than once, so far my shaman is my only 65. <br />
<br />
and I have done some massive pling, its a great way to lvl bots and your pocket cleric...just a bad idea for most mains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">the insanely slow lvling drives me bonkers when compared to earlier and later lvls<br />
<br />
Someone doesn't remember pre-PoP exp very well!<br />
<br />
Also...turn on AA when the leveling is feeling slow, then you can see one yellow bar fill up fast.   :D<br />
<br />
Edit:  Woops, I misread the &quot;later&quot;...oh well, comment still stands.  LDoN helps out too, very easy to get full groups going nowadays.</div></div><hr />
