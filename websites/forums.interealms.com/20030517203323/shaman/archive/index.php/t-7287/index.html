<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">went to the dentist yesterday to have a tooth pulled..<br />
<br />
<br />
its been a month and a half since I made the original appointment (was on a weeks supply of antibiotics/pain killers before the first appointment) but they rescheduled me twice..   so i get there and complain that my tooth has been having throbbing pain for the last week or two (had gone in twice to attempt to be seen as a 'walk in' but was just given pain killers and sent home) she says well, it might be infected, if we cant get your tooth numd we will have to reschedule you again   <br />
<br />
then she proceeds to give me 4 shots of novicane, and leaves to wait for me to get numb, when she comes back i tell her that i can still feel my tooth hurting so its definitely not numb, she gives me 4 more shots of novicane and come sback a few minutes later and I say ok, it feels numb, but when she starts working on getting it out I definitely can feel pain so I tell her again its not numb and she gives me 3 more shots of novicane and waits a few minutes then proceeds to rip the top half of my tooth off of the root of my tooth (which is still in my gums atm) <br />
<br />
she then tells me that I will have to go to an oral surgeon, writes me a perscription for some tylenol 3 and an antibiotic and a referal form to  go to an oral surgeon.   I complain that tylenol 3 is not going to be strong enough for me because I have a high tolerance to pain killers, but she refuses to write me a stronger perscription.   Then I am informed that I will have to pay for the oral surgery myself, and was still charged for the extraction the dentist did..       <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2nd most amount of pain ive ever been in, and to top it all off, I have to go and take a history test tomorrow because the dentist wrote my doctors note reccomending me to return to work and school today</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I am not sure what the question is but I would think that you wouldn't be able to work competantly at school while on pain killers.  Just talk to your professor, I have found that sometimes they can be very lenient towards that kind of thing, he may reschedule your exam or allow the next one to count for more, atleast that has what profs have done for me in the past.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, this doesn't seem even like it compares to what I've been through in the last week.  I had all 4 of my wisdom teeth taken out and 2 spots in the front of my mouth surgically exposed so that tiny gold chains could be attatched to my teeth that don't want to come in, all done one week ago.  I am just getting over the effects now, and I still can't eat a lot of solid food.  Problems I have had over the last week have been:  first, I did not wake up from the general anesthesia for about four more hours than anticipated, then for the next day and a half I could not even drink water without vomiting (mostly from blood I had swallowed), then my face swelled up to about 3 or 4 times its normal size for about 3 days, and only one of those days did I get any sleep.  Finally, from having eaten so little and from the antibiotic, I went into semi-shock at about 1am two nights ago and I shook and could not get warm for an hour and a half.  Only in this last day (sixth from the surgury) have I begun to feel somewhat normal.  Worst experience of my life, physically, so far.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have a good dentist - in the UK you have the option of the National Heath Service, or go private..<br />
<br />
I would say dentists are my specialty..  having spent every thursday for a year at school in a dentist chair in a dental hospital (I was a registrar's examination case because of overcrowding and my active childhood - read running, tripping and kissing a stone road curb). Nice to think your part of someone's qualification.. I've also had all four wisdom teeth out under local anastetic.<br />
<br />
I would say that she isn't a particularly good anethetist - the Registrar was very good, the National Heath Service dentist my parents used is a nice bloke but has taken 7 shots to numb the area to extract one tooth when I was younger.<br />
<br />
The private dentist I have now took about 1/2 a vial to numb my mouth for a root canal with 3 part injections in the correct areas - the guy really knows his ass from his elbow and I'm a happy customer. I the numbing lasted 1/2 a day..<br />
<br />
My advice is that you should talk it over with the dentist - especially if your paying for it. I would then state that your going for a second opinion (your money, your mouth).<br />
<br />
Personally if I felt there is a leagal settlement - I'd get them to pay for the work of another private clinic to rectify the problem. Compensation is something that's up to you.<br />
<br />
Judging by your treatment (ie they're not fixing the problem) I would change dental clinic - if they ask why tell them, tell them how you feel. The way they treat you is their problem.<br />
<br />
[PS.. none of this is legal advice but just what I would do having quite a bit of experience of dentists]</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, your mouth IS worth $50k.<br />
<br />
I am not a fan of &quot;ooh, I spilled coffee on myself, I'm gonna sue&quot; school of thought. Not at all. But I can tell you this:<br />
<br />
I got in a car accident with the State Patrol a couple of years ago. He rear ended my car and my fiance's neck was almost broken, and my back and her back were damaged. To this day and for the rest of my life, I am not going to be able to do certain activities, participate in certain forms of sports... and she gained over 100lbs (thankfully that has since almost come off completely). Her back may need surgery, and she gets a lump on her neck every so often and can't lift normal stuff sometimes.<br />
<br />
We were offerred a settlement of $12k each. This barely covers medical bills SO FAR. What the **** is $12k going to do for me over the rest of my life? I CANNOT DO the things that I would normally do now. <br />
<br />
Now, as for his mouth, you eat with your mouth. Your smile is a big part of how attractive you are. You go to the dentist expecting to have your teeth taken care of, and come away with a messed up mouth, and you say he shouldn't sue them? If this is something that ends up being permanent, he gets to live with their stupid mistake for the rest of his life! If it's something small, them he needs to get whatever bills this caused paid for. It's only right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think the reason why the shots just wouldnt numb the tooth is because its managed to become infected again in the month period i was not on any anti biotics while waiting for my appointment to come around</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can feel for you on the car accident problems too, when I was 15 I was on the way to school and the city bus (not school bus) I was on crashed into a car with 2 students also on the way to school and i got thrown and ended up with some neck and back problems.. at the time they didnt seem so bad, and after a short physical therapy program it didnt bother me much, and I ended up settling out of court for $15k (1/3rd to family, 1/3rd to lawyers 1/3rd to medical tho)..    of course  my neck and back problems are worse now and I'll be in pain from that for the rest of my life most likely too heh</div></div><hr />

<br />
My own novacaine problem type story follows.<br />
<br />
Went to get four wisdom teeth taken out all at once -- back molars.  <br />
<br />
Turns out I am extremely tolerant of anesthetics. Dentist tried three different ones on me, and after 10 or 15 minutes each, at most, they all would wear off.  Dentist managed to get like one out before problems started.  I was on gas at the time too, but it didn't matter -- yanking bones out of bones is serious business.<br />
<br />
Dentist tried three different anesthetics.  He finally said he was just going to pull them anyway, because he was this far in and he couldn't give me any more anesthetic without putting me in danger, and he couldn't stop pulling what he had already started to pull.  We just had to go on.<br />
<br />
Said I had the biggest roots he had ever seen in his life.  He kept on saying he just couldn't believe how big my roots were.  He waved the bloody teeth, vein still sticking out the bottom spikes of the roots, in my face and asked me if I wanted to keep each tooth.  Just made things weirder and more frightening to see the carnage that came from inside my body out and up close and bloody.  I didn't want to see that.  That's the last thing I wanted to see.<br />
<br />
I tried to concentrate.  And relax at the same time.  Doing an extraordinary job, I thought.  Meditative, almost.  No expression on my face.  Breathing a little heavy.  Some sweating.<br />
<br />
Now I think it was just an extended, quiet scream.<br />
<br />
The dentist was getting more and more tense.  I couldn't think about him, or anything.  My eyes were rolled back in my head and I was just trying not to do anything but push the whole thing out of my consciousness.  Finally, he said, &quot;I can't continue with this.  I can't do this.&quot;  <br />
<br />
That's when I realized that the only thing touching the dentist's chair was the very top back part  of my head and my heels.  My back was arched up and my waist was more than a foot off the chair.  I hadn't particularly noticed moving.  The top of my head was practically parallel to the ground.  I seemed locked there comfortably, once I noticed where I was.  No physical strain registered.<br />
<br />
The dentist looked really disturbed and flustered.  I didn't know why.  Everything looked silver to me.  I realized my breaths were coming out in long shudders that sent a wave through my body, as if I were being waved like a flag from my feet to my head.  Both my arms were in the air.  My right arm was pointing up, almost toward the ceiling.  I was ready to go on.  I was going.<br />
<br />
The dentist had to walk out of the room for a while.  I still wasn't sure what was really going on.  I felt guilty; I hadn't made any noise.  I didn't say anything.  He looked really shaken.  After a while, he came back in the room and had to finish.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">That's the worst dentist I've ever heard of.  She screws up, yet you have to pay the bills, both for her screw up, and for the fixing of her screw up.  You might have room for legal action, I'd check into it if I were you.<br />
<br />
Also, as far as I know, there have never been reports of being tolerant to Novacaine.  Seems like she wasn't hitting the nerve with the needle right, so you have room for complaint there also.  Sounds to me like someone either just got out of dentist school, or that they never did...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Laynee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">One thing that most people don't know is that there is a verified link between dental problems and many other physical ailments.<br />
I took care of an elderly woman for 13 years (my mother-in-law) until she passed away last year. She had a massive stroke and needed alot of care. During that time, I did alot of reading and found out as much as I could to be as good a care-giver as I could be. One of the things that I found out was this:<br />
Several years ago, it was discovered that elderly people who had recently had any kind of dental work done were at a significantly higher risk of having a heart attack. When this was looked into, it turned out that there was a much higher rate of serious illness within a few weeks following tooth extraction or other oral surgery. Not just for the elderly. For everyone.  Apparently, the bacteria which resides in the mouth can compromise other parts of the body when it is introduced into the bloodstream to a much greater extent than was previously thought. In fact, most of the current thinking is to discourage the elderly or infirm from any non-essential dental procedures.<br />
The reason I am posting this is to help you to understand that your dental problem is not just alot of pain and possibly failing a test. Infection in your mouth is dangerous. The danger can lead to infection in the sac which surrounds your heart. There are other possible complications. Take tooth problems seriously. Make sure that the infection is not present when the dentist/oral surgeon removes the damaged root. Generally, if there is still alot of swelling and pain, the tooth is still infected and should not be removed. A good dentist will give you antibiotics to bring the infection under control before he removes the infected tooth. If the antibiotics don't bring the infection down, they will switch to a different antibiotic. <br />
The most important thing is to find a dentist who comes highly recommended. There are alot of incompetent dentists and doctors and your health is important enough to not accept whoever happens to be on duty at a clinic. <br />
You are in my thoughts. Please keep us posted on how you're doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Get a second opinion..and a third..then go back and ask for your money back.  Have a lawyer freind make a friendly inquiry.<br />
<br />
While I know many honest and skilled dentists, recently I have heard of a growing minority who are playing the system solely for the money and are providing sub-par services.<br />
<br />
Did you choose the referring oral surgeon?  <br />
<br />
Sorry you have to go thru this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It's not as easy to sue a doctor or dentist as it sounds.  I personally experienced a serious malpractice issue but because it did not result in death or a permanent disability which would generate a long-term loss of income or lifetime medical expenses I could not get an attorney to take my case.  The first thing I had to do was to find a doctor to review the records and issue a report of his findings.  I would have to pay for this myself at a cost of about $1,500 and then pay attorneys fees because my case was not a million dollar one, but probably only in the hundred thousand range.  <br />
<br />
In response to the statement about the spilled coffee, I have to interject that I read a little more about this case and there were other issues.  I assume you are referring to the McDonalds case where the woman sued because her coffee spilled and burned her? The truth was that McDonalds (the particular store) was keeping there coffee at a much higher temperature than is necessary to keep it hot.  Around 180 degrees when 140 is the standard.  They had other incidents in which people had burned themselves and been advised to turn down the heat.  <br />
<br />
I don't like lawsuits, I've never sued anyone, but sometimes people just don't take care of their business and are irresponsible.  <br />
<br />
When you do go to the oral surgeon ask him to put in writing the condition of your tooth and to describe the ease or difficulty of dealing with your situation.  Also, there is a law that gives patients the right to have proper pain management.  I do not know if this is required only in hospitals or extends to other medical facilities, but it is a nationwide law.  It was implemented because doctors in an effort to avoid drug abuse/addiction by patients were under-medicating.  Your dentist could be in violation of this law.  It seems obvious to me that Tylenol would not provide adequate relief of pain under the circumstances.<br />
<br />
You may not be able to sue in traditional court because it is a small recovery, but you may have a case for small-claims court.  Suing for the price of the oral surgery and a small amount for pain and suffering would be a fair compensation.<br />
<br />
I really feel for you-Good Luck</div></div><hr />

I had mouth surgery this summer - let's see, it was called something like a maxa... oh I give up. My upper jaw was too small for my lower, so they cut the bone in three places (right down the middle of my upper mouth, and along my jaw in each side), removed all my wisdom teeth, and put in a metal expander which I cranked open 1 centimeter over a month.<br />
<br />
I bled for days, was on Morphine, Vicadin, and am only just now beginning to be able to eat normal foods again. I still can't bite off anything harder than bread. (Knives are your friend). <br />

I know exactly how bad mouth pain can be... I wish you the best of luck.</div></div><hr />

I have maxed resists when it comes to RL drugs.  I feel your pain LITERALLY!  The thing I've learned though is that painkillers are overrated, a little relaxation and meditation can block out pain just as well.  It sounds funny but the biggest source of pain is fear, let your mind go, don't worry about the pain and you'll be supprised how much even that little bit will do.  I highly suggest picking up some books on self hypnosis or meditation though, they'll help you a ton!  A lot of people think they're bogus but I've learned to completely block out pain, I never get drugs at the dentist and I've even been through surgery with no drugs whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

It took the dentist and four dental technicians to hold me down during my wisdom tooth extraction.<br />
<br />
All four at the same time, no gas.  Novacaine took care of virtually all the pain, except for the needles themselves. :p  I rather strenuously explained how nervous I was, and that I would really prefer to just be put under general anesthetic for the procedure, but he refused.  From the x-rays, he knew the bottom 2 wisdom teeth were going to be a PITA to remove.  <br />
<br />
I had to sign all kinds of medical waivers beforehand.  I read all the small print, and the stuff about permanent nerve damage, loss of facial muscle control, and all those other horrible *possible* side effects really threw me for a loop.  It was a military U.S. Marine Corps Colonel (oral surgeon) performing the extractions; you've heard all about military medicine horror stories I'm sure.<br />
<br />
He didn't believe my nervousness initially.  Guess he thought I was faking it in order to get laughing gas.  After less than a minute, he called for an extra dental tech to help keep me down.<br />
I completely remember the &quot;heels &amp; top of the head&quot; position, with the rest of my body levitated off the chair.  :p  Two more minutes, and a 3rd person was called in.  Eventually it took 4 of them, one on each limb, plus the dentist himself to keep me immobile.<br />
<br />
One tooth came out in 4 pieces, another in 5.  The top ones came out whole without any problems.  I will never forget the sound &amp; smell of the tooth breaking up, with small pieces flying out of my mouth.  (I had huge roots too) The stitches seemed to take forever after the extractions were all done.<br />
<br />
All in all, the procedure went very well, in spite of me being freaked out.  I did have one complication during my recovery.  A &quot;dry socket&quot; that hurt much worse than any of the pain that I felt after the initial Novacaine wore off on the day of surgery.  A trip back to get the iodine soaked gauze packing installed took care of that.  Boy, was that ugly when they pulled it out awhile later! :eek: <br />
<br />
Once again, good luck!</div></div><hr />

-- Not Anymore --<br />
<br />
I'll just leave it in unless they recommend it being removed. . . how about someone post some good experiences! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Okay, my wisdom teeth were hurting me a little bit, so my dad says, &quot;hey, I know this guy&quot; (note: my dad knows &quot;a guy&quot; for nearly every situation).   So, we go see this dentist friend of my dad's and the dentist says, &quot;hey, I got about an hour before I tee off, I'll just take em out right now!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Of course, I thought I was going in just to have the teeth looked at and was scheduled to work that night.  The dentist pulled three (I only had 3, the 4th wisdom tooth has never appeared) and I was perfectly, completely fine and went to work that night!  I did have a perfect hand print bruise on my jaw from where the dentist got a good grip to yank those teeth out and I remember having to stuff some cotton in my mouth for a bit, but no big deal for me at all.<br />
<br />
I have been very very lucky with all things dental.  Aside from having to wear braces as an adult (the horrors, but off now!!) I've never even had a cavity.  I thank my mom for never allowing us to have sodas as kids and the fact I'm an avid brusher/flosser.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Here's a not-so-frightening story:<br />
<br />
A few years ago I had surgery to remove my wisdom teeth which were impacted (they were coming in crooked. They were growing out of the back of my mouth &amp; butting up against my other teeth). I was knocked out &amp; had them taken out pretty quickly. My face was swollen &amp; I was goofy on drugs, but I recovered nicely. <br />
<br />
Another time I had a bad tooth (one of the teeth one of my wisdom teeth was butting up against). It had a cavity, so the dentist drilled it to fill it. The tooth shattered &amp; he put in a &quot;temporary medicine filling&quot; instead of the traditional filling. A year or so later, I was having pain in this tooth. I could barely talk or eat I was in so much pain. This dentist was surprised the other dentist used this &quot;temporary medicine filling&quot; so he removed it and found a cavity beneath this fillling. He tried to fix the tooth, but it was in bad condition. So he just pulled it out. It cracked in 2 pieces, but he acted quickly and the tooth came out of my mouth with much work. Again, I recovered nicely. I could eat regular foods the next day.<br />
<br />
I never had a fear of dentists. I guess it's because I've not had a bad experience yet. Doctors &amp; hospitals, on the other hand, terrify me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Ok how's this for a good experience?  I've been to the dentist several times and I didn't die once!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Wow! those are some pretty horrible experiences at the dentist.  The last dentist I went to was great.  He removed all my wisdom teeth and I didn't get any swelling what so ever, and the only time I had pain is when I would be chewing food and accidently chewed where my teeth once were.  I even went out on a midly drugged up date with my girlfriend that night :D  Don't remember it to well though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Viraal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Dannin, a few words of advice from a soon-to-be M.D.<br />
1. Hagle has a point. 7 shots is overkill, especially for a single nerve block (your one tooth). Tolerant or not, it still should not take that many shots of Novacaine to block the nerve. And if your dentist is telling you it can't be numbed due to an infection, he/she is mistaken. Basically anything can be numbed with the right anesthetic in the hands of someone competent.<br />
2. About this infection, Laynee has a point as well. Dental infections are nothing to joke about as they can lead very easily to systemic infection (septicemia) and worse, infection of your heart and its valves (endocarditis). However, in most healthly, young individuals, without a history of heart disease, this risk is much lower than that of Laynee's mother-in-law. But nevertheless, it should be looked at and treated appropriately.<br />
3. Your blood pressure (BP) of 174/98 is impressive, but not in a good way. I'm guessing your age to be &lt;25 because of your visit to the school nurse/history exam. That is a significant elevation of BP for someone your age. If your tooth was absolutely killing you at the time, then maybe it can explain the pressure, but just in case, something else you might want to have checked out.<br />
4. No insurance. Ouch. Don't know what else to say. Try for public hospital ERs, but expect to wait.<br />
<br />
I feel your pain, my wisdom teeth are still healing, and Tylenol just isn't cutting it. :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I was posting while waiting for my ride to pick me up and take me to the hospital, I definitely wasnt waiting to go...   I was diagnosed with hypertension when i was 16 (im 22 now)..   when i got to the emergency room I had to have an EKG, and they ended up giving me a shot of thoradol which brought my BP down from 175/110 (went up while i was there) to 150/90..      was given a blood pressure script and a different antibiotic than the one the dentist perscribe to me and was advisded to take it instead of the one the dentist perscribed to me.<br />
<br />
well, im doing OK for the moment, hopefully the pain doesnt shoot my bloodpressure up again before i can get in to the oral surgeon (appointment on 11/12) <br />
<br />
going to be looking for a lawyer tomorrow, since the dentist doesnt seem to agree that I shouldnt be the one to have to pay for his ****ed up tooth job</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Aaarrrrrggghhhhhh!  I went through a tooth issue last year and I dont ever ever ever want to think about it again - I have never been so miserable - the pain was so bad I stayed awake 48 straight hours before I finally had my root canal.  I have a huge amount of sympathy for anyone going through that crap.<br />
<br />
Slamdooley</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">this is the 2nd most painful thing ive had to deal with in my life..   and ive gone thru some bad stuff, like getting hit by a car ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Dannin, heres what you do:<br />
<br />
Buy some kerosene, a lighter, and track down your dentist's home address.<br />
<br />
I think you know where this is going :)<br />
<br />
No seriously though, get a lawyer, and have that bitchass dentist who messed everything up in the first place pay for all medical expenses + 'mental pain/suffering' :)<br />
<br />
He/She jacked up your tooth, its time to make that idiot pay, in more ways then one.<br />
<br />
Get yourself a good lawyer, a good one can persuade a jury in a lot of matters:<br />
<br />
Dumbass lawsuits:<br />
-A guy thought cruise control drove his new trailer for him.  He put it on and went to get a drink...obviously not a happy ending.  He was rewarded some insane amount of cash as the makers of the trailer didnt explain cruise control properly in their manual :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
-A guy broke into a house, but was locked in the garage...The owners of the house came back from vacation 8 days later, finding the robber still alive.  The robber was awarded a large sum of money for the mental pain and anguish he endured while trapped in the garage eating dogfood.<br />
<br />
Yeah...US legal system sucks, get a good lawyer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">well, maybe i said im OK too soon, im still having some chest pains, although they arent as bad as the ones i was having yesterday...         but yesterday only on left side now on left and right side<br />
sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Viraal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Hmm, chest pain, a history of hypertension, AND a tooth ache...<br />
<br />
Did the ER make any mention of a reason for your chest pain, I'm assuming they got an EKG because of that, but you didn't say anything about a chest x-ray, which would have been indicated in your case. Without boring the forum's loyal readers with a full medical history, I just have to say that hypertension beginning at age 16 usually has a specific cause. I'm kind of interested in what you were told when it was diagnosed, because it might have something to do with your chest pain now. Or you might just have a pneumonia/lower respiratory infection. <br />
<br />
Not trying to sound like an interrogator, just hoping I can help out, hate to hear of people suffering needlessly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">went back to hospital 2nd time, and had another EKG (had one the first time) some chest x-rays and some bloodtests done..   wasnt a heart attack, thankfully<br />
<br />
they think its probably chest pain from my elevated bloodpressure due to the pain from my tooth (bp was 164/115 when i went back into the emergency room)..   anyway I am schedule for a stress echo (stress test? treadmill + monitor my heart)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Viraal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Stress echo = pharmacologic stress test + echocardiogram<br />
<br />
In other words, it's usually done by having you lay on an exam table like you would for a routine echo, however they use certain drugs to increase your heart rate for you, so they can run the echo and watch the EKG for changes while your heart rate goes up. It allows them to do two tests at once essentially.<br />
<br />
Hope everything goes well, keep us up to date.</div></div><hr />
