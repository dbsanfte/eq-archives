Didn't the frogs need the help of the barbs to take over Grobb?  Not to mention the trolls were betrayed by their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a terrible disaster has struck luclin, it exploded it seems, and rain down on norrath, happens shortly after the eq timeframe. this basically changed to land layout completely, createing new seas, new land etc. and i think the gods have deserted us. as such the curse on orges is slowly being lifted. cue 500 years later and the ogres although still not huge intellects but are more intellegent than was and hence likely this events:) also the forgs dont have the protection of mar!<br />
<br />
however, and this is purely from what i gather from other post and text, i belive it is not what it seems, some gods might not be so inactive, and other have set plans to work againts them? could there be striffe with the gods? who knows, but i sure it will involve alot of killing:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The destruction of luclin happens about 300 years after current eq if I'm getting the dates right. Eurid or however you spell it is around in the ps2 game (500 years before eq1) if I remember. The lore section with the invasion of the nexus leading to the destruction of luclin takes place on the 800th aniversary of eurids crossing, being about 300 years or so in the future. All of the events with the ogre invasion take place before the sundering of luclin I believe as there hasn't been any mention of the actual destruction yet, only the invasion. <br />
<br />
Basically they just trashing most of the cities so they can have a good story reason for only two cities in EQ2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
actually huge chunks of moon falling on your city is plenty to get rid of it and the following raise of water or destruction of land does that too, they need no other reason:) also the rise in water would lead to some nice underwater cities i would think:) least if they thought about it well:)<br />
<br />
still i am unsure of the time scale and the destruction of luclin could be to follow, and this is just the set up to that.</div></div><hr />

The Frogs were able to take grobb for 3 reasons.<br />
<br />
1. All the fighting trolls had left for gunthak (or somewhere in the LoY crap expansion area). Only the old and very young trolls were still in grobb.<br />
2. They had the help of their god.<br />
3. The devs just patched their sorry asses into grobb.<br />
<br />
#3 is the real reason.<br />
<br />
The truth is that no amount of those slimey frogs could have taken grobb if even one troll was there to defend it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was still playing on Vallon when the frogs took Grobb. If memory serves the Evils held off the invasion into the wee hours of the morning till the GM's had to modify the script with god level super frogs. Really torqued everyone off when the GM's &quot;cheated&quot; like that. :)</div></div><hr />
