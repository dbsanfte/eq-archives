<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flogg Lheggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read as many posts as I can find and talked to alot of peeps in our guild..but noone is quite sure how to zonein to the OOW zone to begin with, or the post seem to assume that we know how to find em..can anyone help please..It looks like what I need to get the old experience bar moving again..thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go to any Priest of Discord in any city, hail him and then say &quot;I wish to go to discord&quot; - he will then port you to Dranik's Scar.<br />
<br />
There are wandering mobs that path close to the port in point. also, some people will train mobs to get to the port out point, so don't assume that you will be in a safe, aggro free point when you zone in. The mobs are green cons to a 65 but even so....<br />
<br />
To get back, go to a priest of discord in Dranik's Scar and say &quot;I wish to go home&quot;</div></div><hr />

Thanks so much Weyalan..this will help lots..map says they are 45-57 and I am 57 with a 57 warrior friend..so should be managable..will invis first time in just in case..8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also, the PoD takes long enough to cast the port spell that you have time to cast invis on yourself if you target yourself quick enough and cast right after saying &quot;I wish to go to discord&quot;.  Handy for when there are trained mobs in the port in spot.  Just an fyi, training the PoD's isn't very useful other than for getting people killed, because the PoD's take just as long to send you home as they do to send you to omens.  It's best to train to the Harbinger's Spire zonein as far as I can tell, because there doesn't appear to be any mobs guarding that zoneline.</div></div><hr />

At 57, you and your warrior friend will have a ball in Draniks. There is a named (Ukun Gutfeaster) that spawns by a tree just north of the zone in point - it drops a nice Augment (+5 to all stats) and skins for shaman epic 1.5 (save 3 of them) Everything is pretty much slowable and rootable...</div></div><hr />
