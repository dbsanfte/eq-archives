<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, After hearing about the new Marget Weis and Tracy Hickman series (War of the Souls) I decided to pick up the first book in the series last week. <br />
 Now granted I probably haven't read a book in about a year, and that was just a re-reading of the lord of the rings series. But after reading Fallen sun I ran out and grabed a copy of Lost star. <br />
 I must say I haven't been this entertained in some time. My wife who has never been one to read or enjoy Sci/Fi has actually taken an interest in this series as well. This comes to no suprise to me though, being a long time fan of these two aurthors.<br />
 I must say that at the end of the the Fallen Star I was a bit let down when I found out exactly who the one god was. I was expecting it to be Raistlin. Who wasn't...:)<br />
<br />
Let me ask you this, how many of you would be thrilled to play a game like everquest, but with the vast back story that is the world Krynn. A follow-up question would have to be During What age?<br />
Please correct me if I'm wrong here...<br />
First Age -- Unknown, could someone provide a discription please.<br />
Second Age -- The Time of the King Priest, A golden Age.<br />
Thrid Age -- Cataclysum, The gods turn for mortals and cast down a rain fire to punish the world for turning from the gods. Gifts of healing are no longer grants to clerics. People have abandon the gods.<br />
Forth Age -- Gods have returned and with them the healing gifts of clerics.<br />
<br />
If someone would like to provide a better discription of the different ages of Krynn please do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've read a ton of Dragonlance stuff (have 90 or so books), and would love to play a game set in that world.  First age would be fun, back in the days of Huma and the dragons, fighting Takisis, and all that good stuff.<br />
And the time of the first books would be up there too, with the dragons and gods returning.<br />
Kingpriest and Istar are too boring IMO, too many goody goody folk around =)<br />
<br />
But really, who could resist playing a gnome in Mt. Nevermind?  All the explosions and crazy gnomish inventions around, I'd never leave.<br />
<br />
I haven't read the new War of Souls yet, I'm waiting on the 3rd one to come out, because I know if i start on the first one I'll finish it and the 2nd in 2 weeks and be sitting waiting on the 3rd =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree Icklymuk. I hadn't read anything in a while...been playing too much EQ. Then, I went ahead and bought both of these books when I saw that Wies and Hickman had teamed up again for another series. I was blown away. And yeah, the world of Krynn is like an easy to get into comfy home if you read the first three books. I read the war of the lance trilogy when it very first was released so many years ago, and that was it for me. I was hooked. Anyhow, I was expecting Raistlin as well hehe. I can't wait for the third book in the series :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm betting that they are gonna throw us for some kinda loop about the One God being who it seems at the end of the Second book.  But good read overall, although I vastly preferred Jean Rabes series much more.  It gets more into how the world goes along, in a manner I enjoy, although I gather there were a lot of critics on her first Dhamon series.<br />
<br />
Oh well, the worst part is waiting for the next book, I hate getting to the end of a book and not being able to keep going in the story right then.:(<br />
<br />
Guess I should post more, been here since 1999 and still stuck with the ol' Disciple tag :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm shy maybe 5ish books from a complete set of all (and I do mean ALL) of the Dragonlance novels.  A buddy and I are both avid readers, and the Chaos War series just beat the magic out of it for us.  He let it slide but I've kept up hoping they'd bring it back to the way it was, and I was VERY pleased with the ending of the new novel (I ate up &quot;Souls&quot; in about 6 hours).  I'm all for finding inner strength and determination, but I'm sorry, monotheism does not belong in the Dragon Lance world (pfft, like I own it, heh).  As for the Jean Rabe series, I've liked every one, though Dhamon's decent into darkness was kind of a bummer at first (being my favorite char in the 1st series).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I read the Dragonlance books by Weis and Hickman years ago. Great series, but I like the Death Gate Cycle by the same authors even more.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see a game similar to EQ set in Dragonlance world, but definetely not during the time period when clerics couldn't heal :).</div></div><hr />
