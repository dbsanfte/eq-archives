When they ask for it, sometimes. I am just a lazy shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I'm in BoT, I keep everyone FA'd!<br />
<br />
  Im kidding of course, havent been in BoT in like years :P  But is it me or have people stopped bugging us for FA? I havent had a request in quite some time.  I too am the lazy sort, and never waste a spell slot on it.  Maybe they prefer the beastlord one, who blames em ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No way! No chance im going to keep up a rotation with FA when I got plenty of other things to do that is more important. Had it been a groupspell or a spell with atleast 30min duration mayby I would have bothered.<br />
At this level of game 140ATK wont make or break a raid...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I absolutly despise FA.  And everyone in my guild knows it.  Yet I still get tells for it on occasion but they know I'll prolly have to memorize it and they'll have to wait a minute before it happens.  Sometimes I can't be bothered due to being busy with other things and I let em know they're SoL.  As a previous poster mentioned, FA won't make or break any raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only when asked in groups.  And usually only if the group is weaker.  Fully GoD'd geared folks asking me for FA in Ldon's is comical.  <br />
<br />
In raids, only if there are a few shaman on, and the raid target is hard.  If the target is a ranged fight, and I don't expect to be patch healing much, I always FA.  <br />
<br />
You know what ticks me off though, is rangers that refuse to drop dog form for FA.  I take the time to make six or seven hotkeys of all the rangers/monks/rogues, etc.. and some of them don't want it.  That's pretty telling right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use it in out-of-guild groups because that's where people usually need it the most.  In-guild groups burn xp mobs down so fast that it hardly matters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kelinka_Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I keep it loaded for when I box exp groups in KT etc...but for the most part I keep it on our pullers for Uqua so they have the best chance at hauling ass back to us with those nasty mobs =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Myzr Snowman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am not qwic flagged yet - but I always have it up for the most part ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In exp groups I keep it up and don't mem balance. When raiding I have balance loaded and not FA. If someone asked me for FA I hit my hokey &quot;/r Ohoh, you said FA! Now I have to ignore you.&quot; Latly I don't have to hit the hotkey often. May be because you need all resists buffed thanks prismatic / chromatic resist checks. And melees run short on buff slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No FA.  Usually people don't have room for it, and it's benefits aren't good enough to be essential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I use it depending on the mob/raid.  If its a mob that 1) doesn't have an AE requiring multiple resists (too many buff slots to use FA), 2) is resistant to our DoTs, then yeah I'll FA.  Usually this means I just FA on mobs like Cynosure, Ravs (Iggy event), etc.  Otherwise I just don't have room to keep it up.  I'll usually toss out a few FA's to rangers/rogues as we buff up and are about to charge, but then I usually swap it out for a DoT.</div></div><hr />

Now if I cast it on someone (cause I thought about casting it) they never let me know when it needs to be refreshed, and I dont think they care or worry about FA any more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Before I joined the guild im in now, i didnt own FA and really didnt want it, but i had to mem it grrrr<br />
<br />
But now I try to FA all people and if it pops and i didnt get a tell for it i just FA the first person i target.<br />
I feel most events in GoD are short but needs alot of dps so if i can add 10-15PCT to any class its a great help in winning the event so yes i use it alot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I don't have any GoD flags yet, but I'll FA as long as people want it.  It's about the only thing we have going for us to let us compete with Beastlords, for gods' sake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have only been asked for FA twice in the last 6 months.  I don't even keep it mem and have moved it to the back of the book.  I have loaded it for a few boss mobs with no aoe spells though.  For the most part its a spell that is worthless for anything other than power leveling a twink after 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jerakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">When I am using my shaman for a raid I try to get a rotation with FA going on rogues.  The DPS increase is definatly there especially in Qvic where DoT dps does nothing and non Magic nukes are almost always resisted.  As a Ranger I do definatly prefer FA over using my self buff.  But unless your keeping FA on me in a rotation with it only being down for a couple minutes at max its just not worth it.  There is no way I would ever click off Feral Form for FA just for one fight because FF requires me to reshrink and use my AA to switch forms.<br />
<br />
FA is worth it, if you are consistant Rangers will leave FF off so you can buff them.  In an XP group if your not FAing the melee your just being lazy, or your deluded about how much dps your nukes/dots do in XP groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Nope, rarely have it up.  Frankly, it's not worth the loss of a spell slot.  As someone noted, in guild groups, we have the equipment and comfort level from playing together to mow stuff down so fast it's not worth casting.  I get up a couple of nukes (and bane) and go to town.<br />
<br />
In pick-up groups, I go with a 2nd DoT.  I'm pretty sure that the increase in dps from 1-2 people with FA is not that close to the increase in dps from even a single DoT line Bane or Blood.  Of course, the agro is always a problem in pick-up groups, but . . .<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">In most cases I don't keep it up, but sometimes I do, as it is being asked from time to time. Mostly in LDoN, where some ranger/monk/rogue/some tank asks it. Can't say much about GoD runs, have been only on few, most of the time when I'm in GoD it's spent with /LFG on.<br />
<br />
But in general it is annoying spell due to short duration, little effect, long recasting time.</div></div><hr />

In an XP group if your not FAing the melee your just being lazy, or your deluded about how much dps your nukes/dots do in XP groups.<br />
<br />
I think you have just made a successful argument for why we need an upgrade to DD.  I would also think that keeping FA up on two melees in a XP group that, a bane and a semi-quick blast would out do the dps addition of FA.  Are there any log parses of the dps increase of FA on someone with 1600*+ attack?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">told a rogue is a xp group to bugger off when he asked me for it... i hate it, unless were raiding then i cast it on the chanters and try to get them to melee... its fun to watch the 1's fly past</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yup, its perma mem'd into the raid line up.  I toss it on rogues and rangers (when I see them without puppy fa on).  I'll toss it on Pali's when undead stuff rolls around, as an ego bump for their Slay numbers.  Ever since I picked up virulent paralysis FA moved into my once perma mem'd root slot.<br />
The new group FA is going to be a real godsend.  I can't wait to grab a group of rouges and rangers and cast that baby.  If only it were mgb'able  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Used to always be perma-memmed.. but lately with all the curing that I'm doing and dps gained by chaining certain spells in certain fights (as well as keeping focus up to constantly hit someone with it in places like Txevu+) I don't have the room for it at this time.  This may change of course with the advent of the new spell slot.. but we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">My sig says it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Jedani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Nope- not worth the trouble to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>CollectraBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I still use FA, cant help it with all the addicts we have in the guild =)   It does increase overall dps, by how much I cant say, I'll try and parse some on my monk if i get a chance and post results....the numbers with FA do &quot;look&quot; prettier tho =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Its only worth casting to me on events where the pally procs help out a lot or on rogues/monks. Any other class/situation the boost is minimal at best. On a good rogue or monk it can be up to a 10% increase in dps when they use their discs etc so its worth it for intense fights. Other classes keep dreaming - its not even worth the effort.<br />
<br />
So I guess it boils down to I will FA rogues and monks just before big fights if it might be a close fight or the paladins on ocaision when its useful - beyond that I wish I could delete this annoying piece of crap spell. If I need to mem a canibalize spell theres just no way its getting memmed also - to many spells and too few slots to have to dedicate one slot to fa... if it was a clicky or longer duration then maybe but not when it eats one of my slots permanently.<br />
<br />
No one in my guild minus a certain rogue even asks anymore and he mostly only asks when he wants to do a parse or he wants to mess with me... But its ok - I got back at him with a ton of crap buffs the other night when he asked :P (he really needed them :o honestly... cause shaman stat buffs are really effective *sarcasm off*)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Hurrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Nope, don't mem it.  It's short duration is simply not worth the minimal gain.  It's also an extra buff, in an expansion where buff slots are at a premium.....most of our dps don't have the room for something with this short duration and minimal improvement.  If they ask for anything, its Bih Li....much less attack value than FA, but it goes to show duration is highly valued.<br />
<br />
And since we dont use it, expect to have a new version with every expansion.  haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Ok, adding to what I said earlier.  If someone were to give it to me, I would use it in group situations most of the time or in raid situations if asked.  But, as I told one warrior that asked for it, &quot;I am not spending 20k on a spell that I have to cast every #$^&amp;*@$ 6 minutes.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I'll normally do FA on 2-3 Rogues on named encounters. Providing I have a spell slot open.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I need to keep Nadox and RGC up, leaving me with the following memmed spells:<br />
<br />
Malos, Malosinia, Nihil, Nadox, RGC, Ancient Canni, Trushar, Daluda.<br />
<br />
I suppose I could drop Trushar if necessary though.<br />
<br />
If we do in fact get another spell gem through AA, then the point will be moot. I will always be able to keep FA memmed.<br />
<br />
I don't bother giving FA on trash clearing. Too much going on most of the time when clearing to be bothered with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">&lt; bit of a spell swap junkie.<br />
<br />
Will FA in hard LDoNs, KT+ XP groups and high DPS classes on Raids for boss mobs (usually sit there FAing while everyone prepping for bosses) ..<br />
<br />
With XP groups with 3 or less melee, I swap FA in, cast on all, as it pops, then swap it out (it almost last 12mins with extension effects, and I watch it with Inspect Buff 2, so I know when to remem)  ..... with 4 or more melee I keep it perma memed.<br />
<br />
And there were some (?old) parses floating around that shows about a 5% - 10% benefit (not sure how old they are nor what mobs it was parsed on) ... so assuming you FA 3 melee of 150dps, you only gain AT MOST 45dps (which is less then one Bane, assuming it sticks) ... <br />
<br />
To this day, I have NO IDEA why SoE feel it necessary to have such a painful buff to cast that has minor effects when compared to HASTE buffs ... Even if they wish to keep the freaking painful duration, it would be nice to GET RID OF THE DAMN RECAST TIME ... <br />
<br />
So, in conclusion, if ya can't be buggered swapping spells in and out, and you have 3 or less melee in group, the entire group you are in gains more from a Bane (or even a Blood) cast then FA ... <br />

<br />
Was something like 35.<br />
<br />
With gear and aas can have a FA that lasts close to 10 min.<br />
<br />
Lets say we keep it on 5-7 x 35 dps, seems worth while.<br />
<br />
I am thinking alot of these lazy shaman posts are in jest, but when the stat cap is lifted we are gonna be buffing stats like a mo fo all day and all night.<br />
<br />
We cried to get our stat buffs to mean something again, and we can plainly see that even with one that does offer some utility now, the general apathy towards useing it. <br />
<br />
Lets add hypocrit to our resume of lazy whiners. We are really presenting a nice class image to the rest of EQ.</div></div><hr />

Wait til you're limited to 54 people, you won't see so many shaman bots, but rather wizard / cleric bots. If someone wants FA that bad they can ask, and I'll FA them. What I won't do is have 11 people on a constantly rotating timer. That's not even fun, if someone wants my 11.5 minute buff so bad then they can tell me when it fades. You'd be suprised how few tells you get, I guess it doesn't really matter that much.</div></div><hr />
