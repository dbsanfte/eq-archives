<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went here the other night with a 55 mage friend of mine and we owned this place.<br />
<br />
Both had pets.  Me dogdog him earth pet.  He pulled.  I slowed, pets killed.  No deaths and alot of fun.<br />
<br />
Snakes, golems,  boulders can all be done.  Prett easy to root and it seems to last along time. <br />
<br />
Will need an EB item or alot of fish scales, or EB from mage.<br />
<br />
Sssar organs can be used for a EB neck item.  Are rare drop bu there are alot of snakes.<br />
<br />
<br />
We hunted by the Mons ZL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What's the secret? I've been looking to solo here at 56 and all I see is Shimmering Rockfiends with 16K HP according to EqMaps, even if they didn't hit it would still take forever to kill them. I have a JBB, Fungi and an Enduring Breath item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solod here for a bit last week (level 56) to get my amulet of the grey wastes.<br />
<br />
The snakes hit hard and fast for 130 ish but are easily killed with dogdog and JBB.<br />
<br />
The Timeless golums are the best they also hit for about 130 but not as fast as the snakes. but again can be killed with dogdog and JBB. these are my prefered mobs as they don't give out as much damage as the snakes. The golums have a proc that can sometimes fire off and spin you around for a bit.<br />
<br />
The boulders are traps that are easy to kill hitting for about 90, but they summon. They are just a pain if you agro them pulling a different mob back to camp.<br />
<br />
I stay clear of the rock fiends as they are immune to jbb and have huge HP compared to the other mobs. They can be killed with BoN though.<br />
<br />
I set up camp on a wall rather than in the middle of the zone. There are lot's of trains created by the ubers heading to the temple. If you are lucky they send out a shout before they set off. A lot don't though.<br />
<br />
the only thing I really dont like about this zone is they way the mobs vanish and re-appear as you run round the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">YOu foget I had a mage with me.  He just got happy with the nukes and I slowed both boulders rooted the add and both pets meleed other while I heal pets as needed.<br />
<br />
We pulled mostly snakes and golems so I would look for them the most.  Boulders are not that difficult.  <br />
<br />
Secret is to only do damage to one boulder.  If you root the add with out attaking it will not summon.<br />
<br />
Only got trained one time.<br />
<br />
Another real nice place to go is the Temple LZ.  Golems there are good exp.  Named snakes however are nasty so you may need a few more people.  I did it with a full group,  sham, sk, sk, mag, dru, wiz.<br />
<br />
Only deaths came from when SK agroed the tower and 25 skelies followed him over to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Secret is to only do damage to one boulder. If you root the add with out attaking it will not summon.<br />
<br />
Something changed got message about being immune to movement change spells everytime I tried to root one of these, in fact last night the only things I could root were the snakes and skells. JBB did work on rockfiends along with BoN, I was with a 55 Pally and could do rockfiends but it took 2 BoNs, his melee, my pet and a few JBB blasts to do it in. Yes, I could save mana on the rockfiends we ended the fights in good health but that would have taken forever.<br />
<br />
ADDED:Oh yeah the boulders have some kind of funky snare now too. Overwrites SoW and slows you down mucho. Melees are skunked there, I had to hit the boots several times to get these things corraled we had 2 snakes too. Luckily a Mage came along blew up a pet and proceeded to beat all 3 boulders down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The grey, eh?<br />
<br />
I have been XP'ng here since lvl 52. At 54, I was able to solo. I don't have JBB or Fungi. I do have my epic, and that's what makes the difference here. <br />
<br />
My recommendations are to first start near the Mons Let zone line. Pull golems first, they are easy. Snakes are next in line, but they tend to have high DR/PR which makes it difficult to DoT them (even after debuffing). Stay away from the Rockfeinds. They are too much work for the trouble they are. I also recommend staying away from the wrom-type mobs. They are called X-something, and they are difficult to root. They usually come as adds which is why they are a pain. If they are solo, then they are easy. <br />
<br />
The snakes are the best XP (IMO). Once you're comfortable with the zone mobs. I recommend going to the temple. The snakes are the best XP. There are a lot of snakes behind the temple. It can be difficult to break the camp, but once they start coming as singles .. the XP starts moving :D. There are skellies by the temple too. Only problem with the temple is the trains - trains - trains - trains!. I stay on the back side of the temple and I'm usually out of the way from the trains (as long as the trainie know what side the entrance was on). <br />
<br />
I have not done the zone line by scarlet. I did the Nroth East corner a few times, but the traps that trigger the boulders were too annoying. Unless you are working on a certain spawn table for a named mob,  I wouldn't bother with the north east corner. <br />
<br />
For the longest time, I did these camps w/o meleeing. Just did a lot of root-n-rot w/epic. I melee the mobs now w/pet, but the beating that I get is difficult to recover from. <br />
<br />
My next goal is to try the sun reverants in the north west corner. They are lvl 55 mobs .. shoud be great XP. I have grouped up there and most spells stick on them. Should be fun :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Funny you should mention this. Experimentally last week I had tried this at 53 solo, no jbb or epic. Mons Letalis zone line. Pulled a shissar stalker (snake) into the little coffin room there. They path funny around the coffin, which gives you more time to cast a cold nuke or cripple before sending in pet. I have uber strength because of a dumb thing I did (that maybe some other shaman did too with their first character ever).... I put all my starting points into STR and STA! No need to fear though. With more strength buffs to max out STR (strength &amp; rage buff) I'm a tank-shaman! The 2hb bonus for level 51 up is also nice, plus I'm master at 2hb so I do 100+ damage hits with hammer of rage. Stand there, no bear form, and use barbarian bash on the thing as offten as you can to stun, then hit the mob and keep yourself and pet healed up. Pull with slow, cripple, toss in maybe 2 or 3 cold nukes (snakes only... other mobs resist these), and prepare for a close battle. The snake got me down to about a bub and a half health before I finally healed myself and then finished it off. I didn't realize the golems are easier. Thanks for posting that. I'll have to go back and try this again now. - Warmag of Mith. Marr</div></div><hr />
