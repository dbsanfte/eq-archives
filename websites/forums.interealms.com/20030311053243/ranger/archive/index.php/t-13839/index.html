<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raiyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi y'all,<br />
  Just hit 46 and have started planning what Im going to do as far as AA.<br />
  One question, and I've looked at all the guides (at least I think I have) but I can't find anything about this.<br />
  Lets say you set your bar to 50%, how much experience translates into 1 AA pt gained?  or even 100%.  At level 51.<br />
<br />
  Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elnil Everstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't quote me, but I understand that it works this way:<br />
<br />
An AA point = level 51.<br />
No matter what level you are, it takes the same amount of exp to = 1 aa point.<br />
<br />
So a level 51, a level 55 and a level 60 all require the same amount of xp for 1 aa point.<br />
Obviously at level 60, you are more easily going to kill a blue mob.<br />
XP has been recently modified to give more exp for greater risk and less exp for less risk.  So light blues give less than they used to, a lot less in my experience.  Even cons give more than they used to.<br />
<br />
For everyone, that AA point you could get at 51 would put you at 52, so it makes more sense to level up.<br />
<br />
It seems now at 60, that 4aa points = 1 level in 60 <br />
(estimate only, I'm sure someone will correct my math)<br />
<br />
The figures above should be used for example only, but the Logic is sound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raiyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you Elnil, looks like I stumped the board on this one.  OR it's a stupid question on my part.  Guess I will just have to wait and see how it works when I get it.<br />
 Level 48 and closing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the reason nobody answered it is that it's been answered many times before.  The search button is your friend.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is that full AAXPing Elnil or a diff ratio.?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beohram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No one can really answer that question exactly, since no one really knows how much actual experience it takes to gain a point.  (I’m sure EQhackers may have something to say about it)<br />
<br />
But two things already stated.<br />
<br />
One, the amount of experience needed to gain 1 AA point is a constant.  It doesn’t ever change.   Gaining your first AA point takes as much exp to get as does gaining your 100th AA point.  Also, gaining a single AA point at lvl 51 takes as much exp as gaining a single AA point at lvl 60.<br />
<br />
And Two, the amount of experience needed to gain 1 AA point is actually a little bit less then the amount of experience needed to complete level 51.  I believe if you used a 50/50 split, starting from the beginning of level 51 you would gain your first AA point and still need something on the order of half a yellow bubble to finish out lvl 51.  Maybe not exactly, but it’s close to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TalvaranRW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea i had a friend do 50/50 right as they dinged, you get aa slightly faster then lvl 51, it's more like lvl 50</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Folletto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I read that an AA exp point is 15,000,000 exp points. It does not matter if you are level 51 or 65 it is still 15,000,000 points.<br />
<br />
That info came from one of those ShowExp types that number crunches everything in sight. ;-)<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, level 51 to 52 takes a little more than 15,000,000 exp points.</div></div><hr />
