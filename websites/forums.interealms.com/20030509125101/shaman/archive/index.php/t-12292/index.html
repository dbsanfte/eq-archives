<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iceborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just sent the following off to the developers corner.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am curious why my Shaman can not forage. <br />
<br />
Shaman are the only class in EQ that can perform works of alchemy. Unlike the alchemists of antiquity who sought to make gold from lead, the alchemists of Ever Quest use herbs and roots to make potions that have a wide variety of properties. The Shaman alchemist knows that if he were to combine a Sage Leaf with Birthwart, a potion that gives increased agility and stamina would be the result. He knows that a combination of Fennel and Eucalyptus Leaf will grant infra-vision. The Shaman knows his roots and herbs so well that he can make combinations that will transport him, or anyone else, to another part of the world. Yet, apparently, he is too stupid to be able to pluck a berry off a bush or a piece of fruit from a tree. Fool enough not to know a fishing grub when he sees one yet clever enough to mix clover with 2 other ingredients to make a potent damage shield.<br />
<br />
If the Shaman alchemist is a master of herbs, roots and berries why can he not gather something as mundane as tea leaves?<br />
You might think at this point I am asking that Shaman be given the ability to forage their alchemy supplies. While I would welcome that ability with open arms, that is not what I am seeking. I just want to do a little cooking. Would Shaman who could gather their own baking supplies unbalance the game that much? <br />
I think not. <br />
<br />
Please give Shaman the ability to forage <br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they have to fix those backwards doors in wfp again !<br />
<br />
if you wanted forage, you should have been a iksar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Remember the game is interdependent and requires cooperation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">iksar shamans can forage, kinda, think it's capped at 50 skill. <br />
<br />
This game has never and will never be balanced.  Just remember that when starting a whine.  The devs have no interest in balancing it truly either.  That might make for a boring game, after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Forage is what makes the iksar the master race. And now that I have a winterstorm i'll be taking over the world, thx.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Iksar as a race get Forage yeah, and it's capped out at 50. Personally I've never had to buy food or water, and it's been really nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well Ceno... Some of us started the game before you did ;)<br />
<br />
Iksar didn't exist back in the day.... so Forage was not an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail,<br />
<br />
This complaint would have better been addressed in beta, not now.<br />
<br />
We have bigger issues to worry about (slow mitigation/immunity key among my issues) than begging for forage to the developers.<br />
<br />
But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  Mine differs from yours. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd rather see alchemy prices revamped and the top-end items brought to where top-end people (and some midrange folk) will actually buy them.<br />
<br />
Every now and then I still find a critter that &quot;yawns&quot; and keeps on smacking for about the same amount, with no mitigation info.<br />
<br />
I'd love to forage, but I'd love to have a real bash, too.  Or 10 points more ATK / DEF and weap skills, as we're more melee-oriented than the other priests... well we were til clerics got their hammer.<br />
<br />
Oooh, while I'm wishing, can we barbarians have a workable way of going beyond 188 smithing?  Our 1st set of cultural trivials decades before the other cultures do.  This would have helped me heaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i can feel the love</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/hugs<br />
<br />
ok...now for something that actually makes sense. ( btw this means less love :(  )<br />
<br />
alchemy = baking?  /boggle<br />
<br />
Don't all classes have the ability to cook?  Couldn't every class make a good case for getting &lt; insert skill here &gt;?<br />
<br />
Now it would almost make sense if you were asking for forageing for alchemy, but since that would be alittle unbalancing and annoying I thank you for not asking for that :)  Though gotta say foraging a gate potion would be rather nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This was an interesting perspective that someone posted in another discussion, long ago, but it's true any time someone is talking about changes to a class.<br />
<br />
There are two ways to argue for/against an ability for a class - the &quot;roleplaying way&quot; and the &quot;gameplay way&quot;.  The Roleplaying argument is what Iceborn is making.  &quot;Wouldn't it make sense if Shaman could do xxx based on what the class is supposed to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Gameplay argument is &quot;Shaman need xxx because of this gameplay element.&quot;  Gameplay elements would be things like being able to be interdependent with other classes, how they solo, how they group, how they perform on raids, etc.<br />
<br />
If you're trying to get something added to the class, you will NEVER WIN AN ARGUMENT with SOE using the roleplaying argument.  NEVER.<br />
<br />
Their primary task is to balance gameplay issues.  You can argue back and forth how good/bad a job they are doing, but they are not going to give a major new ability to a class just because the class &quot;ought&quot; to be able to do it based on its description.<br />
<br />
The roleplay argument could be used to argue for just about every cleric, druid, and necro skill.  Come up with a solid GAMEPLAY reason for Shaman to have something and you might have better luck.</div></div><hr />
