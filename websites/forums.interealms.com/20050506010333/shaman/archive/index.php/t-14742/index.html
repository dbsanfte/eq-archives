<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seems like they are changing the extended dots to more damage per tick. On test, Extended Affliction IV is now Burning Affliction IV (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3507). Hope its a flat 20% instead of random 1-20%.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Guchu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is a very good thing, as long as it really does just add 20% to the damage done each tick.  It stinks for a 9 tick duration spell to only get one instead of two extra ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That looks like an interesting new change.  Extended Afflicition was useful back when it extended the duration of debuffs for me, but I've always been disappointed with it in regards to dots.<br />
<br />
In order for it to be of any benefit at all, your dot HAD to go full duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, looks like Extended/Burning Affliction is only available on like 3 items.  One of which is one of the pottery items... I can't seem to fit all my focus items in primary/secondary/range :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm this could be interesting.<br />
Looking at the list so far they have only changed the standard affliction x items. If you have one of these changed ones and one of the extend ones under a different name or another item like a crown of ambi you could end up with extended and improved dmg dots. That would rock =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say its more likely they only changed the Extended Affliction X items because they are the most commonly available items for players on Test.   Most likely there are very few Test players with the higher end duration focuses,  this way they can test all levels of play without having to make a bunch of changes to numerous focuses.  I would suspect that after they get the right percentages and dmg increases that either a) they change other higher focuses or b) they return Ext Affliction back to its original form and create the new focus on different items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont know about that, Jaradis. When I was on test the other day I did a /who all 65 and the request was cut short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And?  Just because you are level 65 does not mean you can get to Vex Thal and Elemental Planes.  And really, what does having a bunch of level 65 players have to do with what I said?   They most likely want to test the new focus on all levels of play.  Just because that focus could be balanced for level 65's does not mean that it would be balanced for level 20's with an Extended Affliction II item.   By changing just EAx items they can get nearly the entire level range from 1 to 65 to test these items.  By changing other focuses like those on VT gear, you gain very little because the amount of people having those items will be very small and would add little to the overall picture, and would just be more work that would produce minimal return.</div></div><hr />

Hmm thats funny. Test may not be in PoTime yet but they do have a legitimate guild in the elemental planes that has killed at least some of the elemental gods. Not FoH or AL by any means but hardly that much of a backwater server.<br />
<br />
Also i've found extend affliction 4 items to be rarer than the specially named focuses. Best I can tell there are 3 extend affliction 4 items. 1 is the pottery item from torment which requires drops from the stomach event for the saryrn key. Another is a earring of of saryrn herself and the final is SK elemental arms. Given the popularity of the torment I doubt either one of those is common and I'm definitely not ever going to see a set of sk elemental arms =)<br />
<br />
The VT equivilent focuses are much more likely to be obtained for anyone with a key to the zone than any of the exsisting extend affliction 4 items.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that there are extend durations items that work on dots that AREN'T just extend affliction under a different name. The most common example would be the crown of ambivolence. So even if they did convert all the name changed extend affliction items to add dmg focus's it would still be possible to extend dots with other focuses. Extended enhanced dots are definitely a possibility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I never said Test was a backwater server, I said &quot;Most likely there are very few Test players with the higher end duration focuses, this way (changing just the EAx items and not the higher end items) they can test all levels of play without having to make a bunch of changes to numerous focuses.&quot;.  So how many players on Test have the higher end duration focuses?  20? 30?   Compared to 3000+ people on the server thats &quot;very few&quot;.   <br />
<br />
Now take a look at the EAx items:<br />
<br />
Extended Affliction I:<br />
Allize Volew Medicine Bag<br />
Aviak Charm Jewelry <br />
Golden Ear Stud<br />
Hollowed Bone Bracers<br />
Magician Earring (Test) <br />
<br />
Extended Affliction II:<br />
Kobold-hide Boots <br />
Malignant Ring <br />
Reed Belt <br />
Rogue Bracer (Test) <br />
Serpentine Bracer <br />
Siryn Hair Hood <br />
<br />
Extended Affliction III:<br />
Bone-Clasped Girdle <br />
Bracelet of the Deep Sea <br />
Coldain Military Wristguard <br />
Cryosilk Cap <br />
Robe of Misery <br />
<br />
Extended Affliction IV:<br />
Ceramic Shackles of Torment<br />
Grimror's Sleeves of the Plagues<br />
Miserable Bauble<br />
<br />
<br />
How many people have one of those items on test?  Hundreds, if not thousands.<br />
<br />
So what would you rather do if you were a designer wanting to test the new focus:  Change one line of Focuses that hundreds of people of all levels have and be done?  or change a bunch high end item focuses that would only add another 30-40 people into your test pool?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I'd want to change all of them that I had planned on changing when it went linve. Compairing specific focuses to generic ones pretty much only pertains to level 4 focus items since specificly named one's aren't availble untill you get to VT or beyond. As I said already Extend afliction 4 items have horrible availability. 2 drop in a zone no one does. 1 off an event most people do once to get a tower key and the other off a boss most people do as little as possible. Wouldn't be too surprised if neither of these items actually exsisted on test at all. The third being class armor for sks.<br />
<br />
Either way it doesn't matter. There will be effects to extend dots even if they change all the current dot extension focuses under what ever name they may happen to use. As long as their are focuses that extend all detirmental spells or even all spells like the crown it will be possible to extend and enhance dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CamaenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So anyone been able to test if its a flat 20% or random?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">currently broken on test =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well i assume it adds 20% to ever tick...or thats how it will be intended to work (as the post above i heard it is broken on test).<br />
<br />
As of now lvl65 Blood of Saryn would be 8 ticks of 320 dmg (assuming EA4 item) for a total of 2560.<br />
<br />
If the change goes through and works like I said above lvl65 Blood of Saryn would be 7 ticks of 384 dmg (assuming the new Burning Affliction 4) for a total of 2688.<br />
<br />
So this change is definitely for the better it increases the DPS, rather than just the over all efficiency of the dot(but it still does this as well)....more dmg shorter time....thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Or even better 8 ticks at 384 for a total of 3072<br />
<br />
So you go from 2240 to 3072 with and extend focus (like my crown) and a burning focus combined. That a pretty nice improvement. Now I just need to get a burning affliction if they actually get it working for the next patch =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They have now changed a few more of the dot extenders on test. Still some remaining, mostly those that works on all detrimental spells or all spells like crown of ambivalence.<br />
