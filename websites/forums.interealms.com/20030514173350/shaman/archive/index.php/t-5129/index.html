<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone noticing slows being easier to land since the resist changes?  Like any previously slow difficult mobs being slowable now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I found myself the lucky recipient of C3 last night from a nice Enchanter in the Bazaar, so I decided to be greedy and go to RM instead of back to Spiroc Island (lvl 47). I hadn't been in RM since late 45, but then I was getting resisted about 20-25% of the time pulling with Togors. Killed giants all day today, had nothing resisted in 6 hours. Will report what happens when I get back to TD and Spirocs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One thing I have noticed is that I get far fewer resists on low level mobs. It is SOOOO frustrating to get a resist on Turgurs on a light blue or very low blue. Since the patch, I haven't seen one resist on any mob lower than 56.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taoxek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was slowing shrooms in FG very easily. Maybe one resist in 10.<br />
<br />
<br />
O yeah, this is at level 43. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was able to slow Prince, King and Queen in Chardok yesterday.<br />
(After Malo)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am level 46 and was able to slow the Dire Wolf in MM twice without a resist, once for pulling it to the entrance (without malisement!) and then again when opening the fight 8after malisement stuck).<br />
<br />
Also I noticed that I didn't get a single resist in more than an hour of hunting in CoM (entrance stable, temple).<br />
<br />
So that would be a 'yes' from me.</div></div><hr />
