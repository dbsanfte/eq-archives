<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tuddaan Thunderbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to be able to provide more help to my guild in forming stratagies for large fights.  Currently we are killing every ST Talisman dragon we can find to increase our ST raid force...  Most of the dragons give us little or no problems, but Sonta in front of ToV is another story.  In about 5 attempts we have downed Sonta once.:(  Sonta's fear has little or no impact on us but the CHAR proc is a killer.  <br />
<br />
    If someone has a few killer sites that will lend us a new perspective on these fights, it would be awesome...:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here is how you kill sontalak.<br />
<br />
Main tank way up front, other melee in middle and casters way in back. bow pull sontalak.<br />
Make sure you have plenty of crap buffs up and a clicker. Kill sontalak as fast as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought the way to kill sont was to invite your closest 12 manaburning wizards to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sontalak is pretty much kill-as-fast-as-you-possibly-can.<br />
<br />
It is also based on luck... sometimes he'll AE you to death early, other times he'll be nice and give you a huge expanse of time to wear him down. Either way, you need to go in full damage instantly. The fights I have participated in took probably around two minutes.<br />
<br />
Also, because he dispells himself, try to keep Malo/OOS on him at all times. I noticed that it made a HUGE difference in how well Ice Strike would land.<br />
<br />
Sontalak is really a test of your guild's DPS. If you are having trouble killing him, work on raising that -- with primal, more manaburn-equipped Wizards, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What they said!  Seriously, let the MT go first and give him all of about 2 seconds before engaging.  He probably won't hold agro, but so be it.  Plenty of clerics spread out is a good idea.  Keep maybe 2 or 3 clerics (depending on the size of the guild) on the main tank and spamming divine light or something.  All the rest of the clerics and pally's need to use their group healing spells--word of restoration etc.  Go max offensive right off the bat.  DPS, baby, DPS!<br />
<br />
Good luck to ya.  Sont, IMO, is the hardest of the first brood dragons now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sontalak used to be a powerfire burnfest.<br />
<br />
After the slow change, he was a farmer dragon to be owned once a day for spells and a key.<br />
<br />
Now, for easily 99% of guilds, he's just a big gamble and not worth the hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No one bothers with Sontalak on Drinal now. Too much effort, too little reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heck, he's tougher then most of the NToV dragons! :p</div></div><hr />
