:( The extra AC boost of Rage sure was nice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah changing the stacking with HOS and stat buffs was a slap in the face of Shaman everwhere! (I just like saying that because usually most ranters start off with that). <br />
<br />
Real reason....uhhh....the stat buff were put in LONG before HOS came up. Be happy you have HOS rather than mad they don't stack, sheesh. You will use the stat buffs again when you get the next talisman spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If rage won't stack with HoS, doesn't that sort of go against the &quot;spirit&quot; of having such a self-only buff? I mean, the only really positive aspect of this line of spells was that they would stack with our normal stat buffs. With the short duration and inability to cast spells for 6(?) ticks, there aren't many redeeming qualities for this spell line, EXCEPT that they would stack with our other strength/ac buffs. I can accept, gracefully, the fact that HoS and our regular strength/dex buffs will no longer stack, but if the Rage line won't stack, then those spells may as well not exist. *sigh* I guess I could just cast Altuna, strength, dex and then Rage, if that will work. That's a lot of casting time though that could've been used more productively by just being able to cast HoS and then Rage. It's sad to see a spell line become practically useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, I'd say Rage not stacking with HoS looks like an oversight, as it stacks with all the individual buffs that essentially comprise HoS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, one reason you might have for casting strength and dex again - Talisman of Kragg, a level 55 hitpoint buff.  It doesn't have a built in str or dex bonus.  You dont get focus until 60.<br />
<br />
Since I have so few hitpoints, I go for that quicker than anything else.  Which means - I never, ever cast harness on myself.  I always use Kragg, and then str (rarely dex myself).<br />
<br />
The stacking issues with harness were nice when buffing newb's.  But I could see it coming.  I think most people did.<br />
<br />
But I really hated hos on raids, with rangers around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bummer about rage and harness, thats gonna hurt some of the melee proccing shammies.  Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Verant has been, from day 1, famous for nerfing items, spells, pets, etc etc because they claim it was a bug.  What we really got was other classes bitching that shaman get HoS and you can stack other spells with it (before patch) with the result of great stats.  This was not a bug at all, at first, until the bitching started.  So now you go and buy Verants little speal about it being a bug.  I wish I was as naive as you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm, as I was typing a comment to the EQ Developer's Corner, it occured to me that HoS not stacking with Rage actually makes sense, in that our Dexy buff does not stack with Rage. I guess it's just always seemed inconsistent that the AC, Str, and Agi components of Rage are stackable, while Dex is not, but (if it's not just a mistake) I can only assume that someone doesn't want us to be proccing fools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">But Mangler, doesn't it seem clear that HoS was intended as a &quot;convenience&quot; spell, with some minor advantages (longer duration, slightly less total mana and casting time), so that Shaman wouldn't have to spend as much time memming and casting buffs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Higher dex also seems to be able to increase your ability to cast through hits, and avoid being stunned... so I would say harness not stacking with rage is big time nerfage (  I don't think there is much concern about shammies becoming proc machines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If focus doesnt stack normally (no clue if there are exploit stacking or not) with dex and str buffs, why would you think harness should?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think taking 3 spells, combining them into 1 handy spell (with the EXACT same stat adjustements) and then making sure that you can't stack with any of the 3 original spells makes a lot of sense.  It was a bug.  Deal with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wish I was as naive as you are.<br />
I wish I was as bitter and unhappy as you are (especially playing a game made by people I hate).  <br />

I never mentioned anything about Rage either, I never use it, although I do have it.  My statement is in regards to HoS, Strength and Dex.  What I see is a naive person, like Snapdragon, that is so ready to buy into anything that Verant says.  Do you trust the government too Snap?  I bet you do.<br />
<br />
In regards to the game and using HOS, only time I used it was to buff the 'newb' level players that always ask me for a power level.  It was fun watching them say, OMG upon noticing the stats they now had.<br />
<br />
Snapdragon I think its you that needs the counceling.  So ready to bash, so ready to believe, so NAIVE.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Last I checked, and this was before I was 60, Voice of the Berserker was the only in the 'rage' line that stacked with Focus or Harnessing. Every other one was overwritten by Focus/HoS. This was an issue I petitioned immediately after VI first announced that they'd 'fixed' the stacking issue with Voice and Focus. You'd think they could fix the rest of the spell line.<br />
<br />
As for dex/str stacking with HoS, HoS gives dex and str. Focus doesn't stack with Maniacal Strength or Mortal Deftness. It doesn't make sense for HoS to stack with these buffs.<br />
<br />
Mangler, get a grip. You're coming across as a Shamanic Ted Kazinski.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I never said I hated the game did I? I don't.<br />
That's correct, you never said you hated the game.  I apologize for putting words in your mouth.  My mistake.<br />
<br />
I never mentioned anything about Rage either, I never use it, although I do have it.<br />
Neither did I.  Rage isn't even part of the discussion.  HoS is Str, Dex and HPs.  Which is exactly what I addressed in my previous post.  Go back and re-read it please.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I see is a naive person, like Snapdragon, that is so ready to buy into anything that Verant says.<br />
It's much less stressful that way.  I can't change it anyways, so what does it matter?  Are you going to /petition, or maybe go to the Fan Faire and rant and rave from the audience? /snicker<br />
<br />
Do you trust the government too Snap? I bet you do.<br />
I work for the government. Is that a bad thing?  Careful...I'm coming to get you ! ;)<br />
<br />
In regards to the game and using HOS, only time I used it was to buff the 'newb' level players that always ask me for a power level. <br />
A lvl 51 shaman who never casts HoS on his groupmates or guildies?  LOL.  You need to get your money back from the guy you ebayd your account from.  What do you buff your melees with? Talisman of Jasinth?  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">harness/rage did stack.. they don't now.  I almost always had these two buffs on me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree snapdragn concerning the stackability issues.<br />
<br />
Not a big rage user, but would agree that rage/HoS stacking should be looked at as a new bug. Rage is self-only for a short duration and does have a mana-regen drawback, so I don't view its use with HoS as being a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Rage and harness not stacking most likely is due to the dex component.  Rage didnt stack with dex, and harness provides dex.<br />
<br />
As to Mangler, settle down.  HoS is your friend.  Listen to people that respond to your rambling with actual logic.<br />
<br />
1) Focus (str, dex, hp) never stacked with str or dex.  It was released with velious.<br />
2) Harness (str, dex, hp) is a lesser version of Focus and is in the same line as focus.  It was released with luclin, *after* focus.  Hence, logically it should not stack with str or dex as Focus never did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I work for the government.<br />
<br />
Don't we all? :-P<br />
<br />
HoS is a good spell when the Shaman is Levels 49-54. After that point, there may be situations where it's cast over the individual buffs (i.e., if I were duoing with a Necromancer or Magician I'd probably drop it on the pet since pets seem to have a way of dying right after you just cast 800-mana-worth of buffs on them, not to mention finicky pet classes and their &quot;this pet sucks I'm going to summon a new one&quot; ways).</div></div><hr />

An interesting situation. Rage/VoB used to stack with Harness/Focus because the former is a DEX-based buff and the latter is HP-based (attribute 1). Now they made it so that Harness/Focus is still HP-based but also blocks out the STR and DEX slots. Typical Verant kludge if you ask me. They didn't even think about Rage/VoB. It looks like the reason for VoB still stacking with everything (including Focus) is that the STR component is higher (which normally wouldn't make sense for a DEX-based buff, but now that Harness/Focus ties them all together, it might explain it). Can anyone confirm that the actual stat increases on VoB and Focus stack now, or is it just the buff icons (with VoB's higher STR and DEX overwriting those of Focus)?</div></div><hr />

I did it this way for my Warrior (255 STR, 201 DEX). Now it's gone. No biggy.<br />

I'll just use Kragg + STR + DEX now. More HP, lower STR/DEX, but again...no biggy.<br />

Dexterity- 100 mana <br />
Altuna-250 mana <br />
<br />
HoS-450 mana <br />
<br />
Nope- check it out (http://lucy.fnord.net/) - in either case you get 67 STR, 50 DEX, and 250 HP.  HoS lasts for 72 minutes... STR/DEX last for only 63, and Altuna lasts for 72... so HoS actually gives the same stat benefits and the STR/DEX parts last a few minutes longer, for the same mana.<br />
<br />
Since HoS doesn't stack with Rage anymore, though, the new max buff config (at 50) is probably:<br />
<br />
Strength (67 strength, 63 minutes, 100 mana)<br />
Altuna (250 HP, 72 minutes, 250 mana)<br />
Stamina (40 stamina, 63 minutes, 100 mana)<br />
Agility (45 agility, 63 minutes, 100 mana)<br />
Guardian (24 AC, 63 minutes, 100 mana)<br />
Rage (51 strength, 52 agility, 52 dexterity, 18 AC,  16 minutes, 100 mana)<br />
<br />
Total:  118 strength, 40 stamina, 52 dexterity, 97 agility, 42 AC (before agility effects), 250 raw HP (before stamina effects)</div></div><hr />

Basically this &quot;nerf&quot; just gave me 2 extra buff slots.  If the stacking doesn't work, they won't demand.<br />

They may not be able to proc as much anymore but hell, this just relieved me of a huge headache having to make sure HoS was on first before I casted etc etc.  On large raiding parties - its a pain.<br />

I definately would like to see Rage stack with HoS and FoS though.  The new stacking rules turned a perfectly good spell into a waste at the worst and a pain at the best.<br />
