<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I load up the old shaman crucible site, and I'm about to click on the general forum, when the number to the right catches my eye...  150,000.  on the dot.  <br />
<br />
I just thought that was an amazing accomplishment for our little board here to have 150 thousand posts just in the general forum alone.  Anyway, gratz to all you long time posters here for dolling out such great (and apparently numerous) pearls of wisdom.<br />
<br />
...Back to your regularly scheduled posting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ouch... I got a negative rep bump for posting this???<br />
<br />
Brutal.  Guess I'll keep my silly observations to myself.  Sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The neg bump probably came from someone thinking you were talking about your own post count or something. And yes I think 150K posts for the site is pretty sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
This site has suffered at least two complete wipes that I recall, and one 'planned' wipe where some of the better posts were able to be saved.  Several of the really good older guides in the hunting forum (mainly in the 30-50 range) have been lost because the authors who wrote them either out-levelled that area, weren't into rewriting their hunting ground 'masterpiece' a 3rd time, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm not aware if the post counter reflects those wiped posts (I would tend to doubt it) or not.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">150k posts! Wow. When you stop and think about that, the amount of knowledge and information-sharing and suggestions and ... Staggering. <br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why are people checking rep points anyways?  I don't think I have looked at that like ever.  Don't even know where....Been using mozilla for a while to dispense with the ads and annoying sigs, most of the rep stuff don't work I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">actually, I had noticed my little green Icon under my name had turned grey...  Checked it out and found out that it meant I had negative rep bumps (-1).<br />
<br />
Just being curious, I did a search for posts I had made and checked them out.  I was thinking it might have been on of my more opinionated posts on the grey or something (no biggie, I expected it there) and was kind of shocked when I discovered that someone actually spent their time giving a negative rep bump for an observation about the sites post count.<br />
<br />
Just thought it was a silly thing to do...  I have lurked here (I don't do much at work but surf this site) since october and have read just about every post since then, and I honestly have only seen like 3 posts that I thought were worthy of a negative rep bump (troll posts after the proposal came out...  A few people were trying to annoy the posters here because of our post on TNZ).  I was just amazed that people wasted their time dolling them out for something so inconsequential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rookz - don't let it bother you.   Rep points are very subjective.  I received neg points once because I commented that someone posting about training someone by name wasn't classy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edited due to the i before e except after c thing (received vs recieved)... I always get that wrong.   Guess it's why I'm a Troll ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOL<br />
<br />
Ok, here's a fun self hijack... What's the silliest  (sp?) thing you got a negative rep bump for?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've received some negative rep bumps with witty comments like 'moron' for disagreeing in threads that are whining about how gimped shaman are.  I think giving a negative rep bump simply for disagreeing with someone else's opinion is very silly.<br />
<br />
I'd also imagine that with the current whiney and negative overall feeling at this forum that you're more likely to get a negative bump if you get any bump at all until everyone stops being so generally upset.<br />
<br />
The rep system itself is silly because it's not moderated and people can arbitrarily throw around positive and negative rep bumps for no logical reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've gotten quite a few negative rep bumps for disagreeing with the majority about shaman balance.<br />
<br />
I also got a negative rep bump for my post on this thread: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?postid=223143#post223143 .  The comment was &quot;stupidest thing you've said to date&quot;.  Well, if that is the stupidest thing I ever say in my life, I'll consider myself a lucky man :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got a really wierd rep bump too.  I said &quot;nice tip&quot; to someone saying how he uses VP to pull mobs.  My rep bump said &quot;lies, stupid post!.&quot;  <br />
Hehe thanks whoever did it, gave me a good laugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ok here comes a negative rep bump...............I'm curious as to where this is, and where you go to check it...I knew it existed, but never knew where you can see the comments and stuff.</div></div><hr />
