<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What's more than likely to happen is that the pure melee character will have to turn the no drop items in theirselves to get the skill.  Nothing will be given (like spells), so that only melee will roll on the skill giving items.  Which basically screws the casters that have to fight with the melee rolling on parchments and runes to get their spells.<br />
<br />
Or, in their infinite wisdom, SOE will just make it where the melee use parchments and runes to get their skills so that they don't have to add something else entirely to the game.  Which also screws casters out of spells.</div></div><hr />

/chuckle<br />
<br />
Just like casters and priests rolling on melee gear and so on and so forth back to the days of gebs and the fbss .....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It's a vicious cycle.<br />
<br />
Kunark brought alot of melee items and casters rolled on (damn the enchanter who won an RBB against my friend because &quot;there aren't any caster items&quot;)<br />
<br />
Velious and Luclin were decent, I guess, in terms of items that dropped. Casters got spells and melee got some neat weps.<br />
<br />
PoP comes around and it's a total screw-over for pure melee. We didn't get anything, and as such, a few of us wanted something to walk away from our groups with, so we asked to roll on parchments, and you said ok.<br />
<br />
Now we will give you your parchments, just give us our tomes kthx ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">What if the melee turn-in system isn't random?  If they can get a NO DROP tome and turn it in for a requested skill?  Course that would be very easy then, but it wouldn't be very annoying at all.  Which leads me to believe it will be at random, and that the resultant skill &quot;spells&quot; will be tradeable.  Just like the PoP spells.  <br />
<br />
One thing that's good, with both melees and casters having things that they desperately NEED from a group, there shouldn't be much griping when the loot rules go NBG.  After all, none of those warriors, rogues, or monks want to take the chance that they won't get a skill that drops.  <br />
<br />
IMHO it would be finally fair.  The melees got off SOOO easily in PoP, having no spells to find, and all skills and improved abilities being just handed to them upon levels/AAs.  Casters had to really sweat it to find their spells.  LoY too, melees had nothing to buy other than armor and upgrades, while casters had as much as 2500 points worth of SPELLS to buy, before they could even consider buying gear or focus upgrades.  I applaud this change as a fair deal for once, where both melees and casters finally have an equal assignment of work.  Spells have always been a gigantic timesink for casters, while melee have nothing equivalent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I dunno. My Warrior was not high enough to get anything handed to him when PoP came out, but all the fuss over Melees needing a fix was because they got nothing but coal in their stockings in PoP, LoY, and LDoN relative to Hybrids, Priests and Casters who got not only gear possibilities, but spells as well. (The usefulness of said spells being a whole other topic)<br />
<br />
I've never been a group where a melee rolled on a parchment. If you're fighting in PoP as a Melee (Talking about the open zones only here), you go in knowing the score...that you ain't gonna get jack but experience unless you kill a named and get lucky on a roll. Only time my Warrior picked up a parchment was EPs that no one else wanted in BoT, so I got them for my 60 Shaman.<br />
<br />
I think working the new turn-in system the same way as PoP parchments will be the way they go. Not perfect, but what in life is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm a NBG person; whether group is guild, pick-up, or friends, I prefer the item go to classes that can and will USE it over somebody who'd sell it or use it for an alt.<br />
<br />
If your monk goes into a grp saying &quot;I'd like to roll on shaman stuff&quot; that's cool.  To roll on a parchment and then claim NBG on an Entwood Mace is something I've seen in too many variations lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Worlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think people are failing to realize how much melee classes will be screwed over if they require a turn in type thing, like parchments and runes, to get their skills.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way:<br />
<br />
Warriors/Monks/Rogue are all based on their equipment, their equipment is what they spend all their money on and it is what defines them as a class.  The way they utilize their equipement defines them as a player.<br />
<br />
Hybrids are a mix of spells and gear, they can go heavy in one, and light in the other, and still maintain a balance in their class.<br />
<br />
Casters are based entirely on spells.  Their gear allows them to utilize their spells, but their spells define how they are able to play.<br />
<br />
Now, throw this into the mix:<br />
<br />
Warriors having skills gained from a turn in type system, with possible MQ options similar to caster spells, will result in a HUGE screwing over to melee classes.  Not only will they now have to continue to pay out the ass for good gear and upgrades, but they will also have to pay out the ass for new skills.<br />
<br />
Bad idea IMO</div></div><hr />

<br />
HINT: Melees didn't get any new skills or abilities with pop(outside of aa, which we all get stuff from for grinding out the exp). They didn't even get reductions in disc timers for levels 61-65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">And I don't think any melee can say they spent 650pts for a 70dps upgrade... *coughbanecough*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Beeg, if LDoN offered melee classes anything even remotely close to a 70 DPS upgrade, you could bet your ass they would be fighting to get it. <br />
<br />
I dont think you know enough about the history of EQ to know what you got with Bane. Since EQ was released about 4 years ago, and raiding started about 3 years ago, shaman discovered that in more and more situations, none of their nukes or DoTs would land. This was especially true for boss mobs, but not only boss mobs. For years shaman pleaded for something they could cast that would allow them to feel useful on those raids. Shaman also pleaded for a DoT that didnt do DD damage when it landed since if the DD was resisted. so was the DoT. With the release of PoP, DoTs without the initial DD portion came into existance. Unfortunately for many shaman, these required farming glyphed runes, which were simply not available to them for a very long time. But these new DoTs were still continuations of the previous poison and disease lines. Finally, with LDoN, we get a very nice DoT that is magic based. And from my experience with it, its resisted less than the poison based DoTs against experience mobs I have fought against. Im not real thrilled by the 24 second recast, but when you are fighting a mob, and you see that your dots are doing 420 dmg and 320 dmg per tick, you can sit back and smile some. And it appears to land on many of the boss mobs that we previously could not land anything on. Magic Resistance is almost always debuffed the most on mobs. And except for the small number that are extremely magic resistant, Bane should prove to be one of our best DoTs ever.<br />
<br />
I group in LDoN with my rogue primarily because I cannot find groups in the elemental planes. There is NOTHING in LDoN that I want. There is NOTHING in LDoN that would be a serious upgrade for me. I will probably eventually buy vengence III and IV augments, but I am in no rush to.<br />
<br />
The reason is that SoE screwed the monkey in LDoN. We are expected to repeatedly fight in the same dungeons to earn points to buy the augments, and once we apply the augment to one of our items, we can NEVER move that augment to another item. Now how many people do you know that will NEVER upgrade their gear that actually play this game? Yep, so now you get an upgrade, and all those hours you put into fighting in LDoN goes up in smoke. Poof. Adios. Buhbye. And the SoE devs sit back snickering and whispering &quot;Suckers!&quot; You get screwed for upgrading your gear if you have augmented the item being upgraded.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you will always have your Bane spell. It might not be the top of the line DoT for you once the next expansion comes out, but you will still have it, and still be able to use it, even if you get a better DoT.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you think 5svMagic/Cold/Fire is something really  useful, you really dont understand the mechanics of this game well at all. My rogue runs around with all but 1 resist at over 200 unbuffed, and greenies still land things on him. Resists are a freaking joke in EQ.<br />
<br />
HINT: Melees didn't get any new skills or abilities with pop(outside of aa, which we all get stuff from for grinding out the exp). They didn't even get reductions in disc timers for levels 61-65.True. And after looking at the initial numbers for the upcoming pure melee changes, we still wont have anything. The numbers they are using right now wont even get close to adding even 1% to our DPS.<br />
<br />
Then look at things from my perspective. All of my combat skills are maxed out, except for hand to hand, which I never, ever use. STR/DEX/STA are maxed out at 305 unbuffed. AGI is maxed out at 305 buffed. Will I need to go back to PoValor and start killing trash mobs there in an effort to gain some of these new &quot;skills&quot;? Are some of these tomes (which are required to learn the skill) only going to drop in the elemental planes? Only in the Plane of Time? Only off of god mobs? Making melee that are already maxed out on all combat skills and damned near finished with all AA's go back and farm tomes is pretty fooking stupid. They need to give those of us that have maxed out our skills the new ones. If you want to make new toons work to learn these skills, fine. But I smell a stinking rat coming to the game on Dec 16th.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have a problem with them fixing pure melee.  I have a problem with them using the same broken, fubar distrubution system as they do with our spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Thank you for proving my point for me. I didn't figure I had to type all that for it to kick in.<br />
<br />
Bane is quite possibly the coolest thing I've ever memmed. On some of the bosses in VT I'm pulling close to the same damage as the better melees and slowing/rebuffing/FAing.<br />
<br />
Anyone who wants to play down the usefulness of Bane (for 650pts) and thinks they're getting screwed needs to take a long hard look at the 1450pts a melee pays for a LORE 20atk aug. What's the average again? 10atk = 1% dps?<br />
<br />
my sympathies go out to all the poor shaman that wasted their 650 points on a 70dps upgrade. I know the those bad bad melees get it so easy because they can afford the 20hp/20mana augs before you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">&quot;Making melee that are already maxed out on all combat skills and damned near finished with all AA's go back and farm tomes is pretty fooking stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
No one handed me the LOY scrolls when it was released, I don't see your point I guess. The main issue here is that casters and definitely priests have had to approach the game from an equipment AND spells approach. Melee's have not other then hybrids.<br />
<br />
One thing shaman in particular have always mourned was the ridiculuous price of spells for our class, on an item that could never ever be sold again. Melee's on the other hand usually can upgrade and sell.<br />
<br />
Never intended this to be a anti-melee thread, only one where melee's who never played a high level caster will now understand how unfair the market treats certain classes. Now all the classes need a) equipment and b) un-resellable spells or skills. So an equilibrium of sorts has been reached.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">my sympathies go out to all the poor shaman that wasted their 650 points on a 70dps upgrade.

<br />
<br />
Yeah. So how many points did you spend on anger augments for your weapons? How about for the +dmg augments for them?<br />
<br />
It goes both ways, melee have to spend points on gear to be more effective(at least their points are useful..bane? I haven't and never plan on wasting the points for that one).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">We are expected to repeatedly fight in the same dungeons to earn points to buy the augments, and once we apply the augment to one of our items, we can NEVER move that augment to another item.

On the other hand, you will always have your Bane spell. It might not be the top of the line DoT for you once the next expansion comes out, but you will still have it, and still be able to use it, even if you get a better DoT.<br />
<br />
The point that I think some are trying to make is that casters pay Adventure points or PP for spells that they can never resell and they will get upgrades to (as long as Sony makes expansions).  So, you name one item that as a melee class, you have paid 60k for that you cannot resell?  I suppose multiquesting for a no drop item could count in this case, but that is not exclusive to melees, so that voids it in this argument.  Also, Augments are not exclusive to melee's.  Do you think that casters will buy augments for their items and then never find an upgrade for those items?  With all of the focus effects and hp/mana regen that can be found on equipment now, equipment is nearly as important to casters as it is to melees. <br />
<br />
For once there is going to be something roughly equivalent to spells added for melees.  Most of them according to Sony will be available from merchants up to level 60.  This is better than spells because for shaman's at least, 16 of the 42 spells between 51-60 are purchased from merchants.  The other 62% of your 51-60 spells are either dropped, quested, or bought with adventure points. Meaning you will either have to drag people to old, unappealing content to get your spells, or pay 20-50k for the rarer spells that you are guaranteed to get upgrades for.  According to Sony the 61-65 melee tomes will be acquired in a way similar to the 61-65 spell parchments and runes, and someone actually sees this as unfair?</div></div><hr />

Meaning you will either have to drag people to old, unappealing content to get your spells, or pay 20-50k for the rarer spells that you are guaranteed to get upgrades for. According to Sony the 61-65 melee tomes will be acquired in a way similar to the 61-65 spell parchments and runes, and someone actually sees this as unfair?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Its perfectly fair if the power of the abilities are as powerful as those spells casters get.  We both know thats not going to happen. So I do hope they are far easier to get than spells that I am betting will stay far more powerful. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mellee are far more reliant on gear  and others than any casting class as well, acting like casters have suffered because they have to quest/buy their spells is silly. Lets not even metion how much easier it is for casting classes to farm platinum over pure mellee.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:- to those who are giggling with glee that they get to roll against mellee for these because some ass stiffed you before, hope I never group with you. I cannot even remember one group in POP where my group forced a caster to roll on a spec/rune unless they insisted or they did not need it. I have never looted a rune or a spectral parchement on my char. Looted a few etherals because they were going to rot. I hope the favor gets returned to me but if not oh well, whatever, not going to get bitter over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Yeah. So how many points did you spend on anger augments for your weapons? How about for the +dmg augments for them?<br />
<br />
It goes both ways, melee have to spend points on gear to be more effective(at least their points are useful..bane? I haven't and never plan on wasting the points for that one).<br />
AngerIII doesn't work for Rogues/Monks. &quot;Radiant Permafrost&quot; from Everfrost for 760pts works out to be about 5dps.<br />
<br />
+dmg augs don't go in ANY of the existing weapons unless you're doing Time raids.<br />
<br />
And if you think Bane is useless you should ask the nurse to double your meds.</div></div><hr />

&quot;They fix something and people still b.itc.h.<br />
<br />
First, to assume that this will 'fix' melee is the heigh of hubris. If SoE has shown ANYTHING over the past four years it is that not too much is 'fixed' (unless you are a male dog) and a lot is broken post patch.<br />
<br />
Second, without any parsing or testing, again to assume that this will 'fix' melee is boggling.<br />
<br />
Finally, the fact that a TIME-SINK is introduced to fix THREE classes is...well typical I suppose. <br />
<br />
Perhaps an undoing of the Monk nerf of 13 months ago, better itemization, and a fix to Warrior taunt would solve a lot of problems. Or at least be a start. Call me crazy, but I sort of like that idea better than competing for drops. (And yes I do see the comparison to spells. At this point I believe many more should be vendor sold)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">point taken, pure melees weren't given enough goodies to pursue with LDoN.  Sure they can augment their weapons and armor to add damage, vengeance, regen, hps, resists, and any stat (free) they can think of.  Sure they can add aggro procs or nuke procs to weapons to make themselves more effective.  But each upgrade kinda takes a lot of points.  It's hard or something.  And the whole thing with losing augs on gear you upgrade does kinda stink, I guess.  <br />
<br />
But still, casters have to spend it on spells first, before considering those equipment upgrades.  Puts us a bit behind the others in respect to gear.  I had to pay 800 for RGC, 650 for Bane, and about 250 for those worthless trap disarming spells.  So I figure I'm exactly 1700 points behind a melee, just to get the spells I need to function at a competent level at my level.  Me showing up without spells is like a melee showing up naked or without a decent weapon.  <br />
<br />
Point is, casters maybe appear to get more &quot;cool stuff&quot; sometimes, but we sure pay through the ass for it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the cost of on Blade of Carnage, I can buy every level 65 shaman spell on just about any server...If you shop you can probably get every level 61-65 spell for that price even...<br />
<br />
But then look at a warrior... Even with EB weapons, which are very dependant upon the RNG, they need to first get an Anger3 augment, 1150 pts. So that MAybe, just Maybe they can get lucky and hold some aggro. The next Most usefull augment that they can get, will be a 40 hp augment that also costs 1150... And to really be effective they need 5 of these, so thats 6900 pts for a little more aggro and 200hp's...I can guarantee that Bane is a much better buy and more useful for the 650 pts than the 6900 pts the warrior spends...<br />
<br />
What the melee fix will do is this... It will give the Devs a way that they can implement upgrades and new things for melee. When was the last time melee actually got something new, that everyone else didn't?  Disciplines? which are what 3 years old? What else did melee get? AA's everyone has them, casters get almost every one of the 'BEST' melee  AA's CS/CA/ND/LR/ID....  What have casters got? Spells, Focus Effects, better and better mana regen(FT-KEI-VoQ-Mounts-SD)? This system gives melee's a lot more options in combat, thats it, it wont be massive dps upgrades, it wont make casters obsolete. <br />
<br />
As far as the parch/rune distribution system? I cannot for the life of me see why any caster could ever complain about this system. It is by far the very best and fairest way that has ever been used to distribute dropped spells. eth/spec/runes drop in zones that are accessable easilly by people of the right level. and with a few flags, they start dropping like candy. compare that to the Ancient spells of Luclin/Velious, or spells that only drop in keyed/locked zones (Primal Avatar?) or that are drops only from high end boss mobs EER?... The new spell distribution is the best it ever has been...<br />
<br />
You didnt see Melee complain when each expansion that casters get new spells, they compalined that they were ignored. Finally they wont be ignorred anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">+dmg augs don't go in ANY of the existing weapons <br />
<br />
<br />
They go in ldon weapons. I guess you're thinking a 16/19 backstabber wouldn't be worth any rogue's time.<br />
<br />
And yes, bane would not be worth 1/4 of the points it costs. It's extremely situational and resistable, and if that weren't enough you can only keep it on one mob at a time(unless it's resisted, then you can't keep it on anything for 30 more seconds).<br />
<br />
I can save myself the points and just not mem a spell slot. Then it's just like I have bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">True, all Priests and Casters have to get both spells and equipment, but it's stated over and over here that it's not even in the same ballpark important for a Shaman to save their money for their 61-65 spells instead of buying gear when in that level range, because with spells comes the true power of a magic-using class. A BoC is just about the same upgrade to a Warrior's abilities as Q is for a Shaman, yet a person could get every level 65 spell and have at least 100k left over for the same cost of a BoC, at least on Povar.<br />
<br />
Again, I actually think that the new system if it is brought live as advertised will actually put things on a relatively balanced scale. Sure some Elemental and Time Melee may have to do a little farming of first and second tier zones. Well, all classes had to farm their LoY spells, and they had to run and adventure in every dungeon to get all their LDoN spells. I'm sure not a ton of level 65 Shaman went all out to get the lower level Curse spells, they concentrated on Bane and perhaps Anamatha. Melees will also be able to pick and choose which tomes they feel are worthwhile to go back and farm based on their personal needs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL yeah, ok, whatever. Bane is a major kick ass spell. Malos debuffs for it. Its barely ever resisted at the EP level, and it does a TON of damage pretty fast. Even useful in LDoN when you aren't in a group with a Mezzer. Park an add, drop Bane on it, its half dead before the group gets there.<br />
<br />
I has slowly made its way into most of my spell-sets, despite the refresh time. Well worth the 650.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">The entire Ornate armor line?<br />
<br />
Ornate is not exclusive to melee's.  I know there are not alot of things exclusive to melee's, but I am trying to make the point that everything a melee spends money on that they cannot resell, casters have their equivalent.  Casters however must spend hundreds of thousands of plat for spells that they cannot resell, and that will be eventually replaced by something better (as long as Sony makes expansion packs as I said before).   <br />
<br />
Quote:-&quot;I suppose multiquesting for a no drop item could count in this case, but that is not exclusive to melees, so that voids it in this argument.&quot;<br />
<br />
Um name one thing currently in this entire game that is exclusive to mellees. This is not a good comparison at all.<br />
<br />
Disciplines are melee/hybrid exclusive.  They are also free to melees and hybrids, unlike spells.  Some disciplines I see as very useful and powerful, such as duelist for rogues, defensive for warriors, and I'm sure there are some other handy disciplines for the other melee classes as well.    <br />
<br />
For the cost of on Blade of Carnage, I can buy every level 65 shaman spell on just about any server...If you shop you can probably get every level 61-65 spell for that price even...<br />
<br />
Are there any upgrades to a Blade of Carnage, or do you think there ever will be?  If you came across one, would you resell yours?  Caster's cannot resell their spells, ever.  <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to say that melee's have not had it hard for a long time, I played a rogue to 58, and then my guild fell apart and all of my friends stopped playing, so I had no regular group to play with and as a casual gamer that meant my leveling hit a brick wall.  That was the reason I quit playing EQ the last time, I could not solo as a melee, and I could never find a group at the times I could play (2:00 am est-5 am est usually).  I also noticed that while I was playing a pure melee, I always had money.  I was always able to resell my equipment as I got upgrades and I was always making a little money each time I played.  <br />
<br />
As a caster I am always having to dedicate most of my money towards spells, and my adventure points towards spells, and I will eventually have to again spend money and adventure points on the upgrades to those spells.  This is all before I can even think buying equipment, because as everyone knows spells for a caster are more important than equipment.  I agree with the people here saying that spells are more powerful than anything melees have at this point, but that is hopefully what Sony is trying to fix with these new endurance based abilities.  If they do manage to fix it, then I think that the plan they have for the way they will be distributed (most of the 20-60 tomes from merchants, and the 61-65 tomes from turnins similar to parchments and runes) is a very fair way for it to be done. <br />
<br />
I'm at work so I'm having trouble concentrating, but hopefully that all made sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">There is some degree of truth to the spells+gear arguement here, everyone has to admit it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Comparing melee gear to caster spells is a bit off, I agree. A more accurate comparison would be a melee's weapons to a caster's spells.<br />

You don't even want to go there. First of all, you didn't have to pay anything for RGC if you didn't want to. I know I'm not the only person out there who's made several of these through research. <br />
<br />
Secondly, if you compare your spells to the cost of a completed melee weapon, the melee class actually has to pay more than you did.</div></div><hr />
