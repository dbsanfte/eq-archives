hmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">he didn't get experience for the kill, so either he had a puller that was too far away or he had him gotten low by some friends who zoned so that he could get the screenshot of being single in tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, but a simple /who charname will get you the same /who results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe not that I care either way but , would he have gotten exp if he was FD when VZ died?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lauron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If it works like monk Fd's, solo, you dont get xp.  Thats The way monks PL stuff.   Beat it low, FD, let lowbie kill it.  I'm guesing with the dots, VZ would just die, and no one would be awarded xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get exp, if pet or dot kills, no faction hit if pet kills. When FD that is. We can PL the same way, send pet till 12-15%, call pet off, FD, have PLe kill for full exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also as pointed out by another Necro, this Nec was using embracing darkness instead of the new desecrating darkness. Tiny mana increase, almost double the damage same resists and cast time, and you know he has it because he is using fang of death, and DD comes before Fang of death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">but on a side note....who's gonna give this a try? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's already easily duo'd by shm+melee.  It's just a matter of gear till shaman solo.  I'm sure a few of our top number could already manage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">don't you have to be able to pull just the real VZ? how would a shaman solo this, by tanking all of vz's at once?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, by pulling one at a time, killing it, and going on to the next one.  Didn't say it'd be fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">most big mobs that get solo'd take ALOT of time....I remember the monk who solo'd bristlebane took like 4 1/2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They're social and aggro. <br />
<br />
This is easily duoed (easily if you have the gear, ie 7k+hps unbuffed and your defensive AAs) with a good Cleric, by leaving your body in a corner, running through the fake VZs to see which one casts with a rezbox in front of you. Now that you know which one it is, get another rezbox, root the one you want (yes, they're rootable) train the others into the corner, accept rez box, singlepull the real one, rinse and repeat. It takes FFE, but it can be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">uh, more like 12, Theodr.  That mob took like 40min for a full group to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">maybe it was naggy that took 4+ hours..../shrug I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
but the point is the same, if you're gonna kill big mobs....and by big, I mean older raid mobs, expect to put some time into it....<br />
<br />
any idea on the time it took for the necro to do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You can pet-pull the VZ clones solo to kill them all one by one.  Carries the same risks pet pulling always does, but it can be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">rezz box no longer wipes aggro, niether does CotH for that exact reason Beth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Man, if I hadn't quit I would have liked to have given this a shot.<br />
<br />
I dunno if I could make it up there solo though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hell. I'll give it a shot. Pet pull should work just fine if I can get conviction on pup-pup before going in and root-rot carefully along the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Not saying it can not be done. I am sure it can, and after posting on the Nec boards someone will get it done real soon, but look at his UI, he has 76% exp reg and 51% exp AA in all screenshots. He got no exp, and that rules out it being scrolled past, or messages turned of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Okay, the Nec that did this finally showed up on Nec boards, where he is a regular. He also posted a screenie that showed the exp message. I respect him, and know a lot of the other solo stuff he has done. Looks to be 100% real.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>bearage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just want to remind you guys that the script resets if the real Vallon Zek isn't killed in 20 minutes in each wave.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Bearage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Real VZ only needs to be brought down to 60% to spawn next wave so he's actually only killed once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bearage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Don't split hairs lol - you know what I mean.  You have 20 mins to get the first down to % hp, then a bit lower on next one, then again lower and finally kill.  20 mins each wave or BUST.<br />
<br />
Bearage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">level 70 necromancers do a LOT of damage, sir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">maybe it was naggy that took 4+ hours..../shrug I could be wrong.<br />
It was Bristlebane, if you're referring to Irontaail.  He soloed Bristlebane down to 60 or 70%, figured it would take him about 12 hours to get the kill solo so he called in a guild druid to help him.  It still took a number of hours to finish him off.<br />
<br />
The druid bound himself in PoM and was porting from PoM to BB to manastone back mana (manastone only works in old world zones) then gating back to PoM.  Bristlebane was only regenning 1HP/tic, so he could be fungi kited.<br />
<br />
Irontaail's site is still up.  Read all about it here (http://www.planeofmischief.com/bb.htm) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>necrognomicon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Took me and three necro's 6 hours to kill lirah the bridgekeeper hehe, plus a bard who ran around in circles for 6 hours! Could do it in 3 but ho hum was fun figuring it out, best kill i've ever done. Plus the legs dropped for my shaman which was cool.</div></div><hr />
