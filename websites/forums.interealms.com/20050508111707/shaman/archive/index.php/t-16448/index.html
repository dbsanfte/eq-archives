<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is annoying me now, got 3 bits, the demutilated Thumb, the demutilated finger, and the arm just missing the glove. Went pretty deep in East Wing, so far all solo, and due to some unlucky pathing died and could not really think about trying again as had been working around all day and was just tired of the place. The question is the container is it behind Drusellas room? Also If I am to fight there, and say I took a divine aura item with me, could I divine aura myself to get it or would the door behind be locked?<br />
Would be appreciative of an answer, its amazing how many people are clueless about HS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chebsis_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The glove is in Drusella's room, in the back left corner as you go into it(looks like a big bag).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So will I need a key to go into Drusellas room? Ie I am asking will I need a rogue, because so far have all the norent keys from soloing. Thx for reply btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chebsis_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You won't need a key to get to Drusella's room, the east door at zone in is unlocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>M. B'fang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, pardon my n00bness, however I believe the bag spawns in the room with the Morterferious Golem, not Drusella's room.  Please note that I never went on a Drusella raid, nor was she up at the time of my crawl, however several maps indicate that Drusella spawns in the room just before the exit portal, whereas the glove pops in the far left of the room just before her which houses the aforementioned golem.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The glove is on the ground past Drusilla if she were to be up. The room is not locked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chebsis_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your thinking of the right room B'Fang, Drusella spawns in that room and not in the room next to zone out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yup.  Just another post here reaffirming that the bag spawns in Drus's room.  Back left corner.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>otakuryoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">anyone post the locs of the groundspawns for the masterkey so i can mark em on my hardcopy map? thnx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chebsis_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Look in the link Juujuu posted Ota, its all there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok cool this morning duoed with a necro, and we cleared East wing, got my Master key now. If anyone is curious about changes to hs, the changes are that named generally have the same spots however some named will be a wanderer. Names summon mainly and hit for 200+ max. They have spread a few of the spawns out which is nice, especially for soloing(kinda impossible to channel 6 adds!). And the crap loot that used to be only on names now drops of random mobs in the zone like kylong set. And the named is more likely to drop their rare item now. <br />
<br />
The changes are pretty good, and names are pretty common. Still noone goes here though, exp is ok, I made an orange into 65 today which is not shabby but shows an improvement. Also for info don't know if Drusellas position has changed since she wasn't up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chebsis_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Drusella's new spawn is, from what i've been told, static between the 4 golems in her room.  The main difference with east wing post HS revamp is that most/all the mobs after the one way wall were bumped up a few levels(improved melee/resists).</div></div><hr />
