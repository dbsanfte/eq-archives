<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a general gripe I'm sure a lot of you can empathise with.  <br />
<br />
I just finished the excruciating pain that is MC3 so I can get Canni5, and I'm left wondering -- why not making ND3 the prereq instead of MC3 for this very useful AA?<br />
<br />
Seems like forcing us to get MC3 is a 'punishment' of some sort.  It certainly is less efficient unless my math is wrong.<br />
<br />
MC3 = 3 extra mana per tick.<br />
<br />
ND3 =~ 200 extra HP.  <br />
Replenishment is, what, 25hp a tick regen?  Plus Regen3 which makes that 28hp regenned per tick.<br />
<br />
If the original intent of the AA designers was to give us cause to use Canni5 less (I guess calculating the inherent danger for the nonattentive [read: me] of canni'ing themselves to death), as I assume it to be, wouldn't ND3 be a better choice for this?  It certainly would make our mana regen more effective.<br />
<br />
Just seems like MC3 was a poor choice of prerequisites for Can5</div></div><hr />

I see, so simply because these two AA have the word &quot;mana&quot; in their description they &quot;fit&quot;?<br />

They share absolutely no correlation except that.  If you're going to make a certain AA a prerequisite for another, shouldn't they have some sort of mutual relevance?  ND3 is more relevant to Can5 than MC3.<br />

<br />
Whats less efficient about MC3? compared to what?<br />
Yes, 3 mana per tick isnt a lot of mana, but it stacks with all other mana regen in the game.<br />
ND3 might make more sense to YOU, but my shaman was at ~2300 unbuffed hp when i got canni5 (level 63 btw) so ND3 wasnt really necessary, but yeah it would be nice to have also.<br />
<br />
Also, ...generally speaking, changing your stance mid-sentence leads to incomprehensible dribble (read: last &quot;paragraph&quot;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
ND3 through Canni4 with replenishment will produce more mana over time than an additional 3 mana per tick, or so it seems to me intuitively without doing any numbers.  <br />
<br />
Take a look at my magelo, I'm around those HP (around 2400 actually, got some gear upgrades that aren't reflected), so it's not me wanting more HP for more HPs sake.  <br />
<br />
Wasn't crying or boohooing about it, just griping.<br />
<br />

<br />
you say that if the intent was to make canni5 used less because there was an hp cost attached, than they should change the path to canni5 to be ND3 because it would negate the hp cost.  And reading between the lines, would make canni5 used more.  This is all said in one long sentence.<br />

<br />
Yes of course one canni4 with hp regened with replenishment will create more mana than MC3 will in that same time period.  ND3 isnt going to increase rate of regen so dunno why you include that in your statement.  But what you fail to grasp is MC3 is going on behind the scene; you are regaining this 3 mana no matter what else is going on.  You said its less efficient and i pose the question again, less efficient than what?</div></div><hr />

Hmm, besides being a moot point (VI's not going to change it), they are the same type of aa - mana regen. ND3 and c5 share nothing in common except the fact that c5 converts hp's to mana. The idea behind c5 is not to lose hp's but obviously to regen mana. As is mc3. Make sense now?</div></div><hr />

That was actually two sentences you quoted, but thanks for playing our game.<br />

<br />
You need to work on your reading comprehension.<br />
<br />
ND3 is more efficient in conjunction with Can4/5 than MC3.  Unless they changed something about shaman in the two weeks I've been playing my cleric, more hp = more mana.<br />
<br />
MC3 is a nice AA, 3 additional mana per tick is nifty.  But making it a prerequisite, as I said before and I'm sure I'll be saying again to your Weekly-Reader-reading ass, is silly.<br />
<br />
Additionally, it's the fact that I, like a lot of shaman, would rather get ND3 earlier on the AA path than MC3.  As far as I know, nearly all Shaman go Run3-Regen3-MC3-Can5-MGB.  That's 32 AA points to spend before you can even think about the ND line.  <br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I understand what you're saying, but in my personal opinion, calling Canni a mana regen spell doesn't quite get the full context of the spell.  <br />
<br />
Clarity line, Spiritual Light line, Pot9, these are mana regen spells.  Canni DOES give the caster more mana, but I don't really think of it in the same vein as the others.  There's a lot of room for disagreement there obviously, but clerics don't really have to build their gear around Blessed Armor of the Arisen or Yaulp 5 and 6 (their self-only mana regen spells) whereas we do. <br />
<br />
And yeah, it is a moot point.  Was just a random gripe.</div></div><hr />

MC3 is about mana regeneration, can5 is about mana regeneration, they fall in line with each other. ND3 is a sweet AA but it doesnt exactly fall in line to be a pre AA to a mana regeneration AA, even though it accents it very well. I agree 100% mc3 is a pain in the ass, i wanted to collect my can5 over night too, but your point in the original post i believe was to why its a pre AA to can5 and why ND3 is not.  It simply doesnt follow the right roadmap... imho<br />
<br />
ND3 through Canni4 with replenishment will produce more mana over time than an additional 3 mana per tick<br />
<br />
MC3 might not be alot upfront, but think of it as a Flowing thought item that you never have to take off and is stackable with everything. Remember that.. stackable, so yes it might not be as much as can4 but its stacking WITH can4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well..that nd3 boosts your potential canni pool by 1.3 canni 4's..hitpoints are worth less than wisdom or +mana in that regard though. <br />
<br />
Only takes a couple minutes for that MC3 to surpass the 1.3 times use of 200 extra hp in canni for mana regain. You'd get the same boost from getting +90 mana from an item upgrade or 10 or so wisdom from an upgrade, to put it into perspective.<br />
<br />
HP != Mana regen<br />
<br />
HP Regen/Mana Regen(MC3) =  Mana regen</div></div><hr />

What kind of f'ed up math are you thinking?<br />
MC3 gives FT3<br />
Having more max hps doesn't make your HP come back any faster at all.<br />
Having more max hps doesn't let wince any more often.<br />
Having more max hps only makes you able to wince more often before taking longer periods of time to regen back the health.<br />
There is no more or less effective.<br />
MC3 gives mana, while ND3 doesn't do anything in terms of mana or health regeneration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Why discuss over a design issue that is out of our hand and 0% possibility that Sony will change it?<br />
<br />
It's like starting a topic, &quot;why need ND3 even&quot;.  Why not make canni5 like layhand and as long as you are shaman, you get it at certain level?  Still, you will need MC3 for Canni5.  That's the way it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As said, MC3 increases manaregen.  and Cann5 increases mana regen, so they seem pretty related in that respect.<br />
<br />
Also ND3 does nothing to increase mana regen.  ND3 works like more wis. higher base HP so more possible mana to tap but as most know the mana/hp pool isnt what counts its the regen.  <br />
<br />
i hated doing MC3 but dont see a problem with it being a pre req.  Look at wizards why is MC3 the pre req for MB?  that seems to have less of a corraltion to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">*shrug* I always thought of it as, because cann5 is so awesome, Mental Clarity 3 is just part of the cost.  So it's 17 points instead of 5 to spend, but you get a nominal extra reward along the way.<br />
<br />
I believe Mental Clarity 3 is also a pre-req for the chanter Gather Mana AA-- yet Gather Mana would still be exactly as useful without the 3 measly extra mana regen.<br />
<br />
One can argue that rangers don't need any arch pre-reqs for their archery skills... but of course they cost alot more points, so the extra cost is more than built in.<br />
<br />
I'd rather have a borderline usefulness AA like Mental Clarity required than have Can5 cost 9 straight AAs, or build up in quality as a 3/6/9 ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Owwiefixer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The way I look at it..<br />
<br />
ND3 still maintains the same value after achieving Canni5. <br />
<br />
MC3's value becomes greatly diminished as soon as you achieve Canni5 (i.e. mana regen becomes a substantially lower priority once you have Canni5).<br />
<br />
So from a standpoint of utility, MC3 as a prerequisite to Canni5 seems like a dimished effect, since after you achieve the ability to generate ~800 mana every three minutes, you hardly notice the 90 mana MC3 generates in the same timeframe.  Prior to Canni5, every little bit of FT/MC helps.<br />
<br />
ND3 would make more sense from a non-diminishing returns standpoint, but really has absolutely nothing to do with mana regeneration.  Sure, we cannibalize hitpoints for mana, but from an organizational standpoint, it seems a bit of a stretch.<br />
<br />
I don't personally believe you can make everyone happy on this one.  To a lot of folks, 12AA's are alot to spend and they would prefer better freedom to spend them on the things earlier on things they think will hold better value.  To some, this will be more hp.. to others, more mana regen.. and to even others, defensive or healing AA's.   No matter what you make the prerequisite, there are going to be shaman that feel they wasted 12AA's on something they feel should have much lower priority compared to other AA's.</div></div><hr />

My perspective is that pre-requisites for class skills are things that build upon previous skills. This works in nearly all situations. SCRM needs SCR3, Gather Mana needs MC3, Advanced healing adept needs healing adept 3, it even works with melee AA (I don't have the names of the AA and their progression memorized, but I've looked at it on my rogue and warrior twinks, and it is clear as day)....ND3 builds up your character to use C5 effectively, where MC3 most certainly does not.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that they made the pre-reqs the way they did because they knew that without having C5 at the end, nobody (Mudcrush excepted) would ever get more than MC1, and few enough would get even that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More likely it could be the simple fact that shaman didn't get ND when they initially put in aa's. ND, ca,cs where all added to all classes a while after SoL came out. Of the aa's that where there MC was the prereq that made the most sense. It is also the prereq for Manaburn which helps set the precident that it's the prereq for anything mana relates (gather mana, mana burn, cann v and not sure what else off hand).</div></div><hr />
