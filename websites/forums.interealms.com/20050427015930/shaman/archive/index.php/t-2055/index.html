<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brtbc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am an untwinked Vah Shir Shaman on Rallos Zek.  I group with one other player usually and occasionally two. The one who I group with most often is a Shadowknight, and sometimes a Bard.  What I want to know is where is the BEST exp per kill place that we could handle on our own, or easily find a group.  I toyed with High Hold Keep for awhile because of the good exp per kill.  Now I feel too high for HHK and I just want new scenery......Where do I go????????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">solb window grp   will need a cleric tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OverThere is great exp for a two person group at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Crystal Caverns would be a good place to go also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been getting great exp in Dawnshroud peaks.  This is on my cleric alt, but shamans would rock here to - groups always looking for healers.  Stick near zone to NL until you get a group, or if you want to solo stick near zone to SS.  And watch for the trains at NL zone - on Seventh Hammer at least, they are rarely called, just a panic'd flee.<br />
<br />
But exp is awesome.  About a lvl every 5 hours of play time.<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jimmy_poopins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think you should go to Crystal Caverns.  The exp is above average and the loot is AMAZING (most of the time).  You can probably solo pretty good there at 35, and if you get a tank partner, even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zymral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">being from Rallos i know how hard it is to grab a good spot lol....try doing CC geos (good money and good exp through the 40's) and you have plenty of time to see pk's comming  the other place is the corner between FM zone and the WW zone you still get the same lvl mobs and no one runns out that far ( and for the barbs NO GOONS). have fun<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Crystal Caverns is nice cause there is a city there, but so is Echo Caverns (shorty side) killing underbulks.  Try it out if you are equiped pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sharrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Crystal Caverns is good exp.. and nice loot..<br />
The zone is also sweet for three things.. Bank. Exp from 32 to 54. NO mob drops copper :)<br />
Bad sides are,.. no binding... and its a long run to a zone. Can't sow either.. as its indoors.<br />
But if you can grab a friend ( a mage teamate is awesome in here..) you can get from 30 to 50 .. bank your 34-49 spells and stay there.<br />
A mage pet and a shm pet., both with buffs. can knock those Orcs down mighty fast.<br />
Another good spot was in tower of frozen shadow. Nice coins. to many 5pp weapons had to rot.. as we all ran out of room. The only hold up somewtimes is getting everyone a key (to avoid the keyholder for a floor having it on his corpse...beside yours).. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>peskinobi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Great Divide killing the Kodiaks is the best exp because you have Velketor near and you can ask for buffs if you are a nice person and you are polite.That will do you get very good xp of these crappy mobs<br />
