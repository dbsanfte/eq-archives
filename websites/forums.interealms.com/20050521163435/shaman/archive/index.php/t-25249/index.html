<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jayson18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everybody,<br />
<br />
I recently caught a few ads on Spike TV for their upcoming Video Game Awards (it airs Dec. 14th but I'm not sure what time, check out their website if you want) and thought to start this thread to see who everyone thinks should win the award for game of the year. Maybe we could tally up the replies here and then compare them to which game actually wins that night? It might be cool too to send these results to Spike TV after we're done, especially if our favorites aren't on their list. So I'm going to dig around and try to find a way to contact them too.<br />
<br />
Here's this year's choices from Spike's website (if you don't agree, just put down your favorite):<br />
<br />
Burnout 3: Takedown (Electronic Arts)<br />
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (Rockstar Games)<br />
Half-Life 2 (Vivendi Universal Games)<br />
Halo 2 (Microsoft Game Studios)<br />
Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (Konami)<br />
<br />
Also, what's your all-time favorite? (I'm predicting Super Mario Brothers and CS will top the list here.)<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone and I'll keep you posted on who wins in case you won't catch it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">none but My last choice on that list is Metal gear, its a fantastic game I think but...in comparison I think I would rather do jedi academy, only because I am a big star wars fan. then EQ, EQ loosing its flare for me, cant say it hasnt helped me through the last 5 years, but hey? its been great. Been playing it rarely but still fun now and then.<br />
<br />
Then again Super metroid was my favorite game to ever grace this plantet, too bad i was so seduced by it to beat it so soon, =(</div></div><hr />

Master of Magic.  <br />
<br />
I really wish the creators would re-release a workable WIN 98 + version.  They tried and the Best Buy folks just nodded their heads when I brought it back.  Fun, fun, game with a lot of replayability.<br />
<br />
Second place?<br />
<br />
Fallout 1.<br />
<br />
It wasn't the dialogue options (which were self-evident 95% of the time), it wasn't the building of the character, or the different playstyles, and it wasn't even the storyline. (VERY well done).<br />
<br />
It was the creepy, haunting music from the very beginning with the Ron Perlman intro to the finale when there is a plot twist that both infuriates and saddens you. (As the game is over).<br />
<br />
(&quot;Maybe&quot; was done by the Ink Spots, reaching # 2 in 1940)<br />
<br />
MMORPG?<br />
<br />
WoW &gt; EQ &gt; The Realm &gt; DAOC. <br />
<br />
Not gonna rehash this, but for me, even if WoW loses its lustre, I won't be coming back to EQ.  FWIW I had some great times in EQ.  The Realm was my very first Online game.  It's basically a chat room with sub par graphics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Old text based BBS classic.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You move to the North 20 paces. To the East you see a pack of Mutated Hyena's. The caustic environment they've been forced to live in has changed them. They look like normal Hyena's, but their movements seem unnatural, almost planned, organized, and intentional. One glares back at you, almost appearing to be contemplating his next move, sizing up potential prey. You could run, but they'd surely catch you.<br />
<br />
The Northern and Western horizons are blacked out by what was once a sprawling city, full of massive skyscrapers and other man made structures. It looks safe, but there's no way to know what lies just inside the now abanded and rotting cityscape. You've heard rumors of untold treasures within the cities borders, but you've also heard the horror stories of other adventurers who sought glory and fame there. At night you can hear what sounds like groans of agony coming from the distant burb. They may just be your imagination, but are you willing to chance it?<br />
<br />
What do you wish to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&gt;_ Move West<br />
<br />
<br />
Absolutely classic. Games like that really nurtured and empowered imagination.<br />
<br />

OMG!!  I thought I was the only one that ever played that game because everyone I ever mention that game to looks at me like I'm some sort of freak (yeah, I know I am, but no need to point that fact out :p).  <br />
<br />
Also, Bard's Tale (for C-64).  Probably one of (if not the very first RPG game) that got me hooked on the genre.</div></div><hr />

I've got the original version of MoM working on my WinXP box at home. Runs at 640x480 in the good old VGA mode. Or are you meaning a version which runs at higher resolution and colours etc? <br />
<br />
It's still fun to play, but the graphics just make it hard sometimes to enjoy it quite as much.<br />
<br />
And don't get me started on Bards Tale for the C-64.  I had huge grids drawn up on A3 paper with 1cm x 1cm squares to map out all the dungeons and zones.  All major spots labelled. Had a stack of maps around 10cm high that I only recently cleaned out. :D<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've played so many games that I'm sure I've forgotten some awesome ones, but I just loved those old SSI Forgotten Realms games (Pool of Darkness etc) <br />
<br />
Master of Orion 2<br />
Half Life 1<br />

Talk about bringing back memories.  I can't even count the number of times I've taken over the known universe under the original version.  Could fit the entire game on a single 3.5' disc now and still that game is awesome to play.  (I have to find the disc, I still have somewhere, just no book so can't always pass the security question).</div></div><hr />

  I love X-COM - UFO Defense, which is produced by Microprose who also produced MoM.<br />

  I also have the riginal version, but for the life of me cannot get the thing to run.<br />

  I am also running XP, and have tried all the compatibility settings, which don't work.  I continue to get a 16-bit MS-DOS subsystem error - NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction.<br />

&quot;lemmings&quot; I can't believe no one mentioned that one. When it came out on the amiga we spent 24 hours straight playing against each other. Nothing like digging a hole in front of your opponent's goal while he's busy elsewhere, or stealing his lemmings with a stragegically placed blocker. Not to mention the Eric Shwartz lemmings animations which were a riot.<br />
<br />
Very Special mention goes to the shareware &quot;Battle mech&quot; on the Amiga. Someone decided to  make a turn based video game version of battletech on their own time. No other commercial version has come close to providing the fun we had on this one. It sucks that he was shut down by FASA. They really missed something when they didn't just hire him or license him to make a computer version. We still like to play it on PC amiga emulators after 10 + years. Hell it's probably older than most of the people reading this board. A multiplayer internet version of that game would be absolutely nuts.<br />
<br />
Others include ...<br />
<br />
Racing construction kit. Also on the C-64. Make your own track, set the gravity. Race against your friends. <br />
<br />
On the c 64, anyone remember &quot;Space Taxi&quot; ? A first person version of that in a 5th element setting would rock. <br />
<br />
Last but not least, &quot;Project X&quot; on the amiga. Figure out what happened to the personnel on the space station, save the beautifull lady from the humanoid green monsters. Lure the Grey Supermonster that eventually spawns into the radioactive room because it's immune to your weapons...</div></div><hr />

Gunship 2000<br />
SSI: Fantasy General and Panzer General<br />
X-Com<br />

These games sucked up way too much of my life, but I doubt I'll ever go back to them.<br />

<br />
My favorite?  The only thing that comes to mind to this question is this response: &quot;I can only have one?&quot;  :)<br />
<br />
Here are some off the top of my head, though they all may have been mentioned already.<br />
<br />
1) Master of Orion 2:   ...I still play this.  For me, being able to design ships, new maps with every game, more than one way to win space battles, and very cool music.  (I have actually sat and just listend to the music of the game... something about it makes me daydream.  This for me is very cool.)   Any game with lots of options for the players to choose from (and hence increases replayablility) is always a good sign.  <br />
<br />
2) The Steel Panthers series (I'm a wargamer at heart).  Again, so many options to choose from.  You can make up your own unit of tanks, infantry, artillery, etc. and go through senerios as the comander.  Being able to move individual tanks (In 1 and 2) and trying to flank an enemy,  or stop him cold from a head on assult gives my mind something to chew on.  Then again, being able to plaster enemy positions with heavy artillery until nothing but shell holes litter the field can place a smugness on my face for days.<br />
<br />
I remember playing the American vs. Chinese human wave senerio in the 2nd game of the series.  The Americans have good artillery, support from machine guns, and the advantage of prepared postions on the small hills.   The Chinese have numbers...  In that senerio, for me, it almost always came down to the last few turns with the remains of a few infantry squads and the last few rounds of ammo for the artillery to push the chinese off the hills.  <br />
<br />
In the third version of the game, you command an entire brigade!  Lots of untis, turns take minutes for the computer to work out, but man, I tell ya, you can really get into it!  With fondness I remember the hypothetical campaign where Syria and Egypt launched a surprised attack on Isreal in the late 1990's.  That first scenrio has the Isreals way outnumbered and the Syrians launch a massive assult with tanks, artillery, and air support.  You really have to think on this one to beat it.  Loved it!<br />
<br />
Ok, hehe, got a little carried away there.  Excuse me. This post is just bringing back some good memories.  :)<br />
<br />
3) Civilization II.  Spent hours and hours playing this game.  I remember many moons ago where I would get up in the morning, go to my computer, and sit there and play Civ 2 for 15 hours -straight.  No joke.  (Don't do that anymore, hehe.)  ...I actually finished a game last month!  What can i say, you find something that really appeals to you and you keep it around.  <br />
<br />
4) The gold box series of D&amp;D games...  man, those had some great story lines in them.  Last year I had my D&amp;D group going through Phlan in the Forgotten Realms.  Bits of of the first game Pool of Radiance, inspired me when I designed the town for the adventure.  <br />
<br />
5) Starcraft w/Brood Wars.  Mmmmm...watching a wave of Battlecrusiers with full upgrades go into a base and have some fun.  Ghosts and nukes!  Protos Dragoons and Reavers.  Mmmmm...  good stuff!<br />
<br />
6) Mechwarrior 2.   Launching two LRM 20's at your target far away and seeing them explode!  Running a light mech really fast up to a heavy and plastering him with medium pulse lasers, and then trying to run away!  haha!  Fighting in the city and plastering buildings as you play hide and seek with the enemy!  FUN!<br />
<br />
7) Aliens vs. Predator.   Love using the flame thrower on the aliens or watching them go down as they charged you when you had two pistols in your hand.  That was a rush for me!<br />
<br />
Ok, I've said enough.  hehe.  Going to have to see if I can get a few of these to run on XP (I KNOW MMo2, Civ 2 do work on XP).  <br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Masters of Orion still gets lots of play.<br />
<br />
Turn based, Cyber Empires, Fantasy General and Panzer General. I'd play them all more, if only the emulator worked better. Really wish they ran well on a XP box. They are the only reason I still keep a ME machine around any more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>kursan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Lots of great stuff being mentioned here, thought I'd throw in a few old genesis games, Speedball 2 and RoadRash 1 &amp; 2. I loved Fallout 1 &amp; 2, still go back to them sometimes.<br />
Oh and i know maybe not the smartest thing to admit to loving here but Diablo, who else remembers running in fear when they discovered Leoric could open doors? (And before anyone else says yeah i know it got completely fubared by the battlenet hackers but hell i loved that game and its atmosphere.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">My favs in order from highest to lowest....all PC games as Ive never been much of a console gamer.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Fallout 2/1 (in order). I cant count the number of times I went back through with a different type of character and the adventure was different due to traits I chose differently. I shed a tear IRL when Black Isle lost the rights to the fallout name. So much detail presented so well in a game that for its time wasnt terribly large.<br />
<br />
2. Civilization 2/3/1 - Never played Alpha Centauri, but any of these games can keep me busy for hours...been playing Civ3 lately and it rocks just as much as 2 did.<br />
<br />
3. X Com 1 - Best Squad based tactical game Ive played. Lots more titles since it was released with better graphics but (for me) none of them could take the place of xc1.<br />
<br />
4. Half-Life 1/2 - For obvious reasons..  right now HL2/CSS are about the only things ive played aside from EQ2 now and again.<br />
<br />
5. Star Control 2 - Oldie but goodie.....<br />
<br />
6. Starflight (the original - 1986) - First game I ever got into playing much.....tons of star systems to explore and planets to visit all in a game that fit on a floppy. Fun fun game for its time....this was the game that got me addicted to PC gaming.<br />
<br />
So many more I could list but I should probably stop</div></div><hr />

Wow man, this looks like my &quot;Shelf Of Fame&quot; where I keep the boxes of my all-time favorite games. In fact, if you put Alpha Centuri and Starcraft on there, its EXACTLY my shelf, LOL. <br />
Never played Alpha Centauri, <br />
You really need to check out AC, if your a Civ fan. Its VERY strong. I have it loaded right now, and have a game going with each of the &quot;factions&quot;. Litterally hours and hours of addictive play, I like it better than Civ 2, and thats saying a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Have any of you been to http://www.the-underdogs.org ? It is a site with tons of older computer games. Alot of them are free downloads while some just link you to sites where you can buy old games. Hearing all these old games reminded me of the site, I downloaded two of the master of orion series there I think. If someone already posted about this I'm sorry, didn't read about it anywhere here.</div></div><hr />

I've got the game...for some reason it never really perked my interest enough to obsess with it like I did all of the Civ games. Maybe ill try it again on a rainy day.</div></div><hr />

I did the same thing. LOaded it, tried it, stopped, re-loaded it, rtried it, stopped, then finally I stuck it out one game, and WOW I have been hooked ever since.</div></div><hr />
