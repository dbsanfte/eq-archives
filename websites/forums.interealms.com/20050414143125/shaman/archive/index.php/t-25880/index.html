<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a Lavaspinners task last night with a 4 person group - 2 level 70 paladin friends, my boxed 68 druid, and myself.  The mission was a straight up ldon style &quot;collect&quot; mission.  We had to collect 15 dragon fangs. <br />
<br />
SUMMARY:<br />
<br />
It was a lot like LDoN, but seemed easier than LDoNs did when they first came out.  Zone was pretty nice looking and BIG.  Reward was about 10% of a not quite elemental level item.  Or 10% of one of a lot of very nice augs including most focus 5 effects.  Mobs lasted about the same duration as Nihil, so about 2 minutes.  I suspect if we'd had ANY dps classes with us they'd have gone down a TON faster.<br />
<br />
A couple of notes:<br />
<br />
1.  every mob in the instance was only &quot;partially&quot; slowable.  I really HATE it when trash mobs mitigate slows this much!<br />
<br />
2.  the mobs hit for about 600, so despite gimped slow, Trushar alone was enough to keep a paladin healed most of the time.<br />
<br />
3.  mob resists seemed reasonable.  nihil stuck first cast most of the time without malos.  Despite the fire theme, my druid was able to cast fire based nukes fairly well after immolation dot/debuff and malosini.<br />
<br />
4.  agro range was very low.  paladin single pulled with stun and only got an add once.  mobs don't wander much.<br />
<br />
5.  there was a &quot;pit trap&quot; with an illusion of floor which we managed to fall into not once but twice.  very hard to see.  Only consequence for falling in is that you get to fight 2-3 mobs immediately upon landing so the person who falls in first could be hurtin.<br />
<br />
6.  by the time we were done, there were 3 mobs that appeared to be &quot;named&quot; on track, but we couldn't find them.  That zone is BIG and twisty.<br />
<br />
7.  there's a mix of live and undead mobs so couldn't just blast around with invis without stopping to kill the undeads.<br />
<br />
8.  mobs didn't respawn, so evac, kiting adds, etc are all tactics that could let sub-par groups function in there.</div></div><hr />
