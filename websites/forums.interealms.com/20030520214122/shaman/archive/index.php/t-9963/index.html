<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day I went to PoN to group for a change of pace from HHK.<br />
<br />
There weren't many people in PoN but soon enough I got an invite.<br />
<br />
It was a 54 shaman(me), 61 Necromancer with spectre pet, and a 54 wizard. The necromancer would pull to us and root the mob, I'd slow while he stacks up some dots. I'd cast E-Bolt and usually that'd break root(:rolleyes:). We'd send our pets with taunt off and the necromancer kited it around while I either canni'd back the mana I spent or I'd follow it around beating it with my 2hb. The mobs wouldn't last long.<br />
<br />
I was getting about 1% exp per kill, and the pulls were very quick. The necromancer was in spectre form(for hp to mana regen) the whole time and I'd keep regrowth up on both of us. The wizard probably could have just went afk or something and we'd still be going strong.<br />
<br />
This place is perfect for shamans and enchanters. Everyone is looking for a slower/mezzer/C-er. :)<br />
<br />
Eventually the necromancer had to leave so we got a 55 rogue, 62 shadowknight, 60 cleric and a druid. We went to &quot;Zo2&quot; and pulled stuff there easily.</div></div><hr />
