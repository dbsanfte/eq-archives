<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im open to suggestions and questions regarding this.<br />
<br />
1. Get PotC/Aego/Virtue and KEI<br />
<br />
2. Get to WL, run around like a headless chicken until you find PoG shroom (cant remember loc sorry!)<br />
<br />
3. Bind outside shroom<br />
<br />
4. Get HP buffs on, Resist Magic and the usual selection. Load puppy into spell list, and prepare buffs for it. Also have gate loaded.<br />
<br />
5. Invis and run in<br />
<br />
6.a. If the Whorl doesnt see invis, run past it avoiding all horses towards south wall. You can run up the hill to the top, onto a plateau and then stand still, for about a minute, to make sure you havent aggroed anything. Gate if you have.<br />
<br />
b. If whorl sees invis, run to the east (not too far, but away from zone in) and gate. Immediately invis again (heal if you need to) and run in. Whorl should be far enough away for you to make it safely to south wall.<br />
<br />
7. Summon pet, regen/haste/talisman it, and guard it on plateau. <br />
<br />
8. Spell list should be similar to:<br />
<br />
1) Canna<br />
2) Root<br />
3) Gate ( NEVER EVER drop this... there is no zone out, so no hope without it)<br />
4) Poison dot<br />
5) Sense Animals/Malosini<br />
6) Swap out slot for buffs/nuke<br />
7) Slow<br />
8) CH or Chloro<br />
<br />
9. Use sense animals. This spell is the greatest gift here. All mobs (that are fightable) are animals except Horses (odd!) and treants.<br />
<br />
10. Most likely you will have a gale wolf first of all. Find it, and bring with slow, dodging adds. If you get one far away from camp, root it and continue to camp.<br />
<br />
11. Malo the mobs. Resists on mobs with sow when fleeing can end fatefully.<br />
<br />
12. You can dot and fight ITF (in teh face) or root/dot and let pet melee them down. Because they hit so small, pet can handle with only one CH. Try to keep mana high for efficient fighting<br />
<br />
13. Continue. Horses are sometimes paladins, so watch out for LoH. All mobs summon. Treants gate, and are very hard to interupt. Work your way along left wall towards waterfall. By the time you reach waterfall you have probably spent up to 6 hours here, so log off and do something in RL!!! Hehe. Once you get to the waterfall, go back to plateau, and head towards lake in the east. I dont recommend fighting anything at lake unless you are 60+... mobs are annoyingly resistant.<br />
<br />
14. I think thats about it. Gem drops are almost 100%. You get the odd Crystallised Sulphur but dont cry!<br />
<br />
I did this with epic (a must, sadly) w/o horse and w/o JBB. With horse and JBB this would be sooo much easier and faster. <br />
<br />
Notes on mob abilities:<br />
<br />
Spirit Flux wolves: Sometimes unrootable.<br />
Bears: All druids or shamans. Watch for nukes and dots.<br />
Gale Wolfs: Rangers. Oh run in fear of the rangers!<br />
Horses: (White) Paladins  (Black) Not sure<br />
Treants: Druids. Bastards. Avoid.<br />
Another note on treants: One paths to the back of plateau. Unless you are FM and ready to fight, i wouldnt hang around.<br />
Spirit Stalker: Namedish bear, 200+ hitter summons and casts... probably like a Yeldema fight but with some healing on the mobs side, so shouldnt be too hard methinks for 60+... at 58 i wouldnt try because my mana pool would just be too small.<br />
<br />
<br />
There we go! Hope this helps, and like i said im open to suggestions and questions. Good hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know you mentioned this already Urd but gonna restate it. Leave/gate from the treants dont bother with them. Pup is probably not gonna stop the gate or you in you have slam and they gate and summon you to a very bad place which makes a pita CR. Just my opinion btw. Seen a small raid let one get away and it started summoning people one by one til everyone who hit it camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a few questions. I stepped into PoG for the first time last night and nothing was up because of a raid. <br />
<br />
1. What is the spawn rate in there? <br />
<br />
2. If you die is there a safe place to drag your corpse and enough time to loot before something wanders your way?<br />
<br />
3. If you don't have epic like me (close but burned out on raids ) then is horse+KEI regen enough mana to burn on a bunch of BoNs and how many BoNs would a typical mob take to kill? I don't have a JBB or Poxx yet either.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Okey Solar:<br />
<br />
1) Spawn rate is 8 hours. Yipee!<br />
<br />
2) Plataeu and Lakeside a relatively safe if you are vigilant<br />
<br />
3) Hmm.... typically takes 7 minutes of dogdog, 3 epics and 3 Banes, so with horse+KEI you could probably just manage... would have to reslow though just to be safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the great info, Urdegish. I'm going to try this again on a weekday early in the morning when hopefully no raid is going on there. Just got the 61 pet, that should make things a bit easier :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Celestin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually there's a treant that paths along the zone wall counterclockwise.  So, if there's a full pop, you need to be away from the wall bascially his agro distance (not far, but a ways...)  or you'll get him as an add.<br />
<br />
For those of us who feed weapons to our pets, gating is annoying.  Adds can be tanked with relative efficiency assuming you have good affliction foci and use DR dots/spear and are 61+.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roksaur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">About 75% of the gale wolves do NOT summon.  You will be hard pressed to find these, as they are the easiest mobs in the zone (did I mention they usually don't summon?), so they are targetted by those who can't handle the summoning.<br />
<br />
As far as the named go, I would stay away from all of them except Sarik the Fang.  He is a wuss (the named gale wolf &gt;_&lt;), don't believe he casts.<br />
<br />
Grahl Strongback hits the hardest out of the front mini bosses (271, i believe).  He doesn't cast, but has hella resist.  I have had slow land 4 times in a row, and 6 resists in a row (resulting in a death).  If you do decide to take him on, kite him around until a slow lands.  Reslow him about 3 or 4 times during the fight, because there is a chance he will resist a lot of them.  I don't have malo, but was unable to land the 58 malisement after 8 attempts.  Drops arms of any class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm a 61 shammy without epic/pox/jbb/torpor/malo (Yea I know, I'm in seb now but I'm just not getting the drops)<br />
<br />
I do have a horse and fungi though (Figures, I get a fungi drop but no jbb yet)<br />
<br />
I can easily solo stuff like rats/goos in PoD. Use the buffed dog-dog/malosini/slow/cripple/root/bane/Plague route. Dog-dog needs 1 and sometimes 2 CH usually and i keep myself over 50% mana by stoic/cani.. sometimes can even end the fight close to fm if lucky.<br />
<br />
Anyways, How hard are these thigns compared to goos/rats in PoD? It sounds like they dont hit has hard but have 2 to 3 times the hps? If thats teh case (baring adds) I should be able to have even more mana than a PoD fight (where the mobs are hitting in the 100-250's) cause I dont ahve to heal as much.<br />
<br />
Reason I'm asking is seb is starting to drive me nuts. I'd liek to alternate it with a cash farm. NG is usally camped in seb, and bribing/getting a guild rogue down to pick isnt as easy as it sounds. Plus the run to seb if annoying as all hell. Course PoG is kinda out of teh way too.<br />
<br />
Thanks much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you can solo in PoD, you can solo in PoG.  The mobs dont hit as hard, and do not seem to have that many more HP.  At 61, I use alpha pooch (mage proc stuff, if you got em--helps dog keep agro with bane running) and 2-3 banes and a little jbb action to kill the typical west side trash mob.<br />
<br />
The hardest part is avoiding adds.  But you can root park one add at time without huge problem.  If not, gate is your friend )</div></div><hr />

Great. Thanks for the info.. Gonna do some faction work in kael, then head over and give it a try. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Um, it's been a long time since I've been to PoG, so this might be a dumb question - but I see no mention made of the Protectors of the Grove. Don't they still still come running at you every half hour no matter where you are in the zone?<br />
<br />
I imagine this would be a major annoyance if you are the only person in the zone (which would not be uncommon).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Reesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Verant changed it so the guardians don't have zone wide aggro anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Great info, I'll add a few things<br />
<br />
Names - Spirit Stalker HUGE bear, hits 243 max, does not cast (didn't the two times I off'd him anyway), and didn't drop me anything the two times I killed him.  Farstride Unicorn - wussy druid hits 155 max &amp; likes to cast, out of 2-3 kills the only drop I got was a bp almost identical to barbed ringmail, but nodrop (30ac 10str 50hp).<br />
<br />
Speed - At 55 with horse and jbb, and aego/kei it was taking me just about the full 6 minutes of turgurs to make each kill, with downtime.  Got alot faster at 58 with cann4/KM, was able to first solo the spirit stalker at this level.  At 62 its probably 4 minutes average a kill, with little (no KEI) to no (KEI'd) downtime :p  I don't have epic or pox, horse is a must if you're tanking though.  I have a jbb but rarely use it now.<br />
<br />
Mobs - White horses can be druids or paladins.  Black horses are warriors.  Glade stalkers are usually druids, sometimes warriors.  Spirit flux wolves are always warriors and have alot of hp's, sanguine kokiaks also warriors with a good deal of hp's.  Roaming druid mobs will buff &amp; DS just about every mob they come across, so its a good idea to have annull up, nothing like fido shredding himself on that ds &gt;_&lt;  At 55 mal____ was a must.  At 61/62 now I don't bother, except on nameds.<br />
<br />
If you can get the NG camp in seb its IMO better money - 1500pp an hour plus lammy / CSS if you're lucky, is the average I seem to get.  Lammies sell fast for 1500 on my server, took me a while to get 1k for a css though so 750 might be more realistic.  I also find it less boring - however its likely to be camped, and if not people are more likely to ks you, train you, etc... here than in PoG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Urd!! Just come show me how ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If I go in there as a 60 Shaman (jbb+horse nothing else :).. 65 Sk,Monk,Cleric,Mage.. what mobs can we not kill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its a 24 hour spawn, not 8 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Khozik:<br />
<br />
There are no mobs you cant kill, except the obvious red named ones :) All other trash you could probably manage. But id avoid the willowwisp type mobs as they are level 60 and enchanters, quite tough.<br />
<br />
Juventus:<br />
Ill check that up. I have seen mobs in an area after i killed them 8 hours earlier but they may be pathers from the other side of the zone that i missed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I heard 8 hours too from other sources.. I went there with a 65 monk and Sk and we were able to handle 7-10 adds easy.. but later on just me and the sk we wiped across the river when he pulled a willow and before I could slow that I got some adds on me :( damn that place is fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Excellent place to get money, but from my experience the biggest problem has been getting mobs! The one time I spent a good hour there of constant pulling I walked away with more than 1000 platinum, as well as some nodrop ench boots (tried to get rid of them in /ooc and /gu but nobody was around, pretty nice stats actually). But since then, I just cannot find this zone with a full or even half full pop. It seems like the only way to really really make money off of this zone is by timing it right, in the wee hours of the morning so no raids and very few farmers will be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tulurean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Null and void now<br />

<br />
bah! thats annoying...No other place that i have found could match pog in pp/hour  :( . Anyone got a alternative to it? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Best place I've found for easy cash loot is NG in Old Sebilis, the hard part is getting the camp to yourself. Other camps in sebilis aren't too bad either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What other camps are good? NG is permacamped on sol ro. Never once have i gotten it. Disco is usally free, but ever time ive worked down there ive got squat for drops. Got a Seb neck guard once. Yuk.<br />
<br />
Is it true that only the bugs drop the gems? if so there are 2 bugs that spawn outside of the disco door. Maybe I'll jsut stick there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">No, it is not true that only bugs drop gems. Only the sepsis/necrosis/gangerous/leprous scarabs drop the high-end gems though (Ruby/Diamond etc)<br />
<br />
Gang is also an excellent camp as JB helm from the iksars sells for 300 and Silver Etched Warhammer for 180</div></div><hr />
