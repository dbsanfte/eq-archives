<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Revulsion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know haste is a linear increase in DPS due to the reciprocal decrease in delay, but I am not sure how slow is done.<br />
<br />
Is slow reported as a decrease in DPS, or an increase in delay?<br />
<br />
In otherwords, is a theoretical 100% slow: <br />
<br />
a) no dps, due to an inifinite delay. This formula system would mean that a 20 delay attack, with a 50% slow, would be 40 DLY, for 50% the dps.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
b) doubling of delay, therefore a halving of dps. This formula system would mean that a 20 delay attack, with a 50% slow, would be 30 DLY, for 66% the dps.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any insight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe a 75% slow results in 1/4 of the dps compared to an unslowed mob, so it's your case &quot;A&quot; above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's option a.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The first answer is the correct one.  A 75% slow will quadruple a mob's delay, i.e. they only swing a quarter as much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That has nothing to do with the question.  Both a and b increase the delay on your weapon, but a just results in a larger delay, with 100% slow being an infinite delay.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was my understanding that delay had no effect on proc rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is a thread in the Medicine Cabinet discussing &quot;procs, haste and swings&quot;.<br />

Last i checked it, your assumption was viewed as correct Juff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Proc rate is pretty much constant over time.  Delay doesn't affect proc rate in that sense.  However, if you slow yourself then you swing less over time, and thus you have more procs per swing.<br />
<br />
It's a point of view kinda thing.  If you're talking about proc rate over time.  Delay has no effect.  If you're talking about proc rate compared to number of swings, then yes delay does have an effect.<br />
<br />
20 delay weapon, unhasted with no double attack/dual wield... You'll swing every 2 secs or 30 times per minute.  Say the proc rate of said weapon is 2/minute.  Then you'd proc roughly once every 15 swings.<br />
<br />
Now you slow yourself 75% effectively changing the delay to 80, swinging once every 8 seconds, you only swing 7.5 times per minute.  Proc rate is still 2/minute so you'll proc on roughly every 3rd or 4th swing.<br />
<br />
Make sense?</div></div><hr />
