<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, when I first started out as a new up and comming shaman I did what a lot of shaman did..I bought or smoozed my way into as much Wis gear that I could get my furry little mits on..Then as time went by I realized through the amazing powers of canni, HP=mana...Now Id like to think I have a healthy balance of stamina and wis gear.. At lvl 59 I have about 1890 unbuffed hp, and an ac of about 880 and wis around 250 unbuffed..Im still looking to increase my stamina but the gear is hard to find without sacrificing too much wis or other stats..But, I dirgress..I keep seeing a lot of posts about shaman and Charisma buffed gear...Is Charisma that important to the shaman?  Have I overlooked some valuable aspect of the game..Id like to think IM a well rounded shaman with decent gear.. Im one step from epic..The dread fear raid and then once I hit sixty its back to AA's for me... If any of you have some advice, let me know soonest..Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Charisma is largely thought of as useless.  Any high charisma shaman are purely incidental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some people actually think Charisma helps slows land. <br />
<br />
Of course in reality Charisma helps slows land about as much as agility helps your mana pool.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can assure you even at 245 cha slow still bounces and mobs are still pissed you tried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well yeah, Shamu, but you can always smile charmingly at them as they beat you to a pulp. Besides, CHA doesn't help as much as facing Northeast does.<br />

Pudding, anyone?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i have 35 cha, and i slow just fine. there's nothing to that crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You actually mean they still want to beat the crap out of you instead of falling to the ground in unfailing reverence?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cha does jack for us, but I buff a lot of warriors with with for divine intervention when raiding ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Used for selling crap to vendors and for your Bard friend before LDoN's.  Thats all I use it for at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theres no posts about CHA here on this forum other than the sporadic once every couple months thread.  No CHA doesnt do anything for you other than DI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The only use I ever found to CHA is vendor diving for tradeskill junk.  <br />
<br />
Just get a couple of Opal Encrusted Steins (+25 each) or a Tradeskill Trophy (+50, brewing is easy to GM just please don't wreck what's left of the market) and you should be good for that.  <br />
<br />
145ish will get you best prices from any merchant that will already sell to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ive HEARD that cha helps paci etc.<br />
What id like to no is why are they putting cha on so much gear at the mo.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My Cleric gets better results on resisted Paci with CHA buff.  Could be the RNG screwing with me, but many on the Cleric forums agree.  Not sure on Druid/Ranger line since my Ranja never had it resisted (Shhh...don't leak that out, may want to play him again :P)  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In a land far, far away and long, long ago there were shamans who could scribe Charm.  Just ignore the green highlighted Cha in your creation screen ok??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've noticed one VERY important feature of charisma!<br />
<br />
When I run through a group of KOS greenies with a CHA of 150 or so I sometimes get agro, when I have my CHA at 305 I get no agro whatsoever!   OMG, so useful!<br />
<br />
Honestly, I tested this with the gnolls in Lake Rathe, near the South Karana zone, and it actually seems to make a difference.  Beyond that (and if you are worried about level 10 gnolls, well....), I wouldn't worry about CHA at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Charisma helps three things that are useful...helps to lower the chance of aggro on a resisted pacify (bard, ranger/druid/cleric/paladin/chanter), helps DI fire (anyone with DI on them), and helps lower fizzle rates on bard songs.<br />
Vendor prices are also a nice thing that it helps, but it doesnt take a mental giant to figure out that you get more flies with a little sugar than you do with a lot of vinegar.<br />
Any Charisma you find on shaman gear is likely there cause some developer is trying to be cute (most likely) or its a typo (again pretty likely).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">lvl 65 and I still need to buff cha to hit the magic 107 for best prices unless I have my grandmasters bag handy (i.e. never thanks to philosiphers stone)<br />
<br />
yes it does help with crit resists on pacify</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">once I hit sixty its back to AA's for me... If any of you have some advice, let me know soonest..Thanks.<br />
<br />
Forget the AAs go for 65.  The spells and level increases are worth more than the AAs.  If you must, put 15% of exp into AAs.<br />
<br />
Shaman spells seem to be affordable at the moment too.<br />
<br />
One reason you are seeing charisma gear is that the best chain gear from LDoNs have a charisma buff - another little SOE joke on rangers, rogues and shamans - like the chain gloves that drop in MMC with int but no wiz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When I originally created my shaman in 99, there were rumors that higher CHA helped with Conjuration, heh. So of course, I put the max in WIS and the extra 5 in CHA. In the long run, I think you could leave the &quot;extra stats&quot; blank and it wouldnt make a bit of difference.</div></div><hr />
