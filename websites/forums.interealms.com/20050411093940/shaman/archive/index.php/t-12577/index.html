<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so I am able to play fine for about 5 minutes, then the number on the right side of the &quot;lag&quot; bar shoots up from 200-500 up to 3000 plus.  Then it sometimes pops back down, only to shoot back up again and make me go LD!!  It happens without fail about five minutes in (works like a charm for the first 5 minutes, but after it goes all screwy).  Any of you internet trafic guru's have any idea why?  I'm using Zone Alarm and am on a campus connection.  I called the campus tech guys and they said they didn't change anything with their router/packateer, so I assume its either a) something about EQ and/or b) zone alarm.  Eq does have full permission to do whatever it wants on my comp and it worked fine before, but since the 4/8 patch it is all screwy. All help would be awesome!</div></div><hr />
