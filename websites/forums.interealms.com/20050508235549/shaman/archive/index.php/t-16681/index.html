<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dikkakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had a near identical grp over the last 2 nights. Killing mobs was almost twice as easy last night in &quot;hills of war&quot; (EC adv) than it was the night before in an Everforst adeventure.<br />
<br />
I won't pretend to know lots about LDoN .. I've only done 3 adventures (won 2 of em :) )<br />
<br />
Group contents<br />
<br />
My 52 mage and 52 shammy / 53 chanter / 52 war / 54 cleric /52 monk<br />
<br />
Only diff was cleric was 53 last night.<br />
<br />
Is it like Miraguls' is hardest and EC adventures are easier? <br />
<br />
curious :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The easiest dungeon for me so far is Mistmoore, this is with an all 65's group.<br />
<br />
Even easier or course, is when you group with a bunch of 61/62s and you're the only level 65, then EVERY dungeon is easy.  As I found out last night :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">dungeon and group content really determine this. Me, I think that Mirg adventure are probably the easiest as they have a very low caster population. Gates that pull 6 + mobs can really mess up your timing. Complete Heals don't help matters either.<br />
<br />
<br />
But if you have a couple pallies in your group, then dungeons with high undead content seem to be the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Their all easy in normal mode ... just do slaughter, collect and azz missions .. just keep moving ... even with multiple deaths we have still completed.  Maybe I have been lucky with good people but just like with exp groups .. they are either &gt; good or just make yoiu want to log after 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My rating of the dungeon difficulties, easiest to hardest:<br />
<br />
Rujarkian Hills (East Commons)<br />
Mistmoore (Butcherblock)<br />
Miragul (Everfrost)/Takish'Hiz (North Ro) (not sure on these two)<br />
Deepest Guk (South Ro)<br />
<br />
Rujarkian has few casters, and those are usually not that devastating. Most of the pulls are relatively easy.  Takish has a lot of casters, some of whom are nasty. Guk is just ugly. It's got everything that makes dungeons tough grouped together. The pulls are harder, the rooms and passages are smaller, the mobs cast more. My favorite in Guk so far was a named who enraged, then gated away while enraged, and then summoned the tank. We still killed him easily enough, since everything was clear back to his spawn point, but it was a good trick. Mistmoore is relatively easy, especially with one or more classes who specialize in undead bashing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My first several adventures were in Deepest Guk (South Ro).  I still like that theme though it isn’t the easiest to adventure in.  Then I did three adventures in Rujarkian Hills (East Commons).  During the first two I couldn’t believe how easy it was.  Everything was spaced so far apart we would have had to have tried really hard to pull more than two at a time.  The second adventure we even had two melees in our group that were rather sad representatives of their classes and we still finished the mission in record time.  But the third time I adventured there it was a different story.  We had a very good group of veteran players and the mobs still managed to kill two of us before we left the first room.  We completed our mission, but those mobs were really tough that time. <br />
<br />
I think Rujarkian Hills is the easiest theme, but don’t get too complacent.  I think Sony added in a random kick butt mode just to keep players on their toes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can almost believe there is a random kick butt mode, lol.<br />
<br />
Though keep in mind if you're 65 if your group average is under 63, you're in for an easy ride. 63+ you'll need to be more on your toes. (Also, under 63 avg. you get 34 pts and 63+ you get 51 pts @ lvl 65)<br />
<br />
MM has been the easiest for me. Done Guk twice and found it to be easy. Went there last night actually for a collection adventure with an all 65 group and we tore through the place with no trouble at all.<br />
<br />
Also did Mir last night and we had a good group but the dungeon was just too frikkin big that we didn't even get to the guy we needed to rescue in time. We tried for the lesser reward but got ported out by the time I had him 2/3 the way back to the zone. :(<br />
<br />
Takish has nasty casters, and Ruj has goblins who love to run at sow speed at low life. Make sure you have a snarer and that they always use it on them. I have good record at both those places but there's been one time at each where we couldn't even break in.<br />
<br />
What makes a dungeon hard/easy is your group. Got a good bunch of people who know what they're doing you should be fine (Unless you get some huge dungeon like I did in Mir last night) Get one or two people who don't do their job right and you're in for a tough time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dikkakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">TY for all your input :)<br />
<br />
now what to do with my whopping 26 AP's!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Totally depends on dungeon layout and mission.<br />
<br />
IN EC Ruj theme for example.  Theres 1 dungeon thats really long.  Making Assassination and Rescue in that theme harder.  theres another dungeon where the mobs are more closely packed making killX harder.<br />
<br />
In Ruj, I find Kill X the easiest long as I remember in the Barracks of War to be more careful charging rooms.   Assassination is 2nd easiest except i one dung which has rope bridge huts suspended because if the boss spawns at the north spot its a longer clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's interesting someone mentioned &quot;Kick Butt Mode&quot; in some of the dungeons. <br />
<br />
I don't know what's really going on, but there is definitely a rare occurence of much more powerful mobs in the dungeons. I have tried one hard adventure. Many of the mobs /con even to a L 65, many are (very high) dark blues. Most of the generic mobs in a L 65 hard dungeon hit for up to 900. That's background. <br />
<br />
The day after our (failed) hard adventure, we got together another group and set off to the dungeon. We intended it to be a normal difficulty adventure. We walk in, and I (playing my bard) pull the first mob, after lulling the others. I pull him with slow - and he still beats my ass. I was down to two bubbles of health (about 3500 damage taken) before the tank got him off me, which took only a few seconds. The mob then proceeded to nearly kill the tank before the cleric could react. We said &quot;Holy *@#$&amp;!, is this another hard adventure?&quot;  I scrolled up, and the mob was hitting for 900's. Just a generic earthen defender in Takish. 900's. Just like on hard. I think he was also a L 65 con. Just like on hard. We thought we were on hard. But no, the person who got the adventure said they were sure it was on normal. Nothing else in the dungeon showed as L 65 on tracking. So, we pressed on. And found no more 900-hitting buttkickers like that first mob. Not one. The rest were completely &quot;normal&quot;. <br />
<br />
I don't know why or how &quot;hard&quot; difficulty mobs are sprinkled into normal dungeons, but stay awake, because they ARE out there. And boy do they come as a shock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I really hate Ruj personally. A lot of the dungeons are very long with a lot of healers. <br />
<br />
MM has seemed to be the easiest by far to me. I had my first failure there today because I got what must have been EQ's most clueless warrior in my group. Talking about a guy that was getting owned by the named (with a shaman and cleric chain healing him) his gear was so bad and had to be reminded to go defensive if he's getting his butt kicked. We cleared to named with 40 minutes remaining even with LD's and someone eating rage on a mini named once, but we still manged to lose to it three time. The warrior was so bad the ranger ended up tanking half the time. <br />
<br />
Last time I join a group without knowing everyone in it first. <br />
<br />
Mir is really easy for the most part too. Did 5 there and didn't have any problems with them. <br />
<br />
Tak is decent. Only thing I really dont' like about guk is the visability in a lot of places sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Scrav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Some of the easiest dungeons I have done were rescues in Ruj.  In some of the layouts you can get to the hostage extremely quickly due to the layout.  However last night I saw my first long ruj rescue, so maybe I have been lucky up until now.</div></div><hr />
