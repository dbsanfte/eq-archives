<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Considering the short timeline before the release of GoD, I would like to &quot;launch&quot; our proposal today or tomorrow. I need your help for the best strategy!! How do we get the proposal to the people that matter?<br />
<br />
We have a several options:<br />
<br />
1) Email interested parties. I don't know if I'm an advocate of a mass email spam brigade, I don't want to annoy those we want to help us. If anyone can help me determine appropriate email addresses, I'd appreciate it.<br />
<br />
2) Posting to the eqlive forums (The Newbie Zone). Brenlo kinda made it sound like he was getting aggravated with multiple shaman requests for attention, so I don't know if I should post it there.<br />
<br />
3) Post it here. I'm not 100% sure the devs visit our forums. <br />
<br />
Suggestions? Ideas?<br />
<br />
Finally, whenever the final proposal is complete and we're ready for SOE to look it over, I think it will very important for us to be united. I would like us to &quot;sign&quot; the proposal. Something simple like &quot;I have read the proposal and I agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
I understand that we aren't all going to agree with all 5 issues. I would hope that there is at least ONE issue that you can agree with. If you don't agree with everything, you could sign with something like &quot;I have read the proposal and I agree our nukes could be improved&quot; or &quot;I have read the proposal and I would like a better heal.&quot; <br />
<br />
If you have friends/guildmates who rarely post here or perhaps aren't registered, please encourage them to come and post their support. <br />
<br />
If you disagree with the proposal, I would ask you to please not interrupt our attempt to present a united front. Start a new thread, if you must. I would feel very uncomfortable deleting &quot;disagreement&quot; posts from the thread, even though I feel very strongly that the key to our success will be our solidarity. <br />
<br />
<br />
One voice. One hope.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering the short timeline before the release of GoD, I would like to &quot;launch&quot; our proposal today or tomorrow. I need your help for the best strategy!! How do we get the proposal to the people that matter?<br />
Honestly ... all of them sound good.  Maybe we can email them a link to our site to make it smaller, whatever.  The key is to get it out there and put it under their noses.  I don't think a &quot;unified&quot; shaman petition will piss off any Mods on the SoE boards since it's from all of us and covers sorta new ground.<br />
<br />
The proposal is decent, loads of work in it, I'll back it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Erm, I'd avoid posting on the n00b zone.  The dev's may or may not read that without prompting.  Given the quality of the posts and the total ****ing idiots over there, I certainly wouldn't read any of the posts there were I them.<br />
<br />
Additionally, every idiot Tom, Dick, and Harry will want to put his or her 2 cents in on the thread, and some of the comments and 'counterarguments' are going to be totally inane, inflammatory, or worse, be totally wrong and yet sound reasonable.<br />
<br />
If we have an email addy for Brenlo, I'd send it there.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would suggest the following:<br />
<br />
1) post it here<br />
2) post it on the official sony board<br />
3) notify mobhunter.com<br />
4) in-game, feedback it<br />
5) email brenlo<br />
<br />
So far Brenlo seems ineffective, but he should still be given the opportunity to respond. <br />
<br />
That is about all I can think of in terms of getting the word out.  It would be good to send a few targeted emails, but I'm not sure who you would send them to.  Spamming = BAD.  It is important to ensure that they see this thing, though, so its kind of a catch-22.  <br />
<br />
If Sony is irritated that the only way to effectively reach them is to post something in TNZ -- then they need to provide something other than TNZ as a means of communication.  Theres not alot you cna do about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Deria, those are great suggestions. Another poster suggested Mobhunter as well, anybody have any contact information?<br />
<br />
Check out this spiffy intro that Henora wrote which I will include in the second post of the Proposal:<br />
<br />
Shamans, please sign on in support of The Shaman Proposal  <br />
<br />
For far too long shamans have been fighting among themselves about what is the role of our class and what issues are important.  We've watched expansions come and go and watched our power and usefulness dwindle away.  It is long past time to unite as a community and support a proposal that will bring attention to our class as a whole. <br />
 <br />
This proposal has attempted to combine and focus feedback from players of many different stations in the game.  While such a diverse and varied utility class will never reach agreement on all the specifics, I think we can all agree that the current GoD expansion spells are simply a continuation of our downhill slide.  In their current form, they address none of the major shaman concerns.<br />
<br />
Please remember that you can support the PROPOSAL without agreeing with ALL the issues or the details of each suggestion.  Even though this proposal has a number of specific points, it has a general objective; bring attention to the general consensus on the lack of usefulness of the new proposed GOD spells and AAs.<br />
<br />
Everybody agree that's pretty slick?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I recommend that after this is done we ALL print this out and sign that we want these issues to be addressed and snail mail it to <br />

<br />
Or alternatively send it to Everquest Live Team <br />
(or both as i will do)<br />
<br />
<br />
A flood of snail mail is harder to ignore than emails</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">sounds great to me.<br />
<br />
I agree with deria in that it should be posted many places, but not spammed.  just posting once on every pertinent forum seems a good idea.<br />
<br />
I don't think Brenlo is going to get in a huffy if we post this one on the noob site, but I do worry that it will be posted on by some of those people that seem to post there regularly.  I KNOW alot of those people will dissent souly for the sake of dissention, and having a ton of disagreements on the thread will only diminish the effectiveness.  So it's kinda a catch 22.  Would be a good place to get attention, but might end up being bad attention</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good idea with the snailmail, Sownow! I'd spend a stamp on it! <br />
<br />
Yeah, Rookz, you hit my second worry right on the head. SHAMAN ARE FINE DUDEZ!!!</div></div><hr />

Community Relations Manager<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
eqmail@soe.sony.com <br />
&quot;This is the big dog of the contact addresses. This is the place to send feedback, suggestions, complaints, compliments, and almost anything else. When email is received at this address, it is forwarded to the proper person or department. &quot;<br />
<br />
eqfeedback@soe.sony.com <br />
&quot;Have suggestions for the game? Think something can be done better? Send an email to this address and provide your feedback about EverQuest. But be warned, chances are very slim that a response to an email will ever be made. This address was created mainly as a one-way street to learn what the players want in regards to EverQuest. &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Good work, Henora! Anybody got that contact info for Mobhunter?<br />
<br />
So, the distribution plan will be:<br />
<br />
1. Post here, duh.<br />
2. One email to Brenlo - please don't spam the guy and make him hate us! I created an email address called one_voice_for_shaman that I would use to send the email<br />
3. Post on mobhunter<br />
4. Post on TNZ (not sure how that will go over!)<br />
5. Individual emails to eqmail@soe.sony.com<br />
6. Individual emails to eqfeedback@soe.sony.com<br />
7. Snail mail, I'm SO doing that :)<br />
<br />
If there is another issue you would like addressed (melee, dots, pets, winged courier) please submit it separately from the proposal email!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I really haven't read Mobhunter since Moorgard left.<br />
<br />
I think it's coray@mobhunter.com for the new guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I admit to not being familiar with Mobhunter. It's been suggested by a couple of posters though, so I'm going to follow their suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Regarding mobhunter, they seem to have two links (and no email for the new maintainer).<br />
<br />
This is the link to submit an article:<br />
<br />
http://www.mobhunter.com/submit-article.jsp<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how if the present maintainer actually reads these submissions.  The state of mobhunter is anything but clear at the moment (apparently the next patch scheduled is for August, 2003 and planes of power is sure going to be a hot item when it is released), but the above link seems to be worth a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I also support the snail mail option in addition to any electronic notifications.  I was highly involved in another activist effort in the entertainment industry, and we mobilized enough people world-wide to blizzard the subject company with hard-copy mail in a very short time period.  It made quite an impression on the company executives.  The fact that people must take the time and energy to produce and mail paper makes much more of a statement than email, which is easy to delete or filter.<br />
<br />
I will sign any thread in support of this proposal.  Were I queen of the world, I would prioritize things a bit differently, but we as a community need to stand together to elicit needed changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would suggest emailing (faster than snail - time is an issue) suitable people on Verant with the proposal linking to various suitable threads on this board.<br />
<br />
I see no need in posting it on other forums since that will almost certain result in other classes whining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I fully support this proposal . I will /feedback it and snailmail it if glori and Henora , ect Agree thats what we should do . Very good job standing up for us Glori/Henora and the rest of you as well .</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Vigdis I conceed emailing is faster but as Thlexian said snail mail is more likely to make an impression. Think about it are you more likely to read a letter or an email whose subject tells them what the gist of the message is and therefore likely to make them hit the delete key like they seem to have so very many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It always bugged me that Devs don't communicate on this board.   Other class boards over the years haven't had the same problem.  <br />
<br />
Appears that our small faction of player community is main reason.  Surely Dev's would not bypass our boards for any other reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Post it here. I'm not 100% sure the devs visit our forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Adinaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I whole-heartedly agree with these suggestions. Henora's intro looks intelligent and well expressed. I think one copy in each of these venues is a good idea as long as there are enough supporting shaman signatures attached to get their attention. Thanks Gloriana for all your hard work in putting together a united message from the shaman community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Neferbastet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I would post here and make sure to email a copy with signatures to SOE. Snail mail is an excellent idea, it puts a face behind the message and a signature may have more of an effect than emailing. The idea about posting on TNZ or other sites gives me a bad feeling. I don't want to see any of these great ideas picked apart by the ignorant and you know they will try to make us look like whiners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Another place to post would be the Developer's Corner, which is (or at least was at one point) the supposed place for players to send feedback in directly to the dev team.  The URL for sending in info is: http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_feedback.jsp</div></div><hr />

Alan Crosby, aka Brenlo - acrosby@soe.sony.com<br />
Community Relations ManagerSo THAT'S who he is? I've been wondering why we'd even care about his opinions/posts. Now I know.<br />
<br />
However, I never would have never guessed he was in charge of &quot;community relations&quot; with the disdain and disrespectful tone I've seen in some of his responses/posts regarding the Shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have read the proposal and support it in full. One--where do we sign on. Two, I suggest that you fax, regular mail, and e-mail. <br />

<br />
Also, I recommend that you link to the message in the developer's corner. Do not spam the e-mail boxes or link on other gamer's forums. IMHO, business handling of personalized faxes is highest priority, overnight mail gets high priority, too, and regular mail gets higher priority than e-mail. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">pssst not yet, eximius!! :) hold that thought<br />
<br />
Okay, if most people are mostly satisfied with the proposal, I'm going to &quot;launch&quot; it today.<br />
<br />
Here's the plan:<br />
<br />
1. One big post here, which I would encourage supporters to &quot;sign&quot;. Remember, you don't have to agree with everything! If you have friends/guildmates that don't read/post very much (or at all) please encourage them to post.<br />
<br />
2. One post on The Newbie Zone. I will include the link on our boads if you'd like to post your support. Please, don't argue with any dissenters on that board. <br />
<br />
3. One email to Alan (I will send it, I made a special hotmail account just for this purpose!)<br />
<br />
4. One email to the contacts provided at mobhunter with a request for them to please post the proposal<br />
<br />
coray@mobhunter.com <br />
<br />
5. All posters encouraged to cut and paste the Proposal into email to the two SOE suggestion email addresses:<br />
<br />
eqmail@soe.sony.com  <br />
eqfeedback@soe.sony.com <br />
<br />
<br />
6. All posters encouraged to print/mail the Proposal via snailmail. Sure, it might be too slow for this launch, but it might be helpful for future expansions<br />

<br />
I did get a bounce back from the Mobhunter address listed above. Anyone else have another contact?</div></div><hr />

Tsk, tsk, tsk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Posting it on the TNZ board is probably counter-productive. There are very few people who post there that can see past their own magelo let alone see things through another classes eyes. Don't expect anything but &quot;This doesn't belong here&quot;, &quot;Close this thread&quot;, &quot;Quit whining&quot;, &quot;You quit whining&quot; etc. I understand why you posted it there but the feedback you'll receive on it from that community will make you wonder how those people tie their own shoes let alone know how to work a computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yes, my first thought was NOT to post it on TNZ, but some posters thought I should.</div></div><hr />
