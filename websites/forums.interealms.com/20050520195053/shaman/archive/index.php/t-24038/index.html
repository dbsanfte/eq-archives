<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Miyna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok me and my friend were talking about shaman melee dmg he said they wouldn't be able to hit over 200 with a 1hb.<br />
 <br />
I think hes wrong personally so could you hit over 200 with a 1hb?<br />
http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=29728 <br />
if you had this wepon would it be possible?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks in advance:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If its possible, and I have no clue, this weapon would take you closer:<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22386<br />
<br />
+10% to 2hb and a base dmg of 50.<br />
<br />
But hey, if you want to just hit for big numbers, might as well go with a good proc:)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The max damage, if I recall correctly is something like:<br />
<br />
(Strength + Weapon skill) x 0.01 x weapon damage<br />
<br />
So, assuming at least 300+ strength and 200+ skill (or some combination that adds up to at least 500) then yes, theoretically, a shaman could hit for 200+ with a 40 damage 1h weapon<br />
<br />
For me, personally, max damage with that weapon would be<br />
<br />
(285 + 205) x 0.01 x 40 = 196 so no cigar for me, but close!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With the PoWater weapon, I max hit for 137 with a strength of 315.  Just FYI.  The procs more than make up for the damage that the weapon does =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">with 239 STR, and 206 piercing, my max melee with a TA (28/23) is 117.<br />
<br />
i get the same max melee with pushing my str, dex and agi all to 355 (stat cap at 69 is 325) using Ancestral Aid and Ferine Avatar. so.... according to his formula:<br />
<br />
(355 + 206) x .01 x 28 = 157.08<br />
<br />
157 is my max melee hit... and.. I'm not passing 117.  *shrugs*  I don't melee THAT much, and really, I'd use http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10201 (albeit a 2hander) to try to hit for 200+ heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
with a 50 35 2hb weapon i hit for 210 at 65 200 skill 305 str, so if you found a  1hb near 50 it might be possible, i havent really check too see what happens with the skill increase and stats increase. (and mellee types with that hit for 300+)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">168 is my max hit with a 40 damage 1hb weapon. I'll let you guys do the math, I'm too tired atm.. that's with about 1650 atk or so.<br />
<br />
I think that would mean about 48 or 49 dmg would get you up to 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With the PoWater weapon, I max hit for 137 with a strength of 315. Just FYI. The procs more than make up for the damage that the weapon does =).I'm level 69, and even with 410 str I still can't hit for more than 134 unless I have that +5% melee thing.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking there's some sort of cap to the amount of max hit increase strength can provide. with that formula I should be hitting for drumroll... 200!<br />
<br />
We really need to lobby to get this high strength damage cap thing removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would guess you could do it if you got really lucky, get a bracer of exploration and a 40 dmg 1hb so you can crit in melee, and then crit on a max hit, that should get you over 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brihanna Iceravyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Using a Hammer of Hours, I've crit melee'd for 222...no clue what the bard was singing that let me melee crit, but it's the only thing I can figure out that let me crit.  So yeah, if you're counting crits, you can hit for over 200 with a 1hb.</div></div><hr />
