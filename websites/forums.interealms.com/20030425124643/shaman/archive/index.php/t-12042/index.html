<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Contagion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There IS an Item that comes from The Deep, which is a very nice Shaman Spear.<br />
It has a clickable DD that is a little less damage, but also with a slightly lower cast time than Winter's Roar.<br />
I don't think the difficulty of the encounters required in order to get the item is in any way comparable, however.<br />
Pretty sweet Spear though, if I may say so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">THO has been a bit avoided since they changed DoT stacking.<br />
<br />
Honestly, by the time you can get an item that is comparable to the JBB for an iksar, you will no longer need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Radag was a 52 iksar shaman that I deleated.<br />
<br />
Now I am an Ogre and no longer have JBB problems :).</div></div><hr />

Hope that crutch helps ya out.</div></div><hr />

The Iksar just like to cry a lot like the French.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, so how was the Iksar so much of a lesser challenge? With the gimp jbb crutch for the other 2, and Iksar having a 20% penalty also, where was this difference in the &quot;challenge&quot;?<br />
<br />
Not that it really matters, I didn't choose the Iksar for the challenge, I like them and have other Iksar characters also, but I've never heard such a stupid statment.</div></div><hr />
