<br />
They're supposed to go down with the ship.<br />
<br />
Today I was in a docks group, our puller got three (for some reason) but that wasn't the worst part by far. Our MT fell because of a CH being a split second late. The Enchanter falls from trying to mez. But I have had experience with plenty of whacky pulls, and especially on blue mobs the best chance of survival is to maloxxless slow everything in sight and just pray it lands, at least that's what I do. I don't mind dying if I save the cleric and can get a quick rez, so agro doesn't bother me, and 3 unslowed mobs running around without a MT is quite fatal. <br />
<br />
So I land all 3 slows without a flaw. The MT is down, and all the aggro is on me, expected.<br />
<br />
But I glance at my battle spam window, and no melee messages are flying by, except for the mobs hittin me. I look around and the only people still here are me and the CLERIC. Our second warrior and Rogue didn't die. Not by a longshot. They ran as fast as they could the instant they saw the pull for the zone out. Now I dont exactly have the best equipment, but I was having no trouble taking the damage from these 3 slowed mobs. Thats what slow does. If they hadn't have run, there would have been no problem. even the rogue could have tanked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So the moral of the story is, sorry melees, but unless I or another caster says run away, dont. I dont care what it LOOKS LIKE to you, you stay, and take the punishment until we say you can run, because the fact is that we know far better than you do what the situation is looking like, because we know when spells will land and when heals are coming.<br />
<br />
<br />
that is all.</div></div><hr />

I can't count the number of times I've been left high and dry by the rest of the group running away, only  to land slow on mobs then proceed to root/rot and tank them one at a time.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From a melee perspective.  Just remember that while you may be bound just over at the zone line, they are probably bound all the way back in Paineel, or even PoK.  Most times a melee class dies, if they dont have a res available its a long ass run back to their corpse.  Sometimes, if things are looking bad its quicker to zone and survive, and be back at the camp in 5 minutes, than to go down fighting and spend the next half an hour on CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sanosake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sometimes, if things are looking bad its quicker to zone and survive, and be back at the camp in 5 minutes, than to go down fighting and spend the next half an hour on CR.<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
If you have a dead Shaman, Cleric, Enchanter and Warrior, you run to zone, come back, and sit around for half a hour anyway because the others need to be rezzed.<br />
<br />
And in the first place, NOBODY should be running, ever. If you wipe, you wipe,  but if you can FD, Escape, or Gate to a nearby place (only when all the melee's have gone down or you're about to die) then you lucked out. If you can't do any of that, sit on your sorry ass and die.<br />
<br />
You run, you  risk the lives of every innocent bystander on your warpath. Is your life more important than the lives of possibly  6+ unsuspecting people? No.<br />
<br />
Never, ever run, no matter what. No, I don't care about your 2% lost exp and half a hour. YOUR 2%  lost exp and half a hour is better than 6 people's 2% and half a hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Meecham - I disagree.<br />
If the melee stay, the group will probably survive.  Survival in a group means the cleric lives, and can rez any we lost.<br />
If the cleric is bound within a short distance, such as the zone line, rezzes will come qucikly even if the cleric dies.<br />
If you run, you will be remembered as a melee abandons the group.<br />
<br />
Sanosake makes good points, too.  The fastest way for a dead melee to get back to the group is to get a rez.  If the rezzer is dead, might as well travel or bank or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Top priority is to make sure the cleric Gates/Camps/Zones..then rez'ing is a non-issue.<br />
<br />
N00b druid pulled a spider, raven, and a treant behind her running to the docks camp in PoN.   The rest of the group turned around, disbanded or otherwise ran away when the dr00d suddenly came up dead.<br />
<br />
Slowed and rooted all three of em.  A passing druid (note the difference) offered to kite away the spider (I assume he wanted silks), and I proceeded to VERY slowly root/rot the tree and the raven without a pet up.<br />
<br />
I sat there at the riverside BEGGING my group to come back and join me while the tree and raven slowly died.  While I had a bit of a problem getting the raven to finally lay down, it was mobs 0 Csin 2 at the end of the match.<br />
<br />
Needless to say I disbanded from that group and will never join them again.<br />
<br />
Group needs to stick together.  There's a bloody GRAVEYARD in that zone and people still act like N00bs in WC running to the toll booth.</div></div><hr />

I mean what's the worst that can happen?  A 15-minute wait for the corpse to pop, a rez, and you're back in business.  Melee are going to be bound in PoK anyway and that's only two zones away.

Peeps like that have probably never seen the inside of a dungeon :)<br />

Also correct me if I'm wrong but I thouht once you camped the docks in PoN that the only way out was to gate/evac/succor/TL. So I'd like to know where those melee thought there were going hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem with this is they get into the habit of doing this and continue to do so in POP zones.<br />
<br />
I never run. Period. Heck even with guild groupage they have to drag me to zone. <br />

I have embarrased folks in pickup groups when they run and zone back in to find me standing over the very mobs they ran from. :)</div></div><hr />

Either way, do it where your group is.<br />

People that train the innocent drive me crazy.  To save themselves a fraction of a percentage of experience loss, they kill as many people as they happen to pass while they run screaming by.  Argh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If someone stays to take one for the team, then you owe it to them to make it out alive.  There's a certain bit of satisfaction of saving everyone else in the group, but nobody likes it when you die, and then everyone else dies even though you told them to run for it.  The whole 'pointless sacrifice' thing. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i agree about the running thing, just stay and die, and work on a rez or deal with the xp loss (im a newbie i dont know too many people so i think of all the times i died i been rezzed once or twice - so maybe im a little more used to the xp loss than others and dont view it as that bad lol). however, it does remind me of a time recently when i was soloing hg's. they are a bit tough for my level, but i can handle them. so im beating on one, when all of a sudden, i see 3 people running past me. first thing i said was oh crap train lol (at least they could announce it if they running from one). so here comes the &quot;train&quot; - one giant lol....well of course it finds me appealing and starts whacking me. to make matters worse, another person comes running past me and yet a third hg decides he dont like shamans too much. needless to say, i did run then, for one i was hoping those who ran would zone back and find em right in thier face, and two, i wasn't dying because of people who cant control their single pulls. i may not be the best shaman, but i kill what i pull or it kills me - it isnt fair for others to suffer from your mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Being a melee first, I am quite used to the stay and die.  I agree that sometimes that even if 1-2 people die, the remainders can finish off the mobs.  My main concern always is for the cleric to live, weather by evac, camp, zone.  If there are no healers left, many times I've appointed the group to run while I 'distract' the mob(s) giving group time to escape before I attempt a FD if it has been deemed under no uncertain terms a hopeless situation.  Contrarily I have also been 'raised' in EQ by a group of RL friends, who's motto is best summed as &quot;Failure is not an option&quot;.  I've been privy to take part is numerous battles that even seasoned 'stand and fighters' would pale at.  Sometimes we die, but more often we live, sometimes several casualties, sometimes none.  And even been in situations where the RUN has been called and high-tailed my tushie for the zone.  But in a game that can get repetative, these situations make things fun.  <br />
<br />
But this is more of a person issue than classes.  I've even seen many of 'dress-boys' stand and take it like a man.  People these days are too afraid to die, too afraid to try things 'risky', too afraid to have other than the 'perfect' group.  A friend of mine was in a BoT group that refused the only LFG chanter in area because they didnt have command of drizzle (subsequently broke up because they never did - boy was she mad at them)  Have seen 59 clerics turned away because they weren't able to cast Aego, even from groups desperately looking for clerics.  Seen Pallies and SK's turned down for MT because they weren't born 'warriors' (/boggle...but that's a different rant all together).<br />
<br />
People have just gotton spoiled and soft.  Always looking for the easiest and fastest way to get where their going.  <br />
<br />
The guy who said that he 'embarassed' runners by staying and soloing the mobs, /salute, I've been there.  It's a great feeling to see them slink back in, only wish you could see their faces in RL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What bugs be more are people calling for run with 3 (count them: 3 ******* mobs) in a regular PoN-camp. That was a full group with more than enough mana to get situation under control. /boggle I never get, how people ever plan to improve their gameplay, when they avoid every single dangerous situation?<br />
<br />
I am not perfect in any sense of the word  ;) , but i remember some fun fights with up to 10 mobs (ok, not in PoP ...) including adds and we survived. People just miss this things, when they run every time like chicken.</div></div><hr />

As a former warrior, I concure it is the melees duty to die for the group, and it is the cleric's duty to make sure thier efforts and sacrifice arent wasted by getting away safely to rez again shortly.  However, there is just one comment I can't agree with...<br />
<br />
Is your life more important than the lives of possibly  6+ unsuspecting people? No.<br />
<br />
Oh you damn right it is.  Why?  cuz its mine.  Its my 12bucks, my free time spent, and my enjoyment out of the game.  Sure, I'm not gonna train ppl intentionally, and I always /shout when I run (this is almost exclusively solo, as in groups I havent had a need to run in 40lvls).  Because after all it is my reputation too.  But when its a matter of life and death, I'm only looking out for number 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">In respons to the original poster, I'd say thats more just bad habits of the players involved.  For example I was just in a group where the cleric (/boggle) ran for the zone like his pants where on fire first chance of trouble (suffisive to say they didn't stay in our group long after that).  Good communication is the foundation of any good group if you dont got it, your group wont survive long.<br />
<br />
Edit:  In regards to Ridik's post.  While yes that may be true and yes you pay for the game and you spend your time in the game, I will point out that this isn't a consol game and it is a community based game.  So while it is entirely your right to play that way, and I can't really fault your comments, it is a selfish attitued to have in a game that is based around player interaction so you can't blame folks that might respond negatively to that oppinion, just food for thought /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">&quot;warriors are supposed to stand and fight till they die&quot;...yeah right, next you're gonna tell my warrior to start using that Taunt button just so he can take the hits instead of the little guys in the robes!!   :D  <br />
<br />
On a slightly serious note...anyone that plays a warrior that's worried about dying should play something else.  The role of the warrior is to take the beating so everyone else can do the damage.  <br />
<br />
I don't have any problem with someone running from a train (as long as they yell out what entrance they are going to well before they get there - and it shouldn't happen often), but the warrior should always be the last one to run.  Of course, if I've just spent 4 hours working the group to a good spot, I'd much rather have everyone but the cleric get wiped and do the rez's then run/evac to the zone and have to work my way back to the spot.<br />

I agree as a warrior was my first char i made, i have to agree with most of what ppl said here But.... if there is a bad pull i as a main tank if i saw it going down badly would tell everyone in group to zone gate whatever  but get the He** out of there.<br />
As a tank it is your job to die.  and let the other group members go,<br />

    When things get rough i try and save the cleric. My warrior it didnt matter where i was bound i lived or died in zone.

My pally i have trouble with cuz sometime he is the rez and i dont always think of camping for rez.

Sometimes this leads to the most fun moments in EQ, but more often than not if I call run and people don't, we will die.<br />

For those who say never, ever run.... I disagree. In most PoP zones where you are almost sure to train someone, I agree. In other places, e.g. Old Sebilis if nobody is camping zoneout, I had no qualms about running from NG or DHall to the exit if things looked bad for the group.</div></div><hr />

Ok so the people who camp at the zone out, so that they can zone if they are trained, are the men?  If you camp at zone out, expect trains, that is why you are camped there, next to the zone out, use it in case of train, pull your head out of your butt and zone if you are camping the zone out.  Staying and dying at the zone out and bitching to zone about train that you were expecting (eventually) at the zone out is not real smart.  Yeah so be a man and die and stuff, cuz men do stupid things, we all know that, just whatever you do, dont train the zone out, cuz people are fighting things there so they can zone quickly if things go bad.<br />
<br />
9 year old girls can play this game smartly too, don't see why you are picking on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they are pussies too.<br />
<br />
However, nowhere in my post did I mention ANYTHING about camping zone in. I don't know which dimension of the universe you were on when I made my post, but it says nothing about camps.<br />
<br />
But in case you did not know, my post's general referrence is to people who camp, say, Kitchen/bar in Sebilis, train to zone thereby training people at Jail, possibly Necrosis/Guardian if it blindsides someone or some funky pathing happens. So for the sake of 2 or 3 people's survival, they risked the lives of 12 people or more.<br />
<br />
Before you say, &quot;but.. but... Sano!! They camped behind us, they should expect trains!!&quot; don't say it. Don't look stupid in public. You know as well as I do if you can't handle an area, get the **** out safely. Or just die there, because I know **** DOES happen, and ask someone to help you get your rogue/monk/etc to grab some corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Another thing thing to point out is that you don't have to be camping the zone line to get trained there.  There are certain zones that seem to always be trained as I'm zoning in, most notably every zone in Maiden's Eye and The Grey.  It really isn't fair to others that people bring 35 mobs to the zone, half of which have a tendency to zone camp, just because they don't know how to pull, or don't know how to travel through a zone without aggroing every mob in a 20 mile radius.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">It depends where and when you do things. Running to zout in seb because you pulled 15 frogs is fine if you do a /who and only you come up. Same for pop if you don't want to die I guess, although those zones are populated.<br />
<br />
About dealing with 3+ mobs. It really depends how they come. If puller sees he is bringing 3 and then runs them around as they get tagged 1 by 1 a few seconds apart it's no problem. If they come in one after the other it's no problem. If the puller panics, pulls 3+ unslowed 560+ hitters it's a bit rougher. Takes at least 12 seconds to slow them all without resists or the cleric may throw off a heal and take aggro when he shouldn't. It's happened a few times that the cleric died because he threw a heal right away, but we survived after root parking/slowing was done easily.<br />
<br />
As for soloing 3+ pulls in tier 2-3 zones.....you seem to be more talented than me I guess. I can't survive 3+ unslowed aggro simultaneously to slow them all, especially if they are immune to root/snare. If you have a group though, they should easily be able to handle it if everyone makes sure the damage is disperesed until it can be handled properly. Again, if it's just adds, that's totally different.<br />
<br />
Either way, running is pointless in most places. Run back and rez + buff + med time is not THAT much longer than zone and run back and med time. Especially for a melee, if you run you aren't getting a heal, or xp or anything. If you die, you will most likely get rezzed up and healed quickly. <br />
<br />
This is all of course assuming the train was unintentional  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Wake up and smell your own BO...<br />
<br />
In old world zones trains to zone are common.  Its the way you avoid dying.  Common courtesy was to shout that a train was coming, and everyone did their best to avoid it.<br />
<br />
In PoP that changed.  With graveyards making CR easy, and clerics with rez sticks hanging around (not to mention laughable exp los on death, and high exp gain from kills) the common practice has changed to stand and die, get a rez, and get back to killing mobs.<br />
<br />
The two situations are very different.  Some people do take a while to adjust to this.<br />
<br />
Yes, I am arogant, Yes, mine is the only opinion that counts.  No I dont really care about your inconvenience... I dont train people on purpose, and have never been a grief player.  But if you bitch at me in game because my actions inconvenienced you, I will readily tell you to go F yourself and ignore you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It even applies in PoP zones. My druid and shaman likes to camp along the wall pretty far away from the zone out, but many Courtyard groups train through there every once in a while. And I'm often not the only one- I often see about 5 people nearby. And when the trains happen, usually is only one person.<br />

<br />
I must admit I am rather amused that you are defending a guy who does not care about you, nor respects you. If you expect me to show respect to a child who plainly said that he has no respect for my time, my money, and my enjoyment, you must be out of your mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">From my understanding of the game, in a raid only the Raid Leader should call evac/camp whatever.. and in xp groups ONLY the shaman should be calling camp run whatever.. <br />
<br />
My reasoning is if the cleric calls run and I can heal/slow and keep up then he doesn't have the right to.. if the cleric can't keep up heals, he can run we can take care of the action w/o him.. ONLY the slower will know what kind of damage the group can sustain and so only the slower should be calling evac.. I've had clerics camp out many times and they just come back in 5 min to continue the healing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I agree that any melee who runs should not be in a group. they were probably a soloing druid that wanted to have a melee alt, so they PLed up the warrior/melee and without knowing what to do in a group they are now way up there.<br />
<br />
I believe, that it should not be the healer, but the crowd controller (and I don't like crowd control, I like damage control, cause all that is done is control how much damage is being done to the group in a time frame) who calls for the evac/zone, as they are ultimately knowledgable (have to be even) on how much damage the group is really going to be taking. <br />
<br />
so if there is an enchanter, it is their job to not only do damage control, but they make the ultimate call on the evac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">There is a ranger I group with regularly who NEVER runs.  Why? Because he has faith in the fact that if I have manna or hps left then there is still a chance that we could win.  Ironically, he also says Im the best shaman he has ever grouped with, and is constantly amazed when we turn a 5 mob pull into 5 corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Have to agree and personally I think if a shaman is in group and is level 58 or higher he should be the one to call run? Why? because a shaman can hold a tricky situation together 10 times longer then a cleric can. Between slow canni and our crap ch ( which isn't so crappy in some situations ). I can remember this one time we were killing gargs/nettlings etc in pon and we got like 10 adds. Not all at one but in a row basically. We would be killing one mob and then another mob would add or two more would add.  They wanted to succor about the 4th mob we got when the cleirc was getting low mana. I calmly had the druid cancel the succor mid cast and told the cleric to sit and med and heal when ready. Then began to heal/torpor/canni like crazy and held it together. <br />
<br />
People just don't push themselves at all and truthfully they never had even in the old days. <br />
<br />
My first char was a necro that I took to 54 before i quit 2-3 weeks into kunark. Basically I was able to do the same thing back then by root parking/soloing 2, 3, sometimes 4 adds. A lot of classes have this ability and well the melees just have to listen to these classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>harowen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Having both a high level shammy and a high level monk, I have to comment that from the pulling point of view you really ought to know what kind of pull you have coming.  When I'm pulling I know either that I'm pulling what my group can handle, or else I got unlucky and pulled too much or aggro passed badly or whatever.  <br />
<br />
Needless to say if I just pulled a supremely bad pull (which really takes effort to do in POP) and I get unlucky with FD I just die and let someone drag my corpse back to get ressed.<br />
<br />
From the shaman point of view, if I'm joining a pickup group I announce to them that I mitigate damage better than my monk does and have stoicism so don't worry about me getting beat on.  Then proceed to explain that I'll offtank adds while I park them if there's no enchanter around.  That way when I start getting hit they're prepared for it and expecting it.<br />
<br />
When there is low morale, people who panic and/or don't follow orders, or people who don't know your capabilities and so are expecting the worst when you start getting hit; those are where the problems come from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all I was defending myself, not someone whom I don't know.  Second of all I was much more interested in pointing out that you were being hipocritical than I was in defending anyone.<br />
<br />
As you read through the posts try to count up the ones that don't try to insult someone.  To me its rather amazing the number of people who feel their argument is too weak by itself.<br />
<br />
For the record I don't like trains either and I do my best not to train people.  The situation I was describing before is rather sad, and all too common and one of my pet peeves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I wish that I could instill this into my RL ranger friend.  I mean, I've never seen someone survive so many encounters...especially being the &quot;Hunter&quot; that he is.  He has been the only surviver to a Servitor of Luclin fight before.  He has been the only surviver to a Velk kill before.  How did this happen...by backing away and letting everyone else around him die while he does nothing.  We once wiped to a PoP boss once (the mini in CoD that spawns the 4x skellies everytime that someone dies) and as I was sitting there in PoK waiting for someone to get back and drag the bodies and the rez to come... he runs up to me in full gear.  So I ask him what happened.  He said that as soon as he saw the first couple of skellies..he used his gate potion that I made for him /boggle<br />
<br />
I just don't understand.  I once had three mobs from around the PoV outer camp that wiped out all but me and two others from my party.  I slowed and basically root/rotted those three, while one zoned out and back in..and the necro stayed FD.  He asked me if I was going to zone out..and I told him prob. not.  So, he gets up and comes over and saw what was happening and eventually started to help me.  It just straight blew him mind that I didn't run, but stayed and keep fighting them.  Granted, I had a lot of room to keep running around while keeping them slowed and rooted...but it was funny listening to him comment on how I didn't zone out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Grrrr! Again! Why do I get into pickup groups!<br />
<br />
Accidentally pulled 2 robots (pulled named and a corroded came) in PoI.  Group wasn't full yet.<br />
<br />
I failed a slow (eeek!), but I had torpor on, and as soon as I could recast I did. I slowed both mobs even though my health dropped to 20 percent, I knew Torpor could out-heal two slowed blues.<br />
<br />
When i looked up, my group was gone. <br />
<br />
I didn't have pet up, zone was empty, so I decided to zone out and reset.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">LMAO Csin!<br />
People so scared in PoP.  It's really pathetic.  The PoI zone-in area is the worst.  <br />
<br />
I've been known to train the zone a few times.  I used to do it without compunction in old world zones.  Couple trains from Korukusk to zone out usually would wipe Chardok clean of the persistant AE groups!  That was fun.  Training from freeti to zone out in solb was also amusing.  Training is fun!  <br />
<br />
In PoP there's less excuse for trains, but they still happen.  I don't hunt in Tier I zones however, so I rarely have to put up with the **** I am hearing about on this post.</div></div><hr />
