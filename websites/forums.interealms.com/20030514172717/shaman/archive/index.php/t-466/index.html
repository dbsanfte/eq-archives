<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya, new poster here. I'm on Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
         I have a question for all you 50+ duelers and expert soloers :). I am currently trying to raise the pp for a JBB, and should have it soon. I know that can make soloing much easier, and provides much support in duels. However, I have 1 dilema. I dueled a shaman a while ago when I was like...40-45ish. He was 1 lvl lower than me, but he did have the same spells, so I'm not sure exactly what lvl. Anyway, we were dueling it and it came down to just us. Pets dead, no mana. I thought he would be like me and not melee but med up to see who would get off the 1st nuke. But then he layed in on me with some 2hb weapon that frikin tore me apart. I'm 51 now and he is a newer member in my guild. We often have in-guild dueling events and I hope to face him sooner or later. Now, I know that 50+ we are sposed to go Ac/Hp over Wis, and I am making an effort to do so. However I would like to know something. Should I go 1hb, 2hb, or 1hp. My melee skills are very low since anything I solo never touches me due to pet agro/slow/DoTs. I currently have a Dark Ember for my 1hb, but that really has a HORRIBLE dmg/dly ratio of 12/36 :(. Now, I recently traded for a Barbarian Spiritist's Hammer. It is 22/46 (not sure about 46, might be a little lower or higher), but the trump card is that it procs Winter's Roar, just as our JBB. I don't expect to be getting my epic soon, but it isn't IMPOSSIBLE to obtain sooner or later. My question... Is the hammer worth dishing my Spitestone Shield in duels (17ac / 10Wis) and a different decent 1hb or Rune Etched Icewurm Fang? The Icewurm Fang is 12/19 and procs a 81 DD, but would probably cost me a pretty penny. Should I go with the hammer and forget about getting a fang until I get my epic, then go with that? Or is the proc not worth it and should I attempt to get a Primal/Heavy/Weighted/Etc. Velium 2hb, 1hb, or 1hp? It's all so confusing! HELP ME!  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok..the archetype for shamans is the rough-hewn figure with the spear and shield..it looks cool and is very effective for most of the encounters that a shaman will have.<br />
<br />
However for soloing, and I'm guessing for PVP, a bit of flexibility is in order.  2hb damage (my hammer) for a 52 shaman(me) with 200+ str can be up to 95 per round.  Add in a decent proc and it's no wonder you get owned in PVP.  Add up all the rounds that your spear procs (even if it IS an 80hp dd or more) and you are still being outdamaged.<br />
<br />
My suggestion? For PvP make up inventory and melee slots for quick equipment changes like Bards.   When you are out of mana swap to the high damage output weapon and lose the shield.  Fully buffed with my Hammer of Scourge I can do 60+points per hit and with dex buffs procs a 500hp dot repeatedly with the 40point DD component of Scourge.  <br />
<br />
I'm a 52 iksar shaman, and fully buffed I can get up to around 2800hps or so (maybe more...I didn't look recently).  After a few rounds of spellcasting, and maybe a few JBB shots from a barbarian foe I'm sure to be hurting and well under half my hit points.  However, I also have an Iks BP, natural regen and regrowth on all the time, so I'm regenning quite a bit per turn.  With my Chill spine I can hit probably 12-26 per round (plus procs of course).  Discounting the procs, that means I can probably regen hps' faster than I could stab myself!  The key here is high damage output.  If it's me with spear vs an opponent with the same regen with a hammer, I am going to be a dead lizard much faster than I can poke my opponent to death.<br />
<br />
To sum up: For last ditch toe-to-toe fighting, I dont' hit too often, so i better make it count.  For raids and groups you'll find me with a spear and shield 'cause nothing beats it for building a mana pool. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have no experience with dueling, but the Runewood Great Staff (2H Blunt, 22/40) is cheap and great for smacking stuff around if you don't care about AC and stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Never used 2hb.  Ever.  1hb and Piercing.<br />
<br />
Now have Barbarian Spiritist's Hammer and Mortificator Staff, and wishing I could hit more.  Thank goodness procs go off swings and not connects.  Kinda cool to proc three times in a row for 750 cold damage and do a whole ONE point crushing damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dueling you need to know your oponents weakness.<br />
<br />
high damage 2hb's are amazing.  in duels with other shamans i use almost all my mana on heals.<br />
<br />
currently my hammer is 33/44 so i tend to hit pretty hard.  the other shammy will first resort to dots....i'll simply cure myself then contunue swinging.  slam as much as possible to interupt casting.  if they get a nook off...fine..heal it off then laugh.  continue swinging.  by the time the oponent starts to mellee he will be down on mana and will slowly die...but yes..they will die.<br />
<br />
the reason why you dont need the shield is because most shammy's don't mellee...so they wont try to hit you.  you dont need the extra AC.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
you got 2800HP's self buffed at lvl 52?  wow...i want your gear! i 'm ogre and self buffed i got like 2200hp's.....god i lack..:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A bit of a typo there..my hp's are more like 2k-ish self-buffed, considerably higher with full raid buffs (cleric, ect)..I was hoping nobody would catch that..:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For duels Im usually useing a runed etched icewurm fang,  12 19 is better then even the 20 30 epic, and the proc is nice, with our high selfbuffed dex (focus+VotB= easy255) a procer is the way to go.  Usein a barb spiritists hammer would be nice but Im an iksar and the fang works nicely. <br />
As far as skill... a couple days of soloing low/light blues will get those up NP, dont be lazy and max them all.</div></div><hr />
