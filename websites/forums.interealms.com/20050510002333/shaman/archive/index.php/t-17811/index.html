<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">61 Pet Nerfed. Tested in Cazic Thule, Droga, and LDoN. <br />
<br />
Before patch I could count on pet to hit the level 58 Tae Ew Warriors and Warders at entrance of Cazic Thule and to hit the upper 50's level mobs in Droga and LDoN adventures. The 61 pet could never really hit higher level mobs in Bastion of Thunder and such places. <br />
<br />
Now, even with pet buffed with Focus of Soul and Strength of the Diaku, Swift Like the WInd, and the pet buff, and dual-wielding, and the lizards debuffed with Cripple, in five fights the pet only hit one time for 18 points at Cazic Thule. I have tried this with other dark blue mobs since patch--for example in Droga and a LDoN adventure. Throughout the entire adventure, the pet never hit one mob. I think that after this last patch, the pet is totally useless except for farming greens and maybe light blues, and have stopped calling a pet. At least I know that suspended minion is now a worthless AA. It is better to save mana and forget about the pet entirely.<br />
<br />
Please test and let me know if your pets have weakened too.<br />

Do i detect someone who hasnt read all the various posts regarding pet dmg reporting ?<br />
In case you havent what basically happens is you wont see the reports of your pet hitting unless youre up close to him.You will however see his misses reported from a greater distance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just a suggestion? This last patch, they added a control in your Options to split off pet hits from pet misses, so you can turn off just one, just the other, or both. For some reason, pet misses defaulted to ON, which pet hits defaulted to OFF. So when I first pulled a pet up, all I was seeing was misses, and no hits. I yelled about it, and somebody in guild pointed out the new control button. Once I switched it, everything was fine again.<br />
<br />
Not saying that's your problem, but you might check it.<br />

That sounds right to me. It would also explain why he only saw 1 hit, because I still see my pet's final hit if he gets the kill shot on a mob, even when I have pet attacks turned off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That is it--new options are only reporting misses and final hits, and not hits other than final hits. I tank with my pet. I dot with my pet. I haste myself and have 200 weapon skill and am pretty well buffed myself. Those lizards go down pretty fast with or without pet. I only saw final hit when pet got the killing hit which did not happen often. Thanks for advice. It i s nice to know it is a reporting issue, not a damage issue.<br />
