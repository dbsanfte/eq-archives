<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A couple nights ago I contracted a Warlord Mastersmith to make me some new Ringmail leggings.  He was very reasonable on the price I think: less than 15k.  Here's what I am sporting now:<br />
<br />
Artificer's Ringmail Leggings <br />
AC: +22 Str: +10 Wis: +5 HP: +40 Mana: +40<br />
Weight: 3.0<br />
Classes: Rogue Shaman<br />
Races: Barbarian<br />
Deity: The Tribunal<br />
Inventory Slot: Legs<br />
<br />
They have a grey banded look, and would probably match perfectly with an Iksar Chestplate.<br />

The Artificers Belt (Skirt) would be an upgrade over spiderfur that I am wearing now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks again Gunter/Koblat.  I woulda given you credit by name, but I wasn't sure if you were ready for the potential influx of orders.  Once again I really appreciate the time you spent making my new legs.<br />

I have a sinking feeling us poor kitties are gonna get jobbed by religious gear coming out now and in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Jarcrap is good =0.. Didnt get a replacement till i was well into 60 thnx iksar.. and the fact that people give chain pants to rogues =0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have jarcrap for long time.  Switched servers and scored RE leggings to tie me over till I could get something better.  Moved to Thurg quest pants for the past few months.  Today I upgraded to <br />
Scalemesh pants from Rhag 2 in Ssra Temple.<br />
<br />
Scalemesh Leggings (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11985) <br />
<br />
I went down in mana and 5 wis but since I am running near 255 wis and have Can 5 (ie I am never below 60% mana) I gained in some STR and AC (offset in the removal of my IGS for peerless dragon mantle...HPs are a godsend for Can 5).   Guild not big into TOV that much any more so little hope of ever getting my KD quest leggings.<br />
<br />
Oh well always new pants to find out there.  ;)</div></div><hr />
