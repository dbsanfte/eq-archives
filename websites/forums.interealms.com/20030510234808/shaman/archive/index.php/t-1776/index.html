<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ridgey Didge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know if there is a post somewhere that describes how to get the tear?<br />
<br />
E.g<br />
<br />
1) You have to kill a goblem to get the child to spawn, where is this goblem and what is its spawn rate?<br />
<br />
2) How many people would be required to get to this goblem and to take him down?<br />
<br />
I'll try and see if I can get a map of POF to get some idea where it spawns, but a walkthrough for this bit would be nice ))<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />

<br />
Takes a pretty powerful team to kill golems - cannot guess at minimum number as I have always been in groups that were very overpowering (30ish peoples).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fright Terror and Dread are 3 of the minibosses in PoF... 4th been the Dracoliche. One of them has a DT which means the first pull needs to be done by a useless player (we use dorf pallies, and purposely fail so we get to watch them die again). Another has a nasty cold AoE and i cant remember the third ones ability. Anyway, Iksar Broodling spawns immediately at feet of these golems corpses, and drops the Tear (corpse lasts 8 minutes like normal corpses with items on)<br />
<br />
We are talking about a pretty large and well equipped guild raid to get to these guys quickly and nail them... 5 groups minimum i would say for a Non-ToV armour and equivalent weapon equipped guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2 of the golems have death touches, one has the ae cold.  I cant say for sure if all 3 spawn iksar broodlings, I think they do, but the one in the middle might not.<br />
<br />
I know I for sure have seen the broodling spawn from the one nearest the portal, and the one with the ae cold.<br />
<br />
Remember, the broodling doesnt have to spawn when you take down the golems.  Seems to be a 50/50 shot of it spawning.  Clearing all 3 golems, best spawn rate was 2 out of the 3.<br />
<br />
All the golems are very magic resistant (100%?  dunno).  I think wizard lures stuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ridgey Didge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey Urdegish,<br />
<br />
Interesting info... can you pop back and tell us how your raid got on, and which one of those had the Death Touch.<br />
I'm writting an updated file for this shaman epic as it lacks so much detail on all the boards. More so, if you like me and are an iksar.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<br />
First-hand witness to Dread Deathtouching my guildleader (MA) and our monk puller multiple times while we were clearing the side closest to zone in.  He was the only one up at the time.<br />
<br />
He gives a shout, calling out the victims name too.  Can DT from across the zone.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fright and dread have DT..or so it seems.<br />
<br />
Takes a full raid force..and make sure the golems are UP before you get your hopes up, they don't always spawn. Send a ranger or a druid in first..:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Indrii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did this last night.<br />
Closest to the portal was Fright.  He DT'ed (we sent in a low level ranger to take the DT for the raid, then had someone else pull him, as his DT has a longish recast time.  ranger got to the foot  of the hill before Fright Shouts &quot;Aregorne!&quot;, instant death.)and afterwards the broodling spawned on top of his corpse.  Our raid was wiped out immediately afterwards by the Dracoliche, but the broodling stayed spawned for another 30min while we regathered, he dropped the tear(I think he always does).<br />
     Next was Dread, he also DT'ed.  No broodling.<br />
Last and furthest was Terror, he's twice as tough as the other two...bring your cold resist gear for this guy, and buff up-- he has a 500pt AoE cold spell that hit me for between 180 and 250 with my CR at 202.  Oh yeah, and I think he dispells buffs too.  he spawned the broodling as well.<br />
We did this with 4 or 5 groups, but only 2-3 clerics and 2 chanters.<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ridgey Didge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm getting alot of conflicting reports on which ones of these mini boses actually Death Touches.<br />
<br />
1) I need to know which ones do?<br />
2) Which one doesn't?<br />
3) Whats the best way to take these down (DT ones)<br />
4) Best way to take down the one that doesn't DT<br />
5) What line of spells do each one cast?<br />
6) What line of spells works best on each of these different mini boses?<br />
<br />
I know its alot )<br />
<br />
Kind Regards, Ridgey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Fright and Dread DT.  Fright spawns the Iksar Child where and when he dies.  Dread does not.<br />
<br />
Terror does not DT, but he also spawns the Iksar Child where and when he dies.  He's got a cold AE.  I think he's easier than Fright actually.  <br />
<br />
How many people required totally depends on what people you have there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ssardos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Anybody ever try pulling one of the Deathtouchers with a cleric that casts DA? or a Necro with Harmshield?</div></div><hr />
