<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious to see if anyone has found good spots for either XP or better still some nice loot in the lower GoD tiers? Thinking of trying this to kill time before raids (getting bored with PoTactics now!) and looking for any suggestions on where to go.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">there are none .... you can solo very little ...<br />
butthat wich you can is not worth the time. the exp is worse than PoP.<br />
and the chance for the random loot is VERY VERY rare. <br />
some zones the mobs bow kite you ... immune to run effects, immune to slow, High MR .. depends on where, what mob.<br />
GoD is just plane nasty solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mobs in Qinimi near the zone from Natimbi are pretty easy solo for about 2% aaxp. /shrug<br />
<br />
The archers are obviously a bad idea since they range fight.  The Mastruk and Noc are easily root/rottable.  Spent about 15 minutes soloing at the zone just goofing off while waiting on a group and haven't bothered since, so I have no clue if there's much that's pullable and soloable beyond the zone area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beawolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've spent a little while soloing at the entrance to Ferubi, it takes a bit of work to get mobs split and debuffed, I typically malos and zone agro.  Zone in, root the non malos'ed mob and park the other semi close to the zone line, zone again to clear agro.  Re-root and debuff and then root rot.  You have to be careful as the mobs hit for around 1k double plus proc differing DD's.  Not really worth the effort for the xp, about 4-6% aaxp per kill, I'd put it on par with tactics ogre's for mob hp.  Fun to try but like the rest of GoD I've seen, the xp isn't all it could be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I solo matruq in KT when I'm waiting for a group, they hit hard, but the proc is easy to resist. Avoid the ukun though, they hit from max much more, and run fast. They don;t summon, and have about 25k hp, and get me 7% AAXP.<br />
Not particularly worthwhile, but a good time filler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can solo the ghost camp in natimbi, awfull bad xp but a fair shot at the named that drops a 20hp augment... Not that spectacular, but beter then some useless stat augs :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">20hp aug sounds worth spending a little time on for sure :)<br />
<br />
And if you can solo Ferubi zone in mobs, I guess that gives you a shot at the really nice MP4 range slot item (a very small shot, but a chance even so!) Might have to try that, will be interesting to see if VP is an effective tool for doing the CC work and splitting the spawns a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fount the very high DR make VP near useless in most of the GOD zones.  Find it is resisted more often than it lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'be soloed trash in Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, Ferubi and Sewers.  The xp is absolutely not worth it.  Ferubi mobs are a headache as Beawulf has said.  The only reason I have kept doing the Riwwi, Barindu and Qinimi mobs once I had established that I could, is for BiC drops.  Have got a couple of keys, and some random other bits so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The expeditions (talked about in a little more detail in another thread) are pretty fun to solo. Get them from Gamesh and they're all soloable. Plant is pretty tough though.. Some mobs summon and some mobs are unrootable so be careful. Never seen any named, just a place to play around in while bored or lfg.</div></div><hr />
