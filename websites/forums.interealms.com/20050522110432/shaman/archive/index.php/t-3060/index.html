Being a troll, you might be KOS to the North Karana guards.  One of them usually paths through the spires if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
But at level 15, the other spots are likely either very dangerous to get to, or a long ways away (unless you have a port).<br />
<br />
The Bazaar connects from the Nexus.  When you are in the Nexus, you port into the center of the zone.  There are four pathways that lead to four miniature spires where you can port back down to Norrath.  Three of these four tunnels lead to zones (one is a blocked passageway).<br />
<br />
The best method I have for knowing which one is the Bazaar is that the opening of the tunnel to it is guarded by one guard and a female that is not dressed like the other guards.  She seems out of place.  Look for her.  Or, you can hail each of the guards and they tell you which zone the passageway leads to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anywhere there is Wizard Spires I believe is a Nexus Scion to transport you to Luclin. There in NK, Faydark, Great Divide, Dreadlands, Toxx Forest, I believe that's it. <br />
Your best bet to get there or safest, would be to get a port to DL and take the Spires from there. The druid ring and Wizzy Spires are in the general vicinity. And yes you can bank in The Bazaar. You are also welcome in the Kitty city of Shar Val.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bazaar is the south passage from the Nexus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bazaar/Kunark spire -  South<br />
Antonica/Shadowhaved - East<br />
Odus/Velious/blocked tunnel - West<br />
Faydwer/Netherbien Lair - North<br />
<br />
EDIT: corrected information, was in a hurry earlier :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your best bet to get to spires to journey to luclin would indeed be port from druid or wizard to DL. As next best bet I would say explore usage of Karana portal. I am sure once you know how to duck guards you can make it easy (and can always use sow to run off). Doing same to GFay would be much harder. You'll need to find way to move back and forth from moon anyways can't spend whole time there anyways (spells/skills)...</div></div><hr />
