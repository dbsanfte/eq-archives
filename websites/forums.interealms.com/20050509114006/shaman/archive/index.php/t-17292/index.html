<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQPolaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya all.. <br />
<br />
I have AA points spent as follows: <br />
<br />
General: Innate Run Speed 3/3 and Innate Regeneration 3/3. <br />
Archetype: Mental Clarity 3/3 <br />
Class: Cannibalize 1/1 <br />
<br />
I have three AA points to spend, and am looking for advice on where to spend it. <br />
<br />
Any advice??  <br />

Scroll down and find my post.  Also, go to the medicine cabinet forum, click on the AA thread, and find my posts in there.  Written advice on this a billion times.<br />
<br />
Short version:<br />
<br />
Do these three next, in any order: SCRM, ND3, SCM3<br />
<br />
After that move on to healing AA or defensive AA, whichever is your preference.<br />
<br />
VP is a good skill to have, feel free to get it at any time.  SC and RC are not that impressive and you should wait a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RC is great, can cure roots and snares (that don't have counters) and means I don't have to mem my cure spells, you should atleast get level 1, it's so cheap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EQPolaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was kind of leaning toward going for Spirit Caller for when I have to solo.  I haven't found a good solo place yet, but my old group has largely left EQ, and until I can get in with another group consistently, I might try soloing some.  With SC, if I understand it correctly, I can summon three additional pets for 60 seconds of dps.  I think the refresh rate was only 2 minutes (or was it 20?).  That seems very helpful.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the link... I am going to go over and read through it now.<br />

The refresh time is 12 minutes.  Level 1 of spirit call will do about the same amount of damage as a bane of nife, assuming that your pets do not die.  That is really not that much damage.  It's nice to have as an added bonus, but I feel that other abilities will help your more for soloing.  The three that I listed, in addition to defensive AA, all have a much greater effect than spirit call does.<br />
<br />
Another thing to be noted about spirit call is that in pop, just using rank 1 of spirit call, your pets will not survive the full duration, thus dramatically reducing their damage.  If you are still soloing in the old world they will usually survive the full minute, but in pop they aren't that great for soloing.  Also, when grouping, many mobs do not even last a full minute so you have to cast spirit call right at the beginning of the fight in order to get the maximum amount of damage from them.<br />
<br />
The only time I find SC very useful is when I am pulling in an LDoN group and there is a room with three or more mobs that need to be split.  I just send my pets in and every mob in the room will attack them.  They will survive long enough for me to pull each mob off one at a time with slow and then root it.<br />
<br />
So, in summary, SC is really not that great of an AA and has pretty limited usefulness, although you'll probably get a real kick out of it the first dozen times you use it or so.  I trained SC right after pop came out and I thought it was awesome for a few days.  Then, the novelty wore off and I left it at rank1 and didn't train it any further until I'd gotten another 200aa.  I often regreted spending those 4 points on SC as early as I did, and I do not regret waiting until 250+ aa to finish it.<br />
<br />
As for Radiant Cure, it definately is not a bad AA.  However, at rank1, it is extremely inconsistent.  If you get rooted or snared I will give RC1 about a one in five chance of saving you.  In addition to that, RC1 only takes off 9 poison/disease/curse counters.  That won't cure anything except tash.  RC3 will cure a slow, but it won't cure any of the LDoN traps or curses that I have come across.  So, basically, the chance to remove a detrimental spell is decent if you have RC3.  Otherwise, RC isn't that great and with blood of nadox you just don't need the counter-removing component.  And honestly, how often are you in a situation where you need RC?  It hardly ever happens to me.  I would much rather have one of the three archetype abilities I listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While we are on the subject I thought roots were only cured through cancel or nullify magic type of spell.<br />
<br />
Are you saying roots and snares like spectral shackles can be cured by using nadox or aura?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Radiant cure uses poison/disease/curse cures, but it has a chance to dispel detrimental magic based things, like root, malos, etc.  Level 1 is a pretty low chance, level 2 a little better, level 3 better than that.  You cannot cure them with normal poison/disease cures, only the AA ability has the chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">although there are arguably better things to invest in..my personal plan of attack currently is quickbuff3 (6 second torpor is awful) and then SCR3 + SCRM for elder title.<br />
<br />
I might work in some other aa during that time..like a level of crits (healing and dd), and VP seems to be worth at least 3 points, and first level of RC might be useful if it saved me from having to mem blood of nadox or any other cures..<br />
<br />
and while i'm talking about aas..i wish hastened rabidity was hastened cannibalize..if canni5 was 1.5 minutes between casts i would be able to free up one gem slot for something else, but i guess thats just wishful thinking...</div></div><hr />
