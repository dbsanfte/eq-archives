<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">People tend to have mixed feelings about this expansion, but it's currently my favorite. I haven't done too much exploring yet other than spending a few days on Hate's Fury with my Paladin when it went live trying to get the Captain to spawn: I know for him you need to collect some items and hand them in to some NPC, but I can't for the life of me remember what the items were and who to give them to. So I thought: I'm not the only one. <br />
<br />
Maybe getting a collected thread on it to share opinions of the events and clear, defined information on getting them started might be a good idea, as well as bringing some attention to some of those rare drops in Ykesha that people neglect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, I think most of us who enjoy the extension would rather people didn't know how good it was. Boo hoo, they don't like it, so they don't clutter it up with their trains and quad-boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Athenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm yeah that quest is a loooong one.  I personally have all the items to make the captain spawn except the Special Brew and let me tell you it is damn rare.<br />
<br />
Here is what you need...Attendent Mia Ta (something like that) at the very back room of Hate's Fury asks for 4 items to make the captain spawn:  a Mystical Spyglass, an Ancient Compass, Map of Norrath's Oceans, and the captains favorite spirits = Okeil's Special Brew (spelled something like that).<br />
<br />
<br />
Mystical Spyglass:  This can drop randomly and rarely off of any of the above-deck named mobs ie Uumuvan the Soulless, Scout Shin Ci, Lieutenant Commander Vzain, Harbinger.<br />
<br />
Ancient Compass:  This can drop randomly and rarely off of any of the below-deck named mobs ie The Broken Skull Armsmaster, Soqui the Forgotten, Quartermaster Fisan,  High Priest Anaanci etc<br />
<br />
Map of Norraths Oceans:  This drops off of a Broken Skull Navigator who is located in the globe room (the room with High Priest Anaanci in it).  The Navigator has a ph if he is not up already.  The place holder is the one who is just to the left of the High Priest spawn on the sunken down floor there.  You will see three mobs on the sunken floor, your ph is the one closest to the High Priest spawn.<br />
<br />
Okeil's Special Brew:  This is going to be the hardest part to camp by far.  The Drunken Buccanear spawns in Quartermaster Fisan's area.  If you follow the ladder down from zone in, then follow the hall back from the torture chamber you will see a room with a few Broken Skull Weaponsmiths in it.  Go in that room and you will see a little nook on your left with 3 rats in it.  <br />
<br />
The drunk spawns right there next to the three rats.  But unlike the rest of the mobs in the zone this is a triggered spawn as opposed to having a placeholder you kill over and over.  I'm not exactly sure what triggers him to spawn but you can usually do it by killing every mob in that room.  So you finally spawn the drunk and kill him and he has the brew right you say?  Wrong, the drunk only drops the special brew very rarely, his common drop is a bottle of vodka which other than making for a tasty refreshment is totally useless.  So good luck with this part its the only piece I need.  I know he drops the special brew because a friend of mine got it.<br />
<br />
Once you get the 4 pieces get a few strong groups and go turn them to Attendant Mi'Ta be ready to fight Captain Jrank.  I know he spawns several 'Fists of Jrank' that assist him, not sure if they mezzable but probably.  Also note that the pieces needed in this quest can be multiquested so that might make it easier.  I'll bet he drops some truly unique stuff if you can kill him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you, Athenae! =)<br />
<br />
I'm going to play around with overseer Wrank tonight and post some details on him if the camp is open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Overseer Wrank spawn sucks, I wouldn't try it solo without a lot of time =)  You need 20 keys, which drop off the guards (troll mobs, wander around a bit).  This is the easy part.  Then you need to hand in 20 keys to 20 different resistance miners.  At best, there are 3 up at any given time, and the only way to get more to spawn is to kill the crazed miners.  The respawn is not very quick (15 minutes?  don't remember anymore), so it takes quite some time to do.<br />
<br />
The overseer drops some nice stuff (see gloves on my magelo - also a nice ring, we got both when we killed him).  It's worth doing once for the fun of the event, but getting / handing in keys for hours (took us 7 or 8 hours, with a full group) is just no fun at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wrank can take longer.  I have personally counted 28 - twenty-eight - keys to resistance miners before he would become targettable and spawn captains.<br />
<br />
He dropped two pairs of DRU/MNK/BST arms that time, just to add an extra special kick in the rear end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Overlord is a pushover, kill him instead of wrank :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've done overlord, overseer, and *attempted* the captain (who, at least for us, was named Krasnok, not Jrank).<br />
<br />
The only hard part about overlord (for his level, and whom his gear is targetted at) is his AE curse.  Feeblemind sucks.  Of course, with radiant cure, this shouldn't be too much of an issue, as he really doesn't have that much HP.<br />
<br />
Overseer Wrank we were able to spawn within about 45 minutes or so of entering from Dulak's.  He's cake.  The only thing special about him is his AE that makes casting twice as long, although the melee slow portion of it is really annoying, as well; it makes it take a while to kill him.  <br />
<br />
Some notes from our fight with the captain:<br />
<br />
We took four groups, average level 62 or so.  This would have been plenty, had we known what to expect.  Here's what happens:<br />
<br />
Captain and FOUR &quot;Fist of &lt;Captain's Name&gt;&quot; spawn simultaneously.  The Fists spawn in the corners of the room, and immediately bumrush the center.  I believe our shaman said they were disease slowable.  Here's the catch:  they won't leave melee range of the captain.  Any attempts to pull them out of melee range of the captain will result in them beating on whoever is highest on the captain's aggro list.  If they are kept beneath the captain, they should be offtankable - but it may be a feature of his rampage that he wipes aggro on them when he rampages.  In that case, knights are best to tank them, as they can get aggro back quickly.<br />
<br />
The captain has four AEs:<br />
<br />
Hate's Fury<br />
Drowning Panic<br />
Bleeding Ether<br />
Languish of the Sea<br />

From what we could tell, you have to be within melee range of the captain to land spells.  A level 65 wizard couldn't land any lures from outside melee range (tried all three resist types).<br />
<br />
The fists have a 122 DB, and 9.6 DI (max hit 314).  The captain has a 192 DB, and 22 DI (max hit 632).  I can't really give details as to the total HP of the captain; things went downhill too quickly after the MT went down (her primary healer went down because of too much aggro from quick heals, we didn't really know what to expect).  I'm pretty sure that we'll get him if we get a second shot.<br />
<br />
If you do take the captain down...let us know what happens. :)<br />
<br />
BTW, if you don't have any radiant cure, or remove curse, Overlord Ngrub can be a pain...see the below attachment.  I was one of three people out of 24 that was alive at the end of the fight...and I let my spear of fate do the talking since I was oom.</div></div><hr />
