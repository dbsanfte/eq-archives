<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone noticed how nice our pets are, after all the changes lately? They're higher level now (at least, you don't have to summon repeatedly to get the high level version), and they had their attack ratings buffed also. They no longer draw aggro when they wander off, and they no longer have a chance to take major chunks of exp when you're solo'ing. <br />
<br />
My shaman is L 47 now, and I've found the L 44 pet to be great. If I find a not-exceptionally tough low blue mob (eg a greater kobold in Sol B, my recent exp spot), all I have to do is slow it and my hasted pet can beat it to death. If I poke it with the spear enough to get one hit in I get full exp. This isn't how I actually go about it (thanks JBB!), but I could if I wanted to. I notice that sometimes if I have a string of interrupts on the JBB casts, my pet is tearing that kobold apart.  If I end up with 3 kobolds, my pet basically solo's one (after slow), while I kill the other two. <br />
<br />
I realize I'm at a fairly high point for the effectiveness of the shaman pet, and that at very high levels the then-old L 55 pet isn't terribly good.  But for now, at least, that little pup is a god-send.  <br />
<br />
Finally, a question: I didn't expect the L 44 pet to hit as hard as it does - up to 43/hit. How hard do the L 49 and 55 pets hit? I have a feeling that it doesn't go up much at all from here. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Before the changes to pets vis a vis mez, I rarely used Puddles.  Now that I don't have to worry about my pet getting a chanter killed, I summon him all the time.  I also love that great new pet window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the 55 pet hits for 53 damage max.<br />
<br />
for me, he always does between 12-14dps while buffed with Focus and Celerity, hitting from the back of the mobs.   Most all this testing goes on while I kill mobs in PoM waiting for the blue throne to finish my boots.<br />
<br />
I don't use my pet much because I like to pull.  I don't use my pet much because I have to do crowd control myself.   I find it greatly annoying when dog attacks the wrong mob and then it starts summoning.  I don't use pet much because I spend 650m to summon, 500m to focus, 185m to celerity and then he poofs in 5 minutes later due to horrible buggy pathing in EQ.<br />
<br />
Overall I think our pet is pretty much a waste of time at high levels (at midlevels the pet rocks).  I have actually logged fights where an unbuffed cleric hammer pet has outdamaged fully buffed dogdog.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The pet is awesome for us non bash shammys. (the 55 pet that is). Lasaner does an excellent job keeping a caster from casting most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Soloing our pet is like a really small dot.  On raids I never use him, have better things to do then manage my 11dps dot.  Hes not worthless though, just not good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Level 60 shaman here.  Group friendly and long time soloer as well.  IMHO, our new pets are great, and i used to use a pet most times i solo.  Problems like pathing in some zones are the one thing that bothers me, everthing else just takes practice.  They are definitely on average stronger now, and i think there hp got a boost too, althout i can't guarantee it since they also con green before anyway, and i never have hits on.......he hits, that's all i care about.  In terms of damage...since many of my solo fights last anywhere from 2-15 minutes, i'll take any help i can to save casting slow one extra time extra.  I would even go so far as to say, unless there is a specific reason (pathing) not to have a pet, you just aren't getting the most out of your class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use my pet all time when I can.   For pvp its my 4 legged Dot great for casters,annoying to melee. <br />
<br />
Never used em much for raids because of the resists.  Now with the changes I can't wait to see how long it will last.<br />
<br />
Always use it when I solo since if jumped in pvp pet stays on mob, i take the PK'er.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't gibes fek if he does 11dps or 1 dps. That's extra damage. He will also occupy the add.<br />
<br />
Mana? <br />
<br />
Umm we're Shaman, name any other class when soloing that can look at their health and mana and say to themself:<br />
<br />
&quot;40% mana and health - ok I can handle two.&quot;<br />
<br />
We are the kings of mana regen. Ok I'm a bit ebullient after dinging 52 last night and getting regrowth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail,<br />
<br />
I really like the pet upgrade.  I usually use him soloing, guarding him in a well researched safe spot, and then pulling to him.  If the area has wanderers, I just sit him down instead of guarding.<br />
<br />
As to the mana cost, an enshrouded veil on my server is not overly expensive &amp; readily purchasable in the bazaar.  It has the summoning efficiency 3 effect, which lessens the blow a bit.  Something to think about.<br />
<br />
On raids, if it isn't obvious to me whether it would be safe to use dogdog, I ask or watch the Magicians.  Dogdog is well enough behaved (especially since the Mezzed mob pet fix) to be worth the mana cost for me.  He's also been the HP buffer I needed to survive on many occasions, soloing or grouped.<br />
<br />
This was a tasty bone for dogdog.  A milkbone bonus would be letting him have innate lupine spirit, but I'm happy already.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">it might be worth it, but i just can't be bothered to summon a pet most of the time. takes a ton of mana and TIME for the gem to refresh and cast. yawn. then i have to constantly command him around, and i have enough spells to cast and hotkeys to click</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Being non-60 I can't give that anything from that point of view... buuut, the level 49 pet rocks my world. Hits for 51 and can make life either MUCH easier or MUCH more annoying.<br />
<br />
He's extra DPS. Gives you time to zone when it all goes bad (if it never goes bad you're not trying hard enough). The 49 pet in The Hole can occupy a slowed enterance mob for a damn long time before he needs saving. Without pet I don't think we could break the last 3 mobs (One for Monk, one for Shaman, one for pet).<br />
<br />
If he's on the wrong mob... you change targets because sure as heck he ain't gonna.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I just hit lvl 44 last Sunday, and the much improved pet has been the difference between 4 out of 5 times looting a corpse or zoning and sitting around recovering, and ending a fight with 60 health and 50 mana against a HG solo, (The new speed and Talisman spells help as well, but that's not going to account for all that difference I don't think) so. After reading the thread about adds in the tactics section, I can't wait to give that a try.<br />
<br />
Many thanks to all those who have gone before who share their knowledge to help the rest of us make our journey<br />

I wish you all well<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I love my dog ( i'm lvl 47) and my friend's 52, his dog tanked 3 HG's without dying :P course they were all slowed, and he had buffs on pet, and healed it but damn... still impressive for a pet that other classes say &quot;sucks&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mid-way through 54 (yeah, I know I'm slow) Goner makes all the difference soloing things.  He gets Talisman of Altuna, clicky Strength, and Alacrity.  And he rocks.  Hoppers, no prob.  Ice Giants?  Num.  Goranga? He can last longer than I seem able to at times.<br />
<br />
One concern I have is this:  Since the changes he never seems to draw or hold agro if I'm in range at all.  Was testing this on IGs this morning (financing spells, ya know).  Without casting on the IG and letting Goner take him down a bubble or two, as soon as I step in range I'm the only target as far as he's concerned.<br />
<br />
Anybody else notice this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Use that to your advantage.  Here is something i often do....pull with debuff/slow, let mob beat on me a bit while i canni, move back and if pet has enough aggro mob stays on pet.  Do my low aggro dot, canna or jbb, whatever, wait till pet gets pretty low in hp if i haven't drawn him off pet with all that, step into melee range.  I have moved in and saved my pet at 1% health many times - and in those cases i'm usually fm and pet has hurt mob good.   So i'm ready to pull asap.  <br />
<br />
Here is another key to using your pet ( most know this already), in non-perma rooted summoning mobs, if something is in melee range, the mob will not summon you while rooted (remember non perma rooted mobs we talking about).  So, if you start a fight real badly, or just start to lose and think, nope, not gonna make it, and this one summons - root it (assuming you have more aggro than pet and you cant just let pet tank while you gate as your under heavy attack) and back up.  Mob attacks pet while you get gate off, phew :)  Pet has saved my butt more than a few times doing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah, but last couple of days... mob hasn't stayed on pet.  And I know Goner's doing far more damage than I am, when all I was doing was whiffing with a fast weenie 1hb.<br />
<br />
No spells, no dots, etc... set pet upon him, let pet get him 1 bub down, I wade in with my staff.  Giant agros on me.  I back up... he follows.  I back up... he follows.  <br />
<br />
Used to be, he'd turn to Goner and commence whacking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The recent pet improvements have been really noticeable for me at 59. I also think that the pet got a HP boost, because it lasts a lot longer it seems. Maybe its strictly the level change though, because I was never one to resummon pets until I got the highest level one. I was in howling stones, and got a double pull. Slowed them both and let the dog tank one. I was watching the pet's health, he was at 30 percent, the skeleton was at 50 percent. That's pretty damn impressive if you ask me, because the pet always seemed to get beatdown and do crap damage in the past. I'm happy.</div></div><hr />
