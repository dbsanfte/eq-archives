<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if i could get a couple responses on my gear. I was thinking id need more hp to sac some wis. Ac would be nice too but would rather lean twards hp. Im pretty sure that my velious dragon faction will be good enough for armor turn ins, and was thinking that i should save my money to buy the gems needed. I dont have much money but something to save for that will help me most in the long run(or quest for) would be nice. <br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

Slime Covered Rubicite Coif.<br />
Hiero Cloak.<br />
<br />
And anything in range with some hp, goranga idol, idol of the thorned, foul smelling sandwich thing.<br />
<br />
All those should improve your hp quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Two good CoV quests you can do with one group or less are the Circlet of Falinkan and the Talisman of Benevolence. There's lots of posts on the board on those two. The other common suggestion would be the Coldain Military Wristguard that you could solo at your level.<br />
<br />
Other than Jaruden's suggestions which are all good, you might want to upgrade your belt at some point for one with some hp. Barbed Rubicite Belt would be an xp spot, Artificer's and Girdle of Mithaniel are other alternatives but costly.</div></div><hr />
