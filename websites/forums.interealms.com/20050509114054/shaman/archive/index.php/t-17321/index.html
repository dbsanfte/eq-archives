<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
Quick question about /pet hold.  Without pet hold, I can guard my pet, tell him to attack something, after the fight, he will return back to the spot I told him to guard.  <br />
<br />
Question:<br />
Does /pet hold work like /pet guard here.  Would he return to the original spot after each fight? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pet hold is a completely new command.  It doesn't take the place of /pet guard or /pet back off.  Pet guard works the same as it did before I got /pet hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">when you use /pet hold. The mutt will not attack anything untill you tell it to. <br />
One thing with pet hold it dose not clear the pets hate list like pet back off dose. So if you use pet hold to get the mutt off of a rooted mob. You will have to use pet back off to sent it after a diffrent target. If you dont it will return back to the rooted mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gromble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When issuing the Pet hold command the pet will immediately stop what it is attacking or going after and do the command u had issued to it before that. If u had it guard before giving it the pet hold command, it will go back to guarding. If u had it following you, it will return to your side. <br />
<br />
A thing to note, you cannot issue the pet hold command during a cast. (like u are able to send in the dog to attack during casts)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Actuly you can. You have to manualy type the comand. The other comands can be used while casting from the pet box.</div></div><hr />
