<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, Horde are so mature.  Why just today my 26 Hunter ( Sans  pet who was in the stable) was offered a duel by a 33 Priest.  <br />
<br />
Of course he rubbed up against me and farted before hand.<br />
<br />
So 1337 ! So P0W4h!<br />
<br />
OTOH, the one Horde I killed, I saluted and moved out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last week (when I was 37) a lvl 38 Tauren Druid and a level 39 Tauren Warrior showed up in Darkshire. They killed a PVP flagged NPC and set off the alerts. My wife and I were there, so ran after them and engaged (she was 34). We took them out a couple of times, they took us out a couple of times. Then a guild priest showed up to keep us alive. After that they just didn't stand a chance. She'd (priest) stay shadow melded until we needed her, vis, heal, SM again. They couldn't find her, so couldn't kill her. And while they were wasting their time looking, we'd whittle 'em down in short order while our pets gnawed on their heals/buttocks. :)<br />
<br />
The Druid waited to rez until PVP flags were reset, then came up and /duel'd me. We fought, it was close, but he won. He bowed, I bowed. We exchanged other /emote pleasantries, then moved on.<br />
<br />
I logged on my Tauren Shaman and chatted with him (/waves at Drought :)). Both he and his buddy were decent fellows. I thanked him for one of the most honorable PVP sessions I've encountered to date and told him I looked forward to our next encounter.<br />
<br />
There are good and honorable players on both sides, though there are also tons of jerkoffs and imature gankers on both sides. I got lucky in this encounter, but have had others like the one you describe too Faern. Luck of the draw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's one ugly baby ..  :p <br />
<br />
.. and yet, somehow I can't stop looking at it!<br />
<br />
And yeah, it seems many of the more, er, immature players are alliance based on Killrog; you know the type, the ones that are level 60 and go camp the crossroads, take advantage of the 'forced PvP' bugs that are still around, and generally act like asses.  I've had more run-ins with decent horde folks than .. well.. ANY bad ones. <br />
<br />
Heck, gotta tell the tale here, it had me chuckling for a while.  Was crossing the barrens from Thousand Needles heading to ratchet when I (34 NE Warrior at the time) came across a level 19 troll shaman who'd just killed something that flagged him PvP.  I kinda shadowed him for a little bit, just to make him nervous, and the poor guy kinda panicked and ran around a bit with me following him.  I could almost sense him sweating :)  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I decided to be nice and let him run away while I continued on to Ratchet, but couldn't resist taking a single pot shot at his skinny butt with my gun. Hit him for like 80 something damage, laughed at how fast he ran away, and then continued onto Ratchet to hand in my quest.  I passed a low 20 Tauren warrior on the way in, and just after I finished my hand in, turned around, and saw three level ?? horde members just standing behind me. Suddenly I was the nervous one backing away, me with my nice green PvP flag.<br />
<br />
I couldn't tell if they were going to give me a bit of a bashing for scaring their little trolls, but thankfully it was about then that my PvP switch toggled off, and I was able to run on safely, with them tagging along for a little bit behind me. Had me giggling like a maniac, and I really thought it was mature of them to simply play 'eye for and eye' type of game. Not to mention the /glare and stuff I had thrown my way.</div></div><hr />

Great story :)<br />
<br />
My best PvP experience was with a rogue who tried to jump me in Alteric Mts. He was one level higher than me but the battle that followed was fast and furious. Both of us almost died during the battle but I was able to cast a Nature Swiftness Healing wave (awsome talent btw). He knew he was done at the point. Instead of running away he bowed to me just before I killed him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can't say I've had any 'epic' or classy pvp battles, I usually only get involved when I'm in a horde town and it gets swarmed by Alliance. on Lothar it seems the lvl 50+ alliance love to jump Sin Jin, Razorhill, Xr, and the other low lvl adv camps. except for one lvl 60 warrior that turned on his flag and rode his horse straight into Orgrimmar. that was pretty funny, he almost made it to Thrall's chamber before he dropped. bravo I say, but it would have been much cooler if he had done more than just ride in  :)<br />
my guild hosted an invasion of an alliance city last night, but I missed it. looking forward to hearing how deep they made it<br />
<br />
cute kid Walrruss, very funny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">had a fun fight the other night, jerk off alliance, a 52 rogue and a 52 druid, were camping sunrock retreat, killing lowbies and guards, and hiding up on a hill overlooking the town. I blinded the rogue, and kicked the hell out of the druid, they went cat form and tried to run, jumped off the cliff and died, I was chuckling.<br />
<br />
rogue started attacking me, I turned, laughed at him, and then destroyed him.<br />
<br />
Never could understand the joy people get out of ganking lowbies.<br />
<br />
That picture looks like me in the morning after a good bender.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aammon Aammonite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Great Pic!<br />
 <br />
I have decided to drop EQ and head to WoW.  If I have to raid one more minute I am going to scream!<br />
 <br />
Going to go Horde PVP. Any recommendations on servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I play a lower level horde shaman on a PvP server (Sageras) and it's tough.  The Alliance outnumber us on the server, but they have yet to take a major city like the horde has done.  I know at the higher levels there is some honourable PvP, but that's not there for lower levels.  Last night small groups of lvl 40-60 players camped outposts in Ashenvale killing all the NPCs and players, totally overrunning the outposts.  At one point a couple horde mid fifties showed up and with the low level 30's and high 20's together, they drove off the alliance from splintertree.  The high level horde players left and the alliance returned (c'mon, they had 2 lvl 40+ pallies, 1 40+ warrior and a 40+ mage and they wouldn't take on the 2 mid 50's players, but only the 6-8 low level horde players ... cowards).  The low level players organised and used the NPCs to drive the alliance off time after time until the alliance show up with a raid force of 18 lvl 60 players ... against 6-8 low level horde players and a collection of NPCs.  Where is the fun and honour?  Where is the skill?  It was payback for a solid resistance by the horde.  The raid popped in and out for 30 minutes camping corpses and killing off the wyvern handler so people couldn't fly out.  I stood with the horde players fighting off a few alliance, but it's no fun getting chain ganked by clueless tards who clearly were not looking for any challenge.  So I used my hearthstone after ressing inside a building before the alliance could find and target me.<br />
<br />
It's getting so frustrating that I only used to challenge players who were up to 7 levels higher and I'd let lower level guys pass, screw it now, anyone within 10 levels of me gets jumped.  I've been ambushed about everywhere, when I turn the tables they call in some ?? con, or a party of them.  While I let Alliance pass sometimes, higher level alliance have only once failed to attack me, luckily I evade most times due to ghost wolf and using terrain.  Some of my friends moved to a PvE server and are a lot happier, but I hate giving up, worse still I hate the thought of having to play an alliance char with them.  I've even resorted to training and ambushing with some success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Therein lies the rub man, I still refrain from ganking, but it is getting harder to resist, I rarely get killed by gankers, but it is annoying. Seems like when i do die it is usually two or more people working together, cowards.<br />
<br />
Think everyone just hates rogues, ha. Can't beat em, join em.<br />
