<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xani Crimsonheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been having a blast soloing Phase Spiders in Dragon Necropolis lately, but I accidentally spawned a Construct the other day and had all kinds of trouble.<br />
<br />
After zoning out, resting up and zoning back in, I tried him again.  I was able to land Turgur's and Epic dot, but Plague and Bane wouldn't take, so I had to zone again.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any tips for dropping one of these guys?  Should I Malosi to get dots to stick?  Any advice would be great. :)<br />
<br />
56th level with Epic, no JBB<br />
<br />
No catchy sig. Sorry :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In general, undead mobs can't be diseased or poisoned.  Not really any easy way, our nukes are too mana-inefficient for soloing large mobs without dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just root him? and keep him epic doted. <br />
<br />
<br />
Its not alot, but 1.5k dmg every 1.5 minutes is ok.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless they summon?<br />
<br />
<br />
I solo'd one a while back with epic, jbb and malo... can't remember though this was a long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xani Crimsonheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Root wouldn't take, but yes, they do summon.  I tried one again yesterday.  He was down to 8% from my melee, epics, and dogdog, then he gated to spawnpoint accross the room and summoned me.  Wouldn't have been bad except there was a Phase Spider running past that aggroed.  It was pretty hillarious.  spider would shoot me accross the room and dragon would summon me right back.  Somehow I made it to zoneout though.<br />
<br />
Without the add though, I would've been able to drop him.  Just a really long fight though.  About 7 minutes at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They summon. <br />
<br />
And have to be directly under them for any spell to land.</div></div><hr />
