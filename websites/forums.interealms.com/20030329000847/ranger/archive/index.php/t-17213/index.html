<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Milendarci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last two months have become really bad for time spent LFG.  Really would like to know if the new LFG function on the next expasion will help, cause if not I think after 3.5 years, I will be done.<br />
<br />
Advice to rangers 60 and below, dont level past 60 cause they broke the game with PoP.   Once you go past 60, the rest of Norrath that you can solo becomes Lt Blue and green.  Get AM3 and EQ before you move to 61.  My 2 cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LFG as a Ranger just stinks in general. I've been holding at 61 and not levelling becase finding groups in the planes is harsh. Unless you have a regular group of folks you exp with (and I do not) the grind can be a pain in the butt.<br />
<br />
I did get one lucky streak a few weeks ago...got EQ in 3 days...and AM1 only takes 3 points but in like 2 weeks since I got EQ I've gotten only 2aa =/ <br />
<br />
At least at 61 if I get real desperate I can still run to EW to solo for a while. At 62 the dorfs light blue so I lose that as an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dont give up.Lots of places in PoP that a duo or trio can make killer xp,grab some parchments and loot,and have a good time.Plenty of other people feelin the way you are right now.Grab some of them,work out a strat,and do it.Get AM3/EQ then you can solo in PoP too =).<br />
<br />
Take a break for a week or so, go play an alt work, on some quests to get your mind off it.That always helps me.Little necro girl of mine went from 21 to 30 this weekend God I love her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moriarti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">whats am3 and eq?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Peatnallie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Taking a break sounds good or playing an alt. I would recommend that you don't try to force yourself to stay on lfg for hours. If it's true that the bodyguards are still blue to 61, you could always delvl yourself to get aaxp. If you are looking to get to 65, keep trying to get yourself a guild group going. It helps that you know who you are playing with and won't have to spend time lfg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You think that's bad. I have been LFG in Kael for 3 weeks now. Finally made it into a group last night and went to the Arena. Want to know what dropped in a total of 5 hours at the Arena ?<br />
<br />
3 Plate Greaves, 3 Plate Vambraces, 2 Plate Gauntlets, 2 Plate Bracers, 1 Plate boots, 2 Silk Helms/turbans, 1 Leather Bracer, and Defiance.<br />
<br />
Just sat at the zone line again for the past half hour doing the LFG thing. What a total waste of my frigging time. So completely and totally frustrating. Can't wait to get 60 so I can quit. Made a promise to myself that I would at least level my main to 60 before I quit so am going to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I took up fishing. :) You can fish in povalor and ponightmare to get fish for the Fisherman's companion quest, and sell the bones for 300ish (at least on my server) in bazaar for the &quot;MQ&quot;.<br />
<br />
&lt;- 200 Fishing now, combined w/fletching I make nice darts for the monk pullers in my guild. While LFG in zone, I ended up making 30+ AA's in the last couple of weeks because I stuck around fishing until something opened up instead of zone-hopping.<br />
<br />
I'm in a european guild, and I'm in Boston, so when raids are over and everyone's sleeping, it's still 7PM here. Between fishing and a few quests, it helped a lot to kill the time between groups. I can solo rats in pod with minimal risk, but it's just boring as hell and I loathe fearkiting.<br />
<br />
My .2c. Up to about 61-62 the best non-group xp you'll find is duo with a chanter charm kiting in pon. After that, just bide your time for a valor group/storms group. Aggro kiting with a wizard dong the frogs in storms is sweet xp as well - about 5% aaxp duo per kill.<br />
<br />
Best advice is not to get frustrated - toss up the LFG tag and find something fun to do other than wander around LFG'ing or it'll drive you mad. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shallana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;whats am3 and eq?&quot; <br />
<br />
AM3 and EQ are both Alternate Advancement (AA) skills that rangers can get.  AM3 is Archery Mastery 3, and EQ is Endless Quiver which means you can use one arrow and it will never run out.  AM3 increases your dmg with your bow (I think...correct me if Im wrong)</div></div><hr />
