<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im sure alot of you know this , but im sure some dont.<br />
<br />
The mage focus item Naki's spiked ring , is actualy a spell haste item. Apprently when you team this up with BoR it gives you that EXACT haste that your affliction haste items used to give. Its not a  self sufficent solution , but having my 3.8 malo/malos and my 2.3 turg back is a beautiful thing. Man i missed it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Umm.. yup... Spell Haste, it's the first thing I ask for, then Tavee Mantle, and Galanite's Bracer if I'm feeling particularly dirty at the moment.<br />
<br />
Great for soloing things that you shouldn't be ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what is the mantle ? I checked it on lucy and allak , but i didnt see a effect description</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>silverlynx_silentfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Focus effects are...<br />
<br />
Ring = spell haste<br />
Bracer = improved damage<br />
Mantle = extended enhancement<br />
Earring = mana preservation (15%) on offensive spells only<br />
Necklace = reagent conservation (bleh)<br />
<br />
<br />
Its amazing how many *magicians* dont know what these focus effects are.  Thank you castersrealm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ahhh casters realm , i should have checked there. Ive gotten into the habit of diregarding them a while ago , didnt even think to check.  But yea , they dont know what they do lol, i ask the mage adn he didnt know , i asked one on a raid if they had extended range item and he didnt know either. I mean i can understand , they have ALOT of summoniing spells , its just funny. But yea , that mantle looks nice for  buffing  uses. pehaps wearing one on a raid while buffing then swaping out for normal item might be a optin since i dont have coldain shawl yet.<br />
<br />
Thnx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>silverlynx_silentfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, actually what I was trying to say there was that castersrealm have some seriously flawed info on many of these foci.  But, the short answer was...mantle = extended enhancement.<br />
<br />
Im not sure why they decided to do the cute names on those focus effects, but it certainly has confused things for many a mage.<br />

Nope , just never bothered with them , i spend alot of time relying on my own and doing things for myself. It wasnt till Pop that i NEEDED to group with people and i have never had a mage myself , so i never looked at all their spells.<br />
<br />
Just figured id try to be a lil nicer and productive since i have to admit i have been a prick here and there lately , for reasons none of you care about so i wont bother ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway , hope it helps someone .<br />
<br />
Peace<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Spell Haste III  is on all of those, meaning they wont haste anything over 60 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">See list at bottom of page for items with Spell Haste IV:<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3525&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
or for 18% spell haste, via Haste of Druzzil, you have:<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3526&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
And eventually I'm sure some items will show up with 23% spell haste also ala the focus effect Quickening of Druzzil:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Indeed Litgruv, there are NO Spellhaste IV items for shaman according to Alla(Other than ceramic Totem of Xegony).  However Turgurs is 51 :P<br />
<br />
After you get 60+, you have to get PoP haste items(Haste of Mithaniel, etc.) unless you are like a wizard or mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>CamaenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">None of these items will get you the 1.7 second Turgur's that Affliction haste 4 used to (pre-nerf) when stacked with BoR.<br />
