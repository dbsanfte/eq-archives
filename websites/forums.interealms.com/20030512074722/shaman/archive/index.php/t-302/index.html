<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toxzyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would very much like to know how evil races may have accomplished this ......<br />
<br />
 ... as an Iksar I had to work hard to get my faction up to Indiff with the Katta guards. Even though the quest giver (Roshawna) is on a different faction (Dah Khura) which is the Vah'Shir shaman faction. Everyone is indiff  on this to start. So with both factions at indiff and all the items collected I was ready to do the quest. <br />
<br />
So I stroll into Roshawna's room and before I could say Swiss Family Robinson I have 2 guards, Roshawna and a Barbarian (which I'll come to) knocking the living hell out of me. I precede to run to the exit (as you do) and I'm rooted at the door ...... LOADING PLEASE WAIT ..... hehe nice reflexes Rosh :)<br />
<br />
The Barbarian in the room (Broote &quot;Rat B*****d&quot; Malicus) is on a completely different faction (Concilium Universus). They are spread all over the city and are kinda like the Admin arm of Katta. All evil races will be scowling to this from the get go. But he must also be very closely tied in with Guard and Roshawna's faction, cuz as soon as he attacked me, everything else did.<br />
<br />
Anyway ... Concilium Universus faction is extremely hard to get up. I know of 1 quest which raises this faction, using all those Grimling Mining Picks :) But you need to be Indiff to do that quest. Saw 1 suggestion on the Safehouse which mentioned killing anything on Heart of Seru faction will give CU hits. Now I've ran around Sanctus and it seems one would need 3-4 groups to get deep enough to hit Hearts of Seru.<br />
<br />
So for me this is a major stumbling block, and am extremely surprised not to have heard of similar nightmares. The workaround I can think of is charming them, but this could be difficult, as charming 1 would probably agro the other. Oh well I suppose its worth a shot ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
After several days hunting recuso my faction with folks INSIDE SSaru hadn't budged.  Needless to say I had better things to do... but perhaps katta faction is easier to deal with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm a barbarian, so havent had to try this myself, but from talking with the npc's in Katta you quickly learn that Katta Castellum (Combine Loyalists) are enemies of Sanctus Seru (splinter faction of the Combine Empire). <br />
<br />
Try hunting in Sanctus Seru a while. I and some guildies killed a couple of the guards there one day and got about half a dozen faction hits each kill (but couldnt see exact ones because it was when faction messages were broken). It's also very nice exp, from what I hear...but we stopped after a couple kills so we werent kos.<br />
<br />
On a side note, it's kinda dumb that they made *anyone* kos in Katta because the Combine Loyalists talk about how they accept all people on their character, not their race. There's even a family there consisting of a female barbarian, male dark elf, and their half-elf son.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cerdle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am an ogre.  Started out dubious.  I did the Ethereal Energy wepon quests (all 3) before the nerf (thank Rallos).  After doing the 3 quests I am now warmly.  Now I don't require the invis trick and can do quests on my own. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm also an Iksar and I want some Katta faction. I've been told that vamps in ME and TM give Katta faction. Is that the same faction as the Iksar that started the post was looking for? Any more info on gaining Katta faction for us KOS Iksars would be nice. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As a troll i'm assuming i'll have the same issues.  Any clues on how to raise this would be great.  Starting to think i should just get that stupid bone braced buckler, but the graphic on that one is just SOOOOO gnoob.  Would hate loosing my Sarnak battle shield for that wonderful gnoob look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jeddi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Greetings,<br />
<br />
I've assisted a few people on the Shield of Bane Warding Quest out of Katta (norms, Iskar and Ogre's) and have noted some places to get faction hits that do seem to help.<br />
<br />
Iskar start off unable to do the Quests in Katta and will get a real WWF smackdown from some less that happy people in there.  <br />
<br />
Sancrus Seru - Hunting in this zone will give positive hits to Katta factions but will obviously tank you with Seru.<br />
<br />
Mons Letalis - Hunting the Thought Leeches in the caves (n1000 p35) give all positive hits with Seru including Seru himself - a good place to counter hits in Seru and you'll need a brain anyway for the SoBW Quest).<br />
<br />
Tene Mnts - kill Coterie vampires - alot of them.  The hits are not big but they do add up over time.  <br />
<br />
If you can get beyond KoS, start doing the Ralic Pack Quest with the Grimling Runner (you'll need invis the first few times you do the hand in) and then you should be good to go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toxzyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye the faction is easy to raise with most folks in Katta. But if you were kos from the start to Katta peeps you can forget about doing the shield quest unless u raid deep into Sanctus Seru and hit the Hearts of Seru folks for Concilium Universus faction. This would require a few groups to tackle.<br />
<br />
There is no other way around raising Concilium Universus that I know of which doesn't involve a raid on Sanctus.<br />
<br />
Anyway my friend has the skulls and she will be mq'ing this part of it for me. Bye bye katta. good riddens :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After two days of trying, I can say that for my Troll brethren, Katta faction is a pain probably not worth raising.<br />
<br />
I have tried killing coterie in Tenebrous Mtns.  Two hundred or so, and no budge.<br />
<br />
Tried two ways to do the Pyrrohite Sample quest.  I tried invis, but the second he gets it, my invis drops and I'm insta-whacked by the dwarf.  Fortunately, he's an easy root, so you can just lock him down, step outside, camp in the corner, pop back on and reinvis.   Also tried having someone else do the hand in to &quot;share&quot; faction.  This didn't work.  Shares the XP, but not the faction.<br />
<br />
My next attempt is going to be to do the part of the Innoruuk necklace quest, the one that gives you the one-charge halfling mask.  Anyhow, I'll be going in to Berk with about 15 Pyrrohite Samples, the mask engaged, and hope I can fool my way to good faction.<br />
<br />
Any other thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe I may have found the solution.<br />
<br />
I got a halfling mask (see Regent Symbol of Innoruuk quest), went into Katta, and became semi-non KOS.<br />
<br />
Could hand in 2 pyrrohite samples before Berk Thurstone jumped me.  Simply ran down the hall (around towards Twilight entrance), reinvised, waited till he simmered down, went back and repeated.<br />
<br />
I'm still KoS, but now instead of scowl, it's threatening.  So it looks like it will eventually work.<br />
<br />
So if you worship Innoruuk, this is possibly your way to the shield.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
