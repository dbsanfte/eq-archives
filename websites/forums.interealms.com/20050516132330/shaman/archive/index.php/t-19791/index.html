<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Our guild runs several raids per week and I am the senior shaman so I usually ensure we are ready to go, ie: roles and stuff.<br />
<br />
I like to ensure people feel like they are contributing so I assign Malos and Slowing duties to different shaman.<br />
<br />
I also like to ensure that every group has a shaman (not hard we have 6 that raid)<br />
<br />
I'm not really crazy about having one shaman doing both slowing and malos as it hasn't caused any problems for us yet and I am very aware of shaman stacking issues at raids and giving them a way to contribute.<br />
<br />
My question is...<br />
<br />
So Group One has the MA and Puller<br />
<br />
Should the main Slower be in Group One or the person who casts Malos?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What are you raiding ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As long as they call it in Raid say I have not found it to be a problem.   I Malo and slow all the time if i fail there are 4 more shaman to pick up the pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My vote is neither.  If your going to have a shaman in every group anyway, might as well have one with no major duties in the MT's group so they can spot heal easier off the bat.<br />
<br />
There are only two shaman in our guild and I don't recall either of us ever being in the MT's group.  Really don't need to be.  If the cleric in the MT's group needs to know when the mob is slowed, have them /join the shaman channel.  Beyond that, there's no huge reason why the slowing or Malo shaman MUST be in the MT's group, so throw a different one in there and give them spot heal duties on the MT, chanter, or whatever.<br />
<br />
(now my guild is a family guild and all, so I might be way off for your scale mobs...  Whatever it is your raiding.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It doesn't make any difference what group he is in. Just give him a healer in case people are slow to /assist heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In my guild we typically assign buff duties. I realized I didn't hate buffing so much as I hated memming/dememming buffs. If I know I'm responsible for focus all night, it's no biggie to keep it memmed and /rt as necessary.<br />
<br />
Raid buff ownership is not tied to who is MGBing necessarily :)<br />
<br />
My guild typically debuffs by mob (since our pullers like to bring multiple mobs to camp). In our channel, a shaman will say &quot;on %t&quot; and then malos/slow the target. It is difficult if the mobs have identical names, so then we would say &quot;on %t in back&quot; or &quot;on %t on left&quot;  If we're in a particularly smooth groove, we can land slows immediately behind another shaman's malos. A dedicated shaman channel with debuffs clearly announced is a must!<br />
<br />
Our motto is, it doesn't matter who slows it, as long as it gets slowed. I'm sure we slow over each other all the time, better safe than sorry!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Usually one shaman goes ahead and slow everything pulled and announce that. Then the rest of us usually hang back and chill untill we see a bad pull or the volunteer slows.<br />
<br />
And if i see noone else volunteering, i usually do. I usually as someone in group to watch my health as i do.<br />
<br />
Also, what group you place the people in does not matter. If splitting tasks are vital, we talk in the shaman channel and set tasks. Announce the debuffs in raid or in a specific chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Last time I raided Chardok we had 1 person cast and anounce Malo, another slow, and I crippled.  The only thing cripple does in my opinion is allow others to hit the mob for higher damage.  Cripple does not seem to lower the damage of the attacking mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We split up the duties across the shaman that make it to the different raids. Try and organize the buffing and what not across those who have which spells and MGB available. The debuffs between different shaman. Malos off the puller on inc, followed with slow from a second shaman. 2 others pick up an add from the ST's target, and we work around.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like the way we do it.  We call in our shaman channel &quot;%t is MALOSED in 3.4 secs&quot;.  I tied this into my hotkey so it's casting the spell and telling everyone, so usually approx 3.6 sec later someone else calls out the slowed message on that mob.  Works great, and mobs get debuffed fast.  Sometimes when two mobs of the same are in the camp, you may both do the same mob, but i know that we alljust hit the other mob with it again just in case.  Works out great and you know what shaman is on what target.  There are no designated malos or slow people.  The last thing i want to be doing is sitting there while the malos person is slow and the mob has been in the camp for the last 10 secs.  Mob starts coming to camp, and by the time that he's fully into camp he's basically slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We kinda have assigned responsibilities, but they are not so much 'assigned' it's just the way we've done it for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Usually 1 will malo/s and the other 2 will assist off her for turg.  We would alternate mobs, him on first...me on 2nd and so forth.  If many mobs are inc, then one of us will break off and malo/s the excessive adds with the 3 alternating back and forth between assisting.  It's simple to judge by the debuff calls in channel where we're at in the order.  Naturally some mobs get done x2 but that's a minor &quot;glitch&quot; in the system.  Everyone keeps focus up on trash clearing and just call the name of whom they are doing in channel so they arn't doubled up on.  The only time we assign a buffer is if there is a rookie with us....naturally he get's crap detail.  (had one guy keeping up avatar on the clerics...was trying to see how much he'd take before he blew =P )<br />
<br />
Communication is vital, talk to each other until it becomes second nature...to just know what your boys are doing.  Now the only time we have to mention &quot;the job&quot; to each other is when one of the rookies is along.  Otherwise it's just iddle chat, and you know everyone is takin care of business.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In my guild we typically assign buff duties.

<br />
<br />
We do this as well, I even have a little macro set up:<br />
<br />
/rt<br />
/pause 20<br />
/cast 5 (slot where buff is memmed). <br />
<br />
Individual buffers are announced often over the course of the raid, especially after a spot where there are deaths. <br />
<br />
As for the slower group thing, we try not to have the PRIMARY slower with the MA or the Pulling group. This allows those healers to concentrate on their duties, and the slowers healer to watch his back. Malos really doesnt matter, it doesnt generate that much aggro anyway, and if your add-tanks are on their toes, you can run around and Malos every mob in a pile and never get hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thks for some great answers, will really help me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just wanted to give you a method we use for raiding with multiple shaman.  <br />
<br />
The obvious reason for assigning duties is we have so many roles in raids.  I hate switching out multiple gem slots just to buff one or two people.  Sometimes the same shaman will get overwhelmed. <br />
<br />
We try to assign groups for differant shaman.  In the buffing role we will usually have 6 shaman on a raid.  3 will be assigned to groups for buffing roles. <br />
<br />
For example if we have 6 groups shaman 1 will be assigned groups 1-2, shaman 2 groups 3-4 and shaman 3 groups 5-6.  No matter who dies or asks for buffs we have the assigned shaman take care of it.  We also though require only group leaders to send tells for buffs.  This limits the amount of tells.  <br />
<br />
Those shaman basically that are buffing are back up heals as well so the gem slots are buffs and heals.  <br />
<br />
The other shaman are overlapping debuffs and offense.  They usually are casting Malos, MalosiXXX, and slows.  They will also RGC, and do cures based on mobs we are doing. <br />
<br />
The back up buffers are usually assigned to either a caster group for heals.  The offensive and debuffers assigned to heavy melee groups.  They would also FA a group of rangers and or rogues for instance. We also assign out a specific shaman to disease slows only.  We will often cast off the disease slow and tugurs at the same time.  Just in case the mob is not really liking regular slow.  Especially if its a new encounter.  <br />
<br />
It is really as creative as you wanna be with the raid leading.  The targets are preassigned and we usually have very little overlap.  We try to switch it up so people aren't always stuck slowing or healing.  All and all it makes for good raiding and accountablility.  <br />
<br />
All of this is always decided and done in a shaman channel so we can keep track of what is going on.  We try to limit the MGB and always have a back up with at least two who have it up in case we wipe or have to redo annulled buffs. <br />
<br />
People know thier roles and follow in suite with what is needed. <br />
<br />
Rascalan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lots of good info here ;)<br />
<br />
Another tip for debuffing/slowing; if you are constantly pulling multiple mobs to raid, I tend to assign a shaman to debuff for each main/off tank and get them to watch over the tank as well for emergency heals etc. lose a lot less clerics this way when multiples come in ;)<br />
<br />
Also, I try to bank my MGB whenever possible, let one of the newer shamans take care of it so mine is available for emergencies</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When I was still raiding in everquest we tried many different slowing strategies, and none of them really proved efficient until we tried matching up each tank with a shaman. This was very effective. Instead of assigning each shaman to malo or slow duty, you assign each shaman to a seperate tank. The shaman always assists his tank and slows the mob that his tank is on, whether that means malos + turgurs or just turgurs. The advantage this really gives is the shaman can patch heal with much more ease as he covers his/her tank only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The tactics you're going to use will be so situational that its hard to say that any one way is the one true way.<br />
<br />
Here are some of the situations that we've gotten so used to that we usually just 'deal with it' without going into debates in the channel anymore.<br />
<br />
1.  High turnover encounters.<br />
<br />
Some encounters (paticularly planar) can have a very fast turn over of secondary people.  They die like flies because of adds, AoE's, curses, what have you.   We usually assign 1 standing singleton buff for each shaman.  Focus, STA being the two that are MOST needed, followed by IOS (for the clerics) and then AGL, and Diaku.  As people get rezzed in each shaman drops his buff on him.<br />
<br />
2.  1001 adds encounters<br />
<br />
There are many encounters where no matter how good the pullers are you have adds.  Maybe dispite their efforts or because they are trying to pull as many as they can to 'beat the clock'.    For these encounters we use a free for all system.  Each shaman is going to debuf each-an-every mob that he can.  Yes, there is double debuffing.  But usually it is kept to a minimum because as we debuff we call it in channel.  Better too much debuffing than a full speed mob cutting down its add tank and chowing down on the clerics.<br />
<br />
3.   Boss Mobs<br />
<br />
Boss mobs that can be slowed... must be slowed.  By hook or by crook.  It doesn't matter if you have 2 or 2 dozen shamans... Somebody has to get that slow in.  We typically have 2 shamans who have max spell hast casting Malo at the open (just because it does fizzle way too often) while everybody else is pounding slow.   Called in channel we sometimes see multiple successes... but if the mob is slowed... its always a good day.   And dont forget the Cripple chaser.   You didn't need those Hitpoints anyways.<br />
<br />
4.  Backup healer<br />
<br />
Never... ever.. let your shaman be the only healer in a raid group.  It completely negates his debuffing ability.  He cannot debuf if he cant take a few thousand points of damage and a Rampage or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For named/boss mobs that can be slowed the debuff chain is essential.  I assign someone to Malos, another person Malosinia's (usually Mage or Shaman) until it sticks, and we include the enchanters (Tash) and bards (debuff songs) in our channel so they can pile on their debuffs as well.  We've been doing NoTV lately and having great success in slowing and keepin slowed the named dragons.  All coordination msg are announced in the shaman channel and a successful slow is announced in /rs.<br />
<br />
Note don't spam the channel with attempts.  Only announce successes.  The exception is Malo(s) because that always sticks and is the first that should land in the debuff chain.  Also be sure to keep a timer on the slow duration (approx. 6 mins.) for those long combats.  If it wears off someone dies.  We use a 3 min. timer to refresh slow and allow for failures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">People are getting a little bit off topic. To answer the original posters question-<br />
<br />
The MA group would typically want the top 4 warriors along with a bard and a cleric. The only time I ever end up in this group is when we are doing an encounter where my group cures needed. Then I take the place of the cleric.<br />
If your going to assign a specific Shaman to debuff and another to slow, I'd put them in the same group along with someone to watch their health. If you have a good number of clerics that would be best, but a druid or even another Shaman will work nicely.<br />
If you have 6 Shaman regularly raiding with you and that is enough to put one in every group, you are fielding around 36 people. That is a pretty small raid. My guild generally makes wizard, necro, rogue (god help you if you get stuck in this one, not only do they want to plow to every enrage but they hassle you over FA the whole time as well :P), and chanter groups. Usually a Shaman ends up in these to keep watch on the groups health. A smaller guild would probably have to consolodate that so that you would have casting DPS grouped together (wizards, mages, and necros) and maybe a melee type group with someone to watch their health.<br />
Certain encounters will change that up completely, but that is the basic template.<br />
<br />
As far as how my guild handles debuffing/slowing duties-We are pretty informal about it. There is an unspoken competition amongst us to see who can land the first slow, especially on the big named mobs. :) Because of this, there is always someone willing to take what I call &quot;the Shamans gamble&quot; that means try to slow without any kind of debuff beforehand. Then there is someone who waits for the tash message to cast, and someone who plays the safest but slowest strategy-Malos+Turgurs. It causes a layer effect. Even if the first couple slows get bounced, the mob is still getting slowed quickly. Again certain encounters require you to perform very specific tasks.<br />
<br />
And its nice to see what you did with your sig Gloriana. I approve whole-heartedly. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok, stopped reading after Gloriana's post because she posted something I completely agree on and wanted to expound on a bit.<br />
My guild typically debuffs by mob (since our pullers like to bring multiple mobs to camp). In our channel, a shaman will say &quot;on %t&quot; and then malos/slow the target. It is difficult if the mobs have identical names, so then we would say &quot;on %t in back&quot; or &quot;on %t on left&quot; If we're in a particularly smooth groove, we can land slows immediately behind another shaman's malos. A dedicated shaman channel with debuffs clearly announced is a must!<br />
<br />
Our motto is, it doesn't matter who slows it, as long as it gets slowed. I'm sure we slow over each other all the time, better safe than sorry!<br />
<br />
I'm going to use tier3 time as an example for when having as many shaman as possible is a good thing.  First, for those who don't know what tier3 is or anything, here is a quick rundown.  You have ~1:15 to kill multiple waves of red and yellow con mobs (~100ish?) with mini bosses in each wave and 2 boss mobs at the end.  To accomplish this you need to have multiple TMs because so very few mobs are mezzable it just won't happen.  So how do I involve the shaman in my guild?  A shaman is assigned to each TM.  That shaman is responsible for malos and slow on their TM's mobs and then helping to spam heal their TM.  Remaining shaman are in charge of ninja buffing everyone on rez and announcing in shaman channel, pullers take priority.  They are also responsible for malos/slowing named mobs.  At 6 shaman we are able to have everyone almost insta-buffed, less shaman deaths, more spam healing, faster slowing without everyone slowing the same mob every 3 pull leaving the other 2 unslowed.<br />
<br />
As for boss type mobs... we malos (2 people designated per every boss, just in case of interrupt while trying to stop running or whatever), get the boss slowed without pulling aggro (yes, we ALL attempt slow but pace ourselves more since we normally have 4-7 shaman per raid), then spam heal.  At times, depending on the number of shaman present, the dps of the mob, and other factors I may assign a shaman to perma Q the MT... also may assign a shaman to rebuff rezzed MTs... everything is mob dependant, and it's easier to reallize your roles if you talk to the other shaman in your guild and learn as much about the encounter as possible as soon as possible (on encounters my guild loses to we start LONG threads saying everything and anything anyone observed... helps everyone reallize their roles).<br />
<br />
Also, always know who has mgb up... and only mgb sta (assuming your guild needs it) if you have an OVERABUNDANCE of shaman present, otherwise do it down the raid list.  Never buff agi... learn to tell people to bugger off... once the raid gets going, if you do not already have sta loaded, tell them to bugger off.  If you have an overabundance of shaman present and ever have near wipes, don't be afraid to mgb fos to cover mass rebuffing often... MGB is just over 1 hour refresh, it's not that sacred (as a shaman) if someone has up in case of full wipe, yours will repop.<br />
<br />
4. Backup healer<br />
<br />
Never... ever.. let your shaman be the only healer in a raid group. It completely negates his debuffing ability. He cannot debuf if he cant take a few thousand points of damage and a Rampage or two.<br />
I disagree.  First of all, if you know that a mob will rampage, or has the chance to, your fellow shaman should be told to wait that extra 3-5 seconds until other melee engage to be sure they are not on rampage.  Second, we make great group healers after we are done debuffing... but if you gotta debuff your group needs to know they are SoL until the mob is slowed.<br />
And dont forget the Cripple chaser.<br />
On &quot;trash&quot; clearing we do not cripple mobs.  For boss mobs, if mezzing is not required from the start, we leave Cripple up to enchanters.  If they do not need to mez during an encounter TELL ENCHANTERS TO DO IT.  We can heal and perform many other functions rather than wasting our time crippling a mob when another, more useless (for the circumstance) class cripples.<br />
<br />
Those are my thoughts as a heavy raiding shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As far as how my guild handles debuffing/slowing duties-We are pretty informal about it.

<br />
This might be fun, but it can also be detrimental.  Fast slows are important, but I would suggest that fast and efficient is better.  Chain slowing will often get the shaman aggro and a free dirt nap.  If you have plenty of shaman to go around perhaps this isn't a problem.  We typically have 3 to 4 so it becomes important that our shaman stay alive.  Dead shaman slow nothing execept the raid progress.  Therefore we opt to use the debuff chain and slow when we have the greatest chance of landing it.  With good timing this doesnt take any longer and is more mana efficient than bouncing a few slows.<br />
<br />
I don't think it matters what group the shaman are in, though I would suggest placing them in seperate groups.  I also agree that having an additional healer in the shaman's group is important as they will often aquire aggro when slowing adds and assisting the enchanters.  Placing them in seperate groups gives them the oportunity to be spot healers and share buffing responsibilities with greater ease.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
haha!  Whenever I am placed in the group as the only healer, I just tell my group flat out that they are going to die in the event of agro.  They think it's funny up until they time they do.<br />
<br />
Usually we assign one Shaman to Malos and one to Slow.  It’s a bit faster (if in a good rhythm) than one person doing it and can cut down on some of the agro.  Most times we have two off tanks handling the pulls.  We will (Shaman numbers permitting) assign two shaman to each.  One to Malos and the other to Slow.  In the event we only have two shaman on a raid then they are assigned to Malos/Slow for the OT they have been given.<br />
<br />
During any given raid we will usually assign one shaman to buff.  Not a hard job for one person and it surprisingly keeps them very busy.  Our guild likes to move fast so we believe in getting people buffed quickly in the event of a death. In the event that a Shaman drops (/gasp) then the person doing the buffing will step up and take that persons place until they are back on their feet.<br />
<br />
On rare occasions we have more than five shaman present then the extras are free to do what they want, heal, Dot, DD, buff, etc.<br />
<br />
All of us know to assist with heals on big named mobs and back heal when able to for our group to help free up clerics to watch the MT.  <br />
<br />
Duties are usually changed around to keep people from being bored and/or complacent.</div></div><hr />
