<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sraxxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have information regarding the respawn time for the Iksar Apparition in HS?<br />
<br />
I know the spawn location and have spent a fair amount of time in the south wing. I have seen it up when I got there, but I have never seen it respawn.<br />
<br />
I took a couple of groups there last night to finish the 8th cudgel.<br />
<br />
The apparition was up when we arrived, but disappeared from track before we could get moving. Another group likely passed through there and aggro'd it.<br />
<br />
4 hours later there was still no spawn.<br />
<br />
Any information would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">somewhere between 4 and 8 from what I can tell.  It's quite a while unfortunately.  We almost had a group kill it when i was getting my cudgel, luckily we were talking about it in ooc, and the group stopped mid-way through killing it so we could get him reset.</div></div><hr />
