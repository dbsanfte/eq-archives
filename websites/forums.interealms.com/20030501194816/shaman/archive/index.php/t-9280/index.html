<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to find out as much info as possible on obtaining Wolf Caller's Armor in Skyshrine. But in order to start the quests I need my faction with Claws of Veeshan to ALLIED status. So the question is,<br />
<br />
1. Does anyone know what gives out good faction for the Claws of Veeshan.<br />
<br />
2. Does anyone know the name and or lvl of the mob that hands out this quest(s) is located on?<br />
<br />
3. What is a good lvl to start this quest?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
P.S. here is a little more info, My toon is a Barb Shaman lvl 40. I parked him and my lvl 40 Warrior in the Great divide last night, never killed on Velious before and have no idea what my current faction is with the Claws of Veeshan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well,<br />
<br />
Get some levels, son.   Hunt in Kael and kill anything that moves.<br />
Get more levels and then go on a raid to the temple of Veshan (HoT) and get very, very lucky and get a chain drop.  Then, get even luckier and win the dang thing against all the other chain users.  THEN, worry about doing the quest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Before you're old enough for Skyshrine armor, it's likely you'll be getting chain drops from Kael to turn in to Thurgadin for Rune Crafter's armor -- worry about that first. Kill giants either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">have no idea what my current faction is with the Claws of Veeshan.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is easy to answer... Scowls. They don't like anybody who hsan't proven themselves by laying waste to large numbers of giants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Currently killing lots of giants and wolfs in the Great Divide, both give good factions to Claws of Veeshan and Coldain, which is good for all those armors. I will mush through some more lvl's then go fight in Kael. thanks for the advice all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you just want to check your faction real quick grab your nearest druid friend and get a port to Cobalt Scar.  When you get there be careful, stick your head out a little and con a Wyvern or a Drake.  This will tell you your CoV faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It takes a lot of giant killing to become an ally to the Claws of Veeshan.  It's good you are starting now in the Great Divide.  You can also hunt the giants in Eastern Wastes to increase your faction with the Velious dragons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just a little note, from experience with my rogue, the Storm Giants (only found in Kael) give better faction with CoV then the normal Frost Giants (found in EW, GD, WL and Kael).<br />
<br />
When I was grinding my faction with my rogue, it took forever for it to move when I was hunting Frost Giants in GD, but an hour or so in the Kael Arena it jumped from apprehensive to indifferent.<br />
<br />
The faction increase is about 6-8 Frost Giants to everyone Storm Giant.  Likewise doing the Giant Helm and Toe quests are great for faction too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just ask to tag along a raid, Vindi raids are great, one shot bumped me from dubious to warmly if memory serves. Grinding faction on giants sucks, just ask to hitch a ride on a Vindi or Arena raid, get out Burst of Flame and you'll be max ally in no time.<br />
<br />
On the server I play on, I have yet to be told no or heard anyone told no after asking to come along for faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At 40 you will probably be limited to giants in GD/EW/IC and any Kromriff are going to give you more +coldain than +CoV which is fine because it will set you up to work on Thurgadin armor.  You will want to be in the low to mid 50's to be effective in an arena group where you can pick up Thurg armor and good +CoV hits from the zek giants there.  Getting in on any opportunistic hits on Vindi/AoW/Tormax will greatly reduce the time needed to hit ally with CoV.<br />
<br />
Generally, you want to be L55 or higher before hitting ToV for armor.  The more levels the better because you will resist more and get resisted less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Id suggest not worrying about it too much yet, wolf callers is SS armour, but theres a lesser set that drops in Kael...cant remember the name offhand, but its still damn nice. at 45-55 u can get in small raids that drop this stuff and it will greatly improve your faction, as well as your gear.<br />
