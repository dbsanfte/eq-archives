<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ballastar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First, like many before me, I'd like to say thank you to the great community we have here. I don't ever post, but I troll this board daily for the wealth of info you all have to offer. <br />
<br />
I'm curious if anyone has put together/found info on the proper progression for flagging your character. For instance, I'm only lvl 57 and am just working on lvling at the moment, but have the flag from Mavuin (spelling?) to do trials, got a flag after talking to the NPC outside of PoD and that's about it. Much like was posted about the trouble with questing for keys to enter crypt of decay etc. I don't want to miss an important flag along the way, whether I quest, kill mobs, etc.   Anything like a - &quot;talk to this guy first, then proceed to do this, then speak with him/her&quot;!<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for all the info. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">from my limited experience:<br />
<br />
To get the flag from killing grummus you must talk to the NPC outside of Disease<br />
<br />
There is a NPC in one of the buildings near nightmare you must get a flag from before participating in the PoNightmare hedge maze event<br />
<br />
those are the only two I know of that require pre-flags, but my guild hasn't done very much in PoP yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ballastar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I searched through the buildings around PoN and didn't get a flag from talking to anyone.  Only person I got much of a response from was the high elf that is tending after the sick people.  She said something of needing a Bile from PoD.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something?  Which bile is this from PoD btw?  Droppable?  Can I solo the mob?  I have soloed some of the Tsetsian Flies near zone in before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">to get the flag for hedge maze you need to say something to the erudite woman in the building with the sick people on the floor..  I remember 'nightmares' being one of the keywords but dunno the whole phrase</div></div><hr />
