<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Acidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
This is my first post.. been reading this board since I switched to a shaman rather be forced to live out my days as a druid.  Great info here, it has really helped me learn this class. Thought I would join in the discussions now, and learn how not to make a fool of myself at the higher levels playing this class.<br />
<br />
Just hit 34 (actually 35 now) love the dog, and I was wondering at what level should I start giving him weapons and also at what level should I start giving them weapons that proc. Love playing the shaman so far, great starting a wis casting class and throwing all my points into stam. Truly a great feeling from being a druid where if you get breathed on you die compared to tanking with the dog.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help or info you can give me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the 34 pet CAN dual wield if given weapons, although his ability to do so is quite limited. Just farm him a couple rusty 1h's and hand em to him. At lower levels it doesn't make as much of a difference, but with the level 61 pet, dual wielding him increases his damage by 60% or so.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hehe, that's what he said.  He said he does not believe the 34 pet dual wields for beans but the 61 pet gets a 60 % increase or so.<br />
<br />
**edit** personally i dont ever carry around weapons of any sort to give to &quot;scooby&quot;.. And I have no clue what increase he truely gets from it if i did. i just buff him really good, and keep him alive. <br />
<br />
If you guys all carry around a bunch of bulky weapons (as i tend to see it) what are they, and do they stack thus not being bulky. Would we have to farm them or can we vendor purchase some where. (this is a 61 pet question.) <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The weapons make a HUGE difference imo.   I used to be mistaken as a beastlord quite often in fact.  (In PvP)   Buy a rallic pack or something if you're afraid of the weight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Best thing to do as far as weapons go for the higher lvl pet is get mage summoned weapons if possible.<br />
<br />
Failing that I carry around secondary hand only weapons so it only takes 1 to make them dual wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I carry around gnoll hide lariats.  The Stun proc can really come in handy.  I nab em when they're below 30pp in the Bazaar or find em 19pp on vendors.  Don't pay the 100pp that I see some goofballs charging.  <br />
<br />
But I only give em to dogdog when I expect her to live a while.  In raids or pickup groups that might not go for long I generally don't bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i notice a huge difference in fidos dmg output wihen he's give a couple of weaps. I didn't know just giving him (1) weap would eneable dual wield... is this tru? even if it is whats it to go clean out CB or one of the camps in PC for 30 mins?<br />
<br />
i clean out CB 1-2 times a week while buffing the newbs &amp; walk away fully loaded with bags of rustys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've noticed the &quot;Alpha'd Project&quot; 61 pet &quot;whatyouwannacallit&quot; has a higher chance to hit for max (60), and seems to hit double/triple/quad (unless my lag makes me read it incorrectly) more often than a non-weapon pet. This using any dual weapon set up (no particular weapons over others, so rusty to FS to gnoll hide lariat etc). <br />
Only buffs I give him to help out are FoSoul, celerity, and sometimes SoW if I'm on the move.<br />
<br />
It is a pain to have to carry around everything, but hey, I'm an ogre so str isn't an issue as much as space is. Gnoll Hide Lariats are very nice as Verdandi has said, another nice pet weapon is that rog/all snare proc, which I forgot the name. Either way, if you can, I'd suggest getting something for your pet either way, no matter how big/small.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Look at the NPC vendors in the Bazaar and the vendors by the bank in PoK.  Usually you will find Shivs that drop in LoY zones.  They are about 8 gold or so (with 131 cha) and arent very heavy (2 stone I think).  I usually pick up 2 every time I go so that I always have 2 weapons to give to the mutt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Think the snare proc is the serrated bone dirk. I use that or the gnoll lariat if the occasion arrives to use its proc. Else i use the mage summoned weapons alot for damage procs. Guess just situational uses but just giving rusty works nicely also. I notice the difference just using epic on mob and letting pet tank and how fast it dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I didn't know just giving him (1) weap would eneable dual wield... is this tru?<br />
<br />
If the weapon is secondary only then yes. If it's your standard rusty weapon you need 2. If you try a mage pet where you can see em wielding the weapon they try to equipe the primary hand first, if they can and then equipe the secondary. If they weapon can only be equiped in the secondary it goes there with nothing in the primary and you get a pet slashing/peircing/what ever and still biting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">for dual weilding anythign works as long as u give the pet 2 of<br />
<br />
Rusty weapons (not 2 handed)<br />
Fine Steel<br />
Velium<br />
Shivs and other LOY junk weapons dropped all over dulak.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Moxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well for iksars, (which you are), the quickest way is to go to FoB, where, just outside the entrance to cab, there is a vendor on the upper level of the ruins that sells sabretooth daggers for like 5 silver a piece..he also has an endless supply which makes life much quicker. Not stackable though, so bring lotsa bags. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The issue with pet weapons has never been weight for me, but simply bulk.  Unless I have procing weapons, my favorite puppy fangs are rusty daggers.  They are very lightweight and easily obtainable.  If you can travel to Freeport, which with the port books is now just a mater of faction, there are two vendors that have endless supplies of rusty weapons.  I believe they are both in the same section of town as the docks.  The one I use is in the slum pits.  Rusty daggers are only a couple of silvers each, so they won’t kill your belt pouch.  Another way to get rusty daggers is to fish.  Every time I fish I keep six of the daggers and drop or sell the rest.  Another possible source of rusty daggers are NPC vendors near fishing spots.  There is a pool of water in PoK and two vendors standing next to it.  I can often find rusty daggers on one of them before I rush off to join a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't know if anyone has noticed this or not, or mentioned it, but lvl limits on Mage summoned items are considered when our pet is wielding them.  I got several messages the other night that my pet's will was insufficient to command his weapon.  I'm 57 using Howler and I had given him some Blades of the Walnan or something.<br />
