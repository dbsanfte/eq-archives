<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Umbral Plains isn't exactly a typical zone for level 53.... however... I was allowed in an UP group yesterday by some level 60 friends of mine because (and strictly because) I'm a shaman. The main reason for this is even on the red mobs there our slow spells will land, and groups there need, I repeat NEED, slow on the mob to save the cleric mana on heals. I didn't leach off the level 60 AA xp at all. In fact, I think I helped them get it better by making the kills go easier. I got better XP in UP than any other place I've tried so far (including the hole, if you can believe it, but I did not do HHK since I'm a barb shaman and don't want faction hit so I can't compare what that's like). Two yellows yesterday there in 53, and fast. Tons faster than seafuries in OOT. The only caution I'd make is be sure you have a rezzer because after awhile one of your slows is not going to stick on the mob and the mob will randomly go berzerk on the poor shaman until you are dead, and not even a cleric or all the taunting tanks in the world is going to be able to save you if that happens, so you will probably die sooner or later (I died twice). It's weird how this happens. Usually if slow doesn't land the mob doesn't care all that much. You might get summoned but that's it. However there's always that one, random mob who absolutely hates it when your slow doesn't land and nobody can taunt off the aggro off you. Anyway, this place rocks for XP, not only for level 53 but the 60's I was grouped with too. - Warmag of MM</div></div><hr />

Yea, so what's new ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like this zone.  It got me through 55 pretty fast with some good loot for some other classes in my guild.  At 56 we still pull yellows and I get to cast BoN and Ebolt consistantly to put a hurting on the cave men :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">UP is good group EXP but theres noting faster then HHK i started there at lvl 49 and went from 49 - 55 in about 25 hours play time then from 55 to 57 in about 20 hours at lvl 55 UP is probaly better exp but not for 49-55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rooser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What is HHK?  I had assumed high hold keep, but alkazzam's shows highest mobs there 35, which would not be very good for a 52 shammy....so again, what is HHK?  Thanks in advance for any help...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is high hold keep. They're talking about the NPC's and guards, not regular mobs.</div></div><hr />
