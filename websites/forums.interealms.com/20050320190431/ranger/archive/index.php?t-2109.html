I spent a little time there with a group and we almost got wiped out...are there any ways to pull break a room or anything where we won't train out the whole zone till we can work back our living froglok faction...don't know how mine got bad to begin with, but it's a serious pain in the ass to have them keep jumping me mid fight.  I only just barely made it into the dead side and got jumped by like 6 lives while trying to fight a dead...couldn't even pull back to the group got jumped so quick....once again any pointers are greatly appreciated as this seems like an awesome place drops and xp wise that I would love to spend a lot of time in.</div></div><hr />
