<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading up on Plane of Mischief.<br />
<br />
As is only appropriate for this enigmatic and unique zone, there is a wealth of information about PoM, but mostly confusing and often utterly contradictory. <br />
<br />
There seems to be 3 different versions of PoM.<br />
Version 1 is defunct.<br />
Version 3 replaced Version 2 but has been rolled back so its back to version 2....<br />
<br />
It iseems to be changing, but here is what I want to know:<br />
<br />
1. Does Cluckker the Crazy give out the Deck of Spontaneous Generation?<br />
2. If the answer to Q1, above, can you purchase the deck from chest vendor? <br />
3. If the answer to either Q1 &amp; Q2, above, is &quot;yes&quot;, do any of the mobs drop cards?<br />
4. If the answer to Q3 is yes, are the drops sufficiently frequent to make it worth starting to farm for flowers again?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can give Clukker the Crazy (if hes there) who is supposed to be in the far right corner of the forest a fishing grub(s) and he'll give you a deck. However the cards are only confirmed to be dropping by one mob in the zone, the white stallion (also spawns on the right side of the forest), and possibly from one of the Lithiniaths (not confirmed).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Clucker is a gnome in a corner in the forest, then yes, you can get them from him.  Confirmed this personally.  (Forgot exact name of MoB I got it from.  And doesn't quite give it away...but the a fishing grub is involved)<br />
<br />
2. If the answer to Q1, above, can you purchase the deck from chest vendor?  <br />
<br />
From what I hear..and I repeat..I hear , no.<br />
<br />
3. If the answer to either Q1 &amp; Q2, above, is &quot;yes&quot;, do any of the mobs drop cards?<br />
<br />
Again, from what I hear one MoB still drops cards.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. If the answer to Q3 is yes, are the drops sufficiently frequent to make it worth starting to farm for flowers again?  <br />
<br />
Depends on your definition of frequent.  For most folks no.  But, if you have been playing a more-or-less increasingly broken class for a few years, normal rules will not apply.</div></div><hr />
