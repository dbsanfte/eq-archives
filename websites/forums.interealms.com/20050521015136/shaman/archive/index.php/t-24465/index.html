- but it wasn't all fun and games; I tossed a couple of heals around too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">[pep-talk]<br />
<br />
Wow, isn't text-to-columns great? Not counting that last tic, which was technically into the next minute, I did 10518 damage, or 175.3 DPS. Sustained. Without any DoT damage enhancements via Bardsong, AA, focus or tribute (only Affliction Haste 3). And I didn't even have Po9 up, I was too slow clicking off HoV... And me with no Elemental, GoD or OoW gear yet, even.<br />
<br />
[/pep-talk]<br />
<br />
EDIT: had to add in the 150 DD effect from Bane of Nife hitting. <br />
<br />
ps, not counting DS damage, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haha, I used to challenge tanks to aggro-grabbing competitions wayback when, like KD arena or something, back when KD vets were a long tank! A decent shaman will invariably be able to get aggro if they really really want to, but the dps you need to generate sufficient aggro is not something you can sustain for all that long (well, I can't, anyway)<br />
<br />
As a rule of thumb, in a single group with a decent tank i can run Epic, BoS and BoN without getting aggro. Any more than that and I start getting summoned and smacked around. Frankly, If I am doing my main job; malos and slowing, and my secondary job of patch healing and buffing, then I cannot really comfortably run much more than Epic, BoS and BoN for long periods of time.<br />
<br />
175 dps is awesome for sumeone who dioesn't have all the whiz bang Time/God gear. However, at the risk of getting a &quot;pedant&quot; tag, I believe it is only kosher if you include the time spent on malos, slow and cripple in calculating your dps heh heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It was right at four minutes from malos to dead; I'll grab the whole lot and see what my overall was, but yeah, with the ramp-up of the dots, the overall encounter won't equal this one minute when they were all in full swing. But then, with melee off, I won't have my True Spirit and ASC2 damage to factor in, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okay, I analyzed my log:<br />
<br />
Duration of fight: 4:24, aka 264 seconds or 4.4 minutes.<br />
<br />
My casting:<br />
1x Malos<br />
1x Turgur's Insects<br />
3x Cripple (for agro!)<br />
1x Cannibalization<br />
1x Spirit Call V<br />
<br />
10168 damage from 3.9x Blood of Saryn<br />
10080 damage from 4x Bane<br />
05004 damage from 3x Anathema (DoT component)<br />
00450 damage from 3x Anathema (DD component)<br />
04280 damage from 2.5x Bane of Nife<br />
03537 damage from 1.4 Breath of Ultor<br />
02826 damage from 2x Curse of the Spirits<br />
-----<br />
36345 damage from spells<br />
00486 damage from damage shield<br />
00231 damage from melee<br />
-----<br />
37062 damage given (didn't record pet damage, I keep others' off)<br />
<br />
37062 damage / 264 seconds = 140 dps sustained over the duration of the encounter, not including pets. <br />
<br />
But I still maintain that it was 175 dps sustained after the debuff and DoT ramp-up time, not including pets. And I actually didn't throw any heals around during this one, oops. Keeping those DoTs going kept me pretty busy, and I don't imagine I can up my dps noticably without getting some AAs/Focus/Tribute effects working in my favor.<br />
<br />
For the morbidly curious, the relevant portion of the log is at http://samanna.net/misc/log1.txt<br />
<br />
ps, with CA3/LR5/CS3/ID1, I was:<br />
- hit 15x for 9319 damage, and missed 12x <br />
- bashed 1x for 148 damage and missed 1x<br />
- kicked 3x for 393 damage and missed 0x<br />
<br />
This has been your voice of mediocrity reporting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sounds about right Sam, those longer fights allow us to stack our DOT's.  Unfortunately those fights are few and far between and you don't want to get smacked by unslowed 2200 quad hitters in raids and get yelled at, lol.<br />
<br />
My guess is that fully focused and AA's damage would increase your example up to 200-220 dps.<br />
<br />
But as I suggested in the other &quot;damage&quot; post 80-125 dps is about all we can &quot;average&quot; in normal 50 sec. fights (excludes 20dps fluffy).<br />
<br />
Purdy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That fight is a great one for Shaman dmg. Low resists and it lasts a decent amount of time. Last time we did it I ended up doing 59k dmg not counting pet/swarm pet. Worked out to about 200-210dps from spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh, no doubt, if you spend the first third of the fight debuffing, and the next third casting a DoT, you don't get much damage in. <br />
<br />
On those occasions when I get into an MPG group, it's just malos, slow, cani, repeat. Well-geared and well-AAd level 70s tear through those mobs like... well, like charmed pets in Tipt, almost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, agro can be really fun with DoTs and debuffs.<br />

Couldn't get Bane to stick.  But I knew if our MT went down I'd be summoned along with most of the other shaman right away as normal.</div></div><hr />

Balance of the Nihil<br />
Blood<br />
Bane<br />
Spear<br />
Hello aggro!<br />
<br />
The SK was chain-casting hate and could only get aggro off me with a successful taunt... until the next tick of dots hit. Too funny. The group was laughing their butts off at the Shammytank.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. I refuse to get any of the Spell Casting Subtlety AA's. There are too many occasions where you just HAVE to pull aggro off a healer.</div></div><hr />

managed to ks a raid on lcea katta with BoU+pox+plague for dps only (I think she just killed to many peeps resetting their dps to 0)<br />
VZ in tactics seems to prefer to gank me over the 5 pally's who are chain stunning and all I have running is pox or BoU.<br />

we have weird agro.</div></div><hr />

Three top disease dots after Mal decay. <br />

Then Spear dot<br />

Then Blood.<br />
<br />
Then Bane and Anathema<br />

Then blood again. And bane and anathema with Rains as able.<br />
<br />
Add in Rusty equipped mutt. And the Swarm Poodles of Chaos<br />
<br />
If I wasnt doing damage We would not have killed it. and 6 dots hitting is nice. But effective at damage we are not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, just because it wouldn't stick doesn't mean it wouldn't generate agro. I've gotten some unslowable mobs pretty mad at me that way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Heh, Trying to get aggro can be very fun!<br />
<br />
I remember when my old guild did VT every shaman there would only have 1 nuke and 7 DoT's memmed on Diabo Xi Va Temariel.  Unfortunately none of us managed to steal aggro, but occasionally we got the KS  :) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>StormCrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Had a few people say it was impossible for me to pull aggro from them.<br />

<br />
Most of the time for me that second Poison DoT puts me over the tank on aggro....while standing up.  Forget meditating from that point on unless it's on a horse! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you add to critical affliction.... forget it... agro city. I only have CA1 and once that crit hits the mob wow.. especially with Bane or BoS. I suppose on the off chance that it will crit two at one time (rare with CA1) it's just about instant agro, being that you have already ticked off the mob with slow and cripple.<br />
<br />
Once you get CA3 Samanna give it another shot.. i'm curious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Theres a Warrior twink in my guild that is a total agro monster.  Ive never seen anyone hold agro like he can.  So I decided to give it a test see what he could really do.  Malos on inc, TA click for slow, then a quick 2 count and slap Yoppa, Saryrn, Bane, Anathma.  These dots have a 45% poison focus, 40% Curse focus, and ICA2.  I almost never get hit, and even if I do he usually manages to get agro back right away.  Now, if I add click Pox from my pants the agro gets a little bit iffy.<br />
<br />
I will admit, for a 'twink' hes fairly well geared with all the agro toys every warrior would love to have.  Dark Blade of the Warlord, Edge of Eternity, both auged with Anger IIIs.  Plus a few other PoTime and Qvic bits here and there.  His agro abilities are very impressive.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Shaman can throw down some serious damage with a well geared and played tank.<br />

I had to stop doing damage at all to let the pally have agro in an easy ldon (helping cleric get gear).</div></div><hr />
