<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I know many of you hate these threads...but I cannot seem to access those Magelo profiles, and am tired of sifting thru the items on allakhazam's.  They give me a general idea, but cannot get solid information about prices and I am sure I am missing some stuff.  Also, fellow Shammies most likely to know the bargain items for various slots.  Soooo, here goes...<br />
<br />
I've been whizzing thru the levels with very little thought about equipment or plat, paused briefly in my 30's to quest totemic, but have not really upgraded more than a slot or two since then.  I am now woefully underequipped for lv. 49, but am making some cash at seafuries.   I have been focusing on AC, but my wis is a tad low (never more than 160, with bear form and swapping in my +6 wis rings over my 6 ac/65 hp rings), ac hovering around 850 or so.   <br />
<br />
I'd love some suggestions on items to improve wis and ac (resists always a nice bonus) that will not cost too or that I can camp.  Uber items not really option for me :), looking to spend about 3-5 K total.<br />
<br />
Ok, do not laugh, here it is:<br />
<br />
Ears:   Orc Fang Earrings<br />
Face:   Artic Wyvern Mask<br />
Neck:   Ivory Imbued Collar<br />
Fingers:  pair 6ac/65hp and pair +6 wis (switch as needed)<br />
Head:  Totemic<br />
Chest: Totemic (have Rygor's as well)<br />
Legs:   Totemic<br />
Boots: Totemic<br />
Arms:   Jaundice Bone<br />
Hands: Rygor (have Totemic as well)<br />
Back:    Kunzar Cloak<br />
Shoulders:  Tattered Mantle<br />
Waist:  Strawspun Belt<br />
Range:  Sun Chalace<br />
Primary Weapon:  Spine Chill Spear or Sharkbone Hammer<br />
Shields:  Charred Guardian Shield/Shield of Falsehood<br />
<br />
I was thinking of 3 things: getting a Sarnak Battle Shield, getting a belt item with wis (and at least 6 ac), buying some of the cheaper JB pieces.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hello....<br />
<br />
All depends on whether you got doe... or not...<br />
<br />
1) You got doe..... <br />
<br />
As a shield I would go the The Crystal Chitin Shield ac 20 wis 9 mana 40, on E'Ci this is about 3 to 4k....<br />
<br />
Belt pends on whether you are a mana or battle shaman, if mana get a Flayed Turmoil Skin Belt, ac 9 wis 6 (about 500 on E'Ci) or if battle a Oak Leaf Girdle ac 6 hp 40 mana 40 (on E'Ci about 2k)<br />
<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield is good, but mainly as a part of your resist Gear..... I'd go for the CC Shield If I were you for now....<br />
<br />
2) You don't have enough doe....<br />
<br />
Go to KC and try to get some of the Jarsath Scale no drop armor, On E'Ci almost no one wears this and as such it just rots.... it has descent stats and is better than Totemic.....<br />
<br />
Or try signing up for some public hate raids and get your hands on some of the Rune Etched, or better yet go to Plane of Growth, Shaman armor on PoG is called Spirit Weavers armor, and is no drop. Spririt Weavers armor is The SAME armor as the Thurgardin Quest armor, Same STATS but just another name....<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
But I didn't have any money untill after level 51 so I too were what you called *underequipped* there is no shame in this, as I think there are way too many who twink their characters and thus don't really get to know how to play their class, and after 55 above it really does matter whether ppl know their class or not....<br />
<br />
What I did was signing up for some public hate raids and after I got a full set, I found out about the PoG armor (but PoG armor look really ghetto, so be warned LOL haha) and started collecting PoG instead....<br />
<br />
Besides I wouldn't whine if I were you, you'll get to better gear soon, but that again pends on if you are a battle or mana shaman.<br />
<br />
Hope you can use what I posted.... :)<br />
<br />
Here is some of my gear:<br />
<br />
Head: Crystal Chitin Circlet  - or JB helmet (for ac)<br />
Face: Arctic Wyvern hide mask<br />
Ear: Forest Loops - or Black Sapphire Earrings for solo and hp<br />
Neck: Ivory Imbued Collar (needs upgrade)<br />
Arms: Crystal Chitin Arms<br />
Writst: Rune Crafters Bracer / Rune Etched Bracer / JB  Bracer<br />
Hands: Crystal Chitin Gauntlets<br />
Fingers: Wis 8 rings - or Velium Fire for solo<br />
Chest: Jaundiced Bone Bp<br />
Waist: Flayed Turmoil Skin Belt - or Oak Leaf Girdle (for hp)<br />
Leggings: Rune Etched Leggings<br />
Feet: Coldain Skin Boots - or Crystal Chitin Boots (for ac)<br />
<br />
Primary: Howling Harpoon (LP turn in for epic now YAY)<br />
Secondary: Crystal Chitin Shield - or Sarnak (for ac hp and resists)<br />
Range: Divine Inspiration (ac 15 wis 15 int 15 mana 35)<br />
Ammo: Shattering Hammer<br />
<br />
I also have a complete set of resist gear, one you should start to think about getting too... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your gear seems relatively ok. Sarnak Battle Shield is a good upgrade, you can get a Clay Guardian Shield for less (same AC but no resists).<br />
JB armor may be a the next step for you. Any JB you can get your hands on...get it.<br />
Spider Fur Belt can be used to replace Strawspun. Same AC plus WIS.<br />
If you wanted to save up even more cash, go for Ikky BP, 19 AC plus regen.  Or Froglok Scale Chestplate could also replace Totemic. <br />
Howling Harpoon or Slimey Harpoon for ranged slot. Medicine Totem is also an option (not sure on price of those).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at folks around your level and see what you'd like.<br />
<br />
Kinda like shopping really with the magelo's as the stores.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah you have to put in a really small bit of effort too, sorry about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL, I TRIED clicking on those links and reading the threads and all I saw was blank screens.  I am not so lazy as all that :)  I cannot seem to access Magelo and am not good with computers.  I have spent plenty of time looking around allkhazam's, eqcasters, and this site.  I always read the equip.  threads.<br />
<br />
/shrug, I still wanted some assistance.<br />
<br />
Thanks for suggestions so far, much appreciated :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would really spend some time in KC, good exp at your level, and you can pick up JB gaunts and boots for cheap (couple 100 pp cash go a long way there).   And it's a good upgrade AC wise to totemic.  Also try to get into a basement group for some jarcrap legs, they are excellent till you can get velios quest/plane. You don't list your bracers, the jarcrap bracer is AC 8 4 wis (so I have to say - no idea if kitties can wear that stuff). The helmet is only 10 AC but has 10 MR, so pick one up for resist gear.  All the jarsath stuff is routinely /ooc'ed as rotting.  Chest - CIB would be nice, but the prices have been exploding lately with the fungi nerf rumors, (currently 8 k on Xev).  But it's fairly easy to get, I'd think one every 4 -5 h on the TT cycle, and that again is great exp for a high 40's low 50's group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was in the same boat at 49, and now at 53 I'm starting to feel relatively comfortable.  Part of it is spending the time browsing on allakhazam's so you know what gear might be good for you, and part of it is looking for that gear to be auctioned for a decent price.<br />
<br />
The biggest part (for me) was joining a good guild so I could go to Fear and Hate, kill dragons, grind in KC regularly, and whatnot.  Without guild support I'd never have been able to upgrade to an emerald dragonscale tunic, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ears: Orc Fang Earrings (not sure about kitty ear choices- I'm spoiled by the barb cultural earrings)<br />
Face: Artic Wyvern Mask (fine) <br />
Neck: Ivory Imbued Collar  (fine)<br />
Fingers: pair 6ac/65hp and pair +6 wis (switch as needed) - (fine)<br />
Head: Totemic - (Get a JB to swap out when AC is needed)<br />
Chest: Totemic/Rygor (I know they're fugly, but a Tree-weave provides nice AC for the money!  If you're swimming in plat, get an iksar regen tunic (5-6k on Karana))<br />
Legs: Totemic (fine- tough spot to upgrade, Jarsath is a nice upgrade but tough to come by- no drop on Karnors; worked dragonlegs are still a little pricey)<br />
Boots: Totemic (JB !!)<br />
Arms: Jaundice Bone (fine)<br />
Hands: Rygor/Totemic (JB, or for more plat, CC)<br />
Back: Kunzar Cloak (probably fine, if you have some plat, seahorse cloak is great for ac/hp, arcylia or arctic wyvern is great for wisdom)<br />
Shoulders: Tattered Mantle (elder wolf hide or chokidai spaulders- that said I'm still wearing the tattered myself.)<br />
Waist: Strawspun Belt (spider fur for HP for a couple hundred pp, flayed turmoilskin for ac/wis combo at around 1k, cobalt drake for extreme wis for lots of plat)<br />
Range: Sun Chalace (I swap a howling harpoon for wis or a goranga idol for ac/hp- each cheap)<br />
Primary Weapon: Spine Chill Spear or Sharkbone Hammer (good- next upgrade is a rune etched icewurm fang, or epic.  Smoldering brand is a nice cheap sharkbone upgrade.)<br />
Shields: Charred Guardian Shield/Shield of Falsehood  (clay guardian shield !!!  Super cheap and very nice ac/hp.)<br />

Why do I try to squeeze in a response when I'm supposed to be running off to a meeting!  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
From a few comments so far, I guess I'm not as underequipped as I thought.  I only minorly twinked myself with some basic wis stuff from my druid and about 200 pp when I was a newbie.  <br />
<br />
I guess I read so much about other people's stuff here I felt I was lagging.  Well, that and the fact that most of the stuff I'm wearing I have had for at least 10-15 levels.  It's just that I finally have over 2K in the bank (plus some items to sell), and making more at seafuries.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the time some of you took to answer :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Someone suggested a Flayed Turmoil Skin belt and I can't disagree.  They drop almost every raid and go into a fund of some sort as most shamans typically have it or better.  On the same raid yo'ull have a shot at your child's tear which I imagine you'll want eventually? If you've heard the horror stories about Fear, come to it late when you know they've already broken it if you have to.  That sounds like it really sucks, and it does in a way, but I don't have tons of time on my hands so I try to stay out of situations with possible long CR's.  Other idea I didn't see was to go for the Sentry/Guardian armor from SS. If you're on Giant faction, take a monk with you and camp the pool room.  All of the pieces are really nice and the pieces you don't need sell reasonably well (a lot is no drop, but a few pieces aren't).  Nice exp here too.  The KC suggestion was a decent one and a pretty safe bet to get some upgrades.  JB pieces are selling for 500pp on Luclin (helm, boots, arms, gaunts) You're 51.. Camp Gormit in OT and you can make 2k in 2-3 nights and if any of those pieces upgrade you, that's a pretty nice exp/money camp and will get you some good upgrades.  Your stuff isn't all that bad though :) That's for sure<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">a little note about magelo:<br />
- you need to be using IE (usually 5.0 or higher)<br />
- try clearing out your cache<br />
<br />
As for the original poster's gear, hell, I don't think it's bad at all. Maybe lots of twinks have equivalent gear many levels lower, but you should be able to function fine with what you're using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Kinda OT, but this seems like a good place to post it...<br />
<br />
before i new much about the class my friend twinked me the way he saw fit(this being my 2nd/3rd char, none of the others survived to a surname)<br />
<br />
He gave me mostly wis gear, which ive swaped for some AC stuff i got myself...<br />
the question:<br />
He gave me GEBs, which have very good wis on them, but not much AC.  i was wondering should i go after JBboots(and whats a good price, Saryrn server) or jus keep these on me feet =-) and i will be starting epic soon, what about the black fur booties? thx<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: what are good prices on the JB gear? particularly the minor items =-)<br />
<br />
thx agin</div></div><hr />
