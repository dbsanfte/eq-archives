<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Obadia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i am lvl 25 now.i am an ogre.i play firona vie so grouping is kinda of hard at times.<br />
 can anyone give me some tips on soloing and where to do it?i am not twinked and i am sure my armor is below average(i only have 120 wisdom....)i have all my spells so far<br />
<br />
 my stats are 600 hp  342ac and 492 atk<br />
<br />
 seems i occasionally find some light blues but they don't even move my exp bar. :(<br />
 am i doomed or is ther any hope! :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dit ye on up to the Moon.  Sounds like you need cash, so, about this level the bandits in Paldual caverns are moving from blue to light blue...though there are still dark blues to be had.<br />
<br />
You can solo....but the bandits like to come in 2's and 3's.  Now I can do it, as Im twinked, but you relative ease in soloing more than one depends on you.<br />
<br />
ANY group will gladly take you in...sit there for a couple levels.  Yes, the exp may be a trifle slow, but remember, Paldual is a 22% xp bonus zone.  <br />
<br />
I usually made about 15-25pp, hour there, and I didnt loot as much as some (cause Im a cream filled twinkie).  I gurantee, in several hours you'll be 27, with an extra 100-200pp in the bank.<br />
<br />
Have fun...oh, by the way:<br />
<br />
Brone Brigandine armor sells for the plat...with my trollish charisma from 1pp - 3pp....use them charisma buffs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mistmoore ... by the lake, get a group or solo.  MM has a fast respawn and lots of mobs to kill, perfect for the 24-27 crowd.  Later graduate to the GY till 35. AWESOME exp for the right group.<br />
<br />
SolA is an option as well, shrink and invis to the rug room and pull fairly safely, zone on an overpull.  My ranger did pretty well there solo.  On BB anyway, the zone is a ghosttown.</div></div><hr />
