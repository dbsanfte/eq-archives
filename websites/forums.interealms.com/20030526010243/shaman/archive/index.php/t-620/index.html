<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Made 60 last nite - memmed Focus and cast it on myself - all my stats went down.  Seems I am better off with HoS, Rage and any of the arm buffs that will stick.  Am I missing something here?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm, did your hitpoints go down?  Focus also doesn't add to stamina or agility, so generally I buff focus + agi + sta.<br />
<br />
Once you get VOB, it will also stack with focus.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, I could care less about my str or dex, it's all about the hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes Harness + str + dex = more str and dex the Focus....  But Focus is more HP and is in most cases &quot;adequate&quot; str and dex to max most tanks.  Plus obviously its only 1 buff slot which is great for raids.  also it stacks with VotB and that should max you if you need max stats for soloing... I Often use VotB on raids simply for the agl as it stackes there too,  It about 38 more ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still think Harness stacking with str and dex arm buff is a stacking issue and Verant is just too lazy fixing it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use kragg Rage Nimble and RH at 60.<br />
<br />
Rage doesnt stack with Focus, and Kragg has way more HP than HoS. I don't give a rats ass about the extra STR and DEX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would much rather use Focus for an important stat, like HPs.<br />
<br />
Rather than stacking HoS for unimportant stats like strength and dex.  Pretty much all my melee friends have max strength with Focus, or focus and bard songs anyways.<br />
<br />
If you want to use Rage all the time, I would suggest using Kragg over HoS, until you can get ahold of Voice of the Berserker and then just use Focus.  HoS and Kragg have the same duration, like 20 mins less than Focus.<br />
<br />
HoS = 250hps, 67 str, 50 dex<br />
<br />
Kragg = 380hps <br />
<br />
Focus = 405 hps, 67 str, 60 dex<br />
Grp Focus = 430hps, 67 str, 60 dex</div></div><hr />
