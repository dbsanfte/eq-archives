<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm in my 50's now and just started to work in groups.  Mostly in LDoN adventures.  It's taking some getting used to, grouping that is.  So as the Shaman in LDoN adventures, I see my main job as the slower.  I was wondering if I should set some kind of message telling the group the the mob is slowed, like when the puller tell the group of an in coming mob.  Do I need to do this, or should people know that I will slow the mob?  And what do I need to do to set up a message saying it's slowed?  Besides just typing the &quot;the mob is slowed&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">whenever i slow a mob, in a raid, in a group, whatnot, i have a hotkey letting the group know that the mob is slowed [%T] is SLOWED, it makes it alot easier for the group, and its becomes a habit to hit that extra hotkey after slowing mobs for a while, makes everyones lives alot less stressful :)</div></div><hr />

I am familiar with the &quot;social&quot; Hot keys, just wasn't sure what the comand was for the targeted mob.  <br />
<br />
I can see this helping the stress of the other group members.  I noticed some other group members trying to slow the mob the mob I already slowed.  This help things.  I guess I should make a Malo hotkey too.</div></div><hr />

I have that set up as DEBUFFED %T, and it gets used when I'm working with an enchanter who's got a charmed pet, or when I'm working with a wizard who needs a debuff.

That is why I brought this up, cause I was in a hard LDON last night with a pickup.  And it really was hard.  A slowed message would've shown that I was doing my job, and like I said, some people were slowing mobs I already slowed.  I just figured that people would know when the puller brings in the mob, that the shaman would slap a slow on it.  Looks like the hotkey will help pickup groups realize that.  I guess your right about malos, but that resist hotkey could be useful for the reasons you stated.</div></div><hr />

There's so many people to please when grouping.  So much different from soloing where I'm my own boss.  But I should learn how to act as a shaman in groups.  This could make things easier, just tell them all in the begining, in case they don't know, that I will be slowing, and just give them a resisted message if the mob resisted.<br />
<br />
Do all the monks pout when the Shaman says he/she wants to pull?</div></div><hr />

<br />
nope, because i always keep at least 2 mobs in the camp, and keep them on DPS :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Typically when doing ldon's I don't use my hotkey unless there are multiple mobs.  If you want to reduce spam in group but still want to annouce it use /say.  Some like to be cute or include some catch phrase, but I prefer the method that gumrock stated %T is SLOWED.  short sweet and hard to miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If there are other slowing classes, I will often announce the first slow or so, then stop announcing.  Depending on the tank, they can tell I've slowed when I grab aggro.  :rolleyes: <br />

I try to Always announce Canni5 tho - it prevents cleric heart attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I used to call slow on every single mob, but then it got to the point people thought it was spam. I never call slow in LDoN especially because there is a new mob every 30 seconds or so, and we do the same thing to every single one of them. Now a days the only time I ever call slow is on named mobs on raids, and thats it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">After reading all this, I think I will just tell the group before hand that I will be slowing, and only give a message if it resisted, and then another once it is slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'll call slow if it looks like people are confused.  Say on a  4 pull I'll call which mobs I've slowed first so the chanter or offtank can help me out,  but usually its real obvious which ones are slowed cuz they are beating on me.<br />
<br />
I'll call a resist of the mob is gonna cream me, but again that happens less and less in LDoN's now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What gets me, is when the puller brings an Add or two.  I usually just slow them all, but I'm not sure if that's the best thing.  Do I wait for a chanter to mezz it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting the mobs slowed is your job. Do it asap. <br />
<br />
The others job are to save your life by either mezzing, tanking or healing asap.<br />
<br />
Once they are slow you have fullfilled your task and go about help with healing or DPSing.<br />
<br />
The ONLY time you might consider waiting is if you meet higher mobs and your tank has problems keeping aggro and your healer is retarded.<br />
<br />
If they pummel you and interupt your spells back into a corner and keep slowing / healing yourself if the healer is not paying attention.<br />
<br />
If you are the healer you will have to get them slowed first so you wont have to heal asmuch. Here in this case a skilled chanter can mezz adds and you only need to slow the one the tank is going to start with, but this requires that all of you know what you are doing (ie selecting the right target at the right time).<br />
<br />
If you are main healer and have no chanter you can be in a stressed situation if you get too many adds. In this case it would be vital to (have everyone who can) use root as crowd control and park adds in different places. Once they are parked and tank is dandy with his slowed mob, you can safely go about debuffing the other mobs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No!<br />
<br />
Only damage (DD, DoT or Melee) does that. You can debuff, slow and yell profanities at mezzed mobs without them waking.<br />
<br />
Be prepared to take some aggro if you land much on them.<br />

That means if wont have time to slow everything before you need to heal your tank probably. Wich means a skilled enchanter can buy you time to slow and heal without your head exploding. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You can also Root a mezzed mob and not break the mez as long as the Root doesn't have a damage component the way Druid roots do.<br />
<br />
Generally, I find that handling adds in normal LDON is easy for a Shaman. Stand reasonably far away from the MT, pick a mob that the MT is NOT tanking, slow it (thus drawing agro) and the mob runs over to you. Root it, step out of melee range and do the same to the next add. Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
Things to consider:<br />
<br />
1. Will the tank live with 3+ unslowed mobs pounding on him? If it's a warrior, he probably will, especially if there is a Cleric healing him and/or he has Defensive up. If not, you may have to consider using your AE slow.<br />
<br />
2. Resists and Malo(s). I don't get enough resists in normal LDON to justify Malo, but opinions differ on the subject.  The best argument for using Malo that I can think of is that it helps Root to last longer. If you are &lt;60 and don't have an irresistable debuff, you are probably better off chain-slowing.<br />
<br />
3. Unrootable mobs. There is a fair number of them in LDON, especially in Tak, so I try to pick rootable ones as my first slow targets and let the MT handle the unrootable ones. By the time I get to the unrootable mob that the MT is tanking, my slow won't get me agro.<br />
<br />
If there are ONLY unrootable mobs in camp, I just slow one, draw agro, offtank and channel more slows through the mob's slowed melee. If your AC/HP is on the low side, this may not work for you.<br />
<br />
4. Casters. Root parking casters is generally less effective than root parking melees - a no brainer. Besides, their melee DPS is lower, so slowing them is less effective. Slow/root park melee mobs first and let the melees kill the casters, especially healers, first. I am not a big fan of wizzie mobs either.<br />
<br />
5. Pet issues. If your pet is equipped with Mage toys, the proc can break Root (um, or so I seem to recall, not 100% sure), so you may not want to have the dogdog offtanking the add. have him assist the MT instead.<br />
<br />
Of course, all of the above only applies to less well equipped adventurers. In a well equipped group, normal LDON is trivial and I just melee or something :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You know everytime I tell people I'm using AE slow they freak out and tell me not to.  It's kind of funny how everyone just automatically assumes that AE slow has insane aggro.   Well it doesn't and this a myth that I have been actively trying to suppress in my guild.   Sure if you are the only one that has cast on the mob they will come running to you, and maybe the initial aggro is enough to overcome the -250 hate on tigirs (i think its -250 anyway),  but this spell really is a life saver.</div></div><hr />

Just make it known that you will be slowing every mob...I only call out resists. I also call out slow on raid mobs...i hate the spam. In LDon hard or GoD I like this message<br />
/g %t ***resisted*** slow recasting ASAP<br />
/tell ubercleric %t resisted my slow...recasting asap<br />
<br />
It is important that the cleric knows if slow is resisted so they do not loose the tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">One thing I find can help you decide is to tell the healer if they want to know when you've slowed the mob, as some prefer to see the message to decide on their heals. I have tended to stop using it as much in places where the tank/cleric aren't going to have problems with an unslowed mob of if they are two many adds or they all have the same name.<br />
<br />
With mezzed mobs I find malXXXX, slow and cripple will make it safer for the chanter/bard or don't usually tend to take hits as well as we can.</div></div><hr />

I also tend ta call any mini-named or what not as wit harder stuff, it a big help fer da cleric so dey kin go from spot heals ta CH'in as needed.<br />
Wit friends orra guildies I never bother wit hot keys fer anything but da named stuff, cuz dey know da drill.<br />
Hoy keys is guds, helps folks know yah doin yah jobs right if dey dun know yah at first, but dun recomend usin dem fer every slow, dat jus spam =-).<br />

shrug.<br />
It's alot of spam, and people will notice when it's unslowed when it's beating the tar out of them.  I'll use it on raid targets on important stuff.  Anything else and it's far too spammy, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Depends where I'm fighting and who with, easy places I tend not to bother. If I'm in Vxed/Tipt I will start them to give Clerics a feel for how long it takes our slow ass spells to land then generally stop after a while and I only bother with resist on hard mobs. I then usually let the cleric decide if they want the spam or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Used to spam slow msg's but later decided it's too much spam and only do it  on important raid bosses. Like Belegurth said ppl notice when a mob is unslowed anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Since we are throwing out a bit of strategy here to help Gunny, I have found that in hard adventures with 3 mobs incoming due to bad pull is what separates the good groups from the bad ones. (same with 4-5 incoming in normal LDON with non-uber group).<br />
<br />
If there is a mezzer in the group it is not always best to methodically slow the mobs!!!  Make sure you get a quick slow on Main Assists mob, but after that keeping the bard/chanter alive is more important than slowing the 2nd and 3rd mobs right away!!  Get things under control then slow the mezzed mobs.<br />
<br />
That is a huge tip and probably only learned in the battlefield (as I did)but please keep it in mind.  I saw one of the above posters comment that job one is slowing, and although that is usually true there are exceptions in crisis situations where a smart Shaman can save the day.  <br />
<br />
Now, don't expect any credit since I swear Shaman good deeds are invisible to other peeps, lol.  Part of being a good Shaman is probably keeping your mouth shut when you have saved the day and everyone is saying &quot;good job cleric&quot; &quot;good job enchanter&quot; &quot;good job tank - way to get agro&quot;.<br />

/grumble on<br />
Often after I leave groups I'll be telling with someone in the group and get a &quot;yeah we died like 4 times after you left&quot;  and still they don't get the fact that the shaman kept them alive when the shaman was there, they must think it's a coincidence or something.  I know in my heart that shaman are the strongest, most versitile support class and I don't need praise, it would just be nice to think other people realize the value of it as well.<br />
/grumble off<br />
<br />
I have a hot key I use for right when I join pickup groups until they get my cadance, then I don't spam.  I like to figure out how each group memebr will react to whatever is thrown at us and plann or change spell line-up accorindly and assume others do that as well, so I make my style and pace obvious.  I also do it for heals if I'm the main healer for a few heals so they get a feel for when I'll cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never too late to learn :)<br />
<br />
Just remember that certain things don't apply at lower (&lt;60 or &lt;65) levels. For example, &quot;hard&quot; LDON is not that hard at 20-60 when you simply get the next &quot;tier&quot; of mobs. At 65, the difference between &quot;normal&quot; LDON, where mobs hit for 360ish and are fully slowable, and &quot;hard&quot; LDON, where mobs hit for 998 and mitigate slow, is quite big.<br />
<br />
I am yet to die on a &quot;normal&quot; levl 65 LDON on my Shaman, much less lose one. And that after 30ish adventures, including ones with only 4 level 62-64 people in the group, ones with people who were AFK most of the time, ones without any healers or tanks aside from me, etc. On the other hand, when putting a &quot;hard&quot; LDON group together, you have to find decent pullers/tanks/healers and pay attention.<br />
<br />
There are other bits of advise above that don't necessarily apply at level 52. For example, I don't think that Mage summoned weapons will proc for your puppy until you get your level 61 (55, perhaps?) pet, so you won't have to worry about him breaking root until then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">My Slow macro is reflexive for me - even if I group with my friends or people I grouped with a few times in the past.  Yes, it is spam.   I've been doing it for so long that it feels weird if I do not do it.  Heck, I click my macro even when I am 2-boxing solo sometimes.  It's habit, and I think it is a good habit to have.  Yes, it is spam.  Yes, it can be annoying.  BUT, it can be useful at times if you have a lot of mobs in camp.  That message may help you determine if you slowed a mob or not.  <br />
<br />
As for people noticing mobs are slowed?  Well, when you slow a slightly mob, sometimes you still cannot tell if the mob is slowed.  I have had people bitch in the past about that, and  /shrugs  it was slowed - read my message :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Throm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Much like other posters, I sometimes will hit the &quot;slow&quot; hotkey at the beginning of a pickup LDON group.  After the first pull, I don't bother.  About the only other time I will mention it is when we have multiple mobs and when I get em all turgur'd then I'll just say something like &quot;All slowed&quot; especially when there's another slower in group.  <br />
<br />
While I routinely slow mez'd mobs at camp, I rarely ever root them, too.  Perhaps if the chanter happened to be a kamakaze and used the AOE mez, then I would make a point to root them too.  I've been away from the game for a LONG time, so maybe chanters do use that AOE mez from time to time, but I haven't seen it in my limited time back.<br />
<br />
Hehe, I remember when they first put the capability to use &quot;%T&quot; and expanded the number of hotkeys.  I think everyone spammed slow messages for a while after that whether we needed to or not.<br />
