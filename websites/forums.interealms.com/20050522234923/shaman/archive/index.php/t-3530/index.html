<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i am looking for a new server that i am planning on starting a trolly shaman on, because my slots are filled on tribunal, i would like a server thats relatively friendly (and with a relatively cheap jbb price!) any suggestions??<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're interested in roleplaying at all, I would suggest Firiona Vie. I've heard only good things about that server, and as far as I know it's still a relatively undeveloped server - ie, there's not a ton of level 60's like every other server yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">JBB are spendy as hell on FV tho.  <br />
If that's truly an issue . . .<br />
But I've heard nice things bout that server as well.  A motivated person could do very well there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">luclin is pretty good.......jbb around 12k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if ur euopean and even if ur not go to antonious bayle, friendly people and prices r WAY low on items, eg cane of the tanq even though its not shmmy can go for 80pp. dont be bothered by its low population BTW, its only like 300-600 difference between top and bottom one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can't recommend a server, but try not to come to Quellious if you can help it. You can't swing a stick without hitting a shaman, I swear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe. isnt that the truth about quellious. i recently stopped playing cause of some loot grubbing mongrels that destroyed my guild there, but there were tons of shaman you would run into all the time, even if you were the only one in the zone !</div></div><hr />
