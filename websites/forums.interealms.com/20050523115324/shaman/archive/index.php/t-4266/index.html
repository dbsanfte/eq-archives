<br />
Seeing as a 59 Monk and a 60 Druid killed him... I wonder if a Shaman with Torpor and Canni IV could solo the guy?<br />
<br />
Can he be JBB'ed?<br />
Will epic DoT land?<br />
Can he be Slowed?<br />
<br />
He does not hit very hard... Seems doable...<br />
DS potions would do quite a bit of damage in that long of a fight :P<br />
<br />
I would think by using a combination of DS Potion, Slow, Torpor, Canni IV, Epic Dot, JBB, and maybe another DoT, he could be taken down...<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I heard he was quite significantly upgraded since irontaail and his druid friend killed him.  Even before then he had about a million hit points they say.  Do you know how long it would take you do do 1million damage with a JBB?  <br />
<br />
1,000,000 / 263dmg  = ~3803 jbb casts<br />
3803 * 8sec = 30,423 seconds<br />
30,423 seconds / 60 = 507 minutes<br />
[EDIT:  man, damn ... I knew that looked wrong... minutes, not hours.  It's pretty irrelevant anyways hehe.]<br />
<br />
assuming you got full damage each time, could chain cast without ever an interruption it would take you 507 minutes to cast the jbb that many times.<br />
<br />
<br />
he only spawns for like 7 seconds per game day as well.<br />
<br />
first thing I would do, if I were you is go wait for him to spawn, and hit him to see how hard and fast he hits.<br />
<br />
but basically I say no, you can't solo bristlebane.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sure, six months ago. But now thanks to the PoM ****up, Bristlebane hits for 500 and flurries. Even if someone did solo him, though... why? There are no faction hits, no loot, and no triggered events afterwards. That and it'd be a 10 hour fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To say that you soloed a god?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah.. I had no idea they changed BB.<br />
<br />
Also, that was the first time I saw that thing about the monk and druid...<br />
<br />
Nevermind I guess :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Callir,<br />
I soloed a god.<br />
<br />
see... simple :) and it didnt take me 6 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1,000,000 / 263dmg = ~3803 jbb casts <br />
3803 * 8sec = 30,423 seconds <br />
30,423 seconds / 60 = 507 hours  <br />
<br />
30,423 seconds / 60 = 507 MINUTES lol<br />
<br />
507 minutes /60 = 84.5 hours.<br />
<br />
hmmm still bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">507 / 60 = 8.45 not 84.5.<br />
<br />
Still 8 hours is a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You are leaving out Epic Dot, and the DS potion... That would probably cut that time by atleast 50-60%... Maybe more if you added another DoT...<br />
<br />
But this is all one the &quot;old&quot; BB ;P<br />
hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haack90</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was talking to Irontail a few weeks back about that fight  He said that BB also got a Charm proc on his attack now: /</div></div><hr />
