<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kudelini Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if anyone has found a recipie for a translocate potion like potion of frost, bone, and swamp.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keep in mind it took a few months to get the Field of Bone port created. This won't be any faster, particularly if Verant doesn't want to allow you to bypass waiting for the spires for only 180pp a pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think with the new spells in, we've got a fighting chance for a shadeweaver's.<br />
<br />
I'm just not sure how usefull it'll be, considering the nexus is so nearby (nexus-&gt;paludal-&gt;shadeweavers). At 180 a pop, I'd rather have a spiritstone.<br />
<br />
Who buys these gate potions anyway? Besides rogues on their epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kudelini Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i sell alot of these potions on Sol Ro to all the non gating classes.  If you have FoB, Swamp, perma, and shade you can get to most of the big zones real easy.  Now all we need is one on velious.  Swamp potion is real popular since the new CT was emplimented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gate potions sell very well for me. Any raiding non-gater should have a supply. Imagine LDing and getting stuck in ToV. Some zones are nearly impossible to reach the exit, like Howling Stones. Most use Thurg potions, but a lot of people are KOS in Thurgadin.<br />
