Just hit 54 and FINALLY bought my JBB (man this thing rocks on the furbies).  Buffed Anyway, a friend has a 55 druid with epic and we are thinking of getting together to bash something.  Any ideas?  I am thinking of Highkeep but it is fairly crowded on Zeb so other ideas would be nice.  Also, would prefer not to kite ( I am not a druid and will not kill that way unless I am about to die myself : ).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Highkeep would be mindnumbing - either one of you would be able to clear the whole camp...2 people would be overkill. A lot of down time, would be fun for chatting, though.<br />
<br />
Druids are fun in outdoor zones, tracking is helpful for getting that named spawn.  Maybe ME?  I don't have a lot of exp in the high end zones, so there are probably better places out there.<br />

<br />
So you won't change your playstyle to hunt with a friend?  glad I'm not your (druid) friend.  You might try it since your epic'd friend probably feels the same way about shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As with any situation, play to your strengths.<br />
<br />
My wife plays a Druid Primary, and she and I play the root rot game with multiple Mobs.  We were hunting Wurms in GD for her spells, and we would take turns pulling, she'd hit it with snare and her dot, I'd hit it with my dots (they stack well), root it, slow it, and send in the pet when its part way down.  Send in the shaman soon after to melee down/JBB, and the druid goes for another wurm.<br />
<br />
Druids have the strength of their abilities -- harmony, snare, and track among them, plus one of their main lines is fire based dmg, where shaman is poison and cold.  Depending on where you choose to hunt, adjust the attacks accordingly.<br />
<br />
Suggested locations?   Burning woods giant fort comes to mind.  Good luck out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah Snap.<br />
<br />
What would you know.  Some druids do not like kiting : ) ( I know he is strange but it is true).  Besides kiting is SO boring when you can stand toe to toe and bash : ).  Plus in all truth we are not built for kiting moe than one critter.  And if there is only one why kite?<br />
<br />
Hmm haven't been back to ME in a while.  Don't tend to be on the moon very often.  How about FG?  Understand people solo the shrooms there all the time.  Guess that is the fun of learning new areas.<br />
<br />
Vad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Vad:  I was simply pointing out the irony in your post.  You state (in so many words) &quot;I don't want to kite, thats how druids do things, and I'm a big tough shaman!  &quot;<br />
<br />
Which is fine, and exactly the way I personally feel as well.<br />
<br />
However, your friend *isn't* a big tough shaman, and it sounds like you are trying to make him comform to your hunting style without considering adapting to his style. <br />
<br />
That's all I meant.  I've duo'd with a druid before, and it was a problem until I changed my usual soloing tactics.  <br />
<br />
The biggest problem I personally found was a) they didn't like me being in melee with mobs, and b) they couldn't keep up with my mana regen, which leads to boring down time when they are medding.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Problem with druids as well is I find that they have lots of clicky dots, at least 2.  While this is great for efficiency, I found my JBB busting root and sending the druid running like a rabbit near a firing range.  Only my slow acting epic was able to assist the druid in straight rot n' root. <br />
<br />
IMHO, slow it, JBB and pet (in melee range), have the druid join in after a JBB shot or so with a snare/druid epic and let the puppy chase the mob while you chain JBB it.  Almsot guaranteed that the druid will out aggro you unless you use mana although it will take them more than one cast.  Druid tosses you a small heal and you cann back the mana and pull again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm.  better go outdoors then.  any ideas for some decent zones?  CS seems to be overrun so that is out.  Anyone played in SG.  Or how about the rapters in TD?  Understand they are good for kiting and dont hit hard.<br />
<br />
For tactics I am thinking of pulling with a slow and letting it get to me.  Rooting it and sick puppy and JBB it.  Let the druid slap his epic on it (understand this is huge aggro.) and then root and JBB it to death.  Sure there will be some breaks but hopefully we can keep im in one place.  Also hoping that he will mainly use his epic only and be able to save mana.<br />
<br />
Pity he is 56.  If he was my level we could stomp on the furbies but alas no xp for him their now.<br />
<br />
Snap, just giving u a hard time.  I know there will be some kiting but I don't like running around : ).<br />
<br />
BTW has anyone quad kited with a druid and used Torrent of Poison?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Vad - Have you tried The Grey?  It's a tough zone, so not a lot of peeps hang out there.  Outdoor, airless, and plenty of mobs.  Lots of traps on the ground, so you will often get 2 or 3 mobs in your camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Try Duo with necro...  He pulls with snare (that way FD can be used) then when mob gets to camp fear, 2 pets and poison.  No epics, slow is unnecessary, can nuke if you want, but what's the point. unless you have JBB or epic to hit extra damage with, you want to keep as much mana as possible because you will be killing so fast...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a 59 druid friend, with FG 'shrooms, as long as they are slowed he could root them but I think he gets a kick out of tanking them :) <br />
He can cast cabbage, and I can stack kragg + agi &amp; sta .. with dogdog and booboo in tow it's fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>seraphem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Try hunting WW, Chardok, SG (zones w/ animals).  Use the strategy people have mentioned here, stack dots etc, but have the druid charm a pet as well, things die really fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I havent had much sucess duoing with Druids. Maybe i just havent grouped with any that are that good.  It always seems like i end up doing the same exact things i do soloing with the druid adding in a couple DoT's so the mobs die a litle bit faster.  Not nearly fast enough to kill two times the mobs i kill soloing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druid that know how to play can make great xp in ME charming wolfs. Friend of mine have hasted pet on one (70% hasted Ravenous Beast does sick damage) and several parked in line with epic dot on them.  Almost want me to start a druid :). <br />
<br />
Love to group with him doing this, but im basically sucking xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ceylonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In a way sham/druid teams can be most devastating. Having recently gotten dire charm i teamed with a great sub58 shammy in chardok. If both players are good druid and shammy spells mix very well, although as posters above say if the druid charms the team is bound to be more effective than using druid kiting methods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The only problem I have with duoing with my druid friends is keeping agro.<br />
<br />
My friend will pull the mob with snare, then on the pull back I grab the mob by slowing it (tugurs) then bane (in an attempt to keep agro) at this point the mob is beating on me and dogdog is snapping at it's heals. Now normally I would start jbb-ing but, my friend usually roots the mob with grasping roots? and then dots it with winged death. If I then break the root by jbbing the mob will make a bee line straight for my friend. <br />
<br />
Without JBB it takes a lot longer to kill the mobs as I don't have my Epic yet, and I can't get close to the DPS poking with a spear that I can with the JBB.<br />
<br />
Do you have any suggestions Ceylonn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ceylonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hale tell your friend to not dot and wait till you get strong agro, come in with his best dd at below 75%. If hes spec'ed evoc this probably will be just as efficient as dots. I have the same problem in the grey with a wurm as a pet their pebble spell breaks root. Another choice though is that if agro is passed have the druid agrokite if you have the room.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt;<br />
Sorry forgot if you do agrokite make sure the dru runs in a large circle around you ideally never pulling mob out of jbb range :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks for the reply Ceylon.<br />
<br />
I've had a couple of thoughts about how to fix this too.<br />
<br />
She will agro kite if we've got the room but sometimes it's not possible, plus she's not getting mana back while she kites.<br />
<br />
The nuke is good idea too, but I'm sure she's specialised in Conj so it wouldn't be as mana efficent.<br />
<br />
I'm going to try another trick I used to use before I got my pet. our trusty flash of light spell. (Well the upgraded version) When blinded the mob runs away, but it will stay and attack anything in melee range. This should keep the mob on me or dogdog.<br />
<br />
I used to use it to give myself a couple of seconds to heal up when I used to solo in my 20's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ceylonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">aye hale forgot that one druids also get &quot;sunbeam&quot; at level24 the length being somewhat unreliable though. If you both mem it you could be on the right track though.</div></div><hr />
