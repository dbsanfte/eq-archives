I have yet to die from a bug in EQ...and I get that level of customer support without spending any AA on it.  :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah EQ has very few bugs and excellent customer support.  We all knew that already.</div></div><hr />

Hey, you guys are doing the same thing, just using more letters :D.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">250 days played and I've only died to a bug twice.<br />
<br />
Both times were zoning in to plane of fire and falling on top of someone and taking 20k.  After the second time I started levitating before I zoned in.<br />
<br />
GM response time, though, is indeed horrible.  The only time I have ever seen a prompt response from a GM is either:<br />
<br />
1) Two guilds are training and leapfrogging each other for a mob.<br />
2) I want my surname changed.<br />
<br />
Anything else, I expect to re-petition several times and wait several days before actually talking to a GM.</div></div><hr />
