<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No rent, no drop, inventory clickable &quot;Talisman of the Panther&quot; would get around the spell gem problem - You would probably have to balance it with limited charges to give a fair mana cost, but the summoning spell could be normal recast.</div></div><hr />

If they did this, I MIGHT be able to accept a 20-25 second recast + the reduced proc rate, but no way is 30 seconds + reduced proc gonna fly, no way. Even I am outraged, and I was a big supporter of &quot;adjusting&quot; the spell down a tone or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just don't want to cycle spells anymore.  It isn't fun and makes us slaves to timers instead of reacting to the game around us.<br />
<br />
Now:<br />
Puller says &quot;Mob inc&quot;<br />
I cast panther, panther, hot the tank, and am ready when the mob shows up.<br />
<br />
After nerf<br />
No matter what.  Pulling, not pulling. Tank afk, etc..<br />
I'll be casting Panther, wait 30, Panther, wait 30, Panther, wait 30......<br />
<br />
Talisman item, AA ability, doesn't change that.  Rotating spells based on timers &lt;&gt; Fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bladefury~fennin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I doubt ill even mem panther on a normal basis ... back when avatar was at its glory it was a pain in the ass to use and wait for it to recycle<br />
<br />
when avatar was 6 min long i would still say /finger to the spell<br />
<br />
panther is 1:30  with a 30 sec recast.... PASS ... i dont care if i sound lazy but i never liked casting this spell over and over again when it was an instant recast now i have to wait to recast it<br />
<br />
i think not<br />

With all the complaints and problems with our line and our spells, we finally get one that works a little too well maybe,,at least for some..<br />
I never can understand why anyone would call attention to it or complain that it is too powerful..it should be left alone as a quickfix for other deficiencies..just me and the way I feel..never turn down a gift or mistake in our favor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No.<br />
<br />
No more compromising. We compromised when they toned it down for pets. That is the line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My Idea ... DON'T CHANGE IT but that would be too easy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kazuyal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They claimed they were going to mess with PETS, not the spell. We all knew they were going to mess with the spell after hearing that, but didn't expect them to mess with the recast time. Whats funny is, they did mess with the pets as well. I hate being on cycle to, i hardly ever do it. It takes away from doing more important things like keeping the grp alive or whatever the situation brings.<br />
<br />
But.. Well, we knew it was going to get messed with sooner or later. One person complains, that's all it really takes anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why bother making suggestions folks.<br />
<br />
Clearly this is an example of the left hand not knowing what the right is doing.  They post that &quot;glad shaman are happy, we're going to add it across all levels&quot; then they &quot;nerf it to hell&quot;.<br />
<br />
Clearly the amount of people the SPELL developers want panthered is 3 max per shaman and they dont have a clue on how to manipulate their game system to accomplish this goal.<br />
<br />
That's it.<br />
<br />
Most shaman would accept being able to only have the buff on 3 people at a time.  They won't accept some crappy 30 second recast delay to accomplish this goal.  Shaman aren't stupid, we knew it was overpowering.<br />
<br />
Two suggestions, the same I sent them in feedback:<br />
1. Add a recourse to the spell which decreases HP of a shaman, and the healing effectiveness of direct heals on them (not heals over time).  Somewhere around 15% per cast would get you 3 casts and maybe 6 during a raid per shaman.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Change the bloody code!<br />
Give each character a new attribute called: Burnout.  A value between 0 and 255 (i.e. 1 byte).  This number goes down each tick by 10 (to 0).  If someone tries to cast a spell with a burnout and are &gt; 100, the spell is prevented (fizzle, message, dont matter).<br />
<br />
Each spell you want to 'limit' how quickly it can be reused you associate a burnout with it,  Between 0 and 99.<br />
<br />
Example: Lets say panther has a burnout of 50.<br />
Tick 0, 0 burnout.<br />
Cast panther, 50 burnout.<br />
Cast panther, 100 burnout.<br />
Tick 1, 90 burnout.<br />
Cast panther, 140 burnout.<br />
&lt; you now have to wait 5 ticks (30 seconds) before casting another panther.  30 seconds because thats how long it takes to remove 50 burnout.<br />
<br />
There you go, you've rate limited Panther to 3 casts + 1 per 30 seconds there after.  Effecting groups very little (since 3 is about the norm for exping, i.e. not losing mana) and you've allowed shaman to cast ~ 5 in a raid situation (i.e. losing mana).<br />
<br />
AND you could give classes other burnout spells.  And as long as you don't give spells a burnout of &gt; 99 they could be combined and you will no longer need a recast delay (note if you have a spell which adds &gt;= 100 burnout, it is effectively a 1 minute recast, and you could simply use the recast delay on a spell to serve the same point).  Spells could add burnout to their target (i.e. mana feeding a necro may make the recipient unable to temporarily cast by giving them 50 burnout).<br />
<br />
You could change all of the Hybrid nukes (the ones with the 18 second casting time) to a 30 burnout.  So they could cast 4+1 per 3 ticks.<br />
<br />
The point is they need to be creative, it is their bloody game they are killing off.<br />
<br />
At the very least the developers and pr people should talk to eachother.  Because its a JOKE what you are doing and does nothing except reaffirm the posts of the more jaded EQers on the various boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh,<br />
<br />
If they want to screw Raid DPS from the spell, why not just adjust the effect .... from the effect if you remove the -ve resist check, and set it to check against Magic (usually the main resist set high on raid mobs), you achieve the same thing (reduces Raid DPS) while keeping it useful to Grouping ....<br />
<br />
Or make it an AA with 30sec recast (so it doesn't waste a damn spell slot) ....<br />
<br />
There are plenty of options available to them ..... <br />
<br />
Can anybody explain the logic &quot;Whoops, we removed the recast timer on Hybrids DD's so now they can do good DPS .... um, how do we now reduce overall Raid DPS to compensate?!?  .....  I know, screw Shaman over on Panther, at least then it's only 1 classes whining we have to cope with .... &quot;<br />
<br />
&lt; Still steaming, and trying not to post too much while in this state of mind.<br />
<br />
