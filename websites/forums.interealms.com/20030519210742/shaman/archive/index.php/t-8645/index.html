<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">a friend of mine is going to turn in tear for me, he is a 61shm with epic. when i go to rak, and loot scale or whatnot, do i have to be ally, can't get possibly any better for it to work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need to be Max Ally Truespirit.<br />
I.e. you've factioned and it cant get any better.<br />
<br />
Before you hand in your scale, ask the spirit doggie &quot;What breech?&quot; or &quot;What Spear of Fate?&quot; or whatever the phrase is.<br />
<br />
If he responds then its normally safe to hand in your scale.<br />
<br />
Go track down an epic guide for the exact wording etc.<br />
<br />
If you shaman buddy has done his epic RECENTLY then get him to /con Lord Rak incase his faction has been reset owing the changes to the quest.<br />
<br />
Bascially both shaman need Max Ally as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">he did his about a year or so ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamandude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did everything from step one to the end. I did not skip any steps or anything but it did take me 2 years to complete the quest. I did everything up the shield, got my tear, got the scale for Kirn and turned it in for the ring, and then started playing another char or 4. <br />
<br />
Tonight I went to finish it, went to COM, up top, turned in the ring, got the book, turned the book into the spirit, and got the message about the end encounter. Went and turned in the tear and killed the last mob and got the scale.<br />
<br />
Went bac kto the spirit and handed it in and for faction and exp, but nothing else as my faction was not good enough :( <br />
<br />
Now what do I do.. I should of gotten some sort of message before this like when I turned in the book but did not ... so I thought everything was fine and got screwed.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did you ask the final spirit about the spear?<br />
<br />
Are you sure you did all the hand ins?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamandude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Turns out that when I turned in my final scale I got neg-faction with Truespirit so I am hoping this is a bug and will get my epic today or soon from a GM. When I handed in the tear for the final fight I got the message that my faction could not possibly get any better with Truespirit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>keldonis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Greetings fellow shaman,<br />
<br />
<br />
   I have a question reguarding the epic. I Gathered the 6 pages from CoM and went to the spirit to return the book. I gave the book to the spirit and was attacked by a gorilla as I handed him the book. Upon clicking trade, nothing happened. No faction/Exp, I have sent in a petition but not sure what too do at this point. If you lose the complete report how do I get another book to restart that part of the quest. Could faction have played a part in this?? If so how do I fix that faction?? Please help..<br />

<br />
Better safe than sorry.<br />
<br />
I've always believed that if an NPC won't respond to a phrase then he'll eat your item.....<br />
<br />
If he doesn't respond then either 1) its the wrong NPC and u need to check your guide or 2) your faction is too low and you need to go do the envy/woe part again til it can't get any better THEN go hand it in.<br />
<br />
If you've done your epic the whole way through, you should have enough faction but ALWAYS say the phrase to check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamandude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Looks bugged right now. Let me show you. Look at the faction hits here to see why.<br />
<br />
After all this time I go and finish my epic. <br />
<br />
We go to COM and turn in the ring then get the book then turn it in and get this. <br />
<br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:11:01 2002] Spirit Sentinel says 'So, the truth is found! Nak mourned over the loss of his child instead of relishing the blessing of his god, Cazic-Thule. His wife and the High Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that was an aftereffect of what caused the king to turn his back on his faith. The child is the key! If we put the child to rest, Nak may repent of what he has done and the mantle may be lifted. The most difficult task is now at hand. Find the child, then take proof of her passing to Nak. I can feel the mantle's foundation crumbling! Now, go!' <br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:11:01 2002] Your faction standing with Truespirit got better. <br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:11:01 2002] You gain experience!! <br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:11:01 2002] Shamandude saved. <br />
<br />
-- NOTICE THE FACTION HIT --<br />
<br />
Then go back to COM and turn in the tear. <br />
<br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:18:07 2002] Lord Rak`Ashiir looks down at the tear in his hand and says, 'A minion of my god came to me one night. I knew it was of Cazic-Thule as I was frozen in terror. My mind screamed for me to flee but my body would not respond. The being took my daughter and vanished to only he knew where. When I regained control of my body and thoughts, I felt nothing but betrayal. I don't care anymore about anything. If you want repentence then slay me, Shamandude' <br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:18:07 2002] Your faction standing with Truespirit could not possibly get any better. <br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:18:07 2002] You gain party experience!! <br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:18:07 2002] Lord Rak`Ashiir begins to cast a spell. <br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:18:09 2002] Shamandude saved. <br />
<br />
-- NOTICE THE FACTION HIT - MAX FACTION NOW --<br />
<br />
We kill the last guy get the scale and head to the spirit and this is what I get when I turn in the scale. <br />
<br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:35:39 2002] You say, 'Hail, Spirit Sentinel' <br />
<br />
- TURN IN SCALE - <br />
<br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:35:47 2002] Your faction standing with Truespirit got worse. <br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:35:47 2002] You gain party experience!! <br />
<br />
-- NOTICE THE FACTION HIT - NEG FACTION --<br />
<br />
My faction got worse turning in the last part of the epic? I am now indiff and I know I was not before. <br />
<br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:36:26 2002] You say, 'what is lost' <br />
[Mon Dec 09 01:36:26 2002] Spirit Sentinel says 'You need to prove your dedication to our cause before I can discuss such matters with you.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shamandude check your bags. A recent patch has changed the end of the quest. Now the spirit doesn't respond and the spear just is popped into the first vacant inventory spot. ALSO your truespirit faction is wiped back to indiff in their effort to curtail MQ of the tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Whats nuts though is it doesn't stop any pre-fix Epic'd shaman from MQing Tears, ever.<br />
<br />
Just stops any new Epic'd shamans.<br />
<br />
# of Epic'd shamans pre-fix &gt;&gt;&gt; # of new Epic'd shamans.<br />
<br />
It was a nice try on VI's part even if it was a year or two too late to do much...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">neg faction....wow.....how un-cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you'd read the thread titles on the first page of this forum, you'd see the negative faction hit at the final turn-in is already discussed here -- Truespirit faction is now reset when completing epic (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=8292)<br />
<br />
This faction change does not prevent you from receiving your Spear of Fate. Look in your bags and you'll find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So did Shamandude ever check his bags for his epic :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you found it in your bag after all that, would you come back to the boards and admit?<br />
<br />
I think we need to know!!</div></div><hr />
