<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wanted to do poll here but not enough options for it :(<br />
<br />
Everyone here seems to agree that Shaman are a damn fun class.<br />
<br />
Recently though lots of people have been making Alts.<br />
<br />
Just been wondering whether Shaman gravitate to the same type of Chars or go for something completely different.<br />
<br />
Dont want to know what is the best toon to 2 box with a shaman,just wondering what Alt you have the most FUN with.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bard.<br />
<br />
Sooooooo much fun with him because the exp just went so fast and i could do anything. But now that i got him to 65 i never play him.. No motivation to get aa's for him and started working on the shaman once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Monk.  it's just tradition, and I love my monk.  Nothing to focus on but pulling and kicking ass.  I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Over the years Ive tried all the classes as alts.  My favorite 2 were ranger and Wizard.  However, Wizard is the only one that I continue to have fun on every time I log in.  I havent played the ranger in a long time.  The wizard gets play time almost every week.<br />
<br />
Why wizard?  Cause its fun to blow stuff up.  I cant buff anyone, I cant heal anyone; the ONLY thing I can  do is damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Favourite: SK - he's a bad mofo and Erudites in plate just look sassy fresh<br />
<br />
Also playing: Wizzie and Zerker<br />
<br />
Tried and Died: Wizzy (once before), ranger, monk, paladin, warrior</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've played my fair share of alts. This is the order I would rank them in fun to play / box.<br />
<br />
1. Ranger<br />
2. Mage<br />
3. Monk<br />
4. Paladin<br />
5. Beastlord<br />
<br />
I like ranger the most because I can do so much more then with any of the other classes. Oh and snare is awesome :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">toss up between zerker and necro.<br />
<br />
Zerker when I just want to hit stuff, but occasionally add a stun to get a mob off a healer, or play baby MT.  Snare.  Bascially, dps+couple utilities = lazy fun night.<br />
<br />
Necro.  Cause he can do anything I feel like doing.  Solo in GoD? check.  Group in BoT and pull? check.  Get jboots for my zerker by running in circles in sro, hitting f8 and pet attack as fast as possible? check.  Little concern if someone is taking dmg? check.  Zero buffing to do? check. Charm really mean undead mobs and farm? check.  Power level casters with mana pump and ok heals at low levels? check.  Summon my darn shaman when he dies? check.  Team up with another necro in spectre illusion, and sit in the center of oasis and wait for someone to try to pull me or my pet? check.  Yell train and run to the dock? check.  Pull a big mob to see how tough he is then FD? check.<br />
<br />
If I didn't have as much time into my shaman (and gear), I'd probably play my necro as my main.  Its hard to justify switching for so many reasons though.  I'd have to drop guilds probably, I'd have half the hitpoints, I'd have 10 AA as opposed to 200 AA, etc..  but dang, necro's are fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bard jack of all trades and fun to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I 2 box with my warrior, but playing my necro alt is alot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Curio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well my Shaman is an alt. My main is my ranger and if I could only have 2 toons on my account they’d be Ranger and Shaman for sure. However when I get Curio to 65 (another couple of weeks) I’ll work on levelling my SK up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Like many, I've had several alts.  In my order of preference:<br />
<br />
1. Ranger<br />
2. Monk<br />
3. Necro<br />
4. War<br />
5. Pally<br />
6. SK<br />
7. BST<br />
8. Chanter<br />
9. Rogue<br />
<br />
I would probably still be playing the necro, but leveling a caster with the shammy is soooo much slower than PL'ing a melee.  Ranger is my current alt because he is so much fun to play, a versitile melee, similar to the shaman as a caster.  I've gone heavy ac/hp and with shammy buffs he tanks just fine in most places, but is only in his 30's, so I know that will change.<br />
<br />
As was said, Monk is fairly single minded, so easy to play.  Stoppe playing him because of fear that at the high end he would be gimped and does not hold aggro very well.<br />
<br />
Pally was really nice, got him to almost 40, but was a bit boring.  Stun and swing, plus I hated casting Yaulp all the time, too much like casting canni constantly.<br />
<br />
War was fun, crits at level 12 are nice, but again, not being able to cast was too restrictive for my tastes.<br />
<br />
BST, too redundant with shammy, etc.  <br />
<br />
All in all, Ranger has a high fun factor, high dps with quad attack, procs and kick (so I get to scratch my melee itch), track and snare kick @ss, and can't wait until I've got decent bow skills.  Something unique that other classes don't have is a big incentive for me.  Main thing for me is that I want an alt I have fun playing duo or solo.  Just creating a meat shield for the shammy, or a replacement (BST/Chanter) was not my goal.  I can really get into the Ranger due to his abilities, spells, and even fletching.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not as much as you might think, at least for general planes running.  I had my ranger up to 57 before I stopped playing him and canceled the account, but he could tank in BoT just fine with Thor healing/slowing.  I had him BoT flagged at level 51, but he didnt tank so well till he was about 54 and the mobs went white/yellow instead of all red.  Damage spikes could still put a hurting on him, but generally he did great.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Started my carreer as a Paladin, loved that class, but they hosed us in Kunark, so I went to the GODDLY class, which I already had a twink, Shaman. Started my Shaman when my Paladin farmed an &quot;extra&quot; Manastone and Rubi BP. Went Troll for the regen with Manastone. heh. Used to freak people out in the &quot;old school bazaar&quot; in EC by stoning til I went purple and fell down, then the regen kicked in and brought me back. One time I did that, a Skelly was too close and aggroed and killed me with a hit for 1!! DOH!!<br />
<br />
Too give you some idea of the thoroughness of my disgust with (at the time) Verant concerning Paladins, my Pally was the BEST on the server when Kunark shipped. He had the servers 2nd Soulfire and 1st Firey Avenger, which I completed LONG before Kunark shipped (7th or 8th FA in all of EQ). I was an officer in the servers TOP guild, co-founder, with people I had known from my Quake 2 clan for 2 years previous to EQ. I had over 110 days played that first year Dinged 51 2 kills after Kunark shipped, then, . . . well, any Paladin knows. <br />
<br />
Anyway, thats my twink now. Hes 56 with 122 days played (only 12ish since Kunark, heh). I used his Firey Avenger to MQ with a friend for his Firey Defender. I left that &quot;uber&quot; guild (they are still uber, Prophecy is their name) and formed a small family guild. My Shaman became my main. He was mid 40's when Kunark came out.<br />
<br />
Since then, I have twinked a few characters, but nothing too serious. My biggest is a 46 warrior and a 52 Cleric on another server. the small family guild I formed when I left the Uber guild broke up when DAoC came out. It took 10 people, and that was that. The ones who didnt go to DAoC left for other guilds. I went to another server (with a RL friend) and actually left the game for 6 months. Came back shortly after PoP, my Shaman was only 57, joined another family guild that was &quot;making the move&quot; too Ssra. Leveled my ass off, and now, we are in Time. My twinks are still a 56 pally, 46 warrior, 13 chanter, 14 BL, havent played the cleric on other server for 2 years. <br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry for the ramble, thats my story. My current main started as a twink, now I barely play anything BUT the Shaman. I love my troll :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My main alternate is a level 65 rogue. He is a lot of fun, so different from a caster. I hit a new high backstab the other day too - 2800! Amusing with one stab he can out damage my best nuke with all the focii and a crit. He is awesomely handy for scouting and cring as well, I never have to worry about not getting my body back or anyone else's. Plus unlocking doors is nice, I can get anywhere I want behind locked doors if I wanna go solo somewhere like the crypt or whatever. Easy as hell to PL too if I wanted, just don't group him and have him KS while I tank. Downside is trying to 2 box him on raids. Rogue DPS is a lot of positioning so a pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Favorite alt, hands down: Bard<br />
<br />
She's 65 now, and I can still solo like there's no tomorrow, no downtime, and I don't get spammed for buffs when running through Pok!  Very different play from a Shaman.<br />
<br />
Oh and running like the wind is very nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've played a ton of alts. I have to agree that bard is the most fun. Mez, lull, haste, slow, illusions, faction adjustment song, charm, running like the wind, able to solo 40 mobs at a time, there's a lot benifits to playing a bard. It's perfect for me because of my limited playtime.<br />
<br />
One side note, I played a bard to 35, got pretty good at ae kiting and twisting and such but after searching the bazaar for the best gear, Fierce Heraldic kept topping the list. I finally rerolled a new bard, Bluez, (last name will either be Singer or Cheeze), and he now worships Rallos Zek. If you decide to go bard you might want to do the same thing for the gear. Check out my bard's magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kookee Monstur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have just started two boxing..    Whith that said, I am trying to level up two different characters for a comparison.  Currently I have a Necro and an SK.   My intent had been to focus on the Necro, but have found many recommendations that an SK is good with a Shaman.  Less maintenance for sure, but possibly not as powerful.<br />
Any opinions on this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I would like to modify my choice of bard because it seems that in the next patch they might be getting a big nerf. On test they have reduced the radius of ae dots to just within melee range which means no more ae kiting. Now I'm not sure which class to choose, mabey the necro...I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>axeman1n</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">WAR alt,<br />
however BST is my fav to play, especially DUO with my SHM. I have Pet Affinity on my BST, so I can cast Group buffs and hit all of us. Sometimes I'll TRIO a RNG for good measure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hands down, SK is the best companion for a shaman.  Things don't die as quick as with some other classes, but you'll be able to concentrate on slowing/healing/cc while he tanks things.  The SK's snare/dot is bigger aggro than our malos/slow.  I have a 63 Wiz, 61 Warrior, and leveled a monk to 52.  SK is the best compliment for a two-box team, IMO.<br />
<br />
Bard would be fun, but they're a lot of damn work to play well, and takes away from your shaman time.  If you're two-boxing a Bard, you're not playing your shaman much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Drachenfels_1017</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've tried a lot of combinations, so far the Shaman/Wizard worked the best for me.  It just made it easier to get around and killing mobs was a cinche.  After debuffing, slowing and then using the disease base spells on the mob keeping aggro from the wizard was a cinch.  And if he ever made the mob mad a simple cripple would just bring him right back over to you.  I also found that a weapon with a couple of nice procs (vampire aug and anothr proc) did wonders for keeping aggro.  I also wouldn't cast with the wiz until the mob was about at 50% or so, and a 5k crit ususally puts the mob in its final resting place.  I also found that collect adventures with the Shaman/Wiz and any other class are fairly easily completed with just self buffs (just add a Druid that can PoTC or better and the fun never stops).<br />
<br />
The shaman/bard combo was great, but man the fingers get reallllly tired after a while.<br />
<br />
All of the shaman/melee combos were fun and easy to play too, but I love tanking with my Shaman too much  :p <br />
<br />
Of course then there was the Shaman / Mage and then the Shaman / BL combos.  They work great, but just weren't that much fun for some reason.<br />
<br />
I've also done the shaman/shaman combo, again as with the bard the fingers get realllllly tired (well if you still can a lot)<br />
<br />
Never tried the Shaman / Enchanter combo as I never had the want to pl a chanter up to get DC  :D <br />
<br />
Cheers all,<br />

<br />
But in general I 4-5 box warrior cleric shaman wizard rogue and it's pretty good.. seems like a 6th monk has to be in that spot but chanter/necro is great too. overpull just  mez :)</div></div><hr />

get a bug thumbs up.  however i think most of the people who know what you're talking about are long gone...<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
if you're rolling a toon with an eye on cultural, the best armor is veeshan.  bard tank like **** in early levels and when you're in that sweet spot where you'd pre-ornate/ep and post complete noob gear the extra mana for charm/fade is much more crucial and hard to get than HP.  if you're taking hits as a bard you're dead especially pre-def aas.  for a bard Hp is the least important among any plate class (including clerics).  on the other hand FT at these levels are hard to get... this is before you really have the aas to put into MC and droppable FT is still pretty scarce.  by the time you're in a position to get no drop FT those pieces will also have good HP...<br />
<br />
I'd say fierce heraldic is a good bet however.  BUT if you're going pure HP the tribunal amor actually has the best HP</div></div><hr />
