<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Atm I have a Sarnak Battle Shield and I was wondering what would be the next step up? Assume I have 10k to spend. Friend thinks I should go with a Stretched Fungus Hide shield from the beasties quest in Fungus Grove, but I dont know if I want to lose the 20 hps and resists. I am over 200 wis easy and dont really care about more wisdom. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am in simular bind, been using my snarnak battle shield for past long time.  been wanting to upgrade .....  we are on verge of Ntov so i am thinking just wait till shield of wurms drops (autoed to me since only shaman in guild right now, dont think we go till have at least a second on raid though).  i have turned down OoIV just cause i felt other guildies could use better since Shield of wurms would drop soon. dunno your posistion but what does everyoen think is better? OoIV or shield of wurms?<br />
<br />
also so graphic on shield of wurms boy is that cheesy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To the original poster, Orb of the Infinite Void is the way to go if you want HPs<br />
<br />
Thraall, your HPs look good to me, if you're happy to lose a few for ac then go for the Wurms. Its lovely ac and nice resists but crappy HPs, I wear mine to keep at a certain AC. I like the graphic, its cute! If it's HPs at any cost then Orb every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A more managable jump from 2k sarnak battle shield to 25k OOIV is the Bone Braced Buckler...same HP as SBS + mana too.  Saves are kinda useless, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went from a shield of the wurms to an ooiv, the ntov shield does have nice ac/mana/resists, but yeah, its a tad low on the hps, the still ooiv still has good ac and a resonable chunk of mana, but has a ton of hps to boot.</div></div><hr />

Nice shield that is attainable for anyone who's guild can kill Vindi. Drops off Rumblecrush. It's an OOIV with 5str, 5sta, 15wis, 10sv all extra. Very nicely balanced shield imho.</div></div><hr />

The Shield of holy vigor is also a great shield but probably out of the reach of someone just starting ntov.<br />
<br />
Personally I stuck with my SBS until i was able to get a Shield of holy vigor. Ntov helped out by not dropping many sheilds but I wasn't really interested anyway.</div></div><hr />

I've seen WAY to may BP's of Integrity and nary a sheild :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yeah grand shield of faith is super duper rare. i dont think one has droped on my server (only two guilds capable if killing him).  but yeah the OoIV vs shield of wurms been bugging me for a while *shrug* we see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For this person, if the OOIV is out of reach, then I would suggest the Skull Marked Shield.  If possible bank the SBS for resist gear, and use the SMS for exp grinding.  The better HPs/Mana are nice, along with the AC.  And its not signifigantly expensive.<br />
(yes, all of the other suggestions are better, but.. kinda hard to get =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Another option that would be a slight upgrade from the SBS would be the Troll reworked Mistmore shield if you know any Troll master smiths. <br />
Fearful Rigid Mistmore Shield: AC 25, wis7, int7, HP 50, mana 20, SV fire/cold/magic 10, SV poison/disease 5; wt 3, recomended level 45; war/clr/pal/rng/shd/dru/brd/rog/shm/bst -All, Cazic Thule<br />
The bad part is I believe it takes 2 Blue Diamonds to do the combine and you really want a Troll smith with like 240+ skill in smithing= expensive and hard to find. (Expect at least 5K+ unless you bring the BD's or are REALLY good friends with the Troll :) )<br />
<br />
The Rallos Zek version is the same except AC 30, HP 20 and unless something better falls into my lap I intend to find a Troll to make me up one when I get to 45. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The troll smithed shields are going to cost you more than 5k hehe. It takes 2 blue diamonds per combine attempt, and there are 3 different combines where each of those can be lost. <br />
<br />
1st combine is pottery to make them into blue diamond powder. <br />
2nd combine is brewing making celestial essence<br />
3rd combine is combining them with a sheet of folded acrylia.<br />
<br />
After you are past that, then the actual shield combine attempt is made, and they are trivial above 250. The success rate is not great and is ruled by the RNG. Also, another component of this is made with ground spawns from Innothule swamp and in the swamp its a pain in the butt to find them. <br />
<br />
Your best bet at getting them at a reasonable price? Gather all of the items required, have someone do the pottery and brewing parts for you so thats all done, and find a troll and just ask him to do the smithing parts. If you have done all the leg work and are putting up all the items, then he shouldn't charge you too much. maybe up to 2k or so, not sure. One nice thing is that you will be fairly unique on your server. For example, only ONE vengeful shield is in existence, and I am the one that made it hehe. Dorfeatr has a shield that makes him look different from all the other level 60 shaman out there (it has MM shield graphic hehe). Anyhow, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Gee, Grizz......  if you stayed true to yer bear self, you wouldn't SEE that cliche shield look :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sangori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Buckler of Insight is great, but if your guild is just starting into the time sink that is HoT ToV quest expect the int casters to get first dibs on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Wish I could use that Ogre or Troll shield, but I am a leezard so I dont think I can. Iksar really got screwed out of the cultural armor imo. Everyone got real nice stuff but the Fearsome Skyiron is crap.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about that Skull shield actually. I might get it (goes for about 3k on my server, Rallos Zek). Dont know if the extra wis and mana (wis at 225) would really do me any good. I usually have c3 when I solo and the mobs die pretty fast (epic + ebolt + bane = dead).  But I might get that sporestrand just for the AC alone. Not too worried about resists when I am slowing melee mobs. <br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the insight. If I could get an OOIV I definitely will. Wish me luck!</div></div><hr />

Its the troll that can only make it... an iksar couldnt make that shield for instance but from looking at it i think he could use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yep! Any shaman that worships CT could use the fearful shield that was listed above. The tough part is finding a grandmaster troll smith hehe.</div></div><hr />

Think I should just dump the 10k into getting a troll toon to GM smithin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Trolls have the worst skill path (with the least incentive to do it) of all races to get GM smithing. If there was not a GM troll smith on your server before the June 5th patch, it is a fair bet that there will NEVER be a GM troll smith on your server.<br />
<br />
Iksar cultural is godly compared to troll stuff. Why? BECAUSE TROLLS DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. They only have the blue diamond weapon/shield reworks, and most of those items SUCK BADLY. <br />
<br />
10k to get a GM smith? Not in your wildest dreams. Try 30k and a year of farming 6-8 hours a day, every day. Smithing is harder (As a troll, I'd say 10x harder) than tailoring to GM, now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hehe, 10K won't even get you close anymore. Smithing is like the old tailoring used to be, anything over 200 skill now requires months and months of farming on the moon for a handfull of skill points or HUGE amounts of cash (someone on EQTraders figured 300K+ to get from 175 to mid 220's doing the sickle part of PoTC for skill ups). Trolls don't even have old cultural to fall back on. VI has promised to look into increasing the droprate for the stuff for Shadow Scream and Acryla Temper, but till they do it's become an incredible PITA for us smiths that didn't make it to Grandmaster before the patch, sigh. :) I'm really hoping to get to the point I can trade some of the Ogre armor for a shield and reworked Glowing Wooden Crook, and mabe an Observers Staff. I would LOVE to be able to play in self made armor using player made weapons at 45. It's been the dream of us smiths for like forever and now it's close to being doable. Check on the server boards at EQ Traders for a Troll GM smith in your neighborhood, there's bound to be one or two nutcases who GM'd Troll smithing before there was anything worth making. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Thrall your gear is excellent as is.  Remember with circles, grm, and bard songs your most crucial resists will be pushed above 255.  So I do believe you can ditch some resists for some hps/ac gear.  In that case, I'd recommend ooiv.<br />
<br />
You could do with upgrading the belt too, even though I know it was a gm event drop hehe.  <br />
<br />
In any case, if you buy the ooiv, keep the sbs in the resists bag, doesn't hurt, not like you'll make an enormous fortune reselling it anymore.</div></div><hr />

Sigh, you got that right. I got up to 201 before June patch, and am now up to 209. I'd like get to the 220's before I try Rigid MM Shields, which will probably be, I dunno, Xmas 2003. Because of constant farming, I'm missing out on exp and guild raids and haven't worked on epic in forever. In the meantime, I'm constantly getting tells from ppl who want troll cultural, as it looks like I'm the only troll on my server idiotic enough to try to be a GM smith. I managed to churn out a couple of Polished Obsidian Shards, but that's been it.<br />
<br />
My guild's been helping out by furnishing the drops I need to skill up, and as a result every member will eventually have Black Acrylia weapons. But I'm a long way from sporting the first Rigid MM Shield on E'Ci.</div></div><hr />
