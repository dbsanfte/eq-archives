<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I seem to think that our pets only double attack, not dual wield. If I give 2 one handers, will my pet dual wield? Is it kind of like the enchanter pet that way? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, you have to give one handers.   Can be rusty, fine steel, whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just tested it tonight, I can't believe I have gone 24 levels of petness without doinhg this. Jabober kicks some ass when he is dual wielding.  /sigh  I guess I am still a noob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shhh, Huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ancere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman pets can use weapons? I tried this a LONG ass time ago, with no luck. Did they change it so that shaman pets can use em?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">think it changed when they made all paets summon at max lvl.  so its not to many months ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Easy way to test this. Give Dog Dog  two velium short swords.<br />
He procs fairly often with buffs on him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Weapon type matters - some weapons don't work in the offhand. If he's not dual weilding with the two weapons you give him, try adding another weapon of a different type and he will start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Our little ALPHA doggie never has been able to use weapons and never will, you're all imagining things.  Just ask any shaman about alpha and he'll tell you that our pet is just a fuzzy dot that barks.  He can't use weapons he has paws not hands.  Now enough of this hypothetical nonsense already ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Best way to see if the mutt is duel whielding is to had it a dagger and a short sword, turn on &quot;Others hit's&quot; then sit and watch a couple of fights and see if he gets pierces and slashes. And yes the pet will use wepons and will proc them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Coralie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i know that for a mage only Human Warrior's weapon may be done</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Demanocus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I gave my New 61 Pet a Velium Hammer and a Velium Dagger. I never saw anything but piercing, bashing, and kicking from him. <br />
<br />
Max hit with Focus of the Soul on him was 65. He did proc allot. Looked like a Druid/Ranger spell casting animation while in wolf form.</div></div><hr />
