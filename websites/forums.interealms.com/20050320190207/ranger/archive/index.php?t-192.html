I got ine for 4.5k on Tunare server(very very rare) usually goes for like 6-8k on my server.  Just look around, odds are u will eventually find a seller with a nice price. :)</div></div><hr />

Expect to get lots of adds, but a good enchanter should have no problem whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't have too much confidence, though.. I've seen a group get wiped with 6 people, do a CR, and then go back with 5 thinking they would do better :)<br />
<br />
Some people are just stupid!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nadiana</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Movement is key to Brogg. Clear D1 (you don't have to clear the actual D1 camp room with the frenzy pox) and pull the two golems.<br />
<br />
Rush the Necromancer room, the small room on the right, and have your chanter mez the two frogs with him. Med a little bit, then go and pull one or two frogs from the library to the necro room.<br />
<br />
Clear the library this way until the library is clear. Don't pull from the right hallway; waste of time if you want Brogg. Go through the secret wall and pull whatever is in the way until the first door on the left. Pull that back to the library (2 easy frogs) .. use that room on the left as your new camp.<br />
<br />
Brogg is guarded by 2 - 3 other mobs, so you are guaranteed to have at least 2 unless you have a level 60 puller with you and the frogs are lower level ones. Target Brogg and get a slow on him while the chanter mezzes the adds. Grats on your bracer!<br />
<br />
Move back to the library and pull the golems there to fight. This reduces the chance of a slow fight in the necro room and having the necro spawn on top of you. Move back to the necro room and repeat.</div></div><hr />
