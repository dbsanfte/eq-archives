You can save the game at any point and pick it up again later.  I haven't played them in a while but I believe you can also save in Dungeon Seige and NWN as well.</div></div><hr />

I agree, Morrowind and MoO 2 are great games, and you can save and quit at anytime.<br />

I haven't looked into MoO 3 yet, it might be viable too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hadina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">heroes of might and magic is one of my favorite series of all time. It's easily windowable (just press F4), is turn based so you can leave it minimized and not worry that you're dying or anything, and it's loads of fun.<br />
<br />
Heroes 2 or 3 are probably my favorite, but there are 4 in the series with numerous expansions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Runja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dungeon Siege (http://www.dungeonsiege.com/) - nice one player RPG/adventure game that can be paused.  Also has multiplayer if you want it.  I played it for the single player game and had a lot of fun.  Music and graphics are amazing. <br />
<br />
Hitman2 (http://www.eidosinteractive.com/games/info.html?gmid=118) - Very fun game.  It's a shooter, but you need to use your brain.  Highly recommended.<br />
<br />
Both of these games have demos that you can download at their respective sites.  So, you can try them out and see how well you like them and see how well they run on your laptop at work.  Dungeon Siege may be windowable, but I'm not sure.  I do know that you can easily Alt-Tab out of both games.  I highly recommend both of those games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">quake3/ut2k<br />
<br />
both are a &quot;jump on the server and frag for a short time&quot; style of game. Nothing holding you to staying on long, but can keep your attention indefinetly if your into FPS's.</div></div><hr />

All things you asked for and more - http://sc2.sourceforge.net/<br />
<br />
StarControl 2 is simply one of the best games ever created.  I highly recommend anyone looking for a new game to check this out.  Plus, its totally free.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So many classics, ah the good ole' days.<br />
<br />
Well I would have to agree with Morrowind, its a real fun time for when you don't know how long you've got. <br />
<br />
Other favorites of mine are any of the black isle RPG's (Planescape:Torment being the best from an RPG standpoint)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Planescape:Torment<br />

The only 2 games I played to completion since I became an EQ addict.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">NWN is a great single player game because you can always find a player mod to play. Moo2 is the greatest turn based game ever, moo 3 sucks harder then most porn stars. I'm a fan of UT2k3, but thats mindless killing. Red Faction 2 is good as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shamolite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I love to play worms 3 armagedon when i dont have time to get online and drudge out the exp grind. It is mindless and has some violence and fun and allows me to relax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">these may not be windowable but if you're looking for a break from the grind heres some ideas<br />
<br />
Half-Life. there is a mod for EVERYONE with that game. now-a-days you can pick it up for probably 10 bucks and have hours of fun. I play Counter-Strike, Vampire Slayer, Sven Co-op Run Away Train, TFC... the list goes on. Even years after its creation, modders can always tweak the engine in some way that makes it feel like a completly different game (see earth special forces a DBZ mod...)<br />
<br />
if you're a non shooter, I like the heroes of might and magic series, 3 was the best imo. I still love a good game of age of emipires 2.<br />
<br />
another idea is look to your old consloes. some of my best hours ever spent was playing final fantasy 3 (best ff game ever with a kick ass sound track and I dont care what you other people say!  :p ) and with emulators these days picking up a few dozen console games doesnt take too long, plus it has instant saving and windowable, so it may be your best bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've been playing Praetorians. Romans vs Egyptians vs Barbarians.<br />
Has fun single player campaign and Multi player through gamespy.<br />
It is ALT-tabbable to desktop and resumes gracefully.<br />
<br />
It's a real-time strategy but more in the likes of the Total War games then the typical warcraft/C&amp;C rts.<br />
<br />
You build armies vs single units and no base building.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Planescape: Torment is the best game ever. My all time favorite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">For the umpteenth time ... Morrowind.  Also, an oldie but goodie, and certainly not mindless ... Magic: The Gathering.  And for whatever reason, I still like Alpha Centauri better than Civ 2/3 or AoE.  And just to totally invalidate my suggestions, I still have the old Pool of Radiance series and Bard's Tale installed LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I love to play counter-strike, it has a huge learning curve but once you do learn its a blast.  That and no matter how good you are there is always someone much better.<br />
<br />
Any of you MTG players who have some extra money might want to check out MTG Online, its a lot of fun for someone who has the time and cash to invest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Matten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">SC ansd WC3 are both alt+tabable. Although I wouldn't reccomend it before saving as it would be unpleasant to bring it back up only to find you have been defeated.<br />
<br />
MTG Online is a good game. I played it for a while but I wouldnt suggest it for this scenario because people get pissed at you if you go afk for long periods of time and it also really eats at your wallet.<br />
<br />
My personal fav game that can be played from any computer with a web browser and an internet connection is star-fury. It is complex and quite fun to play. Best of all it's free! And if you play on the slower server Merlin (1 hour ticks, 10 min ticks on fast server Eclipse) you dont have to be constantly monitoring it. Check it out at http://www.star-fury.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">And for whatever reason, I still like Alpha Centauri better than Civ 2/3 or AoE.<br />
<br />
You're not the only one.  :)  It was the best of its class.  Well balances, flavor voices that you could actually understand, humor, different forms of combat, and politics which actually did something.<br />
<br />
I still play SMAC game on occasion.  I like playing the peacekeepers and using diplomacy to extort and punish my opponents.<br />
<br />
MoO3's day of judgment will be when they release the code patch.  Its got alot of potential, but the game on release wasnt ready.  For those who think EQ had a buggy release, check out this link for the list of corrections the game post release.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Hullk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Since I don't think anyone posted them...I recommend trying:<br />
<br />
Fallout: A post nuclear apocalyptic roleplaying game<br />
Fallout 2<br />
Fallout Tactics<br />
<br />
All 3 are great games, all of them should easily run on a laptop, and all of them are dirt cheap nowadays.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's rare to find people who appreciate a game based in a post apocalyptic world. Yes, all three are great games. Tactics was my favorite. But I would suggest playing through the other two to understand the setting of tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I find the quests &amp; dialogue in NWN to be terribly entertaining.  It's so refreshing to be able to maintain a certain ... how's that go?  &quot;moral flexibility&quot; in a game without everybody instantly knowing.  Not only can you play as a good or evil person, but as something in-between, or you can bounce between extremes as you choose.  That and the D&amp;D system is familiar and comfy...  Had better be a nice laptop to run this satisfactorily, though I've never tried bumping down the quality.<br />
<br />
I've never known someone to play through Planescape:Torment and not enjoy it immensely.  Lots of puzzles and thinky things.  Should be very laptop-able.<br />
<br />
I still enjoy Diablo2 entirely too much, as long as I don't play it for more than a couple weeks at a time.  I find that if I consistently push into areas that are too tough for me, I have to really stretch my abilities and come up with some tactics.<br />
<br />
I've found that switching to pause-able games has done amazing things for my ability to get things done around the house, and pay attention when real people speak.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">turn based strategy : heroes of might and magic 3 : try it , if you like medieval fantastic / turn based you will love it , side note though ,&quot;heroes of might and magic 4&quot; sucks , while the 3 has an amazing replay value and/or multiplayer . <br />
<br />
RTS : i love starcraft and warcraft , but i still prefer warlords battlecry ( the 2 was good , not sure if there is a 3 yet ) when it comes to real time strategy ( 2D , heroes unit who gain experience and progress on a skill tree , heroic fantasy units .... a blast ) <br />
<br />
for action : Half life , no question asked , the single person mode is amazing for a fps game , you'll see for yourself if you haven't played it yet , and the multiplayer is crazy ( just try counterstrike for a night ) <br />
<br />
for fun/adventure : day of the tentacle ( maniac mansion 2 ) , loaded with humor and fun , if you like the genre you'll love that one ( scrolling/click and move ) .<br />
<br />
<br />
according to what you said i'd pick heroes of might and magic 3 , the sound is not important and you never even have to pause the action as everything is turn based .. and the fun ! i was addicted to the 1st one , i was crazy of the 2nd ( was addicted to that one like i have been addicted to EQ ) and the 3rd just made everything so much better and more fun ( tried the 4th  and it sucked , plus game was uncomplete , needing patches , bad passage to 3d iso ...etc )<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
good luck finding a game that fits you , i still enjoy playing civillization 1 at times , its still a fun game . <br />
<br />
Hadd.<br />
*edit* <br />
forgot you had a limited time window , i recommended heroes of might and magic 3 but the game is extremelly addictive ( more than everquest i'd say , which is really bad ) and might eat more time than you'd like it to . if you can't really fall in an addiction , go for a theme-park style like sim city , theme park , the sims , those should allow for easy 30 mins of play without having you feel bad when you have to leave ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If you have fond memories of Moria and other &quot;roguelike&quot; ASCII games from the 80s, you may want to try Angband - http://www.thangorodrim.net/ - or, once you become comfortable with the basics, one of its variants.<br />
<br />
Big, reasonably complex, turn-based, saveable, and so on.<br />
<br />
The deeper you go, the more compex it becomes - just running up to a Mature Ancient Multihued Dragon and hitting it in the head doesn't work any better in Angband than running up to VS and hitting him in the head works in EQ :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I LOVED fallout and fallout 2.<br />
I played it so much I got no sleep for a few weeks it seems.<br />
<br />
Those who love fallout will recognize this:<br />
<br />
&quot;War, war never changes. The end of the world occurred pretty much as we had predicted, too many humans, not enough space or resources to go around. The details are trivial and pointless the reasons as always, purely human ones. The earth was nearly wiped clean of life, a great cleansing. An atomic spark struck by human hands, quickly raged out of control. Spears of nuclear fire rained from the skies, continents were swallowed in flames and fell beneath the boiling oceans. Humanity was almost extinguished, their spirits becoming part of the background radiation that blanketed the earth. A quiet darkness fell across the planet lasting many years. Few survived the devastation; some had been fortunate enough to reach safety, taking shelter in great underground vaults. When the great darkness passed, these vaults opened and their inhabitants emerged to begin their lives again. <br />
<br />
One of the northern tribes claims they are descended from one such vault, they hold that their founder and ancestor one known as the vault dweller, once saved the world from a great evil. According to their legend, this evil arose in the far south, it corrupted all it touched twisting men inside, turning them into beasts. Only through the bravery of this vault dweller was the evil destroyed, but in so doing he lost many of his friends and suffered greatly, sacrificing much of himself to save the world. When at last he returned to the home he had fought so hard to protect, he was cast out, exiled. In confronting that which they had feared, he had become something else in their eyes and no longer their champion. Forsaken by his people, he strode into the wasteland. He traveled far to the north, until he came to the great canyons. There he founded a small village Arroyo, where he lived out the rest of his years and so for a generation since its founding Arroyo has lived in peace. Its canyons sheltering it from the outside world, it is home your home, but the scars left by the war have not yet healed, and the earth has not forgotten............ &quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Asylum, definitely play Asylum. Pirate Adventure, Zorc, Telengard and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy were also fun games. Hehe, how many of you played any of those?<br />
<br />
Some suggestions that you might actually be able to find;<br />
<br />
SMAC is a golden oldie. Galactic Civilzations has been billed as everything MOO3 should have been. Master of Magic is fun if you can find it. There are also several economic games that are fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">defintally try fallout 2, (i liked it better than the first because there was no time limit onthe second one) fallout 1/2 doesn't require a cd to try your favorite source of pirated software. Also I enjoyed Freedom Force, kinda cartoony and kiddiy but still enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The Fallout intro was brilliant. One of the best ever. The game was good but a little too much BROWN everywhere. It looked very dull to me.<br />
<br />
Morrowind is beautiful and deep. Lots and lots of play time there, but it can be difficult to remember which quest and which item to which city etc etc if you're only playing for 30 minutes at a time.<br />
<br />
GTA 3 and Vice City have fantastic attitude. Thoroughly entertaining.<br />
<br />
Torment is one of the greatest games ever written. Absolutely engrossing.<br />
<br />
Civ 2 is still a great game.</div></div><hr />
