<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Beastlords can be quite dnagerous if you play them right like all classes.  Just have to understand the class your going to fight to defeat them.  If you want to beat him then your going have to take out his pet.  His pet is 1/2 his damage ability.  And like any casting class you will want to get your resists up.  Magic being the one most wanted up with beastlord followed by Poison then the others.  Depending on level the lower levels are harder I would think as the beastlord pet is much more dangerous and such at those levels.  One good root on the pet and then couple good dots on the Beastlord should be enough to take the average beastlord.  I personally would concentrat all your damage on the beastlord as when he dies the pet does as well.  Beastlords have loads of pet enhancing ablities including huge pet heals.  They dont however have very good personal healing.  Sick your pet on them DoT them and root thier pet.  They can not root you unless they have some sort of item and there are few of those about.  Long as his resists are not huge you should be able to get him in the end.  Shaman only run into problems when people start to reach 150 unbuffed resists in all areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">his pet will eat yours in under 4 min.  i just found this out with a 61 BST against my pet (me 61)<br />
<br />
it was a pet vs pet competition self buffs only, no weapons.<br />
<br />
i had a fluff of vs fire, then cold, then magic then sta, then agi, then shroud, then focus, then replen, then celerity, then spirit quick, then his pet just chewed mine a new backside.  no no avatar for me.<br />
<br />
cost me 500 plat<br />
<br />
with proc weapons my pet would have still lost bady, with life tap weapons my pet would have still lost.<br />
<br />
i would probably bet that most of the shaman spells equal to my lvl would bounce off me (magelo is in the sig), when i have 3-4 buffs up for resists.  if his resists are decent to mine you will have to add the time of debuffs.  if he is serious in wanting to beat you he will have pumice, cure potions and perhaps even heal potions.  then the dots are done, and you have to wizard him with DD.  then you run out of mana.<br />
<br />
even if you root his pet, but yours is dead, isn't his an ability?  he just deletes one and starts casting another with no mana cost?  the biggest thing my pet does is interupt casters.  if it is dead, then i am taking the spells.  i like to keep my pet alive because of the cost of casting and outfitting a new one.<br />
<br />
i ran a shaman to 40 on Vallon, and a shaman on Sullon to 52.<br />
<br />
i left Vallon before there even were BST.<br />
<br />
i think he will probably stomp you a new backside.   especially if he is prepared and has any potions.<br />
<br />
ok, so that all sounds kinda dismal.  you of course get a better heal than him.<br />
<br />
you might get to set the rules a bit.  get a wide open zone and root his pet from the get go and try and kite him with your pet.  if you really wanna get fancy cast cha on your pet then buff, then cancel magic and see if you can cancel any root he applies without losing all the other buffs you gave it.<br />
<br />
ok, so you root his pet, get yours off it and on him.  get him debuffed, and your pet interupts his attempts at new pet.<br />
<br />
he doesn't have any potions or has low resists, and you get dots to stick where you can run and not be hit.<br />
<br />
can you win?  Maybe<br />
<br />
will you win probably not.<br />
<br />
and i want to try and explain the differences of the pvp servers.  on some the guy will lay in wait and see if you kill the mob then attack you, because if he kills you , no exp loss.  on Sullon (within 5 lvls) there is exp loss, and the sec you engage a mob you have the pvper on you to.<br />
<br />
PvP is not about dueling.  it is about killing you.  every shaman on a pvp server has gate memmed.  and after they gate they try and bandage themselves to outlive the dots they have when they are OOM.<br />
<br />
so if your friend is stupid, you have a chance.  if he knows what PvP is, don't bet money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Use blind against his pet.  He can't cure it or annul it.  It requires a pretty wide open area though - arena it wouldn't work so well b/c you need to manage to get out of the pet's aggro range in order for him to take off running.  At higher levels you'll need debuffs to even land blind somewhat reliably, and the BST if he's smart will annul the debuffs.<br />
<br />

<br />
Gate is a waste of a spell slot at level 65.  The only thing that can kill a good shaman is an instakill ability and gate isn't going to work in that situation anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Beastlords are annoying, but not overly dangerous (to me at least).  Their pet doesn't do that much damage, but it interrupts a lot.  Between the pet bashing you and the beastlord kicking you, it is difficult to channel spells.  If they get you to low health and you cannot channel a heal, you might die.  If you try to run from them, the beastlord has significant nukes that can bring you down.  In addition to being an interrupting monster, beastlord pets are also very resistant.  Any other class's pet I can just slow without ever getting resists, but beastlord pet requires malos and multiple attempts to slow.  Once the pet is slow, the vast majority of beastlords forget that they have cure disease spells.  I have run in to a whopping 1 beastlord that has cured his pet.  The same is true of root.  I have had necros and mages that were smart enough to dispell root off of their pet, but never a beastlord.<br />
<br />
If he is smart enough to cure his pet of root/slow, then use blind on it.  You cannot cure that, and with malos on, it lasts for a long time with barely any mana cost or casting time.  Once you have the pet under control, the beastlord is a joke.  Their melee damage doesn't even come close to outdamaging quiesence, and without their pet helping, they won't interrupt you very much.  They have two types of DD spells: nukes and spears.  Spears hurt if you don't have good CR, but they have a long recast time (30 seconds I believe).  Their nukes aren't that strong.  They have good poison dots but we can cure that.  If he tries to burn you down with nukes, just heal yourself (quiescence should cover most of it).  He will go oom way before you do.  Use a DS potion and he will be taking as much damage as his melee is dishing out.<br />
<br />
So, basically, a good beastlord with a lot of AA is a long, tough, and annoying fight (I hate their pets even more than knights with twohand bash).  They have a lot of resist buffs (+50 to everything from ferocity, plus whatever else they can cast), and if they add that on top of already decent resists, you will have trouble landing anything.  However, if you have good resists, there isn't much they can do to kill you.  The pet is more annoying than dangerous, and you can always kite the beastlord just like any other melee (quiesence and run around until full health).  It makes for a very long fight, but in the end you should win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a friend bl that claims that he can hand me my behind at any time he wants to in a pvp battle any time he is within 5 lv's of me, is this true? <br />
<br />
Well if you suck then it's probably true. If you don't suck then it's probably false.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Given that the poster is 61, he doesn't have Quiessence and Torpor would be... risky.<br />
<br />
Forget about slowing the BL pet. He doesn't even have to load cure disease for it, their pet heals contain a disease cure component. <br />
<br />
He can cure any DoT that you can cast except Bane. <br />
<br />
The BL pet is no longer an ability. It will cost him mana to cast and buff it if you manage to kill it. Even when it was an ability, it would still have cost him mana to level buff it.<br />
<br />
Dispell the hell out of his pet (as well as the BL himself, naturally). Its proc is a buff, and getting rid of its haste would be a Good Thing as well. It costs him a lot more mana to rebuff it (even if you give him time to do so) than it costs you to remove it. If he insists on rebuffing everything you annul, it's a good way to run him OOM in a hurry.<br />
<br />
In short, if the BL is decent you should have a difficult time killing him off, but he should also have a difficult time killing you: as previously mentioned, he has really crappy self-heals, and his mana regen is vastly inferior to yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well if you suck then it's probably true. If you don't suck then it's probably false.<br />
<br />
Exactly. It all depends on skills and gear. If his resists are low then his pet will spend the whole fight rooted. This is where malos come in...<br />
<br />
Same with him.<br />
<br />
If his resists are high then you can probably survive all he can throw at you, but you wont be able to do jack to him back...  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Never had a problem with Bst's.<br />
<br />
Usually I'll just stick dogdog on the warder and just keep it quiessenced.  Malos the Bst himself and play about with them with my snare spear, the second that snare lands, pet burn + blood/scourge/bane of nife and its usually all over or very close to being so.<br />
<br />
To be fair though, I'm yet to duel a bst that can consistently resist poison dots, and no bst is going to be able to cast anything worth anything on me bar Annul.</div></div><hr />
