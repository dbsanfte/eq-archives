During that time the shaman pet did 24k dmg in melee <br />
<br />
Ok, this appears rather off to me, does that look wrong to anyone else?<br />
<br />
Wait nm, that appears to just be a way of saying the pet did bout 30dps over the course of the fight, gotta love how the big numbers get put up to make it look better.</div></div><hr />

The 24K number is his melee damage alone. I dont think he was trying to say this is unbalanced by using that large number, he was using it to demonstrate the total over time. But that number isnt including the procs. He is claiming that withe procs added in, its unbalanced. <br />
<br />
Shrug, he makes a pretty valid arguement to me. If these spells are truly proccing at that different a rate between pets and players, then its quite possible some adjustment is needed. I really dont understand why people seem to WANT the game unbalanced in their classes favor. Nobody else thinks this sort of thing is bad for EQ overall?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">IMHO this is/was a badly needed and highly desirable upgrade for Shaman.<br />
<br />
1) we typically melee much more frequently than other priest classes; but our choice of weaponry is; quite frankly, horrendous.  Panther gives us a great boost to our tanking abilities.  Given the state of dogdog, I know I find myself in a situation where I have to tank fairly often.<br />
<br />
2) Group desirability.  Maybe I'm lucky, I can usually get a group within 10 minutes of putting up LFG, but I know that most groups, given the chance, will take a BST over me any day. Why? DPS, plain and simple.  BST have the 65% slow, and DPS on an order of magnitude higher than ours.  Panther has put us back where we need to be concerning groups. WANTED.<br />
<br />
3) About dogdog.  Why is this guy whining?  Rover is, at best, a highly unreliable dot ( I cant tell you the number of times I have had to kill one pet and summon another because fluffy is too dumb to jump onto a ledge or run up the staircase that was about 30 seconds of running behind me).  Panther makes the lil fellow worthwhile again.<br />
<br />
My comment to Milk: Stow the whining man!  So we Shaman actually got an upgrade from an expansion.  Can you remember the last time we did? Huh?  &lt;crickets&gt;<br />

BTW, this from a shaman who is not of a high enough level to use the spell yet; but has been lucky enough to see the effects it can have. =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Buffs are a core feature of shamans, they are and should be the ULTIMATE buff class. What is wrong with replacing marginalized buffs (like acumen and all the non-overcap buffs) with a useful one? In shaman groups I click off half of the buffs (since all stats maxed). That's just wrong.<br />
<br />
Honestly, what is wrong with upping shaman DPS? BSTs are so overpowered as is, one of its parent classes could use an upgrade. They take the best of monk, mage and shaman - 3 parent classes! Then they get buff lines 90% as good as parent (90% as good pet buffs, 90% as good focus, and a new HP buff line SV to compete with pal/rgr). They get melee 90% as good as parent (monk). They get a pet 90% as good as parent (mage). They get incredibly useful unique stuff like paragon (MGB-able!) and mana/hp regen buff.<br />
<br />
Hybrids were originally intended to be 75/25 or something, a bst is 90/90/90. Someone should derail that thread and call for a bst nerf every time they complain. Now that bards have had 30 consecutive nerfs, BSTs are the new bards...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">beasts don't get double attack without aas. Beastlord dps compared to monk dps is much less than 90% with equivalent gear. MUCH less, even with pet.<br />
<br />
for example, example of beastlord in the guild: epic 1.5 and knuckles from RS PLUS pet, struggles to break 200 dps. Monk in same guild (since has upgraded to shinai) but again, 1.5 and RS knuckles. with his 69 DoN disc being used when it pops, he averages 400dps.<br />
<br />
 Beastlords have leather mitigation, so can tank about as well as an equivalently geared shaman. Mages own the crap out of them in dps, shamans do as well, monks too, monks outtank them on top of all that due to block and all that jazz, the only saving graces they have is their mana regen. Other than that, beasts get badly outperformed.<br />

I am in agreement here. SOE, in their typical way, has OVERNERFED BLs, but they did it the same we Shamans got boned, with ommission. Shaman DPS got jacked up so much that the ONE MAIN THING a BL had going for it in a &quot;who gets groups&quot; situation was their superior DPS, now that advantage is mostly gone. <br />
<br />
BLs were the &quot;baby of the family&quot; class of SOE for a long time though. They were pretty huge, still are actually. But now they have been dropped down a notch or two. Lets not stand here and try to put the nail in the coffin of these guys. Remember what we went through as we watched other classes BLOW by us in abilities? <br />
<br />
I grow weary of the selfishness (and overall lack of ANY understanding of the game's &quot;Big Picture&quot;) I see here on a daily basis now. There is no one thing I can point too, just seems like a LOT of &quot;Shaman are great but we want it ALL so we can be GODDLY again!&quot; attitudes.</div></div><hr />

I am pretty sure you will soon see(or not see) a change to pets. My own theory about pet stats is that their original cap remained the same, which is causing all this. I believe that the stat table for any NPC(including mobs) looks somewhat like this:<br />
<br />
Shaman pet<br />
<br />
AC: 250 (0-1000)<br />
<br />
At some point NPC stats were just too low due to the original cap being 1000(for AC), so instead of changing the caps in the system for NPC stats, they added a multiplier to be in line with player power again:<br />
<br />
AC: 250 (0-1000) x 6 = 1500<br />
<br />
This initially worked fine, but buffs cast on NPCs would automatically multiplied as well, so that a regular Dex buff of 85 will actually add 85*6 dex to the Shaman pet above.<br />
<br />
I base my assumption on the relative low AC/ATK figures used for NPC debuffs. Things like cripple, ro ect. seem to debuff stats in a very inappropriate manner, but if you imagine that they are actully X times stronger due to the multiplier(6 times in the above example), they suddenly seem a lot more reasonable.</div></div><hr />

You can't tell from the outside what kind of exception coding is going on and in what part of the game. This wouldn't surprise me at all though. But I am not so sure pets will get nerfed. Quite possibly that involves screwing around with every class out there. EQ is so full of legacy code and exceptions (SK procs anyone?) some changes simply won't be feasible even if SOE wants them to happen.</div></div><hr />

I am pretty sure that a lot of people liked this line so much because it was a significant boost to their own pet. A &quot;real&quot; company would poll the spell again after the &quot;nerf&quot; and see if the comunity still likes the idea of extending the line as part of a Shaman balance program.</div></div><hr />

I guess it depends on how much they nerf this.  If they make the same for pets as players, they should compensate it with longer duration or a much much reduced mana cost.  This is one of the few things that have made me really enjoy EQ again.  If it is castrated as I feel it will knowing SOE's trackrecord, then I'll probably hang em up.</div></div><hr />

ANY nerf will just tip the scales to not worth it for me at least.Back to Sisslack and Yoppa for me, and don't be fooled nerfing pets proc rate is nerfing the spell plain and simple.What a sad cruel joke,class jealously triumphs again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">slow down man....space and enter keys are your friend. lol<br />
<br />
the spell was near perfect as it was, it didn't need any tweaking (duration is something I'd still ask for). I wouldn't be as annoyed by this if our DoTs had the same casting time and were unresistable.<br />
<br />
the whole idea was simply that the cleric saw something he didn't like, and he chose to make an issue of it. this situation has a very strong resemblance, in my mind, to the preacher in Mississippi who didn't like what he heard on the radio, and wrote a letter to the government that brought the FCC into existance.<br />
<br />
I don't like what happened, but then I don't have to. if SOE chooses to implement this in the patch, which they've stated they will, they will just alter their game into a direction many people don't like. this could potentially break all the classes capable of summoning controllable pets. <br />
<br />
I will say this..I certainly would hate to be a cleric on their server right now.</div></div><hr />

If i had to slow, heal, anything else besides cast this spell the dps was gone.  And I think thats a fair tradeoff.<br />

<br />
However, I was wrong - there's some very detailed info about pet procs over on the beastlord site:<br />
<br />
http://www.beastlords.org/forums/index.php/topic,2849.0.html<br />
<br />
Buffing DEX by 105 takes their procs per minute from 6 to 7 with Spirit of Rellic, or one proc every 10 seconds or so. Certainly a far cry from the 28 to 30 I've parsed on our wolves with Leopard!<br />
<br />
Faced with that, it's hard to argue that Leopard isn't bugged on pets - as it seems to fire more often than self procs on players, I suspect there's a proc modifier added to the spell. IMO they'll either remove the proc modifier, or fudge it so that proc modifiers are ignored by pets. <br />
<br />
Assuming that buffing DEX by 255 scales, that would mean 8 to 10 procs a minute of Leopard/Panther, or around 60 DPS for Leopard, 80 for Panther.<br />
<br />
(EDIT: and something to check, post &quot;nerf&quot;, will be whether weapons with proc modifiers, such as the Omens magician summons, make proc buffs go off more often)<br />
<br />
(SECOND EDIT: Bingo!<br />

I'd bet anything that &quot;400&quot; refers to a 400% proc rate increase, as it would fit the relationship between BST procs and shaman procs on pets.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Of course that's what the 400 is for, I thought that was common knowledge?  Just the scale of the number should be the tipoff, compare it to proc rates on cle hammers &amp; stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Can't say I'm really suprised by this or even upset. Pets proced ALOT. It's been that way for a while it just didn't really matter too much when the procs where small and fairly resistable. Panther really was too good on pets. I'm sorry to see pet class loose some on thier pets but I'd rather have that fix than have the spell it's self nurfed.<br />
<br />
Parses around 250dps just from the procs weren't uncommon. Thats roughly a proc every 2 seconds or 30 procs from an unextended panther. At that it's not only providing a good amount of dps it's also doing it very efficiently. With out any mana pres or spell extension or anything taken into account thats ~25 dmg per mana. Thats  about 4 times even a wizards most efficent nukes. Max extend that with 80% extension total and add on some mana pres and it's easily over 50 damage per mana.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that for someone bazaar geared or simular you could be doing more dps than anyone else in your group from 1 cast of the spell. As much as I enjoyed it it really was too good on pets.<br />
<br />
On players it seemed to be about 1/3rd or so. A proc every 6 seconds. A bit less than 100 dps and only 10 procs a minute. About ~8.5 damage per mana base and over all much more reasonable.<br />
<br />
Lets compair things to our dots.<br />
Blood of yoppa<br />
450 hps a tick for 7 ticks for 665 mana pr with no resist mod<br />
Curse of Sisslak<br />
577 hps a tick for 5 ticks for 609 mana mr with no resist mod<br />
Spirit of panther<br />
550 per proc ~1 per tick for 10 ticks for 650 chromatic neg 300 resist mod<br />
<br />
Assuming the 1 proc per 6 seconds it really compares pretty well. It costs less, does more dmg and last longer base than blood. Compared to curse it does slightly less per tick and costs a little bit more but lasts twice as long. For either it also has the benifit of faster casting time, huge resist mod and stackability going for it.<br />
<br />
Sure it's not as crazy as it was for pets but it's still far better than any other source of damage we have. I still like it and will still use it on players and pets after the change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">we don't know how bad its going to be &quot;adjusted&quot;. simple as that. SOE doesn't typically adjust things well, as been proven in the past.<br />
<br />
knowing past precedent, I wouldn't be surprised if they remove proc modifiers from the spell altogether, and we'll have something that isn't really worth it, a spell that will proc maybe 3 times a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>bryce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">&quot;Compared to curse it does slightly less per tick and costs a little bit more but lasts twice as long&quot;             I almost always get 1 or 2 1300+ crits on Sisslak. This is not a bug fix or a &quot;nerf&quot; it will be a nerf period if it is tampered with in any way. We didn't need another dot on par with what we have. Panther's superior DPS on pets is really the only thing that makes it worth the hassle for me at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Yeah and if your casting it on a player they can get crits on panther too. Pet won't but players can. If the mob dies before sisslak wears out it probably will do more damage but in any situation where things go longer panther is going to out do it. Double the duration and more potential for being extended (SCRM + focus vs just focus) really does make it alot better in any situation where the mob or mobs last threw the entire duration.<br />
<br />
I really fail to see how you can call panther a hastle in comparison to Sisslak. <br />
<br />
Curse of Sisslak- 5.5 second cast time and 30 second recast time.<br />
<br />
Spirit of the panther- 3.0 second cast time, no recast time and can be cut to 1.5 second cast time with quickbuff.<br />
<br />
Either is going to cast when the mob is in camp and if your talking a direct comparison once per mob. Panther is going to be noticibly faster casting time, no chance for resist and no recast time to ever worry about. Sure if you want to treat panther like a buff like focus that you keep up on your pet or melees at all times it's annoying but thats not how i view the spell. I treat it like a dot. I cast it when I expect the mob(s) to live long enough to make it worth while once stuff is in camp and under control. The exact same type of situations where I would have cast dots before. Except now that particular mob doesn't have to live. As long as there is any mob for the pet, or player to be meleeing panther is providing benifit.<br />
<br />
Sure it was nice when our pet could out dps all but top end dps melees from panther but that really isn't reasonable or realistic.</div></div><hr />

If it doesn't hose the procrate on those hammers then there really needs to be some bitching.  Those things must have a 50x proc mod from what I can see.<br />

Yeah, cleric hammers are nuts and probably proc as much or more than panther and leopard ever do.  And maybe if we become whiny sobs on the cleric board about that, their secondary slot epics and all the other perks they get they'll get a nerf.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Just remember, Soe hasn't been very successful in global changes like this.  Adjusting pet proc rate potentially effects a lot more than just this one spell.  Just one of those things where the petitioner may not like what he's asking for.<br />
Looking at this thread, there's some folks crying 'nerf us for balance's sake'.   Umm, in eq there is no such thing as complete balance.  Its a matter of being 'over' in some areas and 'under'  in others.  Just how many things do we need to be 'under' in to get our 'over'?  Up until oow(at which time i took a 5 month break), we were under in almost every category.  Things have improved a lot since then, but there hasn't been any compelling reason to take a shaman instead of a better healer or another slower.<br />
That being said, I really can't speak for panther, since I have only leopard.  Doesn't seem overpowered to me, since a beastlord or mage pet can rip mobs up faster than my dog and tank them to boot.  No idea about necro pets since i've not duo'd with any.  A paladin friend reports 30-35 dps when cast on him.  No real point casting it on him since a dot or nuke gives more dps than that.<br />
Hopefully the spells will still work well after the nerf, and we'll still have the option to provide useful dps.  Like most folks, I've grown tired of cries for nerfs and crying for our own nerfs seems especially odd.</div></div><hr />

This is a ridiculous comment. First off, Panther adds at LEAST 130 DPS to players, and I dont see anyone saying to TOTALLY nerf it on pets, just some are saying &quot;trim the proc rate back a bit&quot;. <br />
<br />
BLs arent taking our group slots anymore, and I doubt the -40 resist slow will change that very much. But if it does, deal with it. You act like you want Shaman to be the SUPERIOR choice to BLs in EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of the game, and thats just not reasonable. <br />
<br />
I am all for pushing for our class to maintain its strengths, both groupwise, raidwise and solowise, but lets not be completely insensetive to the needs of the GAME overall. Panther proccing at 2x rate on pets is an AWESOME spell, an amazing jump in our DPS. Right now, its insanely overpowered on pets, period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I simply say that the spell wasn't overpowered in comparison to what we were doing before, just in a more immediate time frame. I still maintain this view.<br />
<br />
I don't like the fact that its going to be nerfed, but like I said before, I don't have to. whats done is done.<br />
<br />
I can only hope that the spell isn't adjusted to the point of uselessness. like casting diaku on a tank that is 1 point short of max strength. I say this, because, in the past, SOE hasn't adjusted things to an appropriate degree, they usually take it a bit too far.<br />
<br />
we know the Proc rates will be reduced, but we don't know how. they stated simply &quot;pets were proc'ing more than intended&quot;, does this mean they are going to change pets, or the buff? changing the buff will have a large detrimental effect in its usage. changing pets could be a much larger undertaking and could potentially break all pet classes.<br />
<br />
the easy way out (and everyone likes the easy way) is just to nerf the buff instead of pets, but if that happens to a typical SOE extent, the spell may as well have not existed. the proc rate, to me, justified the mana cost and short duration (which I think could have been improved still). would you still cast panther if the proc went off an average of 2-3 times per cast? hint: you'd save more mana, and get more DPS chain-nuking with our Ice DDs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">There's no doubt about it that the proc rate for pets is not intended. <br />
<br />
Mikar never said Panther was broken or overpowered, but that the effect it had on pets was and that's pretty hard to argue against. <br />
<br />
That's why I said Mikar owned everyone in the thread, because people flat out refused to see what he was saying and instead pretended that he had said the buff itself was overpowering.<br />
<br />
However, I have to disagree with Blazz saying Panther adds 130 dps to any melee. As far as I can tell the Maw line is set to proc once every 6 seconds, 10 times per minute, so that it's fair to assume that it adds around 100 DPS on average.<br />
<br />
That said I will be the first one to say that I think 100 DPS is a tad too low and that the broken aspect involving pets was what made it really powerful and valuable for the Shaman. Why am I saying this:<br />
<br />
1. There's no way they will change the proc rate of the buff itself, 'cause that one is fine, they will probably hard cap pets' proc rate and we all know pets don't get AAs that make them crit DDs, so that a pet will actually do less DPS than a melee after the &quot;nerf&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Panther doesn't scale. Buffing 3 people now will be the same as buffing 3 people at the end of the expansion. A Wizard will be doing more damage by the end of the expansion than he's now, a Shaman will not do so with Panther<br />
<br />
3. Stacking. Whether there's one Shaman or two Shamans in a group, the damage output added through Panther is almost the same(as opposed to adding another rogue, which would result in doubling it). This is a strong argument for not nerfing the way Panther works on pets. Shamans could fill a DPS role through their pets in groups as the DPS added from a second Shaman's pet is currently very noticable</div></div><hr />

I love leopard but if your completely honest with yourself I don't see ho you cant say this isn't slightly overpowered. I actually took out a 1500 hitter with just shaman/necro the other day. Necro pet tanking with a convition on it and leopard on pets. It's DPS output is absoltly rediculous when you stack focus and FA onto pets. You get a proc every swing and the spam is sick. <br />

Some of the fableds are 1500 hitters. FYI I had my necro pet tank it and he would get hit for 1500 on the hiero. Hiero is much harder then the jbb was that was a joke. <br />

<br />
are the folks who have complained about wanting to be usefull because stat cap made most our buffs obsolete wanting to nerf ourselves?<br />
or is it the folks who wanted to solo more, bacause since pop (and before) solo content for shaman was hard to find wanting this self nerf?<br />
<br />
guess the point im getting to is that the spell was coded to 400% proc rate.  If i was a betting man, and judging from past expansions, is that there is a planed reduction in that proc rate once the expansion settles in and most folks buy it.  its about making don buyable for the $$'s, not about what makes shaman a usefull group member.  <br />
enjoy the spell while it lasts, solo something crazy that you would have never been able to do bacuase low dps.  because when the nerf bat hits, were gonna have a 550 proc with a zero proc mod that costs 650 mana...and who knows what other coding it will mess up, maybe mobs will be banished or something weird...o wait that already happened...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">However, I have to disagree with Blazz saying Panther adds 130 dps to any melee. As far as I can tell the Maw line is set to proc once every 6 seconds, 10 times per minute, so that it's fair to assume that it adds around 100 DPS on average.<br />
I was adding in a few crit-procs, and it was just a ballpark guess anyway, based on what some of my guildes said they parsed (in samples much too small to be considered scientific). <br />

While I am generally not a big supporter of the &quot;Corporation Conspiricy Theory&quot;, I am forced to recognize this particular theory as completly plausible, considering SOEs past record on similar things (MPG trials made harder, 70 rune drops in MPG nerfed, Uber items dropping early in every expansion since Kunark, only to be removed. Gem Encrusted Ring anyone?)<br />

I highly doubt that it will be this drastic, and honestly, there are only a couple people here who actually think the spell is a bit unbalanced in its current form (me being one). <br />
<br />
I think we will see a reduction in the proc rate on pets, but I dont think it will be lowered to the same rate that players have. I think it will still be a VERY VERY powerful spell. I dont even call it a nerf, I call it &quot;balance&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">check out the cleric version don spell lvl 69.  my wife is a cleric, and ill tell you how she uses it.<br />
<br />
first off its a 550 dmg spell she self buffs herself with, and it lasts 3 minutes for 750 mana.<br />
<br />
in that 3 minutes, she grabs a small train and puts a large hot on herself.  once mobs start hitting her, thers a constant string of 550 and 1100 dmg &quot;ticks&quot; going off.  the best way sh can describe it is that shes sorta doting them with a self buff...while she swings away with her hammer, critting at 600% increased rate, with criticals.  <br />
<br />
dunno about yoou but for 100 extra mana, her spell can in effect AE dot anything that touches her, for 3 minutes...and it stays on the mob if the buff fades, so she doesnt have to imedietly recast it if it drops in order to maintain dps.  so thats double the time, for 100 mana, that can hit more than 1 mob...<br />
<br />
for me, im glad shaman didnt get the shaft for once....rangers and druids did, unless they really were begging for another snare...or 2.<br />
<br />
its not out of balance, or over powering, its just powerful.  something long over due.</div></div><hr />

Yes 1 charge 800 hp heal only use every 30 seconds. If it was castable whenever it would be useful but this is just plain stupid. Is a necros problem ever mana in a fight?

Just over a week after it first appeared the proc was added and the chance to crit was replaced by a 1500 HP buff first, then an 80% movement increase (it went live at this stage, but as DoN hadn't launched there was no way to scribe the spell).<br />
<br />
At the same time Leopard was introduced, different proc, lower movement rate increase. Finally, just before DoN went live, the movement bit was scrapped and the spells ended up as proc only.<br />

They are spectacular bryce, and STILL will be, even if they cut the proc rate on pets in HALF. <br />
<br />
Personally, I am beginning to agree with a lot of the opinions here. If they are going to &quot;fix&quot; the proc rate on pets, then at LEAST give us another 30 seconds of duration, so we can cast it 1 or 2 more times each cycle. Thats seems a reasonable compromise, since it would trim its &quot;brokenness&quot; in single group situations (where I feel its just too strong) yet it would almost be the same in raids (1 or 2 more pets with it is about the same as a higher proc rate). <br />
<br />
Fair enough?<br />
<br />
EDIT: I wanted to add the reason I feel its just too overpowering in groups. Group is looking for a DPS class, and says &quot;Screw that wizard, we have a Mage, so get a Shaman, the 2 pets with Panther is WAY better DPS than a Wizard&quot;. Wizards are hosed enough now, IMHO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with many posts of yours regarding balance, but I have a different opinion on Panther.<br />
<br />
First, I see no hope for anyone believing that, after the pet nerf, this spell will provide the same or even more damage when cast on a pet. I assume pets will proc less often than a PC will, but we shall see, I guess.<br />
<br />
Second, Panther will add about 100 DPS per melee and pets(we'll just assume so for now). This means that a Shaman can generate 300 DPS with this spell by keeping it up on 2 PCs and his own pet.<br />
<br />
300 sustained DPS in an average group is...fine, I'd say. 300 DPS in a highend group, is not so great anymore and sure as hell won't be much 6 months from now when everyone has upgraded their weapons, spells and foci, which do not in any shape or form affect the DPS from Panther. This itself already is a pretty solid argument imo, for why Panther will not be so great, let alone overpowered, after the changes to pets.<br />
<br />
Third, I have said this already twice, but people ignore this, Panther, after the change, won't stack worth ****. While a group with 1 rogue will be doubling their rogue DPS by adding a second, a group with a Shaman won't be doubling the Panther DPS by adding a scond Shaman, because you only have a limited number of &quot;recipients&quot; for Panther.<br />
<br />
I really wish a Developer would actually read these posts to see the Pros and the Cons. While the proc rate for pets is certainly not intended and &quot;broken&quot; compared to how the spell affects PCs, it's THE way to allow Shamans to fill a stackable DPS role in groups through the high proc rate of their own pet.</div></div><hr />

If the change makes it proc LESS on pets than it does on PCs, then I will be VERY upset and definitely jump on the &quot;make it better&quot; bandwagon. I think it can be a great spell if it procs on pets at a 150-200% rate compared to PCs, but at the 400-500% we are seeing now, its just stupid. <br />
300 sustained DPS in an average group is...fine, I'd say. 300 DPS in a highend group, is not so great anymore and sure as hell won't be much 6 months from now when everyone has upgraded their weapons, spells and foci, which do not in any shape or form affect the DPS from Panther. This itself already is a pretty solid argument imo, for why Panther will not be so great, let alone overpowered, after the changes to pets.<br />
I agree here, to an extent. Groups without pets will not get as much benefit at all. This could be intentional to give Mages and Necros more group-appeal. But overall, 300ish DPS isnt really a massive thing, its like adding 1 extra ranger to the group. Also, that 300 dps isnt really the &quot;actual&quot; additional DPS Shamans will provide. Since it essentially replaces our DOTs, the actual DPS gained is less. <br />
Third, I have said this already twice, but people ignore this, Panther, after the change, won't stack worth ****. While a group with 1 rogue will be doubling their rogue DPS by adding a second, a group with a Shaman won't be doubling the Panther DPS by adding a scond Shaman, because you only have a limited number of &quot;recipients&quot; for Panther.<br />
I agree, a 5th or 6th shaman per raid isnt anywhere near as good as a 5th or 6th wizard or rogue, which are basically infinitely stackable. But how many guilds have 6+ active shaman? There are enough PCs and pets on most raids to keep 3-5 shamans plenty busy with debuffs, regular buffs, and now panther. Our stackability sucked ass before this spell. This spell made us considerably more stackable. Personally, I am satisfied with the end result. But again, a lot depends on how deep the nerf actually is. <br />
I really wish a Developer would actually read these posts to see the Pros and the Cons. While the proc rate for pets is certainly not intended and &quot;broken&quot; compared to how the spell affects PCs, it's THE way to allow Shamans to fill a stackable DPS role in groups through the high proc rate of their own pet.<br />
Can't argue with this logic. I am in &quot;wait and see&quot; mode myself. If they nerf it to LESS than PC proc-rate for pets, then we can bitch. But if they just cut the proc rate back some on pets, I can accept it. My personal feeling is a 2x proc rate for pets will be OK. Strong, stackable, but not overpowering. <br />
<br />

It is a new role for Shaman and there will be class envy for awhile. Frankly I didn't like it at first because it limits me in what I can do in some ways.

You are really smarter than this.  They might not nerf the spell, but by nerfing pets, then upping all other pet spells except this one to compensate, they are, in fact, NERFING THIS on pets.  How much is yet to be seen.  I'm hoping for a 1/2proc rate with a 1.5 -2x duration.</div></div><hr />

Sigh. Its like a bad nightmare that just keeps re-occuring over and over.<br />
<br />
Let me try to explain MY PERSONAL point of view, Vork, ok? I think the spell is FAR too powerul on pets. I think it unbalances us vs other classes. I think it makes us TOO good. I think having one class be TOO good is BAD FOR EVERQUEST. <br />
<br />
EQ is an living, breathing, evolving game. Classes get &quot;boons&quot; and classes get nerfed, or classes get nerfed by &quot;ommsion&quot; (they arent given as big a bump as other classes). These game adjustments need to be made CONSTANTLY, or the whole game suffers. I think that Panther, they way it is on pets, is FAR too powerful and should be reduced ON PETS for the overall good of the game. <br />
<br />
My personal compromise, which has been said here a few times: Reduce the proc rate for pets to 200% of the proc rate on Players (its currently 400-500%). Add 20-30 seconds to the base duration to compensate. <br />
<br />
See? By the time you factor in the extended duration, which would allow you to add another pet/player to your &quot;cycle&quot;, the &quot;nerf&quot; isnt really that big overall. Maybe slightly less useful in groups, but in raids, the extra duration gives you a different &quot;balance&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Cripes, would any of you think it was unbalanced if they suddenly gave Wizrds a 1K DPS nuke with absolutely ZERO aggro? Cause right now, if you keep Panther running on 4 pets, at 280-320 DPS per pet, do the freakin math.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">This spell is extremly powerful on Pets and Palyers.

wow 3 pets that are really to weak do a whole lot to begin with? Vs necro's, bst, mages? Ok fine, so m aybe 99% was off. it's about 1/2 I guess, hard to think at 4am in the morning.... None the less, If you guys are so worried about casting this spell on the pets that your even willing to cast it on the druids bear which is mostly for looks anyway instead of pc's. Its no wonder they are wanting to change it. Plus get mage pet weaps like most people do, those weaps proc and help the pets out quite abit as well. /shrug.. to me, pets don't need panther like spells casted on them. Hard enough to keep this spell on the players during raids that I don't even consider the pets. What do you guys do? Have one shammy on  pets, on shammy on the pcs while the other debuffs and slows? <br />

I'm really wondering who put you in charge of deciding what is too powerful for us.  I'm wondering if you even play any other classes.  There are other classes that have power that is comperable to ours with  the spell just the way it is.  It seems YOU have gotten used to being underpowered for so long...</div></div><hr />

Well.  Nice to have constructive feedback on a thread that seems to have degenerated to &quot;I'm right, you're wrong.&quot;  I agree with ya Blazz; one class overpowering others is a VERY BAD thing. Do I think Panther makes us overpowering? Hard for me to say. No, I cant cast the spell, and it will likely be months until I can; giving the community and the Developers plenty of time to scream back and forth at each other until 1) a happy medium is reached; or,<br />
2) the Dev's do something and we as a class decide it's no longer worth the time and effort to complain about it.<br />
Either way, in a few months Ill get the spell; and hopefully be happy with how it changes my gameplay.  However, I still think that it's rather rude of SoE to focus solely  on the &quot;High end,&quot; and relatively small portion of the class when they decided to &quot;re-envision&quot; the Shaman.</div></div><hr />

Valid point m9. Honestly, if you read my posts, I sincerely try to include statements like &quot;I think&quot; and &quot;in my opinion&quot; etc. <br />
<br />
But think for a sec. A wizard/mage gets a 1000-1200 DPS nuke, that has no aggro, would anyone bitch? A necro gets a 1000-1200 DPS DOT taht generates no aggro, unbalanced? Becase on a raid, this is how powerful this spell is. In a &quot;normal&quot; group, with 1 pet user, yourself, and 2-3 melees, Panther is about 600 dps. I can write a simple macro and just change the names:<br />
<br />
/tar Goner (my pet)<br />
/cast 5<br />
/pause 20 (or whatever)<br />
/tar Loban (other pet in group)<br />
/cast 5<br />
/pause 20<br />
/tar Backstabby (rogue/monk in group)<br />
/cast 5<br />
/pause 20<br />
<br />
One click, 600 dps. <br />
If the spell gets cut back to 150 DPS on pets, and stays 100 dps on PCs, thats a 200-300 &quot;nerf&quot; in this situation, but its STILL a good 400 dps addition. And its not hard to malos/slow and keep this running in most normal XP groups either.</div></div><hr />

That Macro would be running my out of mana within a few fights.   I can keep it up on my pet....and Maybe maybe maybe one other tank while haveing to malo and slow.   So maybe for the  Upper end shaman this spell is overpowering but for the lower end I don't think its to bad.</div></div><hr />

You seem to think that shamans have nothing else to do, besides turn every pet in a raid into damage machines.  In normal raid situations, whether clearing trash, or engaging major mobs, I find myself pressed to maintain Leopard on more than 3 targets.  Its not like our other responsibilities of keeping the cleric alive, casting BoN or RGC, keeping other players, and pets alive, and everything else, leaves us a great deal of time to maintain a LeopardPanther chain on every pet or player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can cast slow on a incoming mob and have it land before the mob reaches the raid, and guess what.  The mob goes directly to the MT.  Wizzies can already crit nuke for over 10K, not 1000-1200.  Know what?  I rarely see a wizzy get agro, unless they are totally undiciplined, because MTs have so much agro building capability.  A necro can easily lay on DOTs that do more than 1000-1200 DPS.  If he DOES get agro, know what?  He FDs.  Bye bye agro.<br />

<br />
You seem to think that shamans have nothing else to do, besides turn every pet in a raid into damage machines.  <br />
I will admit I am a bit spoiled. My guild has an average of 5 Shamans per raid, and all of them are very well skilled and very well geared. I am probably the 5th or 6th shaman in the guild, gear-wise, mostly because my RL has limited my raiding window in the evenings. Even so, I can keep Leopard on 5-7 targets with relative ease, as well as my other duties (buffing, malos, and I have a TA for slowing). That Macro would be running my out of mana within a few fights.   I can keep it up on my pet....and Maybe maybe maybe one other tank while haveing to malo and slow.   So maybe for the  Upper end shaman this spell is overpowering but for the lower end I don't think its to bad.<br />
There is a lot of merit to this viewpoint. As I said above, in my guild, we can afford to have 3 or 4 shaman dedicated to JUST panthering, so maybe it seems so skewed to me personally because of the general make-up of my guild. <br />
<br />
It is expensive though, I will give you that. I have Epic and TA, FT18 with AA, and as long as I am not primary healing, I can keep Leopard on 5 targets easily, since the only other &quot;real&quot; spell I have to cast is Malos (clicky-slow, clicky group heal is usually enough to help out the main healer) aside from refreshing buffs. <br />
<br />
I am glad to see people FINALLY starting to enter the debate with something more than &quot;what are you nuts? dont ask to be nerfed&quot;. I will gladdly concede these points; that in Raids where there are less than 3-4 shaman, and groups with players that AREN'T as well geared as myself, Leopard/Panther lose a lot of their &quot;assumed over-power&quot; very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">If they give our pet an extra couple thousand HP and up the proc rate on this for PCs a tiny bit at the same time as they nerf it, I'll actually be fairly happy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">atm, i really only cast thi on PC's to a)keep them happy, b) if tehres no pets around, and c) becuase i can cycle thru pc targets fast.<br />
<br />
pets make far better use of it atm.  broken, unbalanced? dont care, its more efficient.  only the best geared, highest attk, most aa DPS class comes close to pet dps (as far as panther) goes, if its unbalanced, in your opinion, so what...SOE coded it that way, not my fault and its not a hack. but again, thanks for killin the fun.<br />
<br />
blazz i can also keep panther on 5-6 targets in a xp sitution, max ft, nice mana pool and clicky slows, but its more of a hasle to do so, since the dps gain from players is nice, but not Super-Duper, its just nice.  epsecially when dog dog can out proc them without blinking.  and in raids, when tehres 1 mob to kill, i can spam panther till im oom, hit the magic button and keep casting my brains out.  but i dont care about how much mana i have left over, and if a nuke happy wizzy or overzealous chanter gets squished, well its not the first time someone died during a raid.  i heal my group, but people still die.  more often than not, with mobs hitting in the 5k range, even trying to heal a group member is a waste of time, just keep the DPS rolling.<br />
<br />
lower lvl shaman, or less then &quot;outstanding&quot; geared probably really enjoy panther/learpord the most, it definetly helps folks out in wos/pop/god zone xp groups, where most tanks arent anguished geared and rogues dont crank out 700dps non stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">I didnt think it was overpowered for the sheer fact that I can only cast it once every other fight due to mana restrictions and the short duration.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">As someone who isn't currently playing but did have a 66 Shaman with no Elemental access. I can see why people might have said these spells are over powered.<br />
<br />
Shaman's as a rule are often seen as unable to run out of mana, this is partly due to the limits of what we had to cast pre-panther. <br />
<br />
With the new cast straight from HP AA I would be curious to now how many people/pets you could maintain Panther on for a big fight.<br />
<br />
A situation I woudl suggest that has potential to be over powered is this (Not sure if you could do it but I think it could be done if timed right): What would be the burst DPS of a shaman soloing, using panther of dog dog and all 5 AA dogs (most likely using the HP casting AA to maintain casting ability)? If is around the 230ish dps per pet and all pets last a minute with Panther (I can't remember how long the AA pets last, but if they don't last over a minute this is wrong), that equals (6 * 230 = 1380) * 60 = 82,800 thats ignoring they normal dps and any dps coming from yourself.<br />
<br />
Even with dog dog and yourself, both panthered you should be doing 350+ dps, how many other classes can do that solo. Wizards need to root and nuke decreasing they DPS and if against a caster they in trouble, Rogues from what I hear solo badly and no where near they dps standard.<br />
<br />
Also with the pets as they are a shaman who can keep panther on at least 3 pets can add around 600-700 dps to teh group. A level of dps that is matching non special attack rogues and wizards and most likely doubling rogues that do not have the good daggers. All without any aggro.<br />
<br />
Adding 300+ to a group keeping it up on 3 people is still pretty good dps for a non dps class.</div></div><hr />

I didnt mean to &quot;flame&quot; you, if I did I apologize. I realize I can be somewhat abrasive when I am agruing something I believe strongly in. <br />
<br />
But honestly, once every other fight? Malos, Slow, and 1/2 a panther is all you cast per fight? Do me a favor, run down your &quot;average 10 minutes&quot; in a group situation, for example:<br />
<br />
Mob pulled, I try to malos on inc and slow when it gets to camp. I sic dog-dog, look to see if a heal is needed, and then I . . .<br />
<br />
In between pulls I check buffs, make sure they are refreshed, canni, top off the MAs health, etc. If we are chain pulling, I prioritize my duties . . . or whatever<br />
<br />
I would like to see why you only have 650 mana every other fight. What else are you burning your mana on? Even with a straight bazaar/WoS mana-pool, I would think you could keep panther up EVERY fight on at least 2 targets (the MA and your pet), in addition to your &quot;normal&quot; grouping duties. If there is a pet-class in your group, then JUST keeping it up full-time on both pets is a solid 450-500 sustained DPS.</div></div><hr />

As the wolves pop faster than you can cast Leopard/Panther, you're not going to get the full minute's worth of buffs. Nonetheless, using Advanced Spirit Call's 3 pets and the normal wolf, Phinny (16K HPs) died before the swarm pets poofed.<br />

Assuming you'd not hasted or cast FA on any of the swarm (which takes an age anyway), you'd get a base 80 DPS or so per pet. So, if you'd got a fully buffed wolf and the 5 from Spirit Call III, you'd be looking at around 600 DPS for 24 seconds or so with Leopard, more with Panther. That's not including melee DPS from the pets either, which should add an extra 100 DPS or so and that's without any DoTs...</div></div><hr />

This assumes that none of the pets get killed...  I know on many mobs that rampage/whatever, my pets poof very quickly and even 'Gonar' or 'Lonar' die quickly too.  No pet, no DPS from SoL/SoP.  <br />
<br />
That is what I think some here don't get.  This isn't something you can multiply xxx casts x 200dps.  You have to have the targets to cast it on to get this DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">In a raid situation with multiple shamans, we have people on malos and slow, people on spot heals, and usually one -- me, recently -- on leopard.  Maintaining leopard on 9 targets during boss fights is not hard.  Somewhere I posted how to maintain a buff list to keep track of who's next to get buffed.<br />
<br />
In a group situation I can easily maintain leopard on 3 targets, with steady mana.  My pet, the tank, and one more (pet or melee).  (No, not flawlessly, you doubters, but yes, steadily and reliably.)<br />
<br />
Your macro to do this has more than 5 lines, Blazz.  I don't think you can actually have one that long.  But I do indeed do it with macros.  I have two macros, five lines each.<br />
<br />
Lep Pet<br />
/pause 3, /tar Kebeker<br />
/pause 15, /cast 9<br />
/pause 15, /cast 9<br />
/pause 15, /cast 9<br />
/assist<br />
<br />
Edit this macro every time you call a pet; replace Kebeker with the current name of your pet.  (Why isn't there a MyPet variable built into the game?)  The macro targets the pet, tries to cast Leopard 3 times (thus recasting automatically in case of fizzles), and then retargets the mob.<br />
<br />
LepMelee<br />
/pause 4, /tar Tanker<br />
/pause 15, /cast 9<br />
/pause 40, /cast 9<br />
/pause 4, /tar Kenober<br />
/cast 9<br />
<br />
Edit this macro with the name of the Tank (who should always be the first player to get the buff) and the name of another pet or player.  The macro targets the MA, tries to cast Leopard twice (recasting automatically in case of a fizzle), targets someone else and -- only has one line left to try to cast Leopard.  I have fizzled on that and had to recast Leopard manually.  Life can be tough like that sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">I can see how the spell is more effective in lower end zones.  But in higher level zones where named hit much harder and have much nastier AoE, it doesnt take long for Dogah to bit it unless you are paying very close attention to him.  Oh and in exp groups.  Unless the tank can control the mob correctly, enrage makes pets worthless.  I think Mages, Necros and BLs benefit from our spell better then Shaman actually do.  I cant remember the last time I reminded a tank to watch positioning in an exp group since this spell has come out.  Now I have to do it several times per group.  I think with all the costs involved with the spell in its current, it isnt over powered.</div></div><hr />

Are you the person who suggested sending yourself a tell when you buff someone, so you know who you left off on?<br />
<br />
And yes, I know the macro thing is complicated. I have fooled around wiith it though, and its not too hard to set up. Mine is:<br />
<br />
/tar MY PET'S NAME , /pause 10<br />
/cast 5 , /pause 25<br />
/tar NEXT IN LINE , /pause 10<br />
/cast 5, /pause 25<br />
<br />
I only have 2 per macro, but can you have more than 2 commands per line in the hot-key set-ups? I am not sure, havent really fooled around too much, did it in a group and only did my pet and MA, since I was main healer as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
can you have more than 2 commands per line in the hot-key set-ups? No.  You can only have two commands if one of them is a pause command.  Otherwise only one command per line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">And I think it's only /pause and /cast that can share a line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't tried /pause with every command, but I believe that it works with any single command.<br />
<br />
Off the top of my head, I know that I have written working macro lines that combine /pause with /target, /cast, /sit, /autoattack, /doability, /autoinventory, maybe some others I'm not remembering at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">I sit corrected. You can read the oddest information on the internet. I've only used /pause and /cast together.</div></div><hr />

Yeah thats it, I remember now. I actually used it for a while, but then we switched our buffing methods on raids so I didnt need it as much. Great idea, pretty sure I rep-bumped you for that one.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the macro info. I will actually sit down and write one up for myself soon. I am just too lazy these days. I have augs I havent swapped into new gear, factioning that could get me some easy stuff, etc etc. EQ has changed a lot for me over the past few months. Saddly for me, that change coincided with the release of DoN and my guilds breaking into Qvic. Oh well, RL &gt; EQ and always will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">I do this too. I made windows and chats for SoL and FA (don't use FA that much, though), and hotkey goes:<br />

/cast 9<br />
/7 %T<br />
/ttell Leopard refresh<br />

or something like that. Actually, I don't announce the Leopard, but I do on the FA.</div></div><hr />

The beauty of the spell is that in a pinch, you could throw it on a bunch of people and get some burst DPS.  With a 30 second recast...USELESS, especially with the proc nerf coming.  I have very little faith in SOE, but if this goes through to live, I will have lost any remaining faith I had.  Completely a crock.</div></div><hr />

I rarely see a wizzy get agro, unless they are totally undiciplined, because MTs have so much agro building capability.  A necro can easily lay on DOTs that do more than 1000-1200 DPS.
