<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few days ago I was raiding with some higher level guildmates (mid 40s to very low 50s) and I noticed something with my experience:<br />
<br />
If we pulled a mob that conned yellow to me I seemed to gain more XP than the times when we pulled a mob that conned deep red. I tested this later with a level 39 warrior and myself. Sure enough, the yellows seemed to give me more XP than the deep red mobs.<br />
<br />
Is there some sort of top-end XP cap?? Or an XP &quot;sweet spot&quot; where after a certain level mob you get very little XP? It seems to make sense to avoid a low level player from sponging too much XP off high level friends, but I thought that was what the grouping restrictions were for. <br />
<br />
Has anyone encountered this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sengal, there could be a number of reasons.  You can group with someone half again your level (or 66% of their level if you prefer to calculate the other way).  If you were grouped with a couple of 50's, the mobs that were yellow to you might have been green to them.  If a mob is green to them and not to you, and you are still in the grouping level range, I believe (and people, please post corrections if I'm mistaken!) that you get all the exp.  So, in your groups, when mobs greened out to the higher level guys, the higher level guys were removed from the exp division.  Thus, the exp from the yellow might be divided by 3 people instead of 6 and you would be getting more exp.  The red con mobs probably divided the exp among everyone as they probably weren't green to the high level guys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mez thing Chutoi is right altho the details are scetchy.<br />
<br />
When mez did some boxing,  I noticed the same kind of thing but<br />
it may not even require that the mob be green to the higher lvl members of the group.  I was noticing this when the mobs turned light blue to the higher character.<br />
<br />
Chutoi has a workable theory that is consistant with everything I have observed and I think he is right.  Hard to put numbers to it thow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Chutoi and Radag.  I believe I have observed this myself, but I didn't attempt to measure it.</div></div><hr />
