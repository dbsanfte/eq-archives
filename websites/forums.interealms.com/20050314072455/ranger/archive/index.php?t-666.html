<br />
You know I suppose at some point this will be true, but through level 45 my current level Rangers make an acceptable although not desirable tank.  We can certainly hold agro if we want.  We have a fair amount of hp's and although not as defensively gifted as some a decent healer can keep us alive.  I still tank a fair amount and although I don't look for the job I know that I can handle it if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naero</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are every bit a tank up to 45.  Your AC and HP are reasonably on par with the &quot;tanks&quot; but once you become planes capable thats no longer then case.  Don't get me wrong you can still tank but are not nearly as effective as you once were.  Personally if you have to tank get the right gear to do so.  If you can be that damage machine that does not steal aggro, do that! Its so much nicer not having to take the beating all the time. Let the warriors/paladins/ShadowKnights take a beating.  I prefer giving them out (most of the time ;))</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as the mobs do not hit above 100 doubling and such I can tank perfectly fine.<br />
<br />
But when there is mobs which double for upwards of 130 our hps go down quicker than the local prostitute.</div></div><hr />

I can honestly say i have tanked in every camp in seb but lzo king and juggs. If you have good ac/hps gear you will find not many clerics will complain unless they don't know how to heal. Now my guild went against Dlamma and i could not tank him and did not try till everyone else died.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RangerKeaianea</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the other day one of my guild's officers was listing out classes and what they were considered.  LOL  He put Ranger under &quot;Tank&quot; instead of &quot;Damage Dealer&quot;.  I just said, /gu &lt;---can deal damage...<br />
<br />
Everyone knows that I can deal more damage than Warriors, Paladins and Shadow Knights.  LOL  They've seen the parsed fights on BIG mobs.  I'm right up there with Monks, sometimes above them.  Of course...I can't compete against those rogues...YET...ROFL  I'll find a way to do it, so help me!<br />
<br />
Anyway, Rangers CAN tank for exp groups.  I duo Chardok / Velks with my husband (60 Cleric) all the time and we never have to break to med unless I start running low on mana or we get unexpected adds.  LOL  ALSO, Rangers can hold aggro very well while tanking.  Sometimes even with warrior in the group, if they are lower level than me, I'm still the main tank (even though my AC is just a bit above 1100 buffed).  Chanters and clerics enjoy the fact that they can nuke / heal / tash / slow and sit down without having to worry about getting hit immediately.<br />
<br />
BUT, don't get me wrong.  If I'm not the best choice for tanking in a given group, I certainly don't mind being behind the mob and attacking.  =)  More DPS baby!<br />
<br />
Ranger tanking is not an easily defined yes or no.  You have to look at each situation and see who is the best choice.  NO, I'm not going to tank Vindi (at least not for more than about 22 seconds...GO Weaponshield...WOOT!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeffr</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We can tank fine in any exp situation and many lower raid situations.  The way I look at is I can tank any mob that a 54 or under warrior can, just because 55+ warriors have defensive.  I compare my stats with warriors in my guild( most are 53-56) and I am a few HPs less(under 100) and maybee a couple ac on some of them, but other than that we are about the same.  Once they get defensive is when they become the real tanks and we sit in the back on raids hehe.  The only time we really cant tank is for the big raids, where you want a defensive warrior tanking, which means even paladins and sk's arent tanking so its not like we are weak or anything hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taluvan Winterscar</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can pretty much tank any mobs cept maybe end game mobs like ToV dragons or such. I can and have tanked Dragons both slowed and unslowed in WW (yeh i know they're cheap but hey it's a dragon :rolleyes: ). Tanked Tpos in velk, and others etc etc. With full 60 buff (aego focus sta agi) my ac is 1300+ Hp around 4500 and atk around 1400+ (without avatar or greater wolfform). So when people say ranger can't tank i just tell them to bring it on :D</div></div><hr />

Jolt at end of the 20 seconds and ask MR. Uber Warrior if he remembered to train in taunt skill. <br />
<br />
Of course our real use is allowing enough time to let the clerics camp in a situation gone bad. Day to day I have never had any issues with normal exp mobs.</div></div><hr />

At 58 with tolans BP and SS armor all over, a str of 255 most of the time, in a normal (read it again, normal) situation at Chardok, KC, or Velks spiders, I can serve as a decent tank.  When it comes to high end encounters, my main duty is damage dealing.  And when a tank is available, I usually end up doing damage dealing.<br />
<br />
Now the other night.... I've fought with three tanks in the last two nights that couldn't hold aggro if you tied it to em.  In those groups I ended up the tank, despite the fact there were warriors present.  Heh, in one, the Mage in our group made the comment &quot;Ranger tank?&quot;  I said, sure!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure warriors have better AC and more HPs.  Like duh.  Does that mean rangers can't tank?  Hardly.  When you are picking the main tank for your next run at the &lt;insert uber mob here&gt;, you'd best let the warrior take the heat.  When you are just xping on day-to-day stuff rangers do just fine.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh, and that goes for all the way up to level 60.  Heck, if you count weaponsheild, rangers are the best tanks in the game for 20 seconds at a time.</div></div><hr />

At 54 sometimes, but rarely, they ask me to tank, i just throw on all my AC gear and ask the cleric ot buff the bejesus out of me. WIth Flamelick and snare rangers can usually keep taunt pretty well ^_^</div></div><hr />

We can fill almost any role, and yes, we can tank.  Compared AC, HP, and ATK with a warrior of the same level recently, his HP were significantly higher, the cleric in the group had higher AC than him, almost as good as mine.<br />

<br />
A few weeks ago I was in velk in the pit with just myself and my cleric.  To single pull profet/champ, etc combos I would use root.  I tanked these mobs down for hours with just my cleric doing a CH.<br />
<br />
Just the other day Caio and his/her crew in the pits were asking for a tank.  They stated 59+ war was desired.  They said they'd take a SK or Pal if they could get and ench as well.  To this I recommended they take a ranger.  The response was that rangers can't tank.<br />
<br />
Funny though how I spent many hours in the pit with just myself and my cleric pulling all the mobs.  I did the named down there with myself, my cleric, and a 54 rogue.  When any mob chealed itself I just kept tanking.  My pulls were non-stop.  Some people will never learn.<br />
<br />
While I was trying to get my EQ and level my cleric to 60 I spent a great amount of time in SG.  No big deal there but I'd get bored every so often decide to go to WW and do the cragwurms.  Hehe, I tanked them down no problem even with them hittin for 245 a pop.<br />
<br />
I've tanked 6 spiders at one time in Velk.<br />
<br />
People say we can't tank.  They are full of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borzak</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well at 55 I do just fine tanking, sure a warrior that can hold aggro of the same lvl is better, BUT my guild has a shortage of warriors (ie like 2 and 1 is part time).<br />
<br />
So I get asked to tank a lot. From Ghetto stuff to the bigger stuff. Chardok I pull and tank, Just tanked in SG this week tyring to get BP gems, tanked in UP last week on yellow/red con mobs. I'm glad my guild decided we're not gonna sit around on our ass waiting on a warrior to log on.<br />
<br />
Lotta times I'm SA cause I can grab aggro fast like on kael raids and even plane raids at times. Doesn't seem to bother my guild at all that the CH isn't as effecient cause we just suck it up and get on with it.<br />
<br />
Now if we have a warrior I want him to tank, or we got a full blown mega mob sure go ahead mr. warrior. Exp grinds and small mini raids why not?<br />
<br />
BTW the class in my guild most like to ask me to tank? Cleric by far followed by our puller (monk) they say it makes things go faster.<br />

Too bad theres a cap on AC cause thats more AC than 90% of warriors will ever see.<br />
In a normal exp group any melee class can tank effectively if theres a high lvl shaman to slow.  I tanked Crypt in Seb with my 52 monk and did just fine and his gear was horrible.  We didn't even come close to dying.  Most fun group I was ever in was my 52 Monk, a 60 shaman, and a 60 ranger who was tanking.  We did BK, and 1/2 of the levi tunnel in Chardok like it was Orc 1.  We just had to time it right so we fought the named solo without any adds which didn't take long.</div></div><hr />

A rule of thumb i use is that if I can med back the mana I used for cheal by the time I need to cheal again it is efficient.  I can do that on single pulls with my ranger.<br />
<br />
On multiple pulls if I have 2 or so bub of mana left after defeating multiple mobs then cheal has been efficient.  If I can do pull singles for a while after that, which usually is no problem, I can regain mana to full.</div></div><hr />

We have the same defense cap as a warrior pre 50, and everyone wears rygorr and stuff anyways =P<br />
<br />
However, when it comes to the big stuff... dont even try it.  We can all hit the soft AC caps, but a warrior in best gear is going to have ~1300-1500 more HP than us, and 32 more points of defense, which seems to do a bit more than AC from armor.  Just a flurry drake in NTOV can knock off 3000 hp per round.</div></div><hr />

Last night I was squashed twice in a row by PoZ's in Kael. Both times took about 15-20 seconds to go down, no heals inc at all that I could tell. I don't think a plate tank would have lasted much longer, maybe another 15 seconds or so. He was doublng and tripling for 360 ish and FAST.</div></div><hr />

-Kaneras  lmao tell this to my guild. I have tanked PoZ and many others in kael. I refuse to tank Dlammawhatever his name it because he hits 500 quad. and vindi 700 quad is way to much for me. But PoZ are cake with out group we take to play in kael arena. If it can be slowed it can be tanked. Now Dlammawhatever was tanked by me for 45 seconds till the slow ran out after the MA got rampaged to death unslowed. The limit is unslowed 200,slowed 300 for me. However to do this we have a great team who have learned to take mobs that most don't try without the perfect setup.</div></div><hr />

Fortunately, I can gear up, and often my ac and hps are better or comparable to warriors, sks, pallies.  SK and Pallies, with nice gear, are great tanks, and then rangers.  It has a lot to do with skill.  And like many friends of mine say, I'm a better tank than most of the warriors on the server (warriors dislike being out taunted, btw).  In some respects, warriors are approaching obselescence.<br />
<br />
Root and proximity aggro.  I've met a ton of warriors who had no clue what proximity means.  Root = you can determine who tanks 100% of the time.<br />
Snaring and dotting (DoD or Immolate) also holds aggro better.<br />
I have a 29 point DS or more up.<br />
My attack is &gt; than warriors.<br />
Calefaction = good taunt sometimes as well.<br />
I can heal myself, regen.<br />
I can snare pull, root pull, use a nuke, use super range bow and arrows, or aggro pull.<br />
Taunt is broken in a few places.<br />
<br />
Gear is where warriors can catch hybrids.  They can get insane ac and hps, and then with a BoC or other super aggro weapon, they can tank well, but in many respects, their lack of rooting ability really removes their importance- conventions change.<br />
<br />
And also very important, a cleric/healer you trust (lots of ignorant  and or dogmatic people out there), and a shaman.  With slows on the mobs, we can tank anything extermely efficiently.  <br />

Well that's great and all, but getting a slow to stick on Lodi ain't so easy.  Who's gonna keep you alive until he's slowed?   He can kill you in the ten seconds it takes to cast CH.</div></div><hr />

You will desperately gather just enough people to kill Lodi with one group while you kite him around and all your buffs wear off.<br />
<br />
It's very possible your'e not a 60 ranger and even if you are you're disc was used up a 1/2 hour ago soloing in Velks.  so what you are is a 2200 hit point ranger coming back to your ragtag group with no buffs.  You will be praying that your pickup 55 warrior can taunt Lodizal onto him so you're not dead in the 7 seconds it takes Lodi to kill your overconfident ranger ass.   <br />
<br />
If  you're part of uber_guild_01 and you have a bunch of 60 clerics waiting to port to Iceclad to save your sorry ass then thats another story, but for the normal ranger in a small guild this is reality folks.  You try tanking Lodi under these conditions and you're dead.  <br />

Actually, a wizard can hold and maintain aggro if he spams his Staff of Temperate Flux enough.  I can't imagine a wizard wanting to do that in a practical situation, but it's possible. :P</div></div><hr />

When we pulled Phara Dar, we were very unprepared for her AE stun, having never faced it, and being that the pull was unintentional.  By some chance, myself, the cleric and druid in my group managed to stay unstunned early in the fight while most of the rest of the raid did not.  I knew I was going to get agro, told the group so, and the cleric and druid started healing me.  I tanked Phara Dar for 30 seconds with just those 2 healers healing me, and only died when the cleric did get stunned.<br />
<br />
For those that don't know, Phara hits for around 750.  My AC is ~1150, and I have ~4500 HP raid buffed, and check my sig, I'm only 58 so there was no weaponshield involved.  Like someone else said, given the right healing situation, and enough HP, anyone can tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HP doesn't help you tank better, just keeps you alive longer... it would be more efficient to tank stuff with 1200 and 2400 hp than it would be with 1000 ac and 3000 hp. The reason everyone says HP is king is cause they're fighting mobs that kill you quickly ;) HP also has an advantage with cheal.  If you're fighting mobs that don't kill you fast (typical exp blues, for example) and don't have a cleric around, it would be better to have ac first up until whatever the softcap is for what you're fighting.<br />
<br />
Phara Dar hits kinda slow if memory serves.. but she still hits for a hell of a lot =) AE hurts too... check  this (http://www.fallen.org/~frost/eq/tanking_phara.jpg) screenshot of my enc tanking phara after most everyone else died :p I just got really lucky heh, it made for a good screenshot though ;)<br />

<br />
Doesn't make a difference, the NET result is the same, and perhaps worse.  If I had more Hps, all that means is I wouldn't have to heal as much during a fight, but certainly would after a fight to replenish the higher amount.  Now if I had worse AC I would be taking even more damage.  <br />
<br />
My point is I read how soandso tanked this and that, but unless they are in uber gear I just don't experience the same thing.  I can tank low blues ok, and what I mean by tank is I can live long enough for CHs. But if I am solo, I just plum get the snot kicked out of me if I try to straight tank it.  And I can assure you that to the majority of rangers playing, my gear is better than most.</div></div><hr />

Now Dlammawhatever was tanked by me for 45 seconds till the slow ran out after the MA got rampaged to death unslowed. The limit is unslowed 200,slowed 300 for me.

Earthcaller sounds very much like the answer ;) Earthcaller slow is pretty huge, and would account for the difference there.<br />

I believe that its not just the ranger ability to tank but the all round effectiveness when a ranger is tanking.<br />
<br />
Go ask anyone on Zeb, that regularly hunts nids. If they have grouped with Tath or Etelos then ask them what they think of Rangers tanking.<br />
All the time, I join a group there and they are often worried about dying or trains or this or that. They tell me not to do this or not to hit that way, dont pull there. I have had one death, that was from a guy (tank hehe) zoning at the top and dying outside.<br />
Me and another ranger together can solo those nids without a problem and without stopping. I have found similar results on just about everything I have hunted.<br />
<br />
I agree a warrior has more HP and in the plains Im sure they are better, but Im 45 now and have yet to notice any real difference. Not when you consider everything we can do while tanking, rather than just hack and slash.<br />
<br />
I would rather go side by side with another ranger or a druid than a warrior/sk/paladin any day.</div></div><hr />

I've done this and it worked ok. <br />
<br />
Something like Lodizal, who hits for 250 is just too hard. He takes me down to about 30% life in what seems like seconds. <br />
<br />
Also mobs like Troopers and Lego's in Keal are just outside of a Ranger's tanking ability too. <br />
<br />
-Kaneras<br />
<br />
Lodizial is a piece of cake. I;ve tanked that turtle several times. Last time was just myself, a cleric, a druid, and another melee (can't remeber what that was). I tanked from start to finish, and I was the one who slowed it also with Earthcaller, as is the case with most mobs (they get slowed by rangers before the shaman slows hit). ALso, I find that Lodizial misses me very often copmpared to a lot of other mobs. I have only had to engage Weaponshield once during a Lod fight, and that was because the cleric was still running from portal to the gnoll camp.<br />
<br />
I've tanked HoT. Don't like to do it on the red and white wurms (especially since the recent upgrades on them), because they really tear down the ranger HPs and therefore require closer attention by the clerics.<br />
<br />
As a Ranger you will find that we are often the last tank standing and will often tank the last 20-40 seconds to kill a mob (even some of the very nasty ones). I've tanked the last 30 seconds of Velketor and Vindi, 15 of that is obviously WS, part is rune if it's still alive, and the rest is healers working their damndest to keep you alive :) Of course this doesn't mean we can tank a Velk/Vindi or higher mob from start to finish, we can't. But with careful use of WS and the right timing on CHs, we are able to either do the last bit to kill a mob, or we are able to hold that mob long enough for the debuffing and slows to hit so that a Warrior can take over.<br />
<br />
As for the Troopers, most 60 Rangers can solo them, not sure how you are equipped or what level you are.<br />
<br />
Rangers tank more often than most people think. We do it out of neccessity, not due to plan. If there is a suitably equipped Warrior of the right level, you won't see any Ranger stepping forward to claim they should be tanking. But, if there is no Warrior about, then hey, look out Lodizial, Servitor of Luclin, and other big mobs, a Ranger won't shy away from a good fight :)<br />

Must disagree. With Epics, Call of Fire, initial snare, possibly Lurid Dagger, standing close, and being first to hit, there is hardly anything that will then take the aggro from a Ranger. Unless there is a Paladin stunning or Warrior heavily taunting, that aggro will stay on the Ranger, but then again, if those 2 classes are there, they should be tanking anyways.<br />
<br />
As far as exp groups are concerned, a Ranger will tank just as effectively (if not more) than any other class.<br />

Must disagree again :) I tank often enough, but believe me, a slowed Rumble Crush, Klandicar, or other mob, will chew us Rangers up fairly quickly. For many of those mobs it's hard enough for a Warrior to survive when the mobs are slowed.<br />
