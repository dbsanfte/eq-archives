<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Souldreamer Bearspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've noticed lately that my kitty rogue seems naked minus the look of black plate boots.  However, at the character selection screen you can also see silver plated leggings too.<br />
<br />
I assumed it was a *.ini problem so I competely started over, making sure that everything was turned on that was suppose to be and that everythign that shouldn't be on, wasn't.<br />
<br />
All luclin models on, loadveliouswithluclin off, load velious armor on.<br />
<br />
No matter what I do, I look naked.  The weird part is, I look naked to everyone else too.  I couldn't figure out why everyone kept inspecting me and I finally asked and they said cause you look naked, but have equipment.<br />
<br />
So, I thought maybe it was the mode that I had picked so I tried to change my face.  This is the weird part.  I could change my face features, but the body to go along with it, didn't change.<br />
<br />
So, I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else.  To mean, it sounds like my character has become corrupt and I'll probably need to petition but wanted to ask first.<br />
<br />
Yes, I posted this at the safehouse too, but figured this was a good community to ask too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krizaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You might want to try turning off Load Velious Armors too...<br />
<br />
A guildmate of mine was having the same problems and turned off all of the Velious armor options and it fixed it for him :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you set the LoadVeliousArmorWithLuclin=TRUE, then characters using new models (including Vah Shir) will sometimes appear to have no armor. <br />
<br />
I'm using new models for my main (barbarian), and when I equipped my Rune Crafter's arms I had bare arms except a little piece of gold scale on each shoulder. But my Rune Etched arms appeared just fine. Once I turned that option back to FALSE, then I could see all the armor again.<br />
<br />
Typical, they give new models for all the races but apparently didnt code the Velious armor graphics onto the new models. That's why LoadVeliousArmorWithLuclin is set to FALSE by default when you load Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Souldreamer Bearspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I fixed the problem thanks to Krizaani.<br />
<br />
Turning off all velious armor (17-2something) made it so that my kitty rogue had armor.  Of course, I now I see everyone else in old armor rather then the new stuff.<br />
<br />
Kinda sucky if you ask me.</div></div><hr />
