<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SnowwyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi i was Recently Leveling in Eastern Wastes and Found The Coldain dwarfs are excellent XP. There are 3 camps which are easy to chain ( really Helps to have a kei here).<br />
<br />
the First Camp is to the Imidiate Left of the Giant Fort. There are 4 Dwarves to pull here. Have a root Spell, malise, 2 Dots and your Posion based DD up (Shock of the Tainted). Around the Fire there Should be a Cook and Warrior, In the hut to the right are 2 Hunters. First cast root and Root the warrior thats around the Fire,The Cook and 1 Hunter should come running, Root the Cook, Then the hunter, Dot the hunter and Warrior (The cook is Has Signifgently More hp Than the other 2) Rinse and Repeat till The Hunter and Warrior Fall. Now time for the Cook Root and DoT  agian Till he Falls. Next there is one more Hunter, Invis and target him, Then Pull him through the Hut wall away from the other dwarves,  Dot and Root once again He should fall quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now Invis up, The next camp can be Reached if you run along the Cliff edge overlooking the water, its a Short Trip. Once your There if you have Kei you should have enough mana to do it without medding, if not take a Medd Break to Full just to be safe.<br />
<br />
Now theres 3 Dwarves around the fire, Root the warrior closest to you. A cook and a Warrior Should come running, Root Them both, DoT The 2 warriors Rinse and repeat till there dead, The Cook once again will be alittle Tougher. Next in the Hut to the left there will be one Hunter, Root and DoT once again. The Hut to the Right AVOID, Theres a Caster and a Named in there, They equal a Quick death =/.<br />
<br />
The next camp is Out and to the right of the Ry'gorr Fort, Only 2 Dwarves to kill, There will be a Lookout at the back of the camp. Root him, an Injured warrior should come after you root him and DoT, He has very little hp, When hes dead, Start on the lookout same Story very little hps.<br />
<br />
By the time your done with the last 2 camps, The first will have repoped. Note: The dwarves should drop Coldain heads sometimes, Once Doubious to the Giants these can be handed to Captain Bvellos in the bank area, You get a large Faction boost some pp and Lots of xp.<br />
<br />
