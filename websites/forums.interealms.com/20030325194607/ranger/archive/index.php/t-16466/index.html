<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roark of Luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to find the maximum non-critical dmg I should be able to hit for with Swiftwind at level 63.<br />
<br />
I am looking for the 'equation'  to help compute this number.<br />
<br />
Possible relevant info:<br />
<br />
Main Hand:  Ancient Prismatic Stilleto (piercing capped at 240)<br />
Off Hand:  Swiftwind (max 1hs of course)<br />
Melee stats capped at 270 currently<br />
Attack Rating w/ Avatar proc and w/o GoF of 1,552 approx.<br />
<br />
I have just recently started using the stilleto (instead of Earthcaller) for melee and and now able to differentiate between my primary and offhand dmg.  Max hit I have been able to discern on the Stilleto is 88 (non-critical) atm.<br />
<br />
Your help and insight is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Hey bud. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arynduil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am about 100% sure that ATK has no bearing on your max hit. At 60 using Earthcaller, my max noncrit hit is 91. Always 91. 91, regardless of my ATK number.<br />
<br />
ATK, in my experience, affects your hit percentage and pushes your hits higher in your damage scale.<br />
<br />
Arynduil, sig currently broken</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Attk has everything to do with your max hit.  I remember back in DL when I had 950 attack (with a 2hs) I would hit max for 124 EVERY time....nothing ever went higher.  As soon as I got a big attack buff (not str) I would hit for up to 134.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naomiy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here is the formula as I understand it for max possible damage:<br />
<br />
main hand:<br />
(Weapon damage * modifier) + damage bonus<br />
<br />
offhand:<br />
(weapon damage * modifier)<br />
<br />
The modifier goes up with level. not sure where, or why, but I do know it goes up at level 60. At level 60 the modifier is ~ 5.7; at 59 it is ~ 5.4. And Ive heard that at 65 it is ~ 5.9.<br />
<br />
We can figure out your modifier because we know your max damage (88), your weapon damage (13), and your damage bonus (12)<br />
<br />
(13 * x) +12 = 88<br />
x = ~ 5.84<br />
<br />
This is only conjecture, but the way Ive seen damage, it seems to me that the weapon damage is like a die roll. You roll 1 - 13 on a die, and then multiply it by your modifier which ranges from 1 - 5.84. The modifier I presume is where your attack and the mob's AC is calculated, among other things. Then you add your damage bonus at the end.<br />
<br />
So your minimum damage will be 13 (1*1 + 12) and your max will be 88 (13*5.84 + 12)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :)</div></div><hr />
