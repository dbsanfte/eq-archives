<br />
I have 1902 hp unbuffed. <br />
<br />
I have 210 wisdom plus 520 mana from items.<br />
<br />
<br />
The highest my hitpoints have ever been is 4028, with virtue, all my own buffs and and a few other buffs from pally etc.<br />
<br />
Is this typical? I do not mean, is it typical for shaman in guilds that do elemental planes or plane of time. I have been unguilded most of my life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">6450ish hps with 9/kazad (6302 raid buffed with virtue), 337 wis with C5 and 1402 AC raid buffed.<br />
<br />
Previous to pop I really never cared what my mana pool was, I just focused on getting as many hps as possible whilst keeping my AC fairly decently.  Now with pop and less efficient more mana hungry spells our mana pool actually means quite a lot though, I always aimed for a mana pool of at least 3500mana but I never really cared about my wis as long as it was 200 or more.<br />
<br />
*edit* I'll add, 1928 hps unbuffed strikes me as a little low, its worthwhile going for more if you can, you'd be suprised how easy it can be to get nice hp tally bumps, and a good amount of hps makes like so much easier, I ended up playing a friends shaman bot ages ago to get them flagged as the raid was pretty much full already, and going from Seb's gear to a modestly equiped buff bot was horrific =)<br />
<br />
As my gear shows I'm pretty much a Luclin era shaman =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, I am in a guild that does not raid hard stuff, we occasionally raid with other guilds. We do not have elemental or time armor (Talking no drop gear, droppable has nothing to do with the level of the guild), we do not even have luclin armor or weapons, we do have some velious gear. totally unbuffed I can cast canni 5 and wind up at 22% health(2309 HPS unbuffed) self buffed, 40% or so(3150 with focus of soul and boar), raid buffed, almost 60%(almost 5200 HPs). Nicest gear I own is my vindi breast plate, wolfcaller arms, 1 wolf caller bracer, thurg boots, all of which, except maybe the vindi, is 1 groupable. I would suggest getting some friends together and working on some of this level gear to at least get you moved to the point where you can stay abive 20% health with no buffs, then go from there.<br />
<br />
NOTE: will have to log on to check stats like wis etc, think wis is 195 or so, ac 1050, unbuffed HPs over 2300 ( missing some of the corect items, did not realise I was so far behind)</div></div><hr />

Yowch, 1902?. Your gear looks like it must be pretty poor, I must have had about 2.4k back then, and I was unguilded =/.<br />
<br />
I'd decrease the wisdom (which isn't really even that high), and land on the hps... somehow<br />

I'm 3030hp, 234wis at 65, guild only really Velious/SSra standard<br />

EDIT: ok, found your magelo. I'd replace your back, waste, boots, ARMS, mask, ASAP, look round the equipment forum for advice.</div></div><hr />

Not in a raiding guild myself, but i will be at or above 3k hp unbuffed when i finish off nd3(1200ac with virtue/self buffs), and my wisdom is capped(although i do not have innate enlightenment or planar power, seemed a waste with so much else to put aa's into still)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">looking at your gear, i'd start swapping out for some hp/mana items, valiorum rings of gallantry would start nice.  I know the huge debate on LDoN, but until recently I was dirt poor, and being non-guilded has helped me out alot, aslo get to 65 get canni V then ND3.<br />
<br />
hit up mistmoore if you want quick improvements only 442 pts and you have a set of armor equivalent to tae ew.  Augment it and voila you'll be close to 3k unbuffed in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I will agree, your HP seems to be a little on the low side for a raiding shaman.  Your AC might be a touch low too.<br />
<br />
My HP at 52 is 1870 with bazaar purchased equipment.  No raiding here.<br />
<br />
I have a lot of room to grow with just droppable gear too.<br />
<br />
I will say that I find that I'm better equiped than most players I meet in the game my level so I may be a little obsessive about equipment and making the plat to afford it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 54 I have 1780HP and about 960 AC, so I have a little work to do.  I used to have about 235 WIS, but only 1200HP and after I switched my WIS gear with HP gear, I found I was able to stay high on mana much much longer than with just the large mana pool.  Only have about 180 WIS now, but I'm happy. :) So, go ahead and switch some gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">~3300 hp unbuffed, 1150 ac, ft 9, and 280 wis (276 if I use my nukestick instead of prismatic/epic).<br />
<br />
I've been at 280 wis for a long time.  I didn't really seek out wis gear, mostly hp oriented gear...my wis just ended up getting that high as a side effect.  At one point, I would have had 300 unbuffed wis if I had those silly enlightenment and planar power AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My wisdom is around 220 or perhaps a bit more now.  I’ve won several rolls on augmentations in LDoN adventures and the only ones that seem to drop in my groups are wisdom and agility.  As far as hit points go, I don’t remember just off hand, but I’m close to getting canni 5, 3 AAs away now, and I’m fairly sure that if I cast it on myself unbuffed I’d find myself at my bind spot.  <br />
<br />
I have worked hard to buy the best armor my poor anemic bank account can afford.  My best equipment is my Tae Ew chest, legs and shield.  And the reason I have those is my small guild camped the entrance to Cazic Thule for the blood and I was able to tip a GM smith for the combines.  There’s no way I would have ever been able to afford buying it in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
I’ve been dropping my AC in order to get more hit points, which has made a significant difference, in both my AC and my hit points.  But I just can’t afford the expensive gear.  And now that the core members of my small guild have quit the game it looks like this is as good as it gets for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">From looking at a lot of magelos, I think its quite typical for your level and unguilded.  We have a lot of 65 shaman in my guild now and I think most of their hp are anywhere from 1900-2200 with only a couple of exceptions.  Like the others think though, you can do better, you should probably start focusing more on HP/sta as soon as you can.  There is a lot of purchasable/tradable gear now that could probably get you to 2500 relatively easily, but its going to take a little time, it wont happen overnight.<br />
<br />
You are pretty close to where I was about a year ago when I returned to the game after missing the Luclin expansion.  In a tad over a year, through raiding mostly small targets (2-3groups), purchasing and AA's (non elemental), Ive managed to get 3200 unbuffed hp, 4k mana pool, 1k ac and just recently my wis passed my stamina and this is with my shaman now considered my alt, meaning I focus most of my cash/merit on my other character.</div></div><hr />

In the past 3 months (since I came back to EQ) my Wis has shot up from 160 to over 220 with no effort on my part.  Just a side result of my new gear.<br />
<br />
Currently unguilded, everything I have is from Droga-type places or the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

My Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=477090)<br />
<br />
Anyway, you can see my HP, AC and WIS there., although I have a few droppable augs from LDoN that have raised my HP over 2500 and my WIS to 251 all unbuffed.<br />
<br />
My wis is a little high and I want to get unbuffed HPs to 3k and AC to 1100 with LDoN stuff mixed in with a couple ornate pieces I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
My buffed (VoQ+Bearform) wisdom is capped at 325 right now w/ Planar Power 5 &amp; Innate Enlightenment 2.  I'd have to look to see what it is without buffs.  (Magelo isn't showing +wis augments, &amp; I don't recall how many I have.).<br />
<br />
I haven't actively sought wisdom gear (other than putting my name in on +wis augment rolls) in a very long time, but it has been creeping up nonetheless as I make gear improvements to get focus effects or extra hitpoints.  I'm at just over 3500 hp unbuffed, and my goal at your level was to first get to 2500hp and then later to 3k unbuffed.  My goal now is to get focus effects, then I'll be pushing for 4k unbuffed hp.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

As I distinctively remembering, I had horror able time getting resists on the slow.  If I put item that let my wisdom 205+ then the slow stuck extremely well.  If I was below 205 wisdom, I had severe resists on slow.  Tested on 10+ mobs in UP while playing my level 60 shaman way back then.  Not enough to prove anything but...<br />
<br />
I believe wisdom seems to play some roll on resists.  or it may have been mentioned somewhere as a fact.<br />

<br />
I'm 65, and I think I carry 261 now, which is nothing spectacular, but KEI/VoQ maxes it to 280 (no Planar Power AAs so far) and I can swap one piece of gear and put on bearform if I want 280 for tradeskills.</div></div><hr />

Spend some money or hunt for particular upgrades. Your back, belt, feet, arms, face and ranger are a little weak imho.  You should be able to hunt or buy kylong darkmail, hiero cloak, iksar hide cloak, cloak of pernicity, cloak of the wise, feathered cloak of the lost, hardened grey flesh sleeves, night terror chain sleeves, death mask of the elysians, crystal spider eyes, barbed rubi bracer, wicked bone atlatl, and on and on.  You know the drill, set up your price, choose your slot, use HP as the Stat, and click search in the baz... find some stuff whether you end up buying it or camping it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1902 seems a tidbit on the low side to me, especially when working on Canni5, but the real measuring stick is a simple one: Do you die a lot? If you can get aggro and automatically keel over, then your HP is working well for you. Work on upgrades, of course, but don't stress out about keeping up with the joneses if it ends up not being all that important.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd much rather have a fun item like the JBB or Spear of Constriction over something with a bazillion HP that won't keep me alive anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Well, one of the problems is that I spent all my mone on Malo and Torpor. But now that I have them and most of my 61 and a handful of my 62 spells I can maybe save up for upgrades.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">You did the right thing, getting torpor and malo first. Torpor + Malo &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gear. That being said, once you start getting your cash flow, you can get upgrades that will carry you to around 2400ish hp from the bazaar and/or hunting for the items. You could get considerably higher, I'm sure, but those high-end droppable hp items are costly. While you will want to keep wisdom in mind, naturally, as someone else mentioned, you should probably search for items based on their hp value. I got by without 200+ wis for most of my levels. It wasn't until recently that I started overflowing on wisdom. As long as you have enough mana to deal with a handful of mobs (a few adds if they show up), you will be fine. Super high wisdom isn't that high a priority since we have the canni line. Just find a balance that works for you. It may take a while, but you will. :)</div></div><hr />
