<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">okay I just dinged 64, and I have a pathetic amount of my 63-64 spells... 2 I believe, one of which I know is Petrifying Earth - the levle 64 spell we can get from EP's. So basically I need some serious SPage. I have about 5K in the bank, so buying any of those spells is quite unlikey.<br />
<br />
I have my BoT key, but no flags for HoH or such. I can probably do the key quests if necessary.<br />
<br />
Where have you had best luck with Specral Parchments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tactics pit.  In the space of about 2 weeks, I got all my 63-64 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">great, thanks... Allakhazam doesn't contain the info for the secondary quest for Tactics access. Is there a quest for it? If so could you provide a link or some information as to where I should start the quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is no secondary quest. You have to kill the Maenatic Behemoth (sp?) to gain access.<br />
<br />
If you don't have access to Tactics, BoT or HoH are your other options, although neither are as good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Um yes there is a secondary quest!  Kill Diaku raiders that spawn in PoS desert area.  They are an uncommon spawn, tracker helps a lot.  Hell I'll just link the quest:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ooh! I was doing that quest before with guildies and they never told me exactly what it was for. I think I have a few talisman pieces</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yup, Tactics.<br />
<br />
Alt key quest is not too hard, just hunt diaku in storms until you get all 4 medallion parts, then you can do the turn in and key your whole group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">question: are there 4 unique medallion pieces, that identify differently? or do I just need 4 of the same kind period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They are all different when identified and dropped randomly off any diaku. Just have the same person keep looting until they have 4.  They won't be able to loot dupes.</div></div><hr />

Each alt quest flags an entire group now instead of a single person.  I know (I personally was in a group that did it) that the Tactics flag can be MQ'd so you might ask around a bit to find out who in your guild has any pieces and maybe between 2 or 3 of you you already have a whole set.  The person who turns in the final item gets the flag item but each member in the group gets access to the zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think this is a scam.  I don't personally know if they are on the same table or not, but I know that attacking them is the fastest way of getting killed in PoS.  EVERYTHING in sight assists rock storms and they hit and stun for a LOT.  If you want a horde of scorpions and cacti down on yer butt, go ahead and do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Unfortunately last time I went after diaku in PoS, everything assisted them too =)<br />
<br />
This may have been fixed now though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">All of the desert mobs assist each other, so if you are smart, you won't be fighting them in the middle of the desert. There are four specific spawn locations in the northwest area of the desert for the Diaku Raiders, and their placeholders are rock storms. So yes, you have to kill the rocks to get the raiders to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lorelan Frostwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yar, run over by the giant tents.  They should be on your right when your backs to the wall (I forget if that's North or South of the tents).  Kill all rock storms in the area.  Send your pet GAR out to find more rock storms.  You'll start getting Daiku Raider pops all around you.  There are 3 spawn locations right near each other in that spot.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The rock storms can be annoying (some nuke extremely hard) and they also seem to have annoying friends (namely: everything) but they are killable and they are not  especially difficult if you use appropriate tactics.  For a group, its easy as pie.  For a duo its, very doable.   By yourself... hmm, I would have to say maybe not.  Or at least not quickly enough to make it worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">a rock storm (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10350) can nuke up to 3000 with Shock of Magic (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3191&amp;source=Live) - not safe to solo. I wonder though why a 58 mob can cast a 65 spell.</div></div><hr />

Yes.<br />
<br />
I posted some information on Tactics in the 60-65 forum.  If you want to search through there and bump the thread, I'll reply with some amplifying information if you have any questions.<br />
<br />
I was soloing there today.  It wasn't easy, death is usually just ONE resist away if you aren't extremely careful, but it is exciting.<br />
<br />
I much prefer duoing there with a paladin.  Did it with an SK today, and it was nowhere near as safe (for me, he was fine w/ FD) but it was workable.  =)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Heh, it's not a scam, rock storms are PHers for diakus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Why bother with alt-quest entry, if they are going to open up the Tier2 stuff for free? Assuming this does happen as proposed.<br />
<br />
As to the spectral equation...kill the nameds in PoN for them. Spider, gator, shade. You can suplement your bankroll as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I understand, they are not going to open up Tactics, so doing this alt entry quest is a good idea if your guild is not able to kill Behemoth.<br />
<br />
Aislyth, Prophet<br />
Silver Daggers<br />
Karana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yes they wont be opening up Tactics.<br />
<br />
Tactics pit is the best place for spectrals, followed by BoT at a distant distant second place.  Getting flagged for tactics should be your top priority, as groupage there can really rock both loot, spells, and exp-wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The rocks are placeholders for the Raiders.  Everything that isnt a giant assists each other, including the raiders (raiders, giants, and the giant frogs are the only thing I remember being kos in storms though).<br />
<br />
We've xp'd in the pit 3 times, and managed 1 spec every time.  I cant imagine solo'ing in the pit.  My hats off to you if you do it.  There doesnt seem to be a truly safe place in the pit, although we havent tried everywhere in there yet.  With the stampede, and the wandering ogre, the doorway isnt safe at all either.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of the time we've been in hoh, we just sort of wandered around killing.  One night, after our cleric rezzed some solo'ing enchanter, he showed us a spot fairly deep in zone where he solo's.  Room with about 6 mobs in it.  5 were not kos, and didnt give a faction message when killed.  The 6th was kos, and dropped a spectral.  Might have been random chance, but I think when we get tired of tactics we'll probably try that room again and see how our luck holds out.<br />
<br />
I think we've gotten 1 spectral in BoT off random mobs, never killed any of the named stuff though.  And we usually dont go to bot often, way to crowded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Rock storms - I'd thought it was the manaburn message I'd gotten when one fried me to death.  After all, the damage it'd reported me taking was exactly enough to kill me, though I'm not often nuked to death, so maybe it always shows up that way.<br />
<br />
They're pretty easy if you partner with a mage, and pet tank, esp with spirit call.  Kinda chumpy, actually, if they're not nuking you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">okay I have gotten my alternate PoTactics access, but have come into another problem. Only a handful of my guild is flagged for the zone, and getting all the classes together to make a group for the zone would be nothing short of a miracle. As you know, this zone isn't exactly &quot;jam packed&quot; all the time, and its not like I can say &quot;64 shaman lfg&quot; and get a group there - in fact most of the time its empty. Its a BYOG zone.<br />
<br />
So my question is, are any of the spectral droppers soloable by us, through root rotting or any other tactic? I have torpor, malo, no BoUltor though.<br />
<br />
Or is that impossible and I need to forma  group to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Root/Rot is possible, but without Ultor/Blood I'd imagine it'd take quite a while to kill them, during which time you greatly increase the risk of a wanderer.  There are no truly safe spots in tactics pit, so solo is risky.  The zone out in the pit is horrid for wanderers pathing too close, but either corner along the wall from there is &quot;ok&quot; and not too far to run to the ZO if ya have to. <br />
<br />
I'd recommmend finding a druid or necro to duo down there, if you can keep them snared a broken root is easily recovered and you can probably handle 2-3 at a time if necessary when wanderers get too close.</div></div><hr />
