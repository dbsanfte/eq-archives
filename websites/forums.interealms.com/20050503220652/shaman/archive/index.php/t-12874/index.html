<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First Introductions:<br />
<br />
Lvl 65 Wizard.  I have played EQ just over 3 years.  Never really known much about the Shaman class.  Really only knew that you need them for slowing, buffing, and that wonderful Malo spell.<br />
<br />
My beef..........<br />
<br />
I like many others, decided to start a Froglak character.  Not knowing much about the Shaman class, I decided to check it out.  Now, 44 levels later my issue is that class is so damn fun that it is taking to much time away from my wizard.<br />
<br />
Honestly, it's a blast.  Just got my lvl 44 pet and he is amazing.  I love the whole root/rot concept and actually being able to take a hit is great. It's a ton of fun, getting up in the mob's faces and tanking it.  Simply a blast!<br />
<br />
So to all you Shamans that I have grouped with and never really appreciated, my hats off to you.</div></div><hr />

ROFLMAO! and i know i'm gonna get flamed for brining up a 7month old thread, but it was in &quot;Other related threads&quot; and had to post  :D <br />
/em cringes as random objects fly over his head.<br />
<br />
Hail, Shaman! i have LOADS of alts running around alot of servers, and at least on of those is a Shaman. i have never played a class that is more fun and exciting than Shaman. we can do almost everything that isn't utility. by that i mean rezz, CC, snare, heal as good as other classes(but still kick arse). but we can do ALOT of stuff in-battle OVER AND OVER again with Canni. and i agree with Final. bats+bears=horrible results...for their side i mean. they ARE going against 3k+ lvl 65 Shamans if they do  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Holy Hell penny that would drive me nuts too. I'd help ya out if i were on that server so you could save 50k =( .</div></div><hr />

<br />
What in the world are you going to get out of having completed a trial that is worth 50k?<br />
<br />
If you're L 55(?) you can get into the zones that a trial would open up for you. Is the miniscule bonus on your charm worth 50k to you? Why bother? By the time you actually need the flag for advancement purposes, you ought to have friends or guildmates who can blow through the trial of execution in their sleep. If you don't, you probably don't need the flag - at least you don't need it 50k pp bad. If you're not 65 I DEFINITELY wouldn't bother. Just spend that 10 hours a day for two weeks getting vast numbers of levels or AA's instead.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My only problem with the Shaman class is the choice of races.<br />
<br />
Before PoP (And I do not hate PoP, to get that out beforehand) you had to make a big decision.  If you wanted the benefits of being evil, you paid for it.  Sometimes hard.  And at best, you had to do a lot of faction work.<br />
<br />
Barbarians did not have as many benefits, but you were welcome almost everywhere, and had the highest wisdom.  Iksar came out,  but it was okay, they were even more hated then trolls and ogres.  <br />
<br />
But aside from that, i enjoy being a shaman a lot.  We rule!<br />
<br />
Er... I mean, we suck!  We need upgrades!  What everyone else said! Give us stuff!  :D<br />

<br />
as i said above, i'm sorry for digging up this thread, but i saw it after posting under other related threads and had to post  :rolleyes: . if anyone's to blame for ressurecting it, i take all that blame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sajem, I was referring to Kriel's post, where (s)he was asking why PennyAntics would pay 50k to get through PoJ trials, who posted on 4/22/03--before 2nd tier planes were opened to all.<br />
<br />
While some consider dragging up a half-year old post a breach of forum etiquette, I am not so petty. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Whoops bet you dont need the help anymore penny lol. I dont think i ever read this thread when it was active. But didnt seem to make sense from other posts ive read thought i was losing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now he's fun because it's great to see a huge chunk of the mob's health disappear instantaneously-- you don't get to see much of that as a shaman... and the porting is really really convenient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've got a 63 wizard and a 62 shaman (would be 65 but hanging out waiting on friends).<br />
<br />
Do NOT quit your wizard.  As with all classes, you will go through times when you are weak, but one big advantage of a wizard is the fact that more wizards are never redundant on a raid.  And you get to take chunks out of things at high levels, too.  Besides, when you want to group with friends and THEY have a shaman, its always nice to have a different character to bring along.</div></div><hr />
