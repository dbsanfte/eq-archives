<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to let you guys know, I discovered an unintentional bug with the way pets worked... when I discovered the dogs wielding weapons thing I made sure to keep it quiet because you told me to and it really wasn't an exploit or anything (but now everyone knows it anyway), but this new bug is clearly an unintended thing that could maybe be considered an exploit.<br />
<br />
This works only if you have a pet up already.  Use Spirit Call and then click on your reclaim item 3-4 times, and you get mana for each dog.<br />
<br />
This isn't an attempt to nerf us or get people to exploit a lot, I just thought it was a neat &quot;feature&quot; and I like exploring the game's finer details and finding out unintentional bugs-- I'm a beta-tester at heart :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Boy, makes that extra cple of dogs look more worthwhile now!<br />
<br />
Imagine what the mages can do with their 9 pets!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mages get a form of spirit call?<br />
<br />
Hmm, do you get a full true spirit mana cast back for each spirit dog you reclaim?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">whoa . . . so question, what mana reclaim items are there for shamans?  I so wanna give it a try before they bring the servers down for an emergency nerf . . . erm patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL viscerator!  That's the best avatar one-liner I've seen yet!  Bearclub indeed hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh and mages already can get mana back for desummoning their epic pet, which casts for no mana.  Hmm.  Seems like 9 pets would fill up ye olde mana bar pretty nicely.  Canni for mages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Landragon do the shovel of Ponz quest--you can activate it from inventory.<br />

regards,<br />
Konarg<br />
<br />
great for dueling bards when they just KNOW they've seived all your mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was under the impression that mage epic only has a single charge?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">until they summon a new one using the spell.  There's a refresh time on the epic spell tho.  Like 3 minutes I think.<br />
<br />
Shovel of Ponz . . . interesting i'll check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">mana reclaim for shaman item - more info please.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I thought the epic spell was like 500 mana or something, so unless the pet gave back more mana, it's kinda pointless.<br />
<br />
If it does work, mages will get some use out of their 18 reclaim energy items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A Ruby--can be purchased from jewelry shops <br />
<br />
The Eyes of a Gargoyle--found in Mistmoore or Ocena of Tears (only need one) <br />
<br />
A Shovel--from a Magician in Najena or Alligator in Cazic <br />
<br />
Toes of a Hill Giant--from Eastern, Northern, or Western Karana, Rathe Mountains, or West Commanlands When you goto the Temple of Solusek Ro you will need to talk to Vira, she is a short Gnome on the left side of the balcony in the main room. Hail her and follow the prompts till she tells you the four items she needs for the quest you are doing. Give her the four items all at once in the order she asks for them. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST INDIFFRENT TO HER. She will give you faction, Experience, and the item you were questing for. Good Luck !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tulson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So if recliam works on DogDog x 3, what about the Suspend AA?<br />
<br />
Anyone have both?  <br />
<br />
I wonder if the Suspend AA would reset the timer on Dogs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This doesn't work.  My Torch of Alna doesn't reclaim them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Helm of Ridossan from the Mugglewump in the Warrens is clickable from inventory and should be easier to get than the quested shovel of ponz. <br />
<br />
I get about 9% of my mana bar back when I send Scooby home.  Useful if he's just about to die and I need a quick boost and definately better than nothing when I zone.<br />
<br />
Any Shaman who can summon a pet should be able to own the Warrens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As of the Jan/15/03 patch, this item is also no longer clickable from inventory. <br />
<br />
Checked it today, but it doesn't function from inventory for a Shaman any longer. apparently someone at VI really didn't like the idea of a reclaim energy clicky being available for class/race combinations that were not intended to use it.<br />
<br />
The Torch of Alna, Shovel of Ponz, Broom of Trilon, Stein of Ulissa, and all the other clickable reclaim energy items no longer seem to function from inventory.<br />
