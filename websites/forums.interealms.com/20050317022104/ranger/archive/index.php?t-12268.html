<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Severance</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having just checked my pre-order of PoP with Amazon, I found a delivery date of december the 2nd. . . . not good.<br />
I then phoned two EB stores (GAME over here) and the first one mentioned PoP being released in oct 2003 ! and the second store said 22 November this year . . that's whole  month after the US. I thought that the distributors had sorted out the whole issue of release dates being universal, but obviously not.<br />
Anyways, mini rant over hehe<br />
*hugs*</div></div><hr />

Be careful if you are buying in Europe that you are buying the current version and not the Ubisoft (I believe?) servers which which will be for localized play.</div></div><hr />

Sadly ordering from Vernat shipping says leave 4-6 weeks notice. Luckily for me i have kind souls in my guild willing to mail me a copy from across the pond...so hopefully I'll see it in the lot too distant future.<br />

It's one thing to be continually screwed on our play time by the way they patch in PST but this exclusion of our right to enjoy a game at the same tie as our friends Stateside is one could say Xenaphobic bias.<br />
