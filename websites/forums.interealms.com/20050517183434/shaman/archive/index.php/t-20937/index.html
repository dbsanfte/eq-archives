<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just one more in a series of what seems to be endless &quot;!@#$ this @#!$ I'm retiring my shaman&quot; posts.  Brunook, as of yesterday is officially on retirement.  I rolled up a warrior alt today in the hopes of playing a class that is actually *gasp* needed in EQ, but I already feel the magik is lost.  Most likely gonna cancel the old account.  Anyway, thanks for all the great advice along the way guys.  I wouldn't have been half the shaman I was if it wasn't for the help here on the crucible.</div></div><hr />
