<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone noticed anything funny going on?<br />
<br />
We were clearing fennin script tonight, I was patch healing after slow and was getting a lot of daluda in the 4100-4400 range, but with 25% heal focus and max heal aa(aha3 ahg3) my max crit heal should cap at 4075 (pre patch). My non crit healing didnt seem to be breaking 2232 (same as pre-patch.)<br />
<br />
I asked a few clerics/druids and they were not getting higher crits.<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice anything or was I just somehow delightfully bugged? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">maybe the crits double the improved healing amount also now?</div></div><hr />

Did you just hear that loud whooshing sound? That was my point flying right over your head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Same here... I have been getting over 5k crits tonight. Did they lift a cap or did they just break something I wonder.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I saw a cleric crit for over 29k tonight during an MB raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Garreth Lawbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">5032 heal with Qvic arms/daluda/max heal AA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>CollectraBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Definetly a welcome change, too bad it only seems to affect crit heals.   Now crits seem to range from like 3700 to 5033.  Now where are those per-tick crits for heal over time spells? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">5022 was my high crit heal, although I had some single targets that could have gone higher if they critted.<br />
<br />
One wonders how things will change tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">5084 here<br />
<br />
max cleric i saw was 34440</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It seems that crits can triple the base heal and then some (along with AHA) with.  I critted 4991 as the highest tonight.  I saw druids crit heal for 6730.<br />
<br />
Most of the changes they made in the patch don't seem to deal with AA abilities, so is this a future change that went live unintendedly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mikar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It seems they made both the AH and the IH parts of the heal double from the crit - where they used not to.<br />
<br />
Before June 14th patch:<br />
1550 * (2 (crit) + 0.19 (aa) + 0.45 (item)) = 4092 max<br />
<br />
After June 14th patch:<br />
1550 * (1+0.19 (aa) + 0.45 (item))*2 (crit) = 5084 max<br />
<br />
They also made AH not affect CH type spells - which has been posted as being an error (EQLive, druid class board - too lazy to dig up link)<br />
<br />
So, I am guessing it was all a mistake.</div></div><hr />

The second equation is intuitively more correct.  The first one is just stupid from a logical standpoint of how the AAs work.  The AHA AA and healing foci modify your base heal, *then* you can crit that value.  Not crit heal then add the modified value.  We've been getting shortchanged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think this might be the *first* thing they fixed. Run the updater, mine was on autoplay so I didn't get the full message... but I think the first thing I saw was something about fixing Shaman and Druid healing....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Did I miss something ... and here I thought SOE stood for Sony Online Entertainment... not Verant... /shrug<br />
<br />
Sorry, but it's hard to get the statement I HATE VERANT out of one's system if he grew up with them.  It's sort of like a knee jerk reaction, like you have an EQ nightmare and wake up screaming I HATE VERANT.  Saying I HATE SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT takes too long and you'd stop yourself before fully awake.<br />
<br />
Nowadays though, looking back, I liked Verant.  And 989, and the one day Red Eye Interactive.<br />
<br />
This patch was craptastic as far as the errors go... Huge golems in PoK scarin the crap outta me, non melee canni spam, random gender changes, and apparantly a few AA's knocked outta whack.  Of course those that affect us are noticed right away... but how do you make THAT many errors after pushing the patch back a week and running it first on test?</div></div><hr />
