<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I came abck about a month ago after taking a year off of eq to findout my equip isn't that good no more. I know i can do better but not sure whats out there anymore. I only have a few k right now and was going to try and grab more cash but need to find someplace i like. Anyway looking for help with different equip i can a) hunt for b) buy with a small amount of cash i have and cash generated by selling off old equip or c) quest for. FOr doing quests i have a few friends that would help me out and most things probly wouldn't be a problem if it required alot of help.<br />
<br />
Right now im working on spirit wracked cord questing and also have plans to quest for coldain ring, coldain shawl, epic ( me = slacker ), and solstice earring. <br />
<br />
Also planned purchases were a) spells and b) horsey eventually.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions to my gear is welcome and please don't feel limited to post things that i can only get exactly how i said i would. so posting items to look for of easy mobs is good as well (IE radir is easy for some decent drops ).<br />
<br />
Im rambling at this point so just thanks in advance. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks thats a good start. Anyone else with any good ideas ? Im looking to upgrade to a point where i don't have much to worry about with equip for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do the Coldain Military Wristguard quest.  Kill bandits in FG for a Shadel bandit ring.  Buy some Tribal War boots 2-4K.  Get in on some Kael arena groups for Gladiator's Chain leggings/arms.  Buy a Chitinous Belt 1K.  Get a dragon group in WW for free armor.  Sell the gold boots!!!!<br />

If you put your time in looking through Bazaar you can find some amazing deals that will be significant upgrades for you.  Just get an idea of what your priorities are with regards to hitpoints, resists, mana, and go from there. :)</div></div><hr />
