<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just been reading some other posts on here and set me to wondering what would people like to see if SoE were to introduce another race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If they were too (hopefully they never will again, and if they do nothing like those bloody toads) i'd like to see Sand Elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bah.  There are already entirely too many elves. <br />
<br />
GIANTS, baby!  That's where its at!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only 1 id be interested in i think is Giants and no dont mean another large race but Giants.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane<br />
<br />
<br />
PS<br />
Would willingly buy a new expansion if they didnt introduce new race/class/AA/spell as long as it included the option to delete Frogloks as a playable race.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i want to be a dragon myself:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Akheva so I can have a quad-wielding wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dammit I still wanna be Fippy!  Bring on da Gnolls!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Something undead maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Goblinses, wicked tricksy goblinses. Finger waggling Kunark era Mt. DOOM goblinses!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gnolls!<br />
<br />
If not gnoll, then some heretofore never before seen race, not even NPC.<br />
<br />
Insectoids!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A truely challenging race ... how about &quot;Bushes&quot; they would be an evil race, and could roll Rogues only, they could also have inate maxed backstab.<br />
<br />
Could also have an inate 'invis' type skill called 'Feed the Mushroom', normal see-invis or see-undead would not work on this requiring the introduction of a new PC spell/skill called &quot;Refuse the Bull****&quot; to see &quot;Bushes&quot; with &quot;Feed the Mushroom&quot; up.<br />
<br />
A new home town would have to built for them, this would have a pristine appearance from the outside and be extremely well (read: Jealously) guarded. Anyone able enough to penetrate its defenses would discover a plethora of Brothels and backhanding fat cats (Ogres?)<br />
<br />
Most of the quests for the &quot;Bushes&quot; could be set in the Oasis, North and South Ro...Politicians are amiable with the Sand Giants (quest NPC's), although gain pp by keeping this fact unknown to the rest of Norrath. <br />
<br />
Also living in the Oasis/Ro area are the Dervs  and although they are lead by an Obnoxious 'rebel' Sand Giant are of very little threat to the &quot;Bushes&quot;<br />
These Dervs however drop &quot;Oil&quot; which is higly prized by the &quot;Bushes&quot; and offers increased faction against the opposing &quot;Euro&quot; faction. Therefore the &quot;Bushes&quot; would often pillage the Dervs, camping them for years at a time.<br />
<br />
Other races would raise eybrows at this behaviour and  point out the hippocritical nature of the &quot;Bushes&quot; alliance with the &quot;Sand Giants&quot; (Quest NPC's) who are commonly know to be as, if not MORE barbaric than the Dervs..<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh...how I could go on, and on and on.*Chuckle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow, a veiled political rant.<br />
<br />
Off to the grey with ye!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I always wanted to be a sarnak. That would be the best new/old playable race imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gnolls also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Frogs were the best idea they had for a new race when they decided to implement a new one. Now we all know how much we love frogs.<br />
<br />
Do we really want their second choice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Add a zone to the west of South Ro.  Call it Rujark or something.  Make it a city.  And fill it with orcs and goblins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>LISIMBA_SHAKIR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bah Centaur would ROCK hae Selos on at all times :)<br />
<br />
Or Vampires super strong when night and weak during day :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, first vote would be for Gnolls. Big, lots of polygons, like a D&amp;D gnoll - giant slavering hyena race.<br />
<br />
But for those tired of &quot;animal people&quot;...<br />
<br />
Goblins. Kunark-style (those things look like I always pictured goblins). Full gamut of caster and melee classes.<br />
<br />
As an option...<br />
<br />
Luggalds. Warriors, rogues, Shadow Knights, clerics, and int casters. These should have been put in along with Frogloks in LoY. Let 'em take over, oh... Do we really need Erudin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">After reading this the only one I liked the sound of is centaurs - the karanas are dead anyway so plenty of space for em. Barbacus gets a big up for wittiest post Ive seen in ages  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Telal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, i left eq for 2 years, and came back, and I'm playing a frog, i think it adds something cool to the game (personally)  I'm not one who worries about being the most uber I just like to have fun.<br />
<br />
That being said, I think Kobolds, Orcs, Knolls.<br />
<br />
maybe some vampire realative make them rather strong, but punish them for being in the daylight (reduced stats/damage) but make it well worth being one at night.  Maybe where they even have to &quot;feed&quot; on things after they kill them to keep (or enhance) their hp/mana regen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I would've liked drachnids as a playable race. Shissar would've been cool as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ratmen!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kvak1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Nah, best race would be the Otters from Cobalt Scar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Always liked the Luggald's of LoY myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">No more races! They did good with iksar I think and went downhill from there. Cat really did seem lame to me, and frogs... frogs don't get me started.. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Oh, there are lots of potentials out there!<br />
<br />
1) I'd really like to see the LDoN orcs from Taj be a playable race!  <br />
2) Gnolls would be good, too.<br />
3) Drakes a la Skyshrinne<br />
4) Sirens from Siren's Grotto<br />
5) Goo!  Anyone else want to play a goo character?!?  A Bubbling Goo bard!  I can see a pool of goo hauling . . . butt . . . with selo's across the landscape tapping on drums with its psuedopods . . .<br />
6) Constructs--how cool would it be to be a golem model--they've become self-aware and can create new versions of themselves or something<br />
7) Treeants!<br />
<br />
Oh, the possibilities!  :)<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">BIXIES dangit!  <br />
and make them tanks so Sony can explain how they can kick and bash for more damage than a large race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Vampire, home city being Mistmoore... since no one goes there anyway anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Hey, WE do.<br />
<br />
Black Dire...remember?  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Aekhold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Snakes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>LachdanonColdpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I've wanted to play as a Gnoll for the longest time, or at least have an Illusion of one cast on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Only race in this thread that would be remotely interesting to me would be the Othmirs...who doesn't like wearing a fez?<br />
<br />
I could be an EQ Shriner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Da, tovarisch.  Othmeer numvah vun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Faeries! Centaurs would also rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Prophet_Soulez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I think the coolest playable race would be Frogloks... oh wait no they suck, so how about vampires, or something evil, there arent enough evil races in the game anymore, maybe perhaps evil centaurs or orcs... or some evil gypsies that would be so tight, I think gypsies would be the coolest race ever, I want a gypsy monk, or maybe even scarecrows  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Orcs, Orcs, Orcs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I'm also in for Othmir... because of the Fez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Thought Horrors or Sarnaks.<br />
<br />
Down with Othmir! I still have lingering feelings of resentment and rage directed towards Mystic Abomin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Morrighan-VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">&lt;3 Othmir<br />
<br />
Also: Luggalds, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Hey, I am a Shriner. I wear the damn fez enough out of game. 8P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Saranark.<br />
<br />
I wanna live in Chardok :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I don't want a new race to play..I'm happy with my cat :)  What I would like is to be able to ride a dragon..not a horse or drogmor LOL. Just a thought  :D <br />

Not on this graphics engine baby.  Hold your breathe for EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Dakanloth-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Any race that doesnt include shaman is fine by me :P<br />
Frogs were bad enough.<br />
I think aviaks might be a cool PC race. Innate levi or some sort of flight</div></div><hr />
