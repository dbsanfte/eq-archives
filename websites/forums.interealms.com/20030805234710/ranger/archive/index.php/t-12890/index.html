<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why is it I see the most bad attitudes in people who are high level Warriors and Wizards when it comes to me? Honestly, because I'm a lower level Ranger, or something, they think I'm to be completely excluded from everything, or to be picked at because it's my main and I don't have an alt with 30000000K worth of gear. <br />
<br />
Mainly I see this in the Market Chat Channel. I turn it on, and go hunt. I only answer questions anymore, or ask for Price Checks, or Links, when forced, seeing as I absolutely hate half of the people on that thing for the way they treat others. <br />
<br />
Example: This was me they treated terribly. I was hunting in Echo Caverns being bored, and killing some of the single boglings once I had figured out how to split the room's spawn by the SH door, in case I got in trouble. Well, someone starts and ooc thing, and the whole zone is into it. We're just joking, and laughing about it, nothing major. Well, my channel was set to Market, because I'd just asked for a Price check, and answered a few other Price Checks that I had seen before, so I set my channel to it on the chat window because I was soloing, and I accidentally post something in the Market on the joke in Echo Caverns. So, I say, &quot;Wrong channel, sorry&quot; and leave it at that. I say nothing more about it, but four other people in the chat channel go off on this joke, making a joke in Market about it. <br />
<br />
I said something to the effect of I didn't mean to start that, and I said it was a wrong channel, when three people jump down my throat about how it's the market and only for buying and selling, and will not, for the life of them, listen to what really happened. The other four people shut up about it, and don't defend me, even though they were the ones in the major wrong here. Now, I look up these three names, and what do I find? Two Wizards, and a warrior, figures. All level 55+. So, whatever, let them talk smack, I shut up about it, and the last comment I made was something to the effect that heaven forbid people have fun on a game and that it was the greates sin to God. So, they shut up.<br />
<br />
Few days later, I see someone ask why the Fungus Patch Vest is 150K when Fungi is 60K (I know, we got a high price compared to some servers). These people jump down his throat, no nice explanation, nothing. Just &quot;**** Newb!&quot; So, I send a tell to this guy and explain why it is more, and everything, anmd neither of us think it's worth it, but, whatever some moron will pay, right?<br />
<br />
Back to me. Someone asks for a Perice check, and I give him to him. Hit the nail of the Price on the head. I recieve &quot;You're a level 41 Ranger?&quot; in Market. No one yells at him for not relating to buying and selling. I tell him yeah, and he goes &quot;You can't answer a PC unless you're 50+.&quot; I said, &quot;What if I have a level 60 Warrior main then and didn't tell you?&quot; He shuts up. I don't, and would never play a warrior, just seems boring, but, it shut him up. Look up his name, he's a level 58 Warrior. Gee, big shock.<br />
<br />
So, my thing is, what the heck is it with Warriors and Wizards wanting to pick on lower level people like they are gods? I see nothing of Higher End Druids, Clerics, Enchanters, Mages, or any other classes but these two doing this. I've met more non loot whoring rogues than I have high end Warriors and Wizards who don't act like they are the greatest things walking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd just ignore people who insist on jumping down your throat for absolutely no reason whatsoever. If you're really into trading and the such, you'll probably end up getting a reputation for providing reliable goods and information and people will listen to you when you provide price checks. Those same l00t wh00rs who are arguing with some 'newb' and are trying to pay 60k for a fungi while the 'newb' wants to sell it for 80k might just appreciate people who can provide accurate and reliable PCs. ;)<br />
<br />
If not, fug 'em and do your best to undercut THEIR sales. Or something.... =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the comment about my Sig quote. I got it in Sol A, after I soloed the Goblin King and should have died, from a Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Myrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hear you.<br />
<br />
I get sick of warriors telling me what to do, where to go, etc. The biggest thing I get from them is &quot;If you don't know the zone you have no business being here.&quot; And it's ALWAYS a warrior saying it.<br />
<br />
Ahem! Terribly sorry if your feel the need to have a printed map and guide before you enter any zone, but I play a Ranger for a reason. I like to explore. So go off in your boring corner and XP grind somewhere that you're not in my F'in way!</div></div><hr />

Thats about the stupidest thing I've ever heard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And THAT'S the stupidest thing I'VE ever heard!   HTF do you learn a zone without exploring it?<br />
<br />
Whoever tells you this, turn into a wolf and EAT HIM!<br />
