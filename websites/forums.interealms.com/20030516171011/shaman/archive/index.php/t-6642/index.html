<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kraeger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok maybe that mob in GD is a little scary, but his MR is not very high and he is slowable. Rampages tho, I tried him with a monk mate and we got him down to 3%. Was pased Enrage and all, but then slow wore off and I was lom. Kinda anoying, but a group of 3 should be able to do him</div></div><hr />
