<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hobosticle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 12 shaman with around 3.5-4k to blow once i sell all the random goodies i have.<br />
<br />
I currently have a giant woven vest, clay guardian shield, lizardscale mantle, slime coated poon, and jb helm, boots, and vambs.<br />
<br />
I spoke to a 60 shaman about my equip ordeal and he said to get forest loops, 6/65 rings and a decent pair of leggings (I think he mentioned brown chit legs) and i'd be set until i pick up enough plat from leveling to fill the empty slots.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any advice/recommendations? Again i will have around 3.5-4kpp to spend and have the items currently listed for equip so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You might want to look at some lvl II (III if/when you can afford) focus items also. They will carry you up to your lvl 49 spells and save you a ton of mana/time in the long run. There's a thread around here somewhere that lists all of the items... use the search icon and probably focus as your keyword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd recommend a iksar regen bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">See a Jeweler<br />
<br />
2   6/65 rings<br />
65/65 necklace<br />
2   35/35 earrings<br />
<br />
at your lvl mana/Hp is better than wisdom.<br />
<br />
Iksar regen BP is great too if you can swing it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would look into the BA medallion from Runnyeye...the one with the focus effect for your neck...not much in the way of extra goodness like 65 hit points or mana, but the focus effect will save you a ton of headaches.<br />
Also look into a spider fur belt!!!! one of the cheapest (on any server that I have checked on) belts with a pretty good ac and lots of hit points on it. Also have a gander at the ac hit point/mana earrings (golden black sapphire?) they will carry you till level 60 if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ikkie Regen is the best you can do...<br />
<br />
if a Barbarian, Imbued Golden Ivory Earrings &gt; Forest loops, and a third of the price.  They are 3ac, 3(or is it 4?)wis, 4 sv cold.  An earring of the twisted leaves is nice too..<br />
<br />
6/65 rings are a must have, they are fabulous until you can afford shadel bandit.</div></div><hr />
