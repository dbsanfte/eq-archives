<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it's a bit early to start thinking about the next expansion...but the new zone just released got me wondering.  There is 1 more continent yet to be discovered.  I think that this will be some sort of continent dealing with the Ratonga.  Yes - those mice like creatures that are the new race in EQ2.  I think it would be a good way to tie them into EQ2 instead of just having them appear out of no where lol :)  So, what are you're guesses on what will be in the next expansion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Things that I was thinking when I was exploring the new zone:<br />
<br />
I personally think that SoE is finally going to add the continent from the back of the globe in Skyfire.  Its been known about for years, and I think its about time they added it.  The expansion will be a mixture of outdoor, pop like zones and LDoN instanced dungeons (Note the Wayfarer camp in the new zone).  Adding a new race in this area would be pretty easy because they can generate the  lore they will use entirely from the new continent.<br />
<br />
Im thinking they are going to HAVE to include raid content (they would be very very stupid not to), and I think that it may be instanced.  Hopefully, it will be excecuted a bit better than the current LDoN raid structure.  Imagine instanced elemental planes type deal, but exclusivly raid oriented.</div></div><hr />

It's gonna be called &quot;Beastman&quot; and will contain the best from the beastlord and the shaman class... High-end Pet DPS, Good melee, excellent buffs, uber slow, mana regen spells, cannibalize... You name it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bleah, there's already enough classes.  But for a new playable race I'd love to see goblins or orcs.  Or maybe a race that allows for evil druids or rangers, just for variety.  Or evil bards.  Something new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It would really rock if the evil team (orange) on PVP servers could finally get their hands on some tracker classes with this possible new race, since verant hasnt put in Dark Elf bards or Iksar rangers or other cool combos.<br />

************RUMOR***********UNCONFIRMED**************<br />
I talked to a friend yesterday who apparently has some friends on the SoE expansion team (code writers or something like that).<br />
<br />
He said 5 more levels, more &amp; different AA's, and many more zones (he gave a #, but I can't remember it).  I *think* he said expected roll-out date was late winter or early spring (Feb-Mar).  By that time I figure I'll have all the AA's I really want (another 50-60 or so) and my 65 bar will be full as well.  I pressed for more details, but my friend was already nervous since the info HE was given was skirting (if not outright breaking) NDA clauses.<br />
<br />
Some virtual food for thought anyway...<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

I can't imagine we're getting a huge expansion so soon after LDON.  Wouldn't we have heard more about it if it were going live in 4-5 months?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">maybe it is a downloadable expansion combine idea of LoY and LDoN -- I won't see a reason for Sony invest big $$ for just an expansion, they already show that LoY or LDoN earn same $$ as PoP (PoP is very huge expansion)<br />
<br />
they can just make few new zone similar to LoY, and duplicate them 50x for instance similar to LDON, throw more ubber l33t to keep raider busy, and add one top end zone like every other big expansion that require huge time sink -- like require finish 100 raid from each theme to unlock it ...<br />
<br />
I remember there was talk about new class is Berseker from FoH board, look like it is another melee class</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">new rumor concerning the next expansion: http://www.planeteq.com/cazicthule/<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks to an Anonymous source within SoE, I am Able to confirm that the Name of Expansion 7 is.. <br />
<br />
<br />
Dawn of Xonyouahuo<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the name of the Mystery 6th Continent of Norrath to the west of the Abysmal sea, seen on the globe in Skyfire and the Atlas in the Plane of time. This continent is roughly three times the size of Antonica, with an archipelago of islands leading to a huge land mass. <br />
<br />
Other Details of the Expansion are yet to be confirmed. <br />
<br />
The distinctly oriental Name could possibly allude to an Asian Humanoid playable character race, (as the humans portrayed the European populace, the Elves portrayed the British, the Barbarians portryed the Nordics, or the Erudites Portrayed the Africans?) Or perhaps other Oriental Links in the new expansion? Only time, and a proper Press release will tell. You heard it here first, guys! <br />
<br />
<br />
No clue if its true or not, but its the most likely place to expand.  The continent is huge.</div></div><hr />

Plus one &quot;U&quot;....<br />
<br />
In other unverified news, have you seen what &lt;a href=&quot;http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=5226&quot;&gt;Caster's Realm&lt;/a&gt; has reported:<br />
<br />
We've been piecing together more pieces of the puzzle for the next content addition to EverQuest since the announcement of Nedaria's Landing.* One player was kind enough to send us a list of zone names apparently extrapolated from EverQuest data files.* If accurate, and we have not yet confirmed that they are, these would confirm the discussions that the next batch of content will include the Abysmal Sea and related regions.  The existing zone names would indicate the possibility of one large city with numerous different areas.* Note that these zone names may only be part of whatever additional content is in development.  We are still awaiting word from SOE as to what is in the works for EverQuest players.* Hopefully the wait will not be too much longer.<br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt;Possible New Zone Names&lt;/u&gt;<br />
  &lt;li&gt;Abysmal Sea&lt;/li&gt;<br />
  &lt;li&gt;Tacvi, Seat of the Slaver&lt;/li&gt;<br />
  &lt;li&gt;Txevu, Lair of the Elites&lt;/li&gt;<br />
  &lt;li&gt;Inktu`Ta, The Unmasked Chapel&lt;/li&gt;<br />

EQlive and EQ2 are two different teams and they will not addept EQlive to better suit EQ2. EQ2 is set 500 yrs in the future but not nescesarily in the same universe as EQlive, they do not have to be consistent with eachother.<br />
<br />
Going from those possible zone names it sounds like it's a high lvl zone expansion again. Newbie zones don't have unpronounceable names with an explanation behind the comma.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can imagine an intire expansion full of themed LDON style instanced zones of which Ill just go ahead and GUESS that the sewers are going to be regular dungeon type zones and the other two are going to be big inside/outside uber raid style instanced zones. This leaves Abysmal Sea as a common hunting zone (with island hopping and lots of low level mobs) and Nedaria's Landing as the access zone and wayfarers camp area. This would keep true to what the current evolution of the game has been pointing to.<br />
<br />
but what do I know...<br />

<br />
I can't see how they possibly can't raise the cap next expansion.  A friend of mine is 65 with 500 AA's.  There is nothing left for him to exp towards.  I'm sure he's not the only one.  IMHO they have no choice, if there's no carrot to chase, people will just stop playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So your friend can then race to 70 and be in the same boat in 3 weeks or less....  Theres always alts to add o replayability. <br />
<br />
Every time they add levels it seriously screws the dynamics of the game.. How much of PoP will be trivial with raids of lvl 70's?  Expect alot more elemental guilds. <br />
<br />
I think the only solution is to add alot more AA's. Or come up with a new way for people to convert experience into something else.. LDoN points or something along those lines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right that there are a lot of people maxed; but there are even more who aren't.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to complain about the level thing. Personally, the thing that I find most fun in EQ is getting new abilities and going back and killing old &quot;cool&quot; content solo or with the smallest group possible. I love getting new spells. I love watching Lucy and trying to figure out what new abilities I'm going to get. However I also realize how game breaking this really is. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's kind of like complaining Kunark trivialized LGuk, or that there are more guilds in Vex Thal since PoP.  The people who were in the elementals will move on to Time and beyond, people currently not in Elementals get in, etc.  This has become the natural progression in EQ.<br />
<br />
The fact that people could cap again in a few weeks didn't stop them from raising the cap for PoP, and it won't stop them in the future.  The game needs to grow it will die.  There are very few new subscibers, so they need to focus on keeping it interesting for the existing player base.  It's just business.<br />
<br />
My 30 AAs are far from capped, but I don't mind.  I long ago accepted I would never be at the top of the heap in this game.  Frankly, being unguilded,  I hope at level 70 + 200ish AA we can single-group Vindi for his BP. :p  It'll probably still be an upgrade for me at that point. ;)</div></div><hr />

Fwiw my problem is with the nature of the new content we've seen since Velious, getting especially blatant starting with PoP, not the fact that they're releasing new content.  Obviously new content is needed to prevent stagnation.  And if I'm any indication, they're not doing a good job of keeping their current playerbase..  I cancelled my second account just prior to the LDoN release, which btw I did not buy.  I didn't buy LoY either for that matter, I just don't like the direction EQ has gone.  I'm looking forward to Horizons, and may soon cancel my only currently active account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Can't argue with that, Namurd... I quit after PoP because of this, and only came back after 8 months because I was unable to drag my EQ-playing friends away.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">A lot of the problems with current and future MMO's stem from the levelling treadmill and the feeling of grinding.  Unfortunately, the flavor of an RPG has been missing since the inception of MMO.  Yes, there are currently millions of VR mobs awaiting your killing blow.  Very few have a real reason to be killed other than &quot;because it will give you experience&quot;.  The main strife in these games comes from PVP or GuildvGuild.  It is very rare for a concerted group of mobs to do anything spectacular that requires the cooperation of a PC town to drive off the advancing hoarde.  The same mob spawns in the same place for 4 RL years and his descendents learn nothing - they keep hanging around the same spot awaiting certain death.  AI needs some work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">To be perfectly honest, I can't imagine them NOT raising the level cap.  Seriously, there are a number of reasons for that.  Typically, they need to trivialize the prior expansions to force people into the new areas and to open up prior content to let the less ubers into new areas.  They've kinda dumbed down the run to PoTime already, and I can't imagine the smaller guilds getting into there unless they raise the level cap.<br />
<br />
Additionally, they need a way, outside of purely new content, to drag the PoTime enabled guilds out of PoP--better equipment, different raids, etc.  I find it unlikely they'll just plug better equipment into the new expansion without some kind of level cap increase.  I just don't see them adding super augmentations and letting it go at that.  If the base equipment isn't good enough to drag players out of PoTime, what's the point?<br />
<br />
Don't misunderstand, I'm REALLY not looking forward to the level treadmill again, but I just don't see how they CAN'T raise the cap.  Otherwise it just seems like they'll be releasing a huge exp zone.<br />
