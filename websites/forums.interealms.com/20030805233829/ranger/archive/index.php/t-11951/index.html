<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd love to see a self only spell, even if only for 50-100hp, that you could cast on yourself during melee without changing targets. (ala Call of sky, etc)<br />
<br />
Would make all the difference in those tight fights where it's a question of rooting the mob and running or standing in and finishing it off and hoping that it stops attacking around 10% health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kedawen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It really doesn't take long to target yourself and retarget the mob if you use the TAB key. (I am pretty sure that is the default). I cast spells on myself all the time using a key sequence of Tab, Cast Spell, TAB. You don't need to wait for the spell to stop casting before retargetting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd like to see a self only heal spell and I have said so in other forums... here are some other reasons for it<br />
<br />
Beastlords which share many of the things given to rangers have pet only heals... only makes since that since we are our own pets we would get them<br />
<br />
Self only heal spells would not harm in any way the need for a cleric or other healer in a full group situation but would rather allow us to be less of mana sponges<br />
<br />
Verant seems very fond of assigning druids and rangers self only spells<br />
<br />
it would not infringe on a paladins place in a group since it would be self only and not targetable<br />
<br />
would allow us a little more flexibility in raid situations (anyone heard that line before *lol*) and would allow us a little more freedom in small groups or soloing<br />
<br />
If the heal is only going to be a small one...  then there really isn't a point... we can snare and root then step back and heal ourselves. <br />
<br />
What I am talking about is a self only heal spell greater then the targetable one we already have..... Get healing at 39..... Greater Healing at like 57..... so get a small self only healing spell at 50 or 51</div></div><hr />
