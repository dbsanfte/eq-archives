<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glutar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all I have just come back to everquest from an extended break and am going to start a shaman from scratch on a new server so no twinking or anything going on.  My question relates to race.  I am curious as to how much faster a Barbarian shaman levels relative to an ogre shaman?  The reason I ask is I want to get to the higher lvls of the game as soon as possible and I will more than likely solo for a while since I do not know anyone on the server.  Also do ogres still have the innate unstunnability from the front?  Thank you for your time and replies ahead of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've only played a barbarian shaman, but I think the XP difference is around 10%. If you are soloing untwinked though, you may find the racial benefits offset that xp penalty anyway.<br />
<br />
Ogres are still unstunnable from the front.<br />
<br />
You may also want to consider a troll, for<br />
1) Innate regen<br />
2) Snare necklace<br />
<br />
If you don't care about having a JBB (you should) Iksar are another consideration with their regen and innate AC. But the JBB is a great crutch from level 46+, not something I'd like to rule out.<br />
<br />
Plenty of other threads about the races if you do a quick search I'm sure you'll find some info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Penalties are:<br />
<br />
Barbarian 5%<br />
Ogre 15%<br />
Troll 20%<br />
Iksar 20%<br />
<br />
I'm an Ogre, and happy with it, though long-run Troll might have been a slightly better choice.  I don't really see a point to Barbarian over Vah Shir (or Froglok, coming) though if you're just looking to avoid the XP penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Troll will probably level faster then Barb through the low levels even with the exp hit.  The snare necklace is another huge reasong as well.  In the upper game their regen is pretty useless.  <br />
<br />
I play an Ogre and would never change.  I never get interupted because I was stunned.  It is not difficult to position all mobs infront of you and if you are backed against a wall you almost never interupt.  That being said Ogres probably level slower then any other race at lower level.  <br />
<br />
IMHO the other races arent worth it.  Back when old wolrd faction mattered being a good race might have ment something.<br />
<br />
One benifit of being a barb on a new server completely untwinked is that you can do mail runs.  I personally do the euradin to qeynos one for 6 gp a run.  with pop it takes about 3 mins and less if you can get someone to bind you next to 1 of the bards.  Use pop to port to one of the cities and die to get back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I love the Iksar race.  In my personal opinion, they have the best character models.  :)  But the exp penalty sucks.  20% off the top is thrown away.  I have to admit that the exp penalty is killing me.</div></div><hr />
