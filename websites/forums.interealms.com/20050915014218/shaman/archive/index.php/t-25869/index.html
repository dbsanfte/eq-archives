<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it is a bit early, but it would be nice to get this spell as fast as possible.  Our 61 spell is easy enough to get, but I heard that the 69 spells might be some sort of actual quest.  Any feedback on how to aquire it, would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">By all accounts, this is purchaseable via shards won on DON missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It isn't on the list of things to buy at DoN camps, I'm thinking you gotta do something else to either get it to show up or get it somewhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While I am not playing any longer. I wonder if it is something like LDoN and you could not see all the purchaseable items until you were within so many point of them??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kheera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While I am not playing any longer. I wonder if it is something like LDoN and you could not see all the purchaseable items until you were within so many point of them??<br />
<br />
Wondering that myself.  It shows up to 340-crystal items which are already pretty nifty things (where all you could see in LDoN was the basic junk until you started getting points), so not sure.  I've done 4 missions at level 70 and got 33 or 38 crystals a mission, so they can add up pretty quick; still only seeing up to the same 340-crystal items that I could see with no crystals.  Will have to see again once I get more.<br />
<br />
I do see the 61 spells/tomes, for 120 crystals.  I do not see level 69 ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I just found out today that this spell is aquired threw the progression Task/Mission quest.  You also need to do that 4 group Mission as well.  It is far enough along on the progression, where it takes more then 1 FULL day.  So if you are trying to save up to aquire this spell from the Mission Venders, dont waist your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't really want the spell, but looks like I am going to get it whether I want it or not.<br />
<br />
That Delete button is going to be really tempting...<br />
<br />
The other reward for the quest at that level interests me more than that spell does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">omg, a *whole* day to get a spell, omg~</div></div><hr />

Is the rep system back yet?</div></div><hr />

yeah, good sarcasm is always worth a POSITIVE bump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The mission is from the Event person.<br />
24 max number of people<br />
<br />
We did it with, eh, 1 bard, 2 clerics, 2 wars, 3 shams, 1 SK, 2 paladins, 2 chanters, 1 mage, 1 beastlord, 2ranger, 1 wizard, 1 rogue, and a twitch bitch thrown in for good measure.<br />
<br />
No bots<br />
<br />
Average gear was, eh, upper elemental + time. 1 War should be considered as a full time geared war tho<br />
<br />
fighting to Emoush was &lt;easy&gt;<br />
<br />
Then the 2 clerics picked a war each, the 2 shaman wiht maxed healing AAs took the SK, and then each tank engaged a mystic.<br />
<br />
Raid moved from mystic to mystic bringing them down to 5%, then we just killed them.<br />
<br />
Slow landed with out Malos easily (Turgurs and Nihil, each was used)<br />
<br />
engaging Emoush, it took spam cast of 7 slows before slow stuck(turgurs, not nihil)<br />
<br />
Emoush's AE was resisted occasionaly, but not on a guarunteed basis.<br />
Bard was in MT/cleric group, paladins whre in the other gruops to help wiht gruop heals.<br />
<br />
Got emoush down to 7% before the mystics awakened<br />
Time from unconcious mystic to awake mystic was about 3 minutes.<br />
As soon as a mystic wakes up, Emoush becomes untouchable until all mystics are KO'd again.<br />
<br />
at 7%, all three mystics basicaly got up and charged us, Hrendra, Scar, and Throk taged them, and nobody died.<br />
<br />
Mystics where KO'd in about 2 minutes , during wich Emoush powered up 2x times.<br />
<br />
When Emoush was re-engaged, he hit for a tiny bit harder, but his AE remianed the same, although *possibly* the AE went off more often, not positive.<br />
<br />
<br />
When Emoush was down, everyone was happy.<br />
I got my spell, Hrend and a paladin got their discs, and a bard got his storm blade proc. and some other people got somehting nice,, I forget wich. <br />
<br />
Oh, and a nifty 135/135 HP/man ring wiht decent stats and regen 3 and haste 41 or 46% dropped. Very nice night, great reward for those not ready for spells.<br />
<br />
