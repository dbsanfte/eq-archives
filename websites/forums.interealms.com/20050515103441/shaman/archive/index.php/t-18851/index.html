<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay i'm feeling a littel disenfranchised so bear with me.<br />
<br />
I hope SOE is messing with lucy and giving them all sorts of misinformation, but....<br />
<br />
It appears to me that we get nothing in the new expansion other than general aa's that everyone gets or ones that fix things that should have been fixed years ago (ie the one for pet buffing with the group).<br />
<br />
No one will truely know all the new aa's and such until the expansion comes out, but what is that is all we get, crap. <br />
<br />
What are we as a community to do?  personally on a raid after the mob is slowed, not much left for us to do, ldon yeah its fun and all, best expansion to date IMO.  But is that what we are becoming LDON machines and nothing else, first they nerf solo xps, and unless you are in PoF/E you cant get a decent rate for aaxp which face it once your 65 is all you do.  <br />
<br />
I hate to look like i'm bitching but what are our options to bring to SOE's developers that we are unsatisfied at the path our class is taking?  <br />
<br />
Personally if all the other classes get a decent boost and we get jack, i'll probably send an e-mail and shelve my shaman and start another class or just quit.  I hate the fact that to feel useful I do ldon and have a good time, but if i want to raid I end up almost falling asleep after slow is landed.</div></div><hr />

The number of them may depend on the reuse time of CotA.  Since SoE said that the new endurance will not be have spells or abilities (CotA? duh) to increase the rate at which it recovers, I find it hard to believe that CotA will be much more then a 1 min or 2 min deal.  If thats the case, expect your guild to ask ALL of their Shaman to get this AA asap. And expect Shaman to become a critical part of Exp Groups.</div></div><hr />

I can't see it being significant enough to be a staple point for xp groups, but yeah unless its really minor, it'll be a nice raiding ability.</div></div><hr />

Are you seriously believing what you are saying?<br />
<br />
The last time I read something like this was when the Kunark spell data was published on EQrealms. The spell the newbies were freaking out about was Avatar. <br />
I can tell you that this will do less than you think in advance. I am not complaining about it, as it is a unique ability(beside their own AAs that give them Endurance regen), but this isn't replacing Slow. This is NOT the new Primary Ability we are waiting for.</div></div><hr />

Ya know what?  This bugs me and I'll tell you why.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone here remember Velious when it was new?  Remember what Necros and Mages were on raids for?  <br />
<br />
Necros were there for one (maybe 2 things).  Mana dumping clerics and (maybe) summoning corpses if things went south.<br />
<br />
Mages were there for mod rods, because pets were usually not allowed and their damage spells were not up to par for a level 60.<br />
<br />
If there is one thing I would really despise seeing is 4 or 5 shaman required to come to a raid for one purpose and one purpose only: to set up the Ancient rotation so that there is a constant stream of Endurance flowing to the melees.  When you reach that stage, it is time to start hunting for a new class because you are a one trick pony in a circus that no longer has room in the center ring.  <br />
<br />
I know that much of the data that we are now seeing about AA's and abilities is pure speculation and all is subject to change untill the release of GoD.  But everything I have read makers it clearer in my mind that the Class is no longer considered by Sony to be of value.  We have the spell that we need (Turgurs) and anything else would be overpowering to us in their minds.<br />
<br />
Since PoP I have sent emails to Devs about the current state of the Class.  Every response I recieved (when I got one, which was 3 for 8 emails) was basically a pat on the head that said &quot;You are good enough, you are smart enough, and dogoone it, people like you&quot;.<br />
<br />
To quote a line from a great movie &quot;They have done their best, and their best is not good enough&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It seems that all priest's and one int caster are getting a ward of some sort.  Ours is one that regens endurance for everyone around, Cleric's and Druid's regen health, Wizard's causes damage to all npc's nearby (is this a good thing?).   I think that it's a new unique ability, and I think it will be useful, at least more useful than AE damage or AE Regen.  I can understand skepticism, but isn't this basically what we were asking for to replace what was taken from us with the stamina heal/regen spells?<br />
<br />
I guess I'm not sure why it is seen as a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

maybe I'm not clear on the whole value of endurance. Clerics and druids get cool ae heals while we get to help melees reuse their discs sooner? Zzzzz..</div></div><hr />

Uggok said it pretty clearly.  Shamans have pretty much turned into buff bots.  PoP and LDoN have been primarily about high DPS for short periods of time.  Shamans don't add much to DPS in short encounters. The only thing we're good for is buffs, which can easily be done with bots, and as a third or fourth class healer if a druid or cleric is unavailable.  I've had trouble sometimes getting groups because of this, even with guildmates.  The shaman class may find a new role as endurance buffers, but its one dimensional, and won't really add much to the desireability of shamans as mains in high level encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Guys now is the time to complain. We can not let soe jerk us around any longer even if This is a rough incomplete aa list we should still complain. These aa's are garabage and should never see the light of day upon norrath. They ressovle none of our current issues and only make us weaker in comparison to other classes. We have suffered from a massive stealth nerf ever since luclin came out. Now we will only continue the trend if we do not complain and let soe know that these aa's are complete ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you really want to complain, complain with your pocketbook. Shaman are a conciderable portion of players, just as is any class. Dont like it, dont buy it. Its not like you dont have a billion other zones to go to.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking that none of you are.<br />
If you are look me up and we will test this new AA... Which BTW now one has ATM, that I am aware of...<br />
The list of AA's aren't complete.<br />
The new Spells aren't in yet. <br />
Chill out... There are ALOT of people playing shamans in the beta...</div></div><hr />
