<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Czakoriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is what I (Lvl 36) was doing with some Newbies:<br />
<br />
SoW<br />
Quickness<br />
Regen<br />
Talisman of T'Narg<br />
<br />
Took  (2) Newbies into EF Tundra (1=Lvl 5 Warrior &amp; 1=Lvl 10 Shaman)...Cast the above mentioned on them and let them go at it.  I basically sat and med while they fought.  Once they got their Mob to &lt;50% I would turn loose my Pet to take them out.  Seemed to work very well.  I know Using this strategy got the Lvl 5 upto 10 in about 2 hours (He could have been higher but by splitting my mana pool between the 2 of them was a bit of a strain).  I would guess he could have been taken up about 8-10 lvls if I had only him to assist.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have any strategy to accelerate training of Newbies.  I apologize to those who don't like the morality of PLing but I don't have a problem with it.  <br />
<br />
(BTW- I wasn't PL'd - Born on Date = December 16, 2001)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shamans arent too great for powerlevelling in my opinion.  If your gonna plevel, do it right with a druid.  Monk, sk or necro would work too with feign death.<br />
<br />
I would guess the shaman should just buff up the plevelee, debuff a red con mob, and have the plevelee go to town on it.  Try and have him hit only red cons.<br />
<br />
What you could also do, if you were much higher level, is make some ds potions and make sure that you keep aggro with non-damage spells (or very little damage spells) while the plevelee beats on the mob.  If you were high level, 50+, the ds would be hitting for a decent amount (not anywhere near a druid though).<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with plevelling in my opinion, as long as the character you are pleveling is going to be played by someone who has already invested a lot of time in the game learning his main's class and observing other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Harness of Spirit, Chloro (group regrowth), alacrity/celerity<br />
<br />
1-13 (pretty quick at newbie zone then blackburrow / befallen)<br />
14-18 (dervs/orcs around Oasis)<br />
19 - 34 (upper guk / lower guk)<br />
35 - 45 (crystal caverns)<br />
45 - 50 (frost giant fort in EW)<br />
<br />
I've done it with melee in about 2 weeks of regular play time (some evenings and weekends).  Could be faster if you were dedicated to PLing someone and forgot about doing your own thing.  Could do 40-50 in CoM pretty easily as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gonna have to disagree...Druids while great for power leveling a melee into the 30s cannot hold a flame to the shaman power leveling a 40+ melee.<br />
<br />
Slow+Haste+Regrowth+HP and watch a monk mow through mobs faster than any DS'd melee.<br />
<br />
It is all about efficiency.<br />
<br />
The shaman will barely be scraping his mana pool to keep these buffs up nor will he have to be healing much in comparison to the druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/nod Epyx<br />

More important is when joo kill with the DS joo get no mele skill ups.<br />
<br />
The DS is a short cut to higher lvl but results in a week unskilled character.  Better to do it da shaman way wich is to excelerate the killing process by increasing mele output and reducing down time.  When joo get to lvl 50 you have a monk that can actualy hit somthing....  that is kind of usefull  *grins*.<br />
<br />
Also I recmend that joo kill blues instead of da reds.... more kills = more mele practice = keep all joo skills maxed.  If all your mele skills are maxed for a lvl then it be ok to kill in whatever mana will gain joo the exp fast.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Atlet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah at level 60 we could just group the folks getting pl'd and use our group focus/agi/sta to buff them. We can haste them slow the mobs they pull and heal them ez all the way to 60. My warrior durring the 40's was in OT/DL making a level a day with that strat. Now my war is 56 and I duo with my war in Velks / Luclin. <br />
<br />
There is NO way any other class can pl like a shaman. Shoot while the powerlevelee is fighting you can sick your dog on the mob to help out on the dps or add a little dd in there or cast our epic to help with the damage. All the plee needs is to do 50.1% of the damage, at lower levels we can make up the diff ez.<br />
<br />
Only way a druid can do better is umm....  umm....  .....  they can uhhh port the lowbie around??  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My monk is level 46 with &lt; 5 days played.  I pl'd him some and solo'd him some when my 2nd pc was down.  (I also had the monk p'l my druid 5 levels to get portability.)  I have no doubt that if I straight pl'd him the entire time I could make it to 50 in under 3 days played.  In fact I may try it with a warrior for kicks.<br />
From 40-46 I can do a level in 2.5-3hrs.<br />
<br />
At around 35th level a my monk could always out damage my pet.<br />
Both were hasted with alacrity.   So I would typically pull with slow, send in monk,  send in dog pet.<br />
<br />
If I didnt feel like using my pet, the monk had np outdamaging my Epic.<br />
<br />
If you have a jbb take a few min to learn exactly how many blasts will put the mob at or closest to 51% of its health.<br />
<br />
Also learn when slow is needed or not needed, sometimes it was easier to just nuke/heal then slow.<br />
<br />
Typically I keep haste, regen and focus buffs on him.  Everything else wasn't worth it IMO, given the rate at which he was dropping mobs.<br />
<br />
I realize the guy who wrote this is level 36, but maybe this helps others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Druids excel at PLing untill mid 30s...Shaman after 40 for sure...<br />
<br />
Looks like you got it there Czakoriah..those are you best bang for the mana spells at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Czakoriah,<br />
<br />
I would also add Health, and Shifting Shield on them as this will give them more HP and AC. The AC will mean that they get hit slightly less and will require less healing. <br />
<br />
I was bored the other night an met up with a guildy who had been told she was too low find a group in Paludal Caverns. So I decided to escort her up to the hollowshad end and watch out for her whilst she &quot;soloed&quot; I used HoS Agi,Sta, Guardian Spirit, chloro and haste. (basically the higher versions of what you've been using) Then I sat down and waited whilst she killed stuff to half way and sent the dog in to finish the mobs off.<br />
<br />
Doing this she got 6 levels in 2 hours going from 11 to 17. Granted she's a ranger and can dish out damage, but still it shows what a Shaman can do. I didn't bother slowing any of the mobs as I wanted to make sure her defense got maxed and I could easily heal her.<br />
<br />
As far as power leveling people I wouldn't recommend that you level someone who is new to the game as they will miss out on a lot of stuff and will not enjoy it later. I would start a new char with them to show them the ropes and fight together. <br />
<br />
People who've played a char to high level usually know roughly what other classes abilities are and so know how to play, especially if it's a similar type of class to their main. This girl's main is a paladin so a ranger is very close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just a thought, I've found that exp seems much better if you fight blues, whites, and a few yellows rather than fighting all reds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tevek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dont forget to slow the mobs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">here is my tip. group the PLing char select yourself and cast Gfocus and Gregen. works like a charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yep Grumgor,fighting reds is just a waste of time/energy.<br />
<br />
Pet is nice  for PLin when the low lvl guy PLed has some adds on him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think he was refering to a PLing very low level character.  Some classes can take on reds solo that early so its not to much of a waste to kill reds at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">last night I was powering my enchanter L29 on 2nd account. Set up on shore in Fvie and I (shaman 59) pulled various spiders with malosini, dog agroes.  I root and sit, maybe throw a JBB shot.  eventually, the enchanter gets up and tashs, and when the mob is at 10-15% life, mezzes the mob, breaking the pet agro.  Then mind wipe and nuke for full exp.  1/2 blue to full blue per kill.  No druid could do that so well.  Kept regrowth on dog and did not even bother to slow them.  Really easy.  Works now with clerics once they get atone.<br />
<br />
I power melees in dungeons alot and also use the dog as crowd control and to chase down the mob when it goes for its death walk.  When powering with the druid you dont get the benefit of the damage shield unless they are getting it, so you have to root the mob or melee/nuke them out.  Lots of people forget the fact that the dog acts and a 2nd (and sometimes even a 3rd) melee while you power level, and takes no exp. I also power with a druid, and after L20 or so, the shaman is much better. I do use the druid at the low levels to help get the defense points up while the damage shield is replacing the dog's damage output.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">druids are uncontested from lvl 1 to about 30 with damage shields. fight mobs 5-10 levels above you, eg reds, and you'll get 3-5 blues per kill. skills can be gained later and go up fast in the lower levels anyway.<br />
<br />
shaman clearly better at 40+ though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our AC buffs are expensive for the effect they have...takes less mana to heal the extra damage taken usually.<br />
Sta is not worth the mana IMO...more HP means more to heal when they get low...If you are cutting it that close your workin too hard, hehe.  Sta is best used when a cleric will be using complete heals.<br />

<br />
Using a mid lvl druid (only 16pt shield) my ranger did 10-24 in 4 hours. 24-30 the next night...30-37 the night after that.<br />
<br />
Damage shield wasn't cuttin it as well then...switched to shaman for PLing at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Personally I like the monk / shammy combo when PL'ing screw damage shields.  The shammy buffs / heals / slows and the monk beats the mobs to low life and FD's all the while the lowbie is whacking at the critter and gets the exp at the end.  You keep your skills up and it;s faster killing than with a wimpy dmg shield.</div></div><hr />
