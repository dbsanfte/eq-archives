<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just reading through some posts I was ignoring, and all the flames and such within, and I just had to make a comment.<br />
<br />
Shamans are not overpowered, and they are not gimped.  I think they are just about right.<br />
<br />
Now I'm only lvl 47, but this isn't my first character in EQ, and I've seen plenty of uber shaman doing their thing...  EQ is all about giving and taking, and for the most part, the bad aspects of the shaman class balance out with the good.<br />
<br />
For example, yes, you can't nuke/dot uber mobs as the &quot;best Dot&quot; thread is arguing about, but you're not alone - many other EQ classes can't either.  At least you can do other usefull stuff - heck, even if it's pulling out your weapon and meleeing you're still doing more damage than that magician that cannot use pets because of bad pathing...<br />
<br />
Yes, I think some slightly better heals would be nice - I'm not talking complete heal, but maybe something that heals a bit more for a better mana ratio so that groups can *get by* without a cleric - I think we all agree we didn't start shamans to be clerics - we just want to backup heal in a pinch.  Verant is working on it too...<br />
<br />
Yes, there's no lvl 59 or 60 pet.  It would be nice to have - but let's be realistic here folks, a lvl 60 shaman can take stuff no other class can even think of taking - our slows make us powerful, and a bad arse pet may actually be unbalancing...<br />
<br />
Drop rates on high spells stink - that's a downside - but not the end of the world either - sort of makes up for our easy as pie epic, wouldn't you say?<br />
<br />
And of course the list goes on and on.  It just irritates me how people always want the best for themselves, so many greedy people.  After playing numerous other classes, I can say that the shaman isnt' without flaws, but they are pretty darn fun.  We aren't gods as jealous rangers on these boards would have you believe, nor do we suck because he can't heal like a cleric and torpor doesn't appear in your bank vault upon dinging lvl 60.  <br />
<br />
Sorry - maybe this belongs in the rant forum, but I just get tired of people bad mouthing the Shaman class (both ways) when it's not true.  Enjoy your shaman for what they are - a reasonably well balanced class in EQ that's fun to play.<br />

<br />
/agree Kongar - we rock.<br />
<br />
It's all relative, and it's easy to take things for granted.  I can't tell you how many times I've started casting regen on a cleric - then stopped myself remembering &quot;Oh yeah, you can't cannibalize!  LOL !!!&quot;  I see shaman power the most when playing a melee alt... having to pay for SoW, no ability to root or gate or lev or invis or see invis or ultravision, no buffs or debuffs, no regen or self-heals, no haste or slow, and in exchange for all that I still get my clock cleaned by a single dark blue mob?  Bah!<br />
<br />
Uberness can make melee fun again (fungi tunic + uber haste item + uber weapons + jboots = fun monkee... and my brother {level 60 warrior} casts so many spells from items that he's constantly getting clarity...) but those are defnitely not the norm- and a shaman twinked to that same level of uberness is more fun still !!<br />
<br />
Last night in Maiden's Eye my group had a bad overpull- cleric was low on mana to start and we had a toiler, two four arms- one a cleric, and a Xi Vius in the camp (all red to me, and we had no enchanter).  I was root-parking, slowing, re-hasting (dispells), healing, and canning like crazy... and we made it through without a single death.  Even though I was the lowest level member in that group, I believe I contributed the most to the success of that battle.  It's times like that it's hard not to feel that we rock.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree, /appluad and all that stuff :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you look at things from a different angle... Shamans can solo several different dragons in WW.  What do you give a class that can solo Yeldema in under 5 minutes?  yeah...exactly, you dont give them anything.  <br />
<br />
Also, besides the fact that alchemy has no market, and its pieces are so amazingly expensive, its amazingly powerfull.  We can make potions for spells we otherwise wouldnt have, thats power right there.  Obviously if things cost a bit less it would be even better, but the potential power makes up for that.<br />
<br />
Also, Bigguss, its so tempting to laugh at those clerics and druids cause they cant canni :).  I love trying to make them jealous by making wierd binds such as<br />
/em bites of his arm and munches thoughtfully<br />
<br />
or stuff like that =-) Those clerics go a medding, i eat my leg :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman is not a pet class, therefore I don't want 59 or 60 pet. I would like to take this opportunity to thank VI for giving us, a non pet user class, quite fine and usable pet. <br />
<br />
I would like to thank also VI that we are without competition the 2nd best healing class around, cabable of running (exp) groups in many cases as prim healer. <br />
<br />
I would like to thank VI for the cannibalization, which allowes along all the levels a fast and enjoyable gameplay without boring downtimes.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank VI for the amazing fact that as cabable as we are in solo, we are still in very high demand for groups. We have no equals in this. Many cases it's just one or the other.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank VI for very versatile class, I hate classes which have only one or two skills to use or spells. As shaman I have so many choises what to do in groups and still be beneficial that it hurts.<br />
<br />
Only thing I have issue with is the end game spells. I don't think shamans need upgrades to heals, but as 60 shaman I would like to have the spells I should have (Torpor, malo...). Now I'm just one shaman running around at 60 still chloroblasting.<br />
<br />
Thanks for shaman class VI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah....I hate to through rain on a parade, but I play both a shammy and a druid, and personally I think a druid is much, much more efficient solo (the shaman is better grouped). Here is what I see with my druid:<br />
<br />
- roots last forever and stack with a 9min ensnare, my shammy roots break all the time<br />
- root dotting leaves me with more HP/mana after a kill than my shaman has. <br />
- drones of doom line appear to almost never be resisted, I get more resists with the shaman disease line than than the druid line of DoTs. <br />
- teleports simply make life better. Nothing beats binding in a far away luclin zone, killing til encumbred, porting to Misty to bank then gating back. <br />
<br />
Now for the negatives:<br />
<br />
- too many druids (this is getting to be a problem with every decent class actually)<br />
- no high end role. As mobs get harder damage shields go down in effectiveness while all slows only grow in effectiveness. <br />
- healing and buffing. A must but a negative for both classes. Its just plain boring. <br />
- DoTs don't compare in damage to shammy DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Grotte, add one more thing to your negatives list.<br />
-shaman solo summoning mobs better than a druid, assuming a druid can even solo them.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss Conaan, he's made a good point and supported it with 2 decent examples.  I will not disagree that he's trolling, but who cares.  BTW Conaan, I love the class and agree with the sentiment of the thread, even many of the points made.  I have never played a druid, and I don't think I qualify as a noob anymore (57 levels later). /shrug<br />
<br />
Shaman are a great, well balanced class.  All that really matters at the end of the day though is I have fun playing my shamie.  I also enjoy my alts, but the only thing I miss in my shaman is that my groups don't let me pull (some shaman pull, but I rarely get to play puller, not really part of the way I play my class).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually,<br />
<br />
I quite agree with Grotte.  Shamans in my opinion are kinda lousy soloers efficiency wise.  Seems that I burn an awful amount of mana per kill, and the only saving grace is cannibalise.  Shaman are however, STRONG soloers.  As in I could care less if I'm getting beat on.  That's something I definatley tried to avoid with my mage (three hits and I was dead)  =)  I personally enjoy the power and the &quot;in your face&quot; sort of tank mage thing...<br />
<br />
I personally try to avoid soloing - I find that it's usually pretty easy to find a tank partner - and this is like twice as fast (complete opinion).  <br />
<br />
Sorry for degrading the thread with a flame, but to reiterate my first post - shamans aren't without issues - I'm just saying that we are a lot better off than many classes, and so far, I'm having more fun with my shaman that any other class in EQ.  Call me a noob, whatever - maybe my tune will change upon dinging 60, but for now I'm sticking with my original thought - Shamans Rule and you can't take that away from me ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Conaan, <br />
<br />
I believe they were referring to top end mobs that a shaman CAN solo, not t he speed in which said mobs are soloed.  <br />
<br />
<br />
If you want raw speed and output of xp, Druid/Wiz all day long and twice on Sunday.<br />
<br />
If you want the class that can take on a bad ass mob, head to head, get summoned 37 times and still walk away calling it his/her bitch, that's us.  <br />
<br />
I still like having a dotted mob in camp as an add and having my group freak out and being able to tell them &quot;Don't worry about it, I'll tank it&quot; and have them believe me (and be telling the truth at the same time).<br />
<br />
As for the BGH/Multiple Shaman issue, I don't believe any of that was addressed in these posts. As long as shaman continue to be an underplayed class I will continue to enjoy playing one.  When we get to the numbers of the Drood community and the previous numbers of Necros (ok I'm dating myself there..) then it will be time to find another class.  But until then, i&quot;m happy being a troll (the Grobb kind, not the Verb)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">funny, druids usually envy me my soloing abilities :)  both for amount of xp and what i can solo, necro logged me in abit and said after:hell, i thought i was a good soloer, but this class is godly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;Shamans in my opinion are kinda lousy soloers efficiency wise&quot;<br />
<br />
I currently have 3 active chars and one portal mule (my very first, day 1 eq character): a 48 monk, 41 shaman, 24 druid and 51 druid (the mule). My monk, equipped in full wu's no weapons, with 2x 65hp rings and 2x 35hp earrings and gobs of bandages is a better solo class than either my 51 druid or my shaman. Why? no deaths, no downtime, and massive almost unresistable melee damage. <br />
<br />
Something is terribly wrong when a melee class is the most efficient soloer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ya monks rule  that's why i try to partner with them - exp flies when I'm slowing/healing/buffing, and the monk does all the damage with doggie.   Shaman/monk has to be the best combo in the game for exp.<br />
<br />
You know, I've actually had some pretty good luck with paladins believe it or not.  They seem to actually work better than a warrior, but still not as good as a monk.  But paladins can heal themselves, and when played properly, a paladin can actually kick some tail.  Then again, maybe i've just playing with uber twinks too so.....  :)<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want the class that can take on a bad ass mob, head to head, get summoned 37 times and still walk away calling it his/her bitch, that's us.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Each class has a moment where they really shine whether group or soloing.<br />
<br />
Druids/wizards rock for the quad kiting/burn them all down in a group moments (dungeons a tad harder though for that).<br />
<br />
Necros for being able to solo practically anywhere.<br />
<br />
Mages for having good offense and some kick ass pets to boot.<br />
<br />
Enchanters for charm, slow and some not too bad spells (I know several that are soloing to 60..give them dire charm and they are really gross).<br />
<br />
But shamans...the love of my life.  We do everything. No zone is too hard to solo in (indoor/outdoor).   Summoning mobs are nothing special, slow owns a mob (good bye damage), dots that are decent, kickass mana regeneration (Can 5 + torpor = any caster's wet dream of mana regeneration), solid buffing and healing line up, debuffs that are sickening and decent AC and HPs to boot.    We are not the perfect class but if you want one that can get thru most things relatively unscathed well this class can do it.<br />
<br />
For instance, today I was with a 53 cleric, 2 x 54 warriors, 54 bard, 57 wizard and 60 shaman (me).  We were doing bar in sebilis with puller messed up and brought in 4.  No biggie..quick malo to aid CC with bard, slows around the clock, speed refreshes on melees and dots on the main target per usual.  Can 5 twice to FM and kept on rocking.  Room spawned on us so at one point we hit 8 mobs in room.  Cleric was running lom (no clarity or song due to CC) so I took over healing as well as refreshing slows, doing malo on new mobs and dotting others.  End of fight, I have FM, group cheering each other for great job (they did well and I salute them) and cleric realizing how dangerous a well played shaman is.  ;)   Twice evac'd was called and I forced them to hold.    Thank you shaman mana regeneration, healing and dots.    <br />
<br />
What is great about shamans is the same as chanters...we make the impossible possible and add that extra edge to a group that allows it to go beyond its expectations.</div></div><hr />

As I read this I could completely see what was happening during this fight.  The same thing has been done but on a lesser level by myself and a few different groups.  Without cana/regen TONS of groups I have been in would not have been able to take out what we intended to kill.<br />
<br />
I love my shaman.</div></div><hr />

These post, can only be intended to say to VI, hey this class is &quot;GODLY&quot;.. go ahead and nerf us some more as we sit stagnant, watching every other class get stronger and Shaman less powerful and less useful.<br />
<br />
The only logical assumptions, in regards to your motivation are; class envy (you’re a Druid) or you don't know what you are talking about (you’re a newb).  Either way, out of ignorance or spite, you are doing what you can to weaken the Shaman in comparison to other classes.<br />
<br />
The fact that you do not sign your post or identify your toon doesn’t help your credibility much either.<br />

I personally prefer to read a message board with lots of happy people saying &quot;Look what I did, isn't that cool&quot; and &quot;I like my shaman&quot;, than a board full of pathetic whiners saying &quot;verant hates shamans&quot;.<br />

And calling someone a &quot;newb&quot; just marks you as the kind of uber fool I wish to avoid. And Kongar did sign his post - he signed it &quot;Kongar&quot; - what more do you want, his home address?</div></div><hr />

a) There are 59 lvls before 60 that most people have to play.<br />
b) &quot;Shamans are not overpowered, and they are not gimped. I think they are just about right.&quot; isn't the same thing as &quot;OMG Shammies Rulez YUO!  /cybor plz.&quot;<br />
c) This is usually a pretty polite board...no need to go around calling people newb or druid just becuase they enjoy playing a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If I hear one more person say &quot;you can solo nest dragons so you have no issues&quot; I am going to pull my eyes out.  Yes, it is fun to do now and again, but every time I go to WW, those dragons are up.  You know why?  Because it isn't worthwhile to kill them.  We are unmached defensive soloists, but our overall soloability is overrated.  We are outdone for soloing axp by several other classes, and there are very few mobs that drop worthwhile loot that we can solo that others cannot.  That big thread about killing Yeldema after dozens had already done it was the worst thing to ever happen to our class.<br />
<br />
That being said, I think shamans are pretty much fine.  Good solo, great duo/trioists, solid full group members.  If every class was as dominant as monks are, the game would get trivial very fast!  Stacking is the only real issue, and if they can get dot stacking to work (as they have said they are trying) that problem wil be pretty much taken care of (I would think a good target would be to put out sustained damage slightly less than a pally/sk).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Oh man....DoT stacking would rock. If you look at the classes use magical dmg spells from a group perspective, DD is the way to go. It stacks. You can increase dmg output simply by adding more wizards or other nukers. Not so with the DoT casters.</div></div><hr />
