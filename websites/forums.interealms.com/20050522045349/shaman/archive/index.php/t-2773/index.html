<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tonight was the most awesome fight i have ever been in.<br />
Last week we killed Emp and it was a normal fight(as normal as emp fight can be), everything was clean i think only handful of people died. Was our 1st kill great rush!. He went down fairly fast 25 min ( he has 2million hp so take awhile)<br />
<br />
Well tonight we had about 14 people less than the night we took him down, couple few clerics, alot less rogues,wizards so DPS was quite a bit less. I was so pumped while curing tanks of curse and tring to keep 2 mages and 1 cleric and my self constantly topored so cleric could mod rod and mages could make them. as well as other shaman duties. even had to deal with a couple unexpected adds but after a staggering long fight 58+ minutes. Emp went down for 2nd time and now everyone has powersources.<br />
<br />
All i gotta say is i have never worked so hard in my life in that whole 58 minutes i didnt have 1 second i was casting on someone or clicking a mod rod. It was insane and fun as hell.<br />
<br />
Now i just gotta get a couple more shards to complete my key then its of to VT. <br />
