<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I read that emails were sent out for another wave of beta testing before the open beta.  And once again, I wasn't invited /cry  (I fill out a beta app so long ago, it's probably lost or something).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I also read that many folks that were already in beta were given (accidently?) another beta invite.  If you or anyone you know has a second account, let me know, I'll be glad to take it off your hands!! :-D.<br />
<br />
Can't wait to start playing this game, as you can see from the sig, my EQ life is pretty much over.  Been wallowing in SWG for a bit til WoW goes live or I get in beta, but I'm bored as hell in SWG still lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah I can't foresee myself playing EQ any more, not seriously anway.  I'm just markin time till WoW comes out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah i was in the stress test for about 2 weeks.  I really enjoyed playing WOW but i havent played EQ since May so i'm MMO starved.  Of course after 2 weeks of stress testing i did not get an invite either.  Hell i was good enough when i played fileplanet $15 for sub. but not for closed beta.  So if anyone has an extra account shoot me a PM.  Withdrawl is so bad i might return to EQ LOL.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nooooo!! Don't go back! lol<br />
<br />
I haven't even had the urge to log back in to EQ.  I play SWG for maybe 30 minutes and then I'm bored.<br />
<br />
My wife bought Sims 2 and *blush* I find it pretty entertaining :).  I like Sims type games, the building part and the part about trying to hook up with some babes (hope the wife doesn't read this!).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After the stress test, I couldn't find myself logging into EQ either for more then a short time... The combat was... wow, just so slow comparatively.  I wont get into a rant about that, though.<br />
<br />
I occupied my time with a lot of things.  Morrowind (Still a good game!  With the expansion packs there is high level content now too)  and Star Ocean: 'Till the End of Time for the playstation 2 - a very good roleplaying game with one wieeerd plot twist going for it :)   <br />
<br />
That, and being a forum troll on the WoW site :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WoW, yet another wave of invites eh ?<br />
<br />
Im kinda diapointed i havent been selected yet. Oh well what can you do right ? On the plus side i think that this heavy invite phase for the beta bodes well for the gold target date.</div></div><hr />
