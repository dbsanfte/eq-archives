<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duhara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well once again VI has made a mockery of their testing of focus items.  All three affliction type focus items do not effect Poison based dots.  They seemed to have put in duration &gt; then 36 not &gt;= to 36 so Poison line is the only dot line, and basically the only offensive spell group not effected by some type of focus item.  <br />
<br />
Anyone with connections or a relationship with VI might want to make a comment to the effect and see if we can get it fixed.<br />

<br />
I don't see why the new focus items won't work with Shaman and Necro based poison DoTs since the duration of VoS, EB and BoN is 42 secs not 36 secs.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong on this but I was under the impression that a tick = 6 secs and our poison DoTs run for 7 ticks = 42 secs overall!<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It does work with the poison DoTs...sometimes...it's just that effect is random, or something similar to that.  It's less understandable the more I use it.<br />
<br />
Took about 5 casts of Ebolt to get the Dustscryer's Crystal Ball to trigger.  Works the same for Root for some reason, with some casts triggering it, and some not.<br />
<br />
With Turgur's it seems to work every cast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Very very odd all around.  There's going to be a crapload of fixes to go with all of this.</div></div><hr />
