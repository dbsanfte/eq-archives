<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>flashman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe this isn't the proper forum for this, but its the best communty I know of and its the most active board, so here goes.<br />
<br />
My everquest account was recently terminated because of my credit card expiring. I hadn't activated the new card yet so since I couldn't be billed my account was terminated. This morning (now) when I attempted to resignup to EQ using the new credit card I found to my dismay that whenever I attempted to choose what province I was from it booted me out of the EQ client. Has anyone experienced this before? And does anyone know of a way to fix it? It would be appreciated if anyone could help me out on this. I attempted to post on Station techincal support forum, but you need to be an everquest subscriber to do so &gt;_&lt;. So if someone could post over there this problem it would be appreciated also.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly, the best way to fix it is to call customer service at Sony.  Amazingly, they have pretty darn good phone customer service.  You'll have to dig up the number off their site or something though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Might try reinstalling if you can't get through tech support.  Sounds like a software issue, and reinstalling can fix that.  Of course that may take hours, maybe you have another computer or a friends place (who has eq) that you could sign up on?</div></div><hr />

When I re-subscribed my accounts, I didn't actually fill out anything in the EQ client, EQ was closed and Internet Explorer automatically opened to The Station's login prompt where it then directed me to the subscription page and I re-subscribed with no problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im going to take a trip up to my friends house to subscribe now, never even occured to me.<br />
<br />
It's definitly just a SOE conspiaracy to keep canucks out of the game though.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about that - If that's the case, we haven't even managed to keep them off the dev team. &gt;:)<br />
<br />
If we have a registration problem, I haven't heard of it.  Please PM me here if this continues for you.  Or, for that matter, if you can PM me what you tried to do, including all of the info, I'd like to ask our testing folks to take a look at it.<br />
<br />
Our login and subscription services can usually be fixed/updated independently of the game's update cycle.  If there's something we can find and fix quickly, I'd very much like to.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Flashman, I had the exact same problem when I renabled my account 4 days ago from a 3 month layoff. Basically if SOE is listening this is what happens. I log in with my station name and get the box that says &quot;bla bla your subscription has ran out do you want to renable it?&quot; I click yes and it takes me to the screen where you have to fill out your credit card number and address and every friggin time I clicked on the credit card expiration date pull-down menu I crashed.. I thought it was just a fluke the first crash but after 3 crashes in a row I was going &quot;huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, what I had to end up doing was go to the SOE Live website at http://eqlive.station.sony.com/  and just renable my account from there and all was good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kegiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dunno if this is the case, but it might have something to do with the fact that they have reactivated dead accounts from 7/30/03 - 8/7/03?<br />
<br />
Might not be able to reactivate a dead account till that time expires.</div></div><hr />
