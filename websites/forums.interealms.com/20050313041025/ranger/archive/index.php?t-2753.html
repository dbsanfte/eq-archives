He's not undead, he does eat the dead though.<br />
<br />
His drop table is very mixed, some real junk, some exceptional.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise yeah all the stats posted seem to be right on , oh btw to slow him bring tash malo and oos any of those missing and no he will not slow.Oh and his AEs are Disease based get Epuration and Greater potions of purity for him DMF does nothing here.<br />

Impossible anywhre but test because 20% into the fight  5 druids would show up say they were camping Lodizal and attempt to kill it from the shaman.<br />
<br />
When are you going to solo that dragon?</div></div><hr />
