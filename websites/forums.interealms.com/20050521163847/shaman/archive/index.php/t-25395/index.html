<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>takk the silent one</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I equipted my 67 pet with the one of the latest mage goods ( Summoned: Staff of  the North Wind)  I buffed pet to proc like crazy and found the warning message that pet was not high enough for the weapon....  what gives..   I was checking forumn if 67  pet had &quot;levels&quot; or not but I though I read that they always gives the max pet  level. Anyone have this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know for certain that the 67 pet can proc the Fireblades. I don't think I've given dogdog the staffs though, but it would be odd for them not too work when the fireblades do.<br />
<br />
Silly question, but are you sure you had the 67 pet out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the 67 pet is level 63. I know for a fact that True Spirit procs the north wind staff things, so there's no reason the 67 one shouldn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is it possible you summoned the 61 pet by mistake? He cannot proc the new mage weapons, but the 67 pet can for SURE. <br />
<br />
Another possibility I just thought of. Does the level of your summoned pet have any relationship to the level of the caster? I know that there is a level &quot;range&quot; for summoned pets, I have seen lots of Mages and Necros kill pets and re-summon when they are &quot;too low&quot;. Maybe, a lvl 67 summoning a 67 pet can summon a 61 dog, which may not be able to proc. I am not sure, I never bothered to pay much attention to such things, given the overall dismall quality of our pets over the course of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been told more than once that our pet spells always summon what was once the max of the listed range, so now it's a fixed pet level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yer changed it a couple of years or so ago that everytime you summon a pet (irrespective of which class) you'll get the highest possible for that spell.<br />

OK, wasnt sure. Like I said, its something I dont pay much attention too. About the only thing I can think of is he summoned the lower pet instead of the 67. I buy pet toys every day, and have never seen the &quot;too low&quot; message, and I always see my pet proccing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">According to the history part of the staff of the northwind (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemhistory.html?id=77507), it procs for level 60+ pets. The lowest level procking weapon for pets would be the fist of ixiblat, which should proc for all shaman pets.</div></div><hr />

Tried it again ... seems to work now... I can only assume my bad.</div></div><hr />
