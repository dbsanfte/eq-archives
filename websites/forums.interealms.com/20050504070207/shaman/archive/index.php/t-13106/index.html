<br />
Truth be told this is driving me nuts.  Someone share the knowledge with those less informed please, or just point me to another thread (I did a search but didn't come up with anything).<br />

So, on behalf of the posters on the Cruibicle, I would like to say: <br />

GOTCHA!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Drajjen,<br />
Giving your pet 2 weapons will allow it to dual wield. I'm not sure if this works with the 34 or 39 pet, but it certainly works with the 44 and above pets.  I commonly use shivs from Dulak, but remember I'm poor and cheap.  I've heard of some better-off Shamman actully buying weapons that have a proc (velium, etc) for thier puppies!!  It all depends how much pp you have lying around I guess.  I have aslo heard that gnoll hide lariets (?) are usefull for the stun factor.  Good Luck!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go to the bazaar and splurge. Alot of mages offer their summoned weapons for as little as 5pp per. Add a muzzle and go soloing in UP like you own the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your pet dual wields already.  This seems to encourage him to do so on a more frequent basis.  And yes, our Companion Spirit (34) does indeed do so, however his chance of getting that off hand (off paw?) attack is slight.<br />
<br />
Velium weaps are easily harvestable off giants, and gnoll hide lariats drop copiously inside Paw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ha, I see thanks all.  And yes there are plenty of post through the search feature, but I like a complete idiot was typing Project Alfa instead of Project Alpha.  So there you go...<br />
<br />
At any rate, one question:  Do you have to hand both weapons to the pet at once or can you give him one, and then later when you get another give him that one?  Reason I ask is the other night my pet had a 1hb weapon and the text clearly showed he was crushing the mob, but later I handed him a 1hs and the whole thing switched, he no longer was crushing but was slashing and I never saw a crush message again.<br />
<br />
Just curious here...<br />
