<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>junaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All,<br />
<br />
Well I have been back playing now for about a month after my year and a half off.  I have visited Lucin (breifly) mainly the newb zone and I have been to a few PoP zones (PoI, PoJ, PoN and PoD) and I have tried a few adventures in LNoD.  What I haven't seen is anyone/group going to or playing in LoY.  <br />
<br />
I'm currently 55 and wiould like to get 56 really soon but don't have the time always to group.  So I have been reading these boards and alot of people seem to think that LoY seems to be a great place for a shaman to solo at.  I would really like to give this place a try, I love new places and exploring.<br />
<br />
What I need to know is:<br />
<br />
a.  How to I get to a LoY zone?  Didn't figure there were any PoK books (as LoY came after PoP) Can I only get there from a druid/wizzy port?<br />
<br />
b.  Are there any places to sell there?  Will I be KoS as a Barbarian Shaman?<br />
<br />
c.  Any hunting tip (eg.  what zones would be good to hunt in at 55).  <br />
<br />
d.  Most people are telling me that Lucin is a waste for an expasion.  Anyone know of good places there that I could get to explore/xp.<br />
<br />
I also have a friend (56 Pally) that might be hunting with me at times, so if you have tips for places that we can group and xp that would be great as well.<br />
<br />
Any/all information is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check these two links:<br />
<br />
http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=3924<br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/zones.html?zstrat=180<br />
<br />
After that, check the &quot;50 to 60&quot; forum for LOY and Dulak, then you know everything you need to know.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>junaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hi Emmhim,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the post.  Both those links were really good reads.  I was actually on the boat in Stoneburnt the other day, but couldn't figure out what it was for (waited 20 minutes to see if it would move).  So I know where to go now :)<br />
<br />
At least now I can go explore.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The boats in Dulak are a really good spot but often the ones you can do solo at 55 are camped up.  A spot I liked a lot is a little hard to describe but I'll try.  Using the Eqatlas map of Dulak, find boat #1 and follow the point of it to a large building that's kinda shaped like half an &quot;H&quot; and it has a smaller rectangular building next to it, with an ally in between the two.  Set up toward the back of that ally (but not against the walls of the bigger building as you can pull aggro from inside).  The smaller rectangular building is the treasure sorter warehouse and is where I suggest pulling from.  There is a spawn outside that sometimes spawns a named in it's place.  And the spawns inside should be easily single pulled.  Just be careful as there is one guard that wonders down the alley from time to time that you will need to kill.  The cash is good, the xp is not too bad (some might be lt blue at 55 i don't remember) but it's never camped.</div></div><hr />
