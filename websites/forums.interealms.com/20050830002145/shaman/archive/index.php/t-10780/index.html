I'm assuming &quot;grobb2&quot; will have a dock that leads to the Gukf of Gunthak that takes you to the Crypt of Nadox that you have to get through to get to the Broken Skull Clan's territory. We may be looking at another linear expansion... &quot;You have to go here to go there&quot;<br />
<br />
Let's only hope it's simply zone lines rather than keys and flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gunthak is supposedly the zone off of LOIO that was never created, but I went there to check if there was a zone in now, but nope, going all the way on both side = staying in LOIO &gt;_&lt;, I could be wrong but thats what I heard Gunthak is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Veksar was supposed to be in LoIO, under the temple (another kedge type dungeon), but they never put it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gulf of Gunthak is on the EQ map as being the area of water SW of Grobb and in which Broken Skull Isle is sited.<br />
<br />
Personally I hope connectivity is Feerrot-&gt;Gulf (using a zone connection on one of the south running rivers in Feerot), and not Grobb-&gt;Grobb2-&gt;Gulf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is anyone else a little worryed about the new troll home? i mean from the sounds of things you are going to have to buy LoY to play a troll when it comes out since they will start in the new troll place unless they give the option to start in neriak also, wich i doubt they will do :mad: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Reading the lore on the EQ site, the Grobb Trolls (Clan Ykesha) would be opposed to Clan Broken Skull. That might make any &quot;new&quot; troll city off limits to old trolls. (i.e Good Grobb factions = KoS to Broken Skulls) Add to that that a lot of players (good and evil) have hammered their faction with the Pirates of Gunthak.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see how they handle adding new factions that are (or would be) directly opposed to the current factions that are commonly used in the game. (Example: Adding a Plane of Underfoot after nearly everyone in the game is max KOS to the faction from raiding the Hole)<br />
<br />
Another thought, most players 40+ are most likely KOS on the Frogloks of Guk faction... Unless you've done a lot of faction work on the dead side. Will that effect faction in the new Froggy City? Is Guk now off limits to good races? Since they just pulled this storyline outta their arses, there was no way for people to know they'd be ruining faction with a future good race.<br />
<br />
The new frogs may be &quot;evolved&quot;, but they still got family and friends living in the Guk area...</div></div><hr />

These frogs are on diferent faction, in the lore it says something like &quot;some of our kind went astray&quot; these are the frogs that agro etc. If you killed the new goodie frogs well then...................</div></div><hr />
