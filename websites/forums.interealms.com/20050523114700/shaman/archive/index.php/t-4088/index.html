<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a couple of questions about using EQ windows. I wanted to ask before I downloaded it.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Is it against the EULA to use it?<br />
<br />
2) What would be the min system requirements to be able to use it?<br />
<br />
I had a second acct that I cancelled a while back and was contemplating using it again.<br />
<br />
BTW my system settings are 1ghz thunderbird,256mb ram and 32mb gforce</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not too sure about min requirements, I have friends with good systems that it doesn't work for them.  It is not against the EULA because it does not alter gameplay.  just gotta DL it and see if it works for ya.<br />
<br />
lazy link eqw.eqhacker.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your system config should be fine.  I'm running a 1.4Ghz Thunderbird, 512 RAM, GeForce2 32MB and have no issues.  In fact, I'm running it now.  :)<br />
<br />
Running two of them at a time is laggy, but doable.  I avoid it when I can (just use the crappy old second PC if I can.)<br />
<br />
Enjoy.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">couldnt live with out .. id probly quit eq if i didnt have eqw<br />
<br />
i dont 2box but i hear alot people complaining about crappy frame rate with 2 accounts up <br />
<br />
--every option set to lowest crappiest quiality (ingame and out of game)<br />
--desktop color dept at 16bit <br />
--also heard installing 2 different directories of EQ, game sped things up.. hogs up double the harddrive space and each need to be patched seperalty <br />
<br />
well dont take my word on it ... its just what i hear from others <br />
<br />
but i hope these rumors help<br />
<br />
and 256 is kinda low for .. might wanna double that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, EQW *IS* against the EULA. Verant has been known to ban some people for using it. Some people have said they'll occasionally check public message boards and use that info to ban people. There is no way without them violating privacy laws for them to tell if you're using it or not unless you admit to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's third party software, which is unsupported by VI and thus against the EULA.  Any third party software is a no-no, regardless of if it &quot;alters gameplay&quot; or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That system should be fine, except you'll want more ram.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with the others that more RAM would be needed if you want to run two accounts on 1 PC. You will also need a decent size monitor. With the new interface I think it would be difficult to play in a lower resolution than 800x600 so two windows is atleast 1600 pixels horizontal resolution.<br />
<br />
The only place in the EULA where third-party software is mentioned:<br />
<br />
&quot;9. You may not use any third party software to modify the Software to change Game play&quot;<br />
<br />
Now if you cant tell whether or not people you are playing with use EQW then I would say it isnt modifying gameplay. Atleast not anymore than reading a book / watching TV / eating does :)<br />
<br />
Apart from that EQW doesnt modify one single byte of the EQ-software. But using Notepad to alter your UI setup would actually be a breach of this EULA :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Patito,<br />
<br />
Do you personally know someone that has been banned for using it? Everytime I ask I usually get a no but my best friends, sisters,husbands, cousin got banned etc. If they were using it and macro hacks at the same time then yes I can understand them getting banned but not for just using EQW.<br />
<br />
I doubt VI would ban someone for using EQW as they will probably end up losing $26 per month, because most of the people I know use it to run 2 accounts. <br />
<br />
I use it to run two accounts, my main on one and my sales mule/personal taxi on the other.<br />
<br />
I run two accounts on my pc (1Ghz 1gb ram Geforece 3 Ti200), and I know for sure that the ram makes the biggest difference.  I would also recommend putting nosound.txt in both of your EQ directories as sound causes really bad lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, someone in my raid group back on Rallos was banned. He said the only thing he's done wrong is use EQW. Not sure how they found out. I think he was talking about it in /ooc channels or something.<br />
<br />
Also, just because it's 3rd party doesn't mean it's a no-no. There's a program that you type a string command while in game and it will alert you with audio responses when buffs run out, or a spawn pops. Verant has said that was ok. Also, all log-parsing programs are cool. Many people run those in the background to see their DPS per fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">think of this. EQW is used by like 40% if not more of the players these days.  The devs themselves prolly use it too.  VI knows about the mass amounts of ppl using the product.  If it was against the EULA, they would issue a statement as such.  I don't think they wanna ban 40% of the player population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's gotten to the point that I assume all of my friends that I party and raid with use eqw.  I'm suprised when I find out that people aren't using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wow you're the first person I've met who actually knows someone that got banned!<br />
<br />
I'll still take my chances. I like being able to browse whilst I med.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">People who say they were banned and 'all they were doing' was using EQW are lying.  More likely, they were using eqw in combo with a hex editor to change their run speed or something.  Or, they were using some other exploit.  If you believe otherwise, you are an idiot.<br />
<br />
I use eqw all the time.  Thta way, I don't have to have a huge stack of maps/alchemy formulas/spells/quests/etc spread out all over my desk.  When I see a piece of gear I like, I can immediately go to khazams and see where to get it.  It is a godsend.<br />
<br />
Hope the guys at VI are reading this:<br />
<br />
I USE   E  Q  W!<br />
<br />
You want to ban a player from day 1 for that, then bite me.<br />
<br />
<br />
ps- To the people that get your panties in a know over whether it is against the EULA (it's not, go read the bullet that mentions 3rd party sw, and stop using hearsay), I gotta ask, have you ever driven 60 in a 55?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, I feel like an EQ Luddite - <br />
<br />
1) What is EQW?<br />
<br />
2) How can you run 2 accounts on one computer when the first account takes up your whole screen? (At least it does on mine)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">EQw is UNDETECTABLE if you are not an idiot about it.  Legally, VI has the right to scan your EQ folder on your computer for missing files and such (a la the patcher) but that is the ONLY thing on your comp they can scan.  What does this mean? DON'T PUT EQW IN YOUR EQ FOLDER!  Just put it on your C: drive and you will be fine.  <br />
<br />
I have been usin EQw for over a year now and never had a problem.  Now, this is the only hearsay you will get from me, but my friend who applied for the GM program said that the GMs use an interface similar to EQw that lets them run EQ in a window.  Don't know if that's true or just a rumor.  <br />
<br />
If VI really started goin after people hard for EQw (which they can't legally, unless you are an aforementioned idiot, or computer illiterate) they would lose the majority of their player base.  They know this, that's why there isn't really any kind of movement against it, other than the occasional banning from someone that was doing something else, like it was said above, they were probably hexing as well.  <br />
<br />
So, in summary:<br />
EQw is against the EULA, but no one cares (VI included)<br />
EQw is undetectable unless your an idiot or computer illiterate<br />
EQw is the only reason a lot of people keep playing EQ (VI even put a goddamn game inside their game to try and keep people entertained...gems anyone?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) What is EQW?<br />
<br />
2) How can you run 2 accounts on one computer when the first account takes up your whole screen? (At least it does on mine) <br />
<br />
Lol <br />
<br />
1. EQW = EverQuest Windows it lets you run EQ in a window. check out EQ Windows if you want a copy (http://www.eqwindows.com/) <br />
<br />
2. I run my desk top at 1152 by 864, I then run one copy in a window at 1024 by 768 and a second copy in another window at 800 by 600. I position the windows so that I can always see my chat and hp boxes on the main window, and I can see the hp bar on my secondary window, regardless of which window is on top. This has been made even easier with the new UI as I'e redesigned the two screens so I can always see all the important info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">First rule about EQW is:<br />
<br />
1. You don't talk about eqw.<br />
<br />
....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Haleice:  That's creepy- that's exactly the same way I run it (1152x864 main, 1024x786 eq1, 800x600 eq2, interfaces designed to allow relevant parts of both to be seen.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Must say I know alot of people that use it. I tried it out a while back and had trouble getting the window a size I was happy with - all too small, tried changing my desktop res but didnt find anything that comfortable.<br />
<br />
Also found it caused a fair bit of graphics lag while playing so stopped using it. Any tips or am I just not giving it a fair shot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Seredith:  No, it's definitely a lag-monster, and it's definitely worse when trying to run two at once.  Honestly, I only run two sessions on one computer when I need to have three sessions going (the second goes to my junky computer.)<br />
<br />
It's best for running just one regular EQ session, at a resolution one notch under your desktop resolution.  In that configuration, I've found it's only a tiny bit more laggy than normal.  One thing that bugs me... when I minimize the window, the graphics engine seems to still be doing all the work of drawing the thing- bah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sleep deprivation plus a funny bastage and a bad heart condition = dead me! now stop that funny stuff!  <br />
<br />
<br />
also eqw is great, right now i am only running a 8 mb card, but when i was using it, it was awesome, hopefully, VI will decide that no one is going to ever make eq into what uo was for Macro-ing,  and at least give us porn... err wesites...  must sleepnow</div></div><hr />
