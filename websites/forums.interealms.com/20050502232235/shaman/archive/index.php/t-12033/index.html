<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It does violate the EULA, but it appears sony doesn't care unless a big company (Like EBay) is making money off it. I think SoE also *realizes* that they make alot of money by letting this continue, because new people buy higher lvl characters, instead of lvl'ing one up from scratch, which may attract more people, who don't want to take forever to &quot;beat&quot; the game; and also because it lets long time gamers, gain characters to 2 box with their older characters... both of which just keep bringing the $$ into SoE's pockets.<br />
<br />
This will probably have no affect on these boards, because afaik EQShaman was shutdown awhile ago, so Douche bag.. err Yantis must have just resurrected it.  And for anyone who doesn't want to support that assmunch, there is always Fuudce's site (linked in his sig) and that new site by lenine..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">2) What impact might this have on this site?<br />
<br />
It has 0 impact on the shaman's crucible.  <br />
<br />
Eqshaman.com has never been associated with the messageboard here or the crucible website.  The former owner of eqshaman.com, madcovv used to post here, but that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One thing of note. Yantis does own the monk board. He has one small link under the banner on the main page. That's it. Besides that, he's had zero effect on the boards, beyond providing material for people to point at and comment on.<br />
<br />
One thing I Will note in his defense, he's done more to try and catch some ripoff artist that's been fleecing alot of people out of their EQ accounts, than EQ themselves has. He's even posted a $10k bounty on him.<br />
<br />
EULA, is the main point people bring up. Besides the rare few, how many people violated it themselves? EQW was a violation. Sharing account info was a violation. <br />
<br />
I'm not wholly for him, but not against him. He kept one of my favorite boards afloat and going, when the people themselves couldn't / wouldn't do it.<br />

The only troubles that were there, were brought about by some folks that wouldn't stop gnawing on the bones of a done deal. They proceeded to spam the board, to where the entire front page was nothing but their protests, and the couple that were banned, were by the Mod's who never left, but couldn't afford to keep it up and going any longer. I personally saw it as a good thing. He provided the funds, to keep one of my favorite boards open and active. The users themselves didn't do it (though some sure complained about it), the mods couldn't, but he did. He remained very hands off on the whole thing, and the mods remained in charge of it all.<br />

<br />
Considering nowhere does it say &quot;Yantis supports, owns, is affiliated with, etc&quot; I don't believe this request is warranted.  I also don't think that just because a website had some links on it, then was bought out, should those links be changed (again those were there - look at the contact address).  Lastly I hold nothing against Yantis - he's out to make money and guess what he's good at it.  If someone wants to &quot;help&quot; themselves out (or gimp themselves if you wanna look at it that way) and spend their own RL cash - let them.  Guess what?  I don't nor will I ever do that, but I let people enjoy the game they want to as long as they let me do my thing</div></div><hr />

<br />
Legally he can be made to stop linking the crucible.  It is called deep linking and requires the permission of the site being linked too (see Ticketmaster vs. Microsoft).  Sunmoon could get him to stop if it bothered him.  Linking to someone's site, especially making it look like that is part of your site, without permission is definetly immoral.  Of course it is good business to leach off of someone else's site, just like it would be good business to take it down if Sunmoon asks him to, since legal costs are bad for the bottom line.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, Yantis is a scumbag ebayer.  The Crucible doesn't exist to lend credibility to scumbag ebayers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>curly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Correct. The Admin of this site should contact this the piece of sh*t known as Yantis and demmand that he remove the link. This guy is a leech. Plain and simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It introduced serious greed into everquest.  Imagine instead of the guy next to you being interested in an item to upgrade his character, he is instead interested in the item to pay the rent.  Which motivation turns the guy into a scumbag?  You ever read about a guild imploding because the members found out the leaders turned the guildbank into a shiny new set of jet skis?  Ebaying introduces rabid greed to the game of everquest.  You think that some young kid getting big eyes and ninja looting an item is bad?  Wait until you login one day and find your characters stripped, all their stuff sold on Yanti's superfagsales site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>curly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">It changes the game dynamics. Yantis uses farming teams to farm high ends items for sale on his site and PA. Next time you go to CoM and see the Reavers camped for the Jade Reaver, by several high level unguilded individuals, who will not answer your tells, or say anything to you, you can bet you just ran into a Yantis farming team. Or, go to the sewers in CT where you will likely run into a Yantis farming team for FT3 boots. Take a look around your server and see where the high level unguilded people are. You can bet when you see 6 or so that you really never heard of, level 65, in one area, that you have run into a Yantis farming team.<br />
<br />
Yantis and his crews are one of the reasons the game economy is so screwed right now. <br />

This guy is a scumbag of the worst kind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I fail to understand how anyone cannot have the minimal amount of intelligence needed to be able to figure out for themselves what is wrong is ebaying stuff from EQ.<br />
<br />
Here's a few hints:<br />
<br />
Read the EULA (or get someone to read it to you).<br />
<br />
Think about the times when you have had a problem with other players in game, think how much worse it could be if there was serious money involved.<br />
<br />
Now consider: if you convert from pp in Norrath to RL money using the conversion rates available in ebaying sites, then the GNP of Norrath is greater than some 3rd world countries.<br />
<br />
Think about it long and hard if you have to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">If I remember it was actually higher that Russia's a year back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">From Ticketmaster v. Tickets.com opinion:<br />
Further, hyperlinking does not itself involve a violation of the Copyright Act (whatever it may do for other claims) since no copying is involved. The customer is automatically transferred to the particular genuine web page of the original author. There is no deception in what is happening. This is analogous to using a library's card index to get reference to particular items, albeit faster and more efficiently.<br />
So far, courts have found that deep links to web pages were neither a copyright infringement nor a trespass. <br />
<br />
<br />
Damn good site this way-----------&gt;http://www.chillingeffects.org/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>rezipps</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">EQ doesnt have the resources nor the absolute power to shut down ebaying sights.<br />
<br />
even if they tried to lock down any accounts that ... oh i dunno... changed credit card numbers? <br />
<br />
think of all the regular people this would affect.... lets see... anyone that has gotten a new card, anyone that has had to change cards due to theft or defraud.... hrm... and what about those that just had name changes and got a new credit card..... or what about those that had thier parents paying for thier account then just got thier own credit card.... <br />

<br />
There are shades of greed.  Someone who sees a shiny new car on that mob is going to be a lot more motivated to grab an item than someone who is just looking to upgrade their character, or get trade bait.  It doesn't just stop at ninja looting either, people pull scams, try to get passwords, etc.  All because pieces of garbage like Yantis host sites to sell EQ items and accounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you gone to Eqshaman and seen it? His menu on the side just says Message Board, and when you click it, it brings you straight to the Crucible forums. Pretty f'ing sleezy, if you ask me.<br />
<br />
And the Ticketmaster thing wasnt the same situation as this.<br />
<br />
If website uses hyperlinks, like any other content, to mislead viewers into thinking the site is endorsed by someone whose trademark it uses, (e.g., &quot;This page sponsored by MEGACORP, click here for more details&quot;), the website might be found to infringe the trademark.<br />
<br />
This is closer to what EQShaman is doing, because they have implied that the Crucible forums are part of their website, by omission of any statement that that link leads to this site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then chances are you're being close-minded.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a few hints:<br />
Read the EULA (or get someone to read it to you).<br />
<br />
<br />
Because a software EULA written by a greedy corporate entity forbids an activity I should stop doing it because it's for my own good right? <br />
<br />
This is why software EULAs are frequently struck down in courts as when they're in violation of consumer rights, right? <br />
<br />
This is why software EULAs are constantly revised. They're never WRONG, they just keep getting even better, right? <br />
<br />
Dude, grow up. A EULA is one entity's idea for how they'd like you to use their software to maximise their profits and minimise their liabilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Think about the times when you have had a problem with other players in game, think how much worse it could be if there was serious money involved.<br />
<br />
I've had friends have their lives threatened by mean jealous about women. Better ban them from the game too.<br />
<br />
Now consider: if you convert from pp in Norrath to RL money using the conversion rates available in ebaying sites, then the GNP of Norrath is greater than some 3rd world countries.<br />
<br />
<br />
What's inherently wrong with this? Nothing. There are thousands of individuals who make more money on interest and investments PER DAY than most third-world individuals will see in a lifetime. Inequality is not injustice.<br />
<br />
You're clueless.</div></div><hr />

The new admin for eqshaman.com removed the link to the crucible here, I am guessing today.  Just look at what is going on with the monks.. you DON'T WANT YANTIS HERE.. in any way, shape or form..  <br />

Nobody said he cant link here. He has a link to the Crucible in his Links section, where it should be. But if you had gone to his site before he changed it, he also had a link on his main page simply called 'Message Boards', which linked directly here. This is not Eqshaman.com message boards, this is Interealms.com message boards.</div></div><hr />

Of course it makes eqshaman a better site, the problem is that it does nothing but drag the crucible down.  Too many people regard Yantis as a scumbag ebayer that actively sabotages the game.  There is no reason for the crucible to get painted with the same brush.</div></div><hr />

On the greed issue - I fail to see the difference between teams of level 65's that pharm phat lewt for sale in the bazaar and teams of level 65's that pharm phat lewt for sale on ebay.  I see no difference between the ninja looter that bazaars an item and one that ebays an item.<br />

Do you fail to see the difference between someone being motivated to scam items and accounts to sell them on ebay so they can get real cash versus the motivation to scam items and accounts so they can use them in EQ?  Which do you think has a bigger motivation?  Would Johnny rather have 30k plat or 30 bucks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Would Johnny rather have 30k plat or 30 bucks?<br />
Greed is greed.  Same action, same motivation, same mentality - slightly different forum.  It's not like the ebay buyer can take the items out of the game for home use.<br />
<br />
On a typical day in bazaar (when it isn't crashing) there are 10,000+ items for sale.  On a typical day on playerauctions - I've seen a couple hundred items tops, of which only 2 or 3 even have bids.<br />
<br />
Does this affect anyone in game?  Not by much, if at all.  Do you really think that Johnny is making his drug money by ebaying EQ items?  I think not.</div></div><hr />

Yes he can, he converts the ownership of the items to cash and uses the cash outside the game.<br />

Right, convert the items to plat in the bazaar, and then sell plat on player auctions.  Much smarter than selling items.<br />

It doesn't matter what Johnny uses the money for, most drug users are too stupid to find a computer, let alone run an electronic scam.  The fact still remains that real cash is still a bigger incentive than increasing some in game counter.  When your account gets hacked in one of the myriad of scams that goes on, all your gear gets converted into plat in the bazaar and that plat gets converted into RL cash.   Yantis is a middle man skimming off of an illicit market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Yes he can, he converts the ownership of the items to cash and uses the cash outside the game<br />
Read it again, note &quot;BUYER&quot;.  The buyer is a willing accomplice in this transaction and is not forced in any way to pay cash for a virtual trinket.  The fact that people will pay cash for in game stuff should show the developers that there is a game design flaw.  The artificial rarity of rare spawn, rare drop, tradeable items leads to this kind of 'black market'.<br />
<br />
When your account gets hacked in one of the myriad of scams that goes on<br />
Hack and scam are 2 different things.  Hack requires pretty extreme technical knowledge, a lot of manual labor, and does not require assistance from the account owner.  As far as I know - it hasn't been done in EQ successfully.<br />
<br />
Scam requires the user to be gullible.  The scammed have one thing in common - they believed some email or web post that promised something wonderful if only they gave their account info to a total stranger who swore up and down that they were honest.  Those who were duped handed over their account on a silver platter.  Any user that gives their account info to someone else is going to lose everything, period.  My guess is that the majority of the people that actually succumb to this kind of scam don't have any equipment worth stealing anyway, as many of the scams deal with PLing.  <br />
<br />
There are all sorts of scams in EQ.  Any player that gambles in EQ with one of the spammer scammers will lose whatever plat they hand over for the bet, regardless of roll.  Any player the clicks buy on a rusty dagger being sold in the bazaar for 10k needs to look a lot closer before clicking 'buy'.  Traders in inaccessible positions setting prices below market value to get other traders to do the same so their buyer can go stock up on low prices.<br />
<br />
The claims of making a living from ebaying EQ crap are a scam.  No web page ad trying to get me to buy the &quot;How to make a living from EQ&quot; book will ever convince me that it's a highly profitable business.  The answer to that one is simple - get a bunch of morons to buy a book called &quot;How to make a living from EQ&quot;.<br />
<br />
Unless I was scammed, I still don't see how this black market affects me.  It doesn't change the amount of plat in the world.  It changes the distribution somewhat from a few players that weren't going to spend the plat to players that want to spend it.  The redistribution still doesn't affect me except possibly to make a couple more items sell in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">The claims of making a living from ebaying EQ crap are a scam.  No web page ad trying to get me to buy the &quot;How to make a living from EQ&quot; book will ever convince me that it's a highly profitable business<br />
<br />
Actually it does happen.  There was a case recently on Stormhammer when members of one uber guild discovered that the small elite group who ran the guild were ebaying off items rather than distributing them fairly.  These people don't have to make a proper living: as long as Daddy pays for their DSL connection and keeps a roof over their heads, they can kid themselves they are doing ok.  Of course as jobs go, there are absolutely no promotion prospects, the pay is poor, only a complete idiot would do it.<br />
<br />
But then there are plenty of idiots around aren't there.  Honestly you'd have to be one to say that the imapct is small, that the number and significance of the items involved is low: how much money is Yantis throwing around?  Work it out - this is a worryingly big thing.<br />
<br />
Frankly, stating that the items involved are only a few compared to the 10,000 or so on sale in bazaar is jaw-dropping.  Huh?  Of the 10,000, there are about 10 items on sale that I'd like to buy.  The vast majority of it is shear rubbish at the end of the scale at which any high level - and the ebayers - are operating.  There are actually MORE desirable items available to me via ebaying (if I was stupid enough to use these sites) than there are in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Just out of interest, what is wrong, per se, with e-baying? I have never bought or sold anything on e-bay (check out my equipment if you don't believe me); it seems rather pointless, but why is it wrong?<br />
<br />
Pretty simple, as was said: Greed.<br />
<br />
Take Tarew Marr for example.  There's a couple, husband and wife who run 6 toons at once between them.  They do nothing but play EQ, their income is all from selling plat &amp; items.  At one point they locked down the Lodi spawn for weeks.  My guild had a major run in with them when we were trying to camp Lodi to outfit ourselves with shields, they ended up training a good 30 or 40 mobs on us in order to try and drive us out of the zone; just so they could keep what must have been a nice supply of plat for themselves in order to make RL money.<br />
<br />
Even if you never buy an EQ item or a single PP with $$$, this impacts your server's economy, and thus your game time, usually in a negative manner.</div></div><hr />

Then go ebay.  I looked at what was for sale on my server at playerauctions today.  I found only one item I don't think I've seen for sale in the bazaar.  The rest is stuff you get in the bazaar for 5k or less, most of it on the level of Jaundiced Bone armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your contact me link is completely unacceptable.  When a user clicks the contact me link, a screen appears that says:<br />

No, guilds compete for spawns, and &quot;usually&quot; on TM it's a fairly polite process, that does not involve continually training mobs onto competing guilds.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Please explain how you came to this conclusion.  Plat and items can't leave the economy unless destroyed, so how is this affecting the economy?<br />
<br />
People sitting there farming plat with the sole purpose of selling it for real life cash means those people are on EQ when they'd otherwise not be.  This will cause deflation of value because there's more plat entering the server economy than there otherwise would be.  It also means that on occasion I'll go to grab a spawn/camp/what ever and I run into someone who's camping it for cash who'd otherwise not be there because they'd already have gotten their rare item and moved on (ie. Lodi shield).  It's a case of taking more than is needed for yourself rather than getting what you need and moving on.</div></div><hr />

And this never happens by guilds building the guild bank of equipment and cash?  You've never seen Lodi farmed for weeks straight by a guild wishing to equip every member with a shield and belt plus a few shields for the bank and a few more to sell?  You've never seen a guild port in around spawn time and kill a mob you've been sitting there waiting for?<br />
<br />
If one person pharming plat can crash the economy - there wouldn't be ANY economy.  Except for experience grinding and camping no drops, that's about all that goes on in EQ.    If you're really bothered about people ebaying plat - I suggest you stop buying KEI in the nexus.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but your argument is rather unconvincing.  Everything you've described already goes on - with or without ebay.</div></div><hr />

You're right, but ebay accentuates the behaviour, quite considerably, in my experience anyway.  When someone's RL income is on the line rather than just some game items it opens up a whole new can of worms as far as compeditivness, greed and poor behaviour goes.  Like it or not ebaying to a greater or lesser extent has an impact on your server's economy, just how much depends on how many ebay farmers you have.  <br />
<br />
And, yes, I've seen people port in and compete for spawns, but as I said, mostly on my server it's fairly polite, other people usually back off if there is enough force already there to deal with the mob, and don't train mobs in an attempt to gain control of the spawn.  I'm not saying it does not happen, because it does (recently mobs were trained in Kael by one guild onto another competing guild), but those incidents are few and far between compared to tactics commonly used by ebayers.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid, to me the issue is fairly simple though, even if it did not impact my game experience; &quot;real life&quot; buying and selling of items shouldn't happen in a game.  If it's ok to you, then all well and good, but it's not to me.  My perception is definitely coloured by my experiences with this kind of person, I suspect yours would be too if you'd run into the same people I have.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I never buy KEI.  Why would a shaman need to?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is untrue, we had no choice in the matter.  One day we come to MB and there is a post stating Zad &quot;sold&quot; MB and the forums to Yantis who will pay the outrageous sum ezboards wanted for gold status.  The majority of us did not want this.  The community chest was never opened for us to donate ourselves to pay for gold status....With some 4000 active users 1$ each would have been enough.  But no, now we have to tolerate his link on our forums and are totally cut off from any dialogue from SOE.  DO NOT let Yantis anywhere near crucible or suffer the same fate you shall (using my Yoda voice).<br />
<br />
Now on a better note other than the annoying link which alienates us from pretty much everyone, Yantis has nothing to do with MB.  We have our own mods in the forums, and our own webmaster updating the news page and info links.  But His taint is there and unless we want to try and move the 22,000 odd MB users to a different site we are stuck, unless we can but it back from yantis.</div></div><hr />

How do you know who is ebaying and who is not?  Are you basing this on a guess of what you would do if you were ebaying, or do you KNOW someone doing this?  I find it extremely hard to believe that everyone on TM is perfectly polite and you've only been KSed by ebayers that everyone on the server knows the identity of.<br />
<br />
A pharmer is a pharmer.  Most are hidiously obnoxious.  A few will step aside if you explain you need an item for yourself, but not many.  If you know someone is ebaying AND being obnoxious - petition.  Considering that SOE frowns on both, you would think you'd get a satisfactory response from a GM.</div></div><hr />

A gm/guide will handle all petitions equally, they are trained to.
