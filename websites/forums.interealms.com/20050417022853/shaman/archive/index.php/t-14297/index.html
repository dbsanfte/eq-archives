<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i actually got invite to a tier 2 grp last night!<br />
<br />
Stumbled into po torment for a look, very atmospheric(creepy) tho soome of the screams get on yer wick aftr about 5 secs.<br />
<br />
Was there in a 60+ grp for 30 mins and made one and a third blue at 55...then chanter died and we got 2 adds...things got nasty then lol.<br />
<br />
The zoni in zone out is same spot, and seems to be safe.<br />
<br />
Lots of gem drops here!  ZOne is indoors tho ( guess thats why its deserted?...casters like to use there mounts alot... <br />
<br />
Didint find portal to postorms yet tho....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I also got a tier 2 group recently in PoTorment. At 57 i was easily able to malo then slow each mob i fought there with my group. I got 1% regular exp every 2 kills about! it was insane and i was getting 2% aa per kill if i put 100% aa. Its great, also PoS frog groups give me a blue of aa per kill. Tier 2 is truely great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had different results in PoS.  Maybe I was just in a crappy spot but I had trouble slowing the mobs and for the amount of time it took to kill mobs, it didn't seem like it was worth it.  I would much rather get in a chain pulling group in PoD or PoN then try and go to PoS at 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well at PoS with a 65 pally and 62 warrior we killed the trash in about 45 seconds per mob! Sometimes we took 3 at a time and we didnt have an enchanter. Was very easy to slow if you malisini them (or whatever the 57 one is called lol)</div></div><hr />

Wow, Well maybe I just had a bad night for resists.  I had a lvl 63 SK, 60 Pal, 60 Wiz, 60 Necro, 60 Druid and myself (lvl 58 shammy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can't wait to get to 55 so my friends can help me out with leveling. Got a bunch of em who have said they'd help me if i got to 55 so they still got decent xp also.</div></div><hr />
