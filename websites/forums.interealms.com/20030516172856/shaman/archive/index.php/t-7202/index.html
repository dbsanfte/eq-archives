<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>butuglia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I will be able to play EQ at work in a few weeks :). I need a location that a 57 shaman can solo with some very specific restrictions. There has to be no roamers ( i could be afk for up to 30 minutes at times). No split pulls or broken camps needed (a single spawn would be awesome) No limit on spawn times. 6 minutes or 30 i dont care. Loot = unimportant. Faction = I'm a Troll i really dont care as long as it aint other trolls. Obviously an out of the way place would be great I want to avoid trains and I certainly dont want to take a decent camp spot from someone since i could be afk a lot and dont wanna take a spot from someone that needs the exp. <br />
<br />
My goal is just to pick up some extra exp while at work on the side :).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sconds in echo caverns.  static mobs no wanderers.  archers summon tho.<br />
<br />
i have not tried soling this, but i can be done at 58 so maybe....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">katta... at level 57.. you'll be pulling 2 at a time (single at 58) but the exp there is pretty constant and killin is cake..  Just go to the wall opposite of bank.. you'll get no roamers.. pretty easy to get there if you use that underwater portal dealio..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Scound and archers in echo.  No roamers.  hard enough fights that at 57 you probably will not try the Arisen soldiers through the water.  the 2 archers and 4 scounds are slow spawns, which is fine for someone with RL interruptions.  When ya have time and mana, the arisen soldiers are great to work in - I root two and then use slow to pull the other one, to get them split.  I hate getting two of em and realizing that both me and the dog are ony half health  8('<br />
<br />
archers do summon, but they hit like little girls.  the dog could solo a slowed archer, I am convinced.  After I kill one archer, I send the dog at the other, slow it, then loot the first and move ot middle of rampart to epic, then concentrate on canni, etc. before doing anything to gain aggro back from dog.  dog is usually about neck and neck with the archer on health by the time I throw a Bane or a JBB at the archer.  If the archer goes below 805 before I start nuking, I may never get aggro back ...<br />
<br />
The scounds across the way are lower hp etc. than scound trevor and his buddy beow the archers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jaggepine would work nicely also, head into the darkpaw gnoll cave on the north est wall. take every right turn you can and you will fall into a pit. Back-up against the wall and you can sit there all day looking at a gnoll and he will not agro you till you engage or get closer. I was pulling about 5-6%exp/hour here. You can make ok loot as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've known a shaman or 2 that could solo quite effectively in Fungus Grove. Very boring fights, but no wanderers &amp; no surprises.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I second Jaggedpine. Get the pit camp, and hug the wall after you fall in. You'll never get attacked while medding there, even if you do this for hours, and the camp is easy to single pull - never needs to be broken.<br />
<br />
At 57, I got a blue every 45 minutes. At 58, a blue an hour. Some nice loot, sabertooth stuff sells for oodles even if it is crap, and gnollish rings of sorcery sell well in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
A gnoll pops close to you, but unless you walk up and say hi, he ignores you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am currently at the Jaggedpine camp, but I didn't like the pit camp as well as I like the other place that I'm fighting the gnolls at.  An easy way to find this place is to fall into the pit that is mentioned before and then run around the only direction possible and take the first right that you can.  This will eventually lead you into the big open area where I think that the head gnoll is in (i haven't seen him yet so I am not sure, but I'm assuming he's around there somewhere).  Anyways, if you turn left inside this cave and set up camp in between the first and second gnolls, they are not close enough to agro on you and also there are no roamers that I have seen in there.  I have only found this place camped once by a 58 druid (who I might add was very rude in letting me know that it was camped and that there was not enough room for the both of us to fight there, even with the 30 mobs or so that are in close proximity).  From that point you can pull mobs from all over the room and not worry about any adds except for that first gnoll.  I usually end up rooting every mob just before they are ready to flee and leave pet on him and just med until the mob is dead.  Very easy exp here for you at 57 and also mobs are all dark blue if Warriors, but light blue for the casters<br />
<br />
Last, when I pull any casters, i just start with Bane, and then sick the dog on them.  I keep MR buffed and let the pet attack and keep them rooted away from me.  If you are facing the Curates, then at just about 2bubbles of life left, I use Ice Strike and they do not end up with enough time to CH.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah, i have only had one problem with this method, but what I do is invis before the cave, and just charge in, the casters have a chance to see you and start casting, but you are usually far enough away from them by the time that it lands that they don't have time to recast anything on you, andyou can quickly reinvis yourself.</div></div><hr />
