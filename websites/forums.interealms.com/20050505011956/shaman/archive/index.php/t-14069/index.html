<br />
It's been awhile...4 1/2 months since my last visit. Obviously, I stopped playing, although not by choice. Computer problems + slow sloooow dial up made playing impossible.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just noticed that TechTV's Xplay show tonight is about Everquest (I think it's covering the Vegas FanFaire, but not sure)<br />
<br />
It starts in about 10 minutes from when I'm posting this, but maybe a few of you will manage to catch it. Also, I think they repeat the same show a cpl of times, so check your listings over the next week or so.</div></div><hr />
