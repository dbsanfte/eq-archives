<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need some advice on the OoW augments and related tradeskills and AAs<br />
<br />
I have 200 alchemy skill, and trophy. I am wondering about GM'ing smithing and jewelcraft so I can work these augments idependently (i don't know any GM smith or jc). Anyone else in this sort of position could offer advice? Or do we have any shammie JC or smith GM that can tell me cost to max the tradeskill?<br />
<br />
I was reading the eqtraders site, and from what I read, it seem the JC components of working the augs is best done by an enchanter, as they get additional JC AAs, making success more likely. So what do you guys think? Is it worth trying to GM in either of these?<br />
<br />
Finally, anyone with salvage and alchemy mastery have any success / fail rates with the various steps? Just tring to get an idea of what I am letting myself in for ;p<br />
<br />
thnx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">JC is really nothing more than throwing money at it. A lot of people say around 5k or so can get you to 250. I only got mine to 170ish or so. Best advice I can give you is get a geerlok and only make items with low trivials so you get more successes and able to sell back more, thus you lose less money.<br />
<br />
I was going to get it to 250 before I found out I needed a Gem Cutter to work with augments. They're tinkered but go for a lot in bazaar. Around 20k on my server. I decided since my brother is a GM Jewelcrafter and already has his gem cutter I'll just borrow him when I want something cut, heh.<br />
<br />
As for smithing, it just plain sucks getting it up. I'm 230ish (252 with my Belt from Sanctus Seru) but I did all my skilling up pre-LDoN and didn't have the option of doing the armour from that expansion. I'd look into it as something to move onto after finishing up on Fine Plate. But I'm not sure how common the components are anymore since not many people are doing LDoN's anymore.<br />
<br />
The path I took was Shadowscream and Mistletoe Cutting Sickles mixed in with some cultural and Tae Ew. <br />
<br />
Tae Ew doesn't sell well anymore but since people are going there again for the new epics, bloods may be cheap in bazaar. If so the weapons are easy and cheap to make. You may be able to get some money back from sales if you can sell the weapons, if not, you'll get some good tribute points, lol.<br />
<br />
Shadowscream is virtually free but endless hours of farming Hollowshade and Shades in Shadoweavers can easily make you go insane. <br />
<br />
Cultural, so many components to gather and so many combines before getting the finished product. Fail rates are high too and the only item that sells (and not for too much) are the bracers.<br />
<br />
Mistletoe Cutting Sickles are good if you have deep pockets. You need to throw a lot of money at it. If you get a good success rate you can sell them in bazaar and make a good profit. But to do 20 combines may cost you a whole night preparing not to mention all the coin in your bank.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit out of the loop though. Perhaps there are other recipes here and there past 200 that'll help you get it up. Regardless, 200+ in smithing is painfully slow. Keep looking at EQtraders for tips but don't expect smithing to be too easy. (pre 200 it's just like JC, throw money at it and most components are vendor bought)<br />
<br />
With smithing I wouldn't worry at all about how much it will cost because it's really tough to give any accuracy since it depends on which route you take and how lucky you are on combines. The main concern is how much time you'll need to put into it.<br />
<br />
I highly suggest getting some friends (pet classes and range damage dealers) and going to Sanctus Seru and taking out Praesertum Bikun and hope he drops the +10% smithing belt. Large races only can wear it though so forget it if you're a Froglok.<br />
<br />
He procs a banish spell to the jail cells in seru but it doesn't work on pets. So have pets tank him and use spells/arrows for DPS.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Zaviax gave a pretty good summary.<br />
<br />
If you want to be successful in making these augments, I suggest you become friends with a rogue and an enchanter with Jewelcraft Mastery 3.  Most of the rogues I've asked have told me that their Poison Mastery AA does not reduce failures by any percentage, so we may have a leg-up on combines for these augments.<br />
<br />
The parts that shamans can do are involve Jewelry Making, Alchemy and Smithing.  Any part that requires more than the maximum skill level obtainable should be performed by someone with all AA that reduces failure or prevents loss of components (a Mastery AA and Salvage).<br />
<br />
I attempted to make some augments the other night and I failed the first combine to turn the augment into its polished form (a 296 trivial in Jewelry Making) even though I had a max of 252 skill, but no Salvage AA.  Therefore I recommend all Jewelry Making parts be done by an enchanter with maxed failure reduction AA.<br />
<br />
The parts that require smithing are expensive, but they do not cause the augment to be lost.  The inlays cost between 3100-6300pp to make and have a trivial of 307 for white gold and 327 for black gold.  You don't have to have the failure reduction AA for these parts, but if you want to reduce loss of platinum, I would suggest them.<br />
<br />
In short, any part of the combine process in which the augment can be lost should be performed by someone with the least chance of failure.  Given the rarity of and cost of some of the components, this is the smartest way to do things.</div></div><hr />
