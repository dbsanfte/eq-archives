<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone parsed the dmg? i know the 3 pets have lower hps, lower push, but do they at least do more damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Who said they have less HPs?<br />
<br />
On exp mobs I parse around 6 to 8k damage per use. The melee is pretty much the same every time, but the number of procs makes up to 2 k difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've done some (very) limited parsing.  My results agree with Giac; basically, expect between 6k and 8k. <br />
<br />
I did have fun during one fight and cast FA and the ancient avatar on two of the three pets, and hasted the first one, but I neglected to log that fight.   I'm going to have to try that again.<br />
<br />
In any case, the damage is definitely better than Spirit Call 3.  Not astronimically better, but its an upgrade.</div></div><hr />
