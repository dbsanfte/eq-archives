<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jerred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Time for a showdown. For a shaman, choose between:<br />
<br />
Ivory Imbued Collar <br />

I currently wear the Ivory Imbued, but a friend is offering me the Amulet.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if EE3 works for buffs you cast on others? If not, my decision is a whole lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I currently have an Ivory Imbued Collar but have been looking for an Amulet of Insight to replace it.. don't feel like spending 6k on it though.. so will wait to solo or until I see a good deal :)<br />
<br />
I would expect that they work on buffs for others.. otherwise it'd be pointless to even get .. IMO :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelgrael Snowstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keep em both - swap in the Amulet of Insight for buffing up - then the Ivory Imbued when hunting/soloing/raiding....<br />
<br />
And yes - the EE3 works on buffs cast on others.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah, 2 wis aint worth the hassle of swapping in and out. I alternate between Amulet of Insight and my Amulet of the Grey Wastes, depending where I'm running. (I swim a lot, go figure, I stop to put my AGW on before I jump).<br />
<br />
I also have a Black Alloy Medallion for my wis suit for tradeskilling, but honestly, it's not worth wearing while I solo. It's much better to keep the Amulet of Insight on for those buffs-as-you-go soloing sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kelgrael Snowstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Harvyst,<br />
<br />
Perhaps I should have elaborated more - but yea, I'd agree that 2wis is not worth keeping for the swapping out - but the 6 raw AC difference is if your an &quot;In The Face&quot; tanking shaman.....every little bit of AC that mitigates hits is worth it in my book....plus the better resists on the Ivory Imbued for raiding - I find PR and DR is such a pain to get good items for.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I guess it would all depend on what your ac gets lowered to when wearing the Amulet.. As long as your ac doesn't dip below that 50 point mark I wouldn't worry about swapping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting this thread. :)<br />
I have a similar choker dilemna.<br />
<br />
I have:<br />
Amulet of Grey Wastes<br />
Gantru Charm<br />
Ivory Imbued Collar<br />
Amulet of Insight<br />
<br />
AGW when underwater (duh).  Also when regenning mana ala' Canni4/Kragg's Mending repeatedly.  Most HP out of the group.<br />
<br />
Gantru Charm typically goes in range slot for tradeskilling, replacing a Goranga Idol.  Also for resists.<br />
<br />
Amulet of Insight is what I keep on most of the time.  I just buff way too much, and swapping out this (along w/ other items) is a hassle for the minor stat differences.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
8 ac, 6str, 6sta, 30hp<br />
<br />
And swap that with the insight for buffing.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Insight is GOD when you need to run haste for a party/raid due to lack of enchie.<br />
<br />
  I don't know if insight works on group buffs like 8th coldain does, but it is pretty sweet having them all last a bit longer.<br />
<br />
  If you don't like to time buffs, you can cast them on yourself, and the melee.  Take off necklace when you cast on yourself to guarantee you never let buffs fade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Does Extended Enhancement stack with AA Spell Casting Reinforcement?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i wear an amulet of insight. i will admit i am waaay too lazy to swap in and out. gantru charm stays in my range slot, tho i do carry around a goranga idol just in case. unless you have something that is more than just marginally better, i vote to just wear the amulet of insight unless you are a devout swapper =)</div></div><hr />
