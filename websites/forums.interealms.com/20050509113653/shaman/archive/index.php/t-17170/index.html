<br />
I was there yesterday at around 11AM MST, and it was fine.  Now it's not--I can't access it from home or work 'puter.  I'm not sure if that helps, but you're not the only one having that problem.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cool. I hadnt been keeping up with eq much for about 3 months so I wasnt sure if something happened to it :D</div></div><hr />

Man, that sucks :(  He got some good stuff done...<br />
<br />
I saw him at the MN FF way back when.  Nice guy, seemed to have his head on straight, and kind of a cutie in a geeky kind of way.  <br />
Personal lament done, lol :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better to have no info than the categorically wrong information presented on Caster's Realm.<br />
<br />
Caster's Realm is out of date for KUNARK, nevermind recent stuff. For a while I used to go there for updates from the official boards, but lately that isn't even very good. I haven't been there in probably 3 months, and I don't miss it at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I used to visit Everlore lots in old day, then switch to Caster's Realm around Velious-luclin day; then some allakhazam and mainly read forum<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spelllist.html is good place for spell for all class, very good when you look for spell list for your alt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Everlore was the goods back in summer of 99.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I hadnt been keeping up with eq much for about 3 months<br />
<br />
CR haven't been keeping up with EQ much for about 3 years...  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Lucy is the best place for factual info. http://www.geocities.com/xymarra/Spells/shmspell.html is an alternative that you can use for quick checks or printing out. CR doesn't even make the grade as a last resort these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/shrug<br />
<br />
Use it for what it is good at, it's an ok site. Spell vendor locations/spell research/skills/regen/mana calc/disciplines/aa lists...it is good for basic info. I use it every time my alts hit a new spell level to see where to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Having spoken to at least 2 people who bought Malosini in bazaar (one for 1k!!!) instead of a few plat from FV after CR listed it as a droppable spell and they had't managed to get one to drop, I heartily recommend against checking on new-level spells there. But YMMV - horses for courses really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ridgey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've been trying to get onto CR for a couple days to with no luck.<br />
<br />
I would've thought last time when it went down for so long they would've given us paying customers some credit (I.E Extend our membership expiry), and I bet this time they don't either.<br />
<br />
Was thinking about it just before CR went down that I really only visit the site for spell information (not just for shammy). Must be the way they list the spells... I don't know.<br />
<br />
In reality, what really bites is the fact that we all have to go to third party sites to get information on everquest. All this should be on EQ's home site and part of our normal online charges. My favourite site, allakhazam's could in fact be mirrored on EQ home site and ran by trusted EQ players the way EQ guides are. Sure, you still will have fan sites but so much info on Allakhazam's needs membership access.<br />
[ Also, I wonder if anyone has ever added up the downtime on EQ itself to see what the hours add up in a year and find if this adds to a possible lost month that we indeed do pay for??]<br />
<br />
Anyway, as soon as CR is back up (again) I'll will not be re-newing my account. The money I save will help pay for the extra fee's EQ is charging for the release of EQII.</div></div><hr />

I totaly agree, come on guys I need my fix!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In the really old days, EQ Shaman was a great site for spell, alchemy and quest related info.  I believe they too are now way out of date.  Thank goodness this site stays current.</div></div><hr />

True that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">CR was back up last night.  I didn't try its forums.  They said they had a network problem and cascaded into a router problem or something like that.</div></div><hr />
