<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is this thing really worth 30k?<br />
<br />
Just seems that with all the new armor that's been introduced to the game, the JB bp seems a bit outdated and overpriced.<br />
<br />
I know on tribunal, Engraved royal velium bp's go for 9k, barbed ringmail 4k and shissar bp 8 to 10k.<br />
<br />
True the jbbp has some nice stats, but nothing you couldn't live without or make up with some other slot.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It has a right click 3 pt damage shield and 13ac buff that lasts forever. Can't really get that with anything else... though there is another bp with the same effect, name eludes me.<br />
<br />
That's probably why it costs so much, along with the prestige of having a Trak bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">True the jbbp has some nice stats, but nothing you couldn't live without or make up with some other slot.<br />
<br />
Equip JB BP, right click an 18 AC/3 damage shield buff that lasts for 2 hours (or something like that).  Bag JB.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's worth so much because for those of us that have one (but wear other bps) have no reason to sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, there's one sitting in the bazaar on tribunal today.<br />
<br />
was debating on whether or not to get it or a lodi shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's definately worth 30k. Nice stats and if you include the long lasting buff, it effectively has more ac than a SS BP. Course you could get both.... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was awarded one on a raid, and i use it now.  I dont know if it is worth spending 30k to get, but I know i wont ever sell it as the effect is very nice, and it lasts forever, and I haven't had any stacking issues with it (yet)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the price for these on D Ro has dropped to 20k lately.  I usually see a few for sale in the bazaar at any given time.  I am hoping that once I get 60 I can trade my Fungi for a JBBP and Torpor.  A Shaman can dream can't he?<br />
