<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you want to get thru those levels fast, if you can get a monk partner and go to sol A, get to the bartender spawn point.  You can med behind the bar and things will not aggro from the other side.  Monk can FD pull and its good xp all around. <br />
<br />
Watch out for the Goblin Drunkard as he is a Mage and has a nasty damage shield.<br />
<br />
Some other bonuses:<br />
goblins drop FS weapons (5pp each), HQ Ore (2pp small, 8pp large) and soot hemlock/some other stackable (10ppish per stack)<br />
constant pulls if you have mana for em<br />
out of the way of trains, if anyone is even in the zone<br />
<br />
cons:<br />
Careful while fighting the initial pull not to push the goblin or step onto the bar.  If either you or the goblin gets up there the others will aggro.<br />
Getting to the spot is easy until a casting mob gets in the way.  All others can't see invis but shaman and wizards can.<br />
At 35th level there are more light blues, but still good xp as there is a bonus on this dungeon.  Once finished move onto gnomes (see other thread).<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Make sure to snare if you can or root, they will run and that is just bad.<br />
<br />
EDIT2:  With caster changes this zone may not be so doable/worthwhile now for a duo.  Wizard and Shaman mobs will make it ugly now.</div></div><hr />
