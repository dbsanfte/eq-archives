<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">HI, I just restarted playing my Shaman. I played him until about 42 then my brother took him over. Now I'm coming back and he is 55.  SO Im rusty and unknowledgable about the upper levels and new lands. <br />
<br />
<br />
So anyway.....2 questions.<br />
<br />
Where is good to solo, and where to group??<br />
<br />
<br />
Also what tactics are being used for those solo/groups.<br />
<br />
I have pretty much all spells except the 50 pet buff....Im fond of using my pet so far, have the JBB .....1 step from my epic at the moment.....another few weeks and I will have that.<br />
<br />
Any input would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
