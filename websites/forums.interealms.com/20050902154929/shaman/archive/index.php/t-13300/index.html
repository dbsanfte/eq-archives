<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">any one tried these guys? out of bordem I tried the 2 outside (near the grave yard). as far as I know you cant split them, so you have to deal with 2 summoning mobs. they hit for low 200s if I remember right. I tried this before I had my epic at 57 and it didnt quite work =P with some outside HP buff I think I could get one down and just slowly kill the other to split the spawns<br />
<br />
any one know if they are worth it after they are split and just throw in some guards while waiting for the respawn?</div></div><hr />
