<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">this is part rant part why bother.<br />
I like a ton of the peeps I know in eq, my current guild is almost a drama free zone and full of great people. the rl friends I know that play the game make it fun and all that.<br />
<br />
but holy crap could it be any more frustrating being a shaman right now? I have a 65 chanter and a twinked to the gills 52 rogue who are both infinitly more fun to play and dont give me migraines over class balance bs but Niether is going to replace my shaman as my main. <br />
<br />
basicly I refuse to pay for an expansion to fix my class, paying cash to the same people who cant get it right with all the cash already spent on this game. <br />
<br />
I just feel this weird pull in 2 directions, the fun part of hanging with cool peeps vrs the never ending string of bull**** dribbling out of sony's amazing talking ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, I guess I dont understand the question.<br />
<br />
If you dont want to play any more then by all means you should do something else.  <br />
<br />
If you dont want to buy the new expansion, dont.  It will be like there is no new expansion if you didnt buy it.  Nothing will change at all...well folks around you will be getting better while you stay the same but you will be able to do the same content only better do to the rest of the groups improvements.<br />
<br />
But if you are asking if it's worth the time to reinstal.... watch TV and swap out discs at each commercial and then start the patcher for the night and walk away :)<br />
<br />
I'd check out the newest AAs that just got posted.  If ours come out anything like the rest of the AAs shown, it will be a great expansion.  There are only 3 that appear to be shaman AAs but there are a lot more shown for each of the other classes, so I'm guessing we'll be getting more of them shortly AND as the debate rages on about Druid or Shaman Rez AA, we'll see if we get that SWEET summon to corpse w/o rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you need someone else to tell you what you should do, then no don't reinstall it.  Maybe you will be happier not playing any MMORPG's.<br />
<br />
You sound confused by the game.  Don't misunderstand me tho I am not saying you aren't smart or don't do other things in life just fine.  <br />
<br />
BUT if<br />
<br />
I have a 65 chanter and a twinked to the gills 52 rogue who are both infinitly more fun to play  <br />
<br />
and you still refuse to make one of them your main, something doesn't seem quite right.  You like to play them more then the shaman, so play them.  Forget you have a shaman.  Beter yet like I said above no don't reinstall the game.  Because you seem to already feel that its a waste fo your time.  Go do something else not PC related.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try another game for a bit, if you still have a desire for eq it will recharge and pull you back in.</div></div><hr />
