<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As of last night, I have 35 skill in alchemy, and I hope to ding lvl 32 tonight so I can make sow trivial. I have sold 2 10shot sow pots so far, and think that I will be able to make a little money at this, if I don't go any farther.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if any of you have been able to make money at alchemy, including cost of skillups?<br />
<br />
If so, how?<br />
<br />
If not, why not?<br />
<br />
How many of you stop at making sow?<br />
<br />
This is my main character, so I don't have an abundance of money to blow on a skill that won't offer me a pp erturn on my investment. I will likely get alchemy to a higher lvl, but will wait till I can better spare the cash.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only real long-term money maker you will have is sow, unless you have a &quot;patron&quot; requesting specific potions.  If you work hard at it, you can sell sow potions for good money.  Oh, you can sell shrink and ITU as well, but it takes a long time.<br />
<br />
You will fail about 40% of the time if sow is exactly trivial to you, meaning your cost will be as high as 90pp per 10-dose.  To do really well, you need to make ITU and shrink so sow is supertrivial.  Trivializing shrink (skill 70) drops the failure rate down to 15% or less, so your cost is almost always below 70pp.  I would definately advise training up to 70 skill at a minimum, even if sow is all you want to do.<br />
<br />
On Rodcet the &quot;standard&quot; price is 110p if you don't want to seem like a gouger, and I'll sell for 100 each if they are buying more than two.  I do see them advertised for 120, and you can sell them for that, but you sell more than 10% more at 110, so it's worth taking the price reduction.<br />
<br />
I don't work very hard at selling them, but a shaman I know made 4000 plat in 10 days hawking SOW potions.  10 hours a day in FV and EC auctioning.  No thanks, I'll be poor 8^)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The requests i get now are for sow and gate potions.  I set up an alchemy mule for my guild and filled it full of potions.  Even posted on our website lots of info about alchemy, etc.   Plz dont go into this tradeskill thinking you will make and bunch of money.  You will be spending a bunch of money and in the end only be broke.</div></div><hr />

My alchemy skill : 72<br />
My wisdom        : 188<br />
Failures in a row for SoW potions last night: 6<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Yes you can make alot of money if you dedicate yourself to selling SoW potions and keep track of your customers etc---but dont expect to have a decent success rate for the combines till your skill is in the 60-70s. The above example was a freak accident I guess, but just to show you that it does happen. Then there are the price-cutters *grumble*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sow potions I can sell like hot-cakes, shrink potions I've been carrying around for 2 weeks now and auction on our auction channel and periodically in the zones I'm in or before raids - nobody wants them. <br />
<br />
At 95pp for 5-dose and 190pp for 10-dose I don't think I'm overpricing them - given they cost me a hell of a lot more than that to make :( <br />
<br />
I'm going to stick to sow potions for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sine Snowray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I made countless sow potions early on, when they sold for ~150pp to ~120pp.<br />
<br />
I used the profits to pay for skill increases.<br />
<br />
Overall I probably spent ~15k to max out alchemy (180), using an initial investment of 2kpp.<br />
<br />
Now I only make potions for guild raids.<br />
<br />
BTW, check your DS potions before right clicking them. One time I gave an everfrost potion out right before Dozekar the Cursed. One tank ended up in Everfrost right as we engaged. Haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tiqua Sunrise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wow?  120 to 150pp?  damn.  haven't been that price on Quellious for at least a year.  100pp is standard price for sow potions on Quell.</div></div><hr />
