<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking today, Sony should give another class a rezz, even if it is gimp. Somewhere from 50-75%?<br />
Why? I really dread doing any ldon now without a rezzer, sure you can always find someone to rez afterwords, 30 minutes after the adventure is complete.<br />
It doesn't seem that fair everyone's ability's have all pretty much been handed out, our slow for example. Not that this is a bad thing, when pop came out it made slow more of a necesity then a luxery, and as much as we would like to be in super high demand it was fair to give other classes a slow. Anyways, as it stands 3 classes have a rez, and necro's need EE, 200-500 a pop, good for emergency's or ppl who don't care about money, but bad for the more casual player. My thought's give necro's a lvl 60'sh rez spell that doesn't require a ee, then give another class a lower rez, exp moves fast enought I wouldn't mind getting only 50% if I had to. I am not necassarly saying give it to our class all though that would make the most sense, shaman's being spirital ppl. Hell give it to the bards they get everything else right? lol<br />
Ok tear it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I could see Shadow Knights getting Convergence on say lvl 64/65 or so.  I don't see it fitting to well for other classes.  I think necros should get an upgrade to convergence 60+ that is the same thing just no reagent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm going to stand by my idea for a Shaman Rez.<br />
<br />
Reincarnation. Requires a piece of racial meat / blood (or any meat / blood from a global model critter. Froglok blood, FI). Doesn't give any exp back, but doesn't count as a &quot;ressurection&quot;, either. It simply lets the player be called back to his corpse. The catch? He takes on the model of whatever provided the meat, permanantly (or until he gets a real ressurection)<br />
<br />
Of course, you could get rid of the model complications and simply call it &quot;Psychopomp&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hyena,<br />
<br />
     Intresting idea. So it operates much like Call of the Hero for the Shaman class? I could see this ability being used heavily in LDoN's where time is of the esscense and people just need to loot &amp; scoop and push towards the goal, worrying about the rez later. I don't think the player should take on the model of the reagent meat permenantly, just until a rez is obtained. Do you require the player's corpse to cast on? If so that will be the defining difference between this ability and Mage's Call ability. All in all, intresting. I'd like to see where this idea could go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No exp would kinda defeat the point of desiring a rez for the most part IMHO.<br />

which means that once you have been &quot;summoned&quot; a cleric can still rez you. <br />
<br />
This is something I've been advocating for ages. Essentially, a zero-exp reverse of corpse summon--you are summoning the &quot;spirit&quot; to the corpse, rather than the way necros do it by summoning the corpse to the spirit. I can't see how this could possibly be unbalancing, and it fits right in with the notion of a shaman as a master of the spirit world.<br />

For shamans to get a rez, SOE would nerf it so badly as to make it undesirable to use, like how they want us to be a pet class without a real pet.<br />

I think that would be a fine idea.  It would be great for things besides LDON.  MGB it when raids wipe and it would be a very interesting tool on a PVP server.  Kill ya...summon, kill ya...summon.  I guess they would have to make it group only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Toad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No reason not to give Shaman, and druids res.  Even if it is 50%, exp falls off of trees these days.  It is a convience thing more then anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are so few distinct class functions now.   Let the three classes that can already rez rez.  No need for any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yea, I do like the idea of a non-exp summon to corpse type spell, I can go for that, then make some sort of option so you don't have to wait 30 minutes after the adventure is over.<br />
Then for sure give necro's a non reagant rez spell, even if it is a bit less %.<br />
I think it is unfair for cleric's/pally's to have a monopoly on the rezz's like that(not counting necro's since they need EE).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sounds a lot like what Blizzard intends to do with WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wish they would just let us make Rez potions that you yourself have to drink ... you drink and pop to your corpse rezed. <br />
<br />
Make the casting time very long and the cost of the potions scale with the % of the rez <br />
<br />
... I mean do you ever take a paladin, cleric, or Necro simply because they can rez NO you get them because they can tank heal and DPS respictively. And this still fits in with the Medicine Man mentality that sony says they have. <br />
<br />
Personally i think this is one reason why so many zones are underutilized ... ho many deaths have you had to eat because you died in DN, HS, The Hole, ect simply because you couldnt get a cleric or paladin (or a necro ... /shiver EE) ... hell im leveling a Paladin Bot instead of an SK so that i can rez myself when i try something and get in over my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think rez potions would be a good idea. I could hear a lot of clerics complaining about it but if the cost on components was set high (which no doubt it would be anyway) and also have it require an imbued item that only clerics can create it'd be a useful but situational item. <br />
<br />
When do people use a necro to rez? Normally it goes to a cleric who died if they were the only rezzer there at the time. Same would work with potions only you wouldn't need to always rely on having a necro. Anyone could use the potion.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't replace people seeking rezzes from clerics but it would be a great convenience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Then tinkerers would have to make a slowing device.</div></div><hr />

Just looking at the huge write up about WoW puts so much into perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">No rez.  It's bad enough that paladins have it.</div></div><hr />

Where is the logic behind that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I smell a cleric in disguise :)<br />
<br />
Seriously, it's time to decide just what you want the shaman class doing.  All of our abilities have been handed out.  I honestly don't see a decent reason why we shouldn't have some form of rez.  As much as I hate to admit it, I think druids should have one as well.  Just my opinion though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I guess in a way it makes logical sense for druids to get say a 70% rez and shamans a 50% rez. That way all groups could be more self sufficient as the majority of groups have priests in them. The only question is how much would it affect the demands of the other 3 classes, cleric, paladin and necro.<br />
Interesting how roleplaying ideals translate in practise to gameplaying ideals, but at the cost of alienating those who bought it for roleplaying ideals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">To be honest, I doubt it would affect them at all.  You'd still rather have a cleric over a druid for main-healer spot, but if you can't find a cleric, you can still get an easy rez.<br />
Paladins are wanted for their tanking ability.  Us getting a rez wouldn't affect them one bit.<br />
Necros are wanted for damage in groups, not for their 500pp-a-pop rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>gothyc meyhem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Summon a spirit without exp gain? That fits better in a role playing aspect than a rez for exp for shaman.  Rez for a shaman is a bad idea.  Why add to the confusion as to what our roles as shaman are?  I know my roles as a shaman are defined by how I decide to play but how many posts have you seen that complain that we need a more defined role in the game?  <br />
<br />
To say all wis casters(priests) should have rez is the same as saying all int casters should have a DD spell the equivilent to a wizards Strike of Solusek(2740 dmg) or rangers and rogues having as much ac and hp as any other melee class.  Some things should be left to the classes they are in and rez is one of them.</div></div><hr />

Again with this druid get more then shaman thing. Im sorry but its begining to irratate me. We are the tribal healers, the medicine man. Druids heal trees and ****, why should we settle for less?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Give Rez to Magicians.  They can already summon a living body to them with Call of the Hero, so they should be able to summon the spirit of a corpse to them as well.  Call it Call of the Loser; after all, only losers die without a cleric around, right? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">In my opinion, we should not have the spell of Rez.<br />
Even if druids want it... I dont care.. I dont want to be thouget us as greedy class.<br />
<br />
But rez potion is another.<br />
Prob 2 options are there.<br />
1. ND potion (it means shm only can use) at 500pp or so.<br />
2. lore or unstackable potion at 2kpp or so.<br />
And they has to be 0% exp rez.<br />
<br />
Please remember the price of gate potion. it is lvl 5 spell.<br />
<br />
But prob rez potion is only a dream... never comes real.<br />
<br />
So I have an another idea here...<br />
How about DI potion? <br />
If it costs 250 pp or so.. not so bad price... because it is gamble..<br />
it should be used before battle. it lasts for 10 min.<br />
And the principal of this game... &quot; Sham can not have rez&quot; is secured.<br />
We do not invade cleric s area..even if it works. <br />
And it could support our heal delay untill debuffed.<br />
I think it is suitable for shm... we can use cha buff.. for this potion =p.<br />
Of course the price will regulate this casual use. And .. it never breaks previous Raid tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">there is no reason to give rez to druids/shaman especially a percentage difference.<br />
<br />
Why would a druid rez better than a shaman if you were to add such things?<br />
<br />
Shaman deal with Spirits.  Returning Spirits = Rez.<br />
Druids deal with nature.  Most nature mythos deals with a Birth-Life-Death being a cycle.  IE Birth-Life-Death-BacktoBirth.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't see point of giving classes Rez.<br />
What I would like to see however, is give more classes the ability to summon a player back to thier corpse allowing the rez to be had later.<br />
With the &quot;mass graveyard&quot; supposedly coming in some day.  Perhaps even a line of spells designed to summon the body back to the player across zones.<br />
<br />
If you want XP back, go get a cleric, paladin, necro. <br />
If you just want to be able to finish the trial, or make the game more fun via less CR.<br />
<br />
you could add these type of abilities to:<br />
Druids: Porting (Variation of existing ability), Nature-Rebirth (theme)<br />
Shaman: Potions (Variation of existing ability), Spirit (theme)<br />
Wizards: Porting (Variation of existing ability)<br />
Mages: Summoning (Variation of existing ability)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">It would be nice to summon someone back to their body even if you can't give them exp back because it really sucks when your Cleric dies, their traveling ability is bad enough clothed, it is horrendous with no gear. This is in reference to GoD of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Are we wanting to make the game much easier again?<br />
<br />
Getting SOW used to be a big deal until Run3.<br />
Getting a TP or a TL to get anywhere was trouble until PoK.<br />
Losing your corpse was a dreaded thought until GY's.<br />
<br />
Been playing since 2001 on 6 different classes including a cleric and necro (summon corpse) that can rez as well as a wizard that can TP and TL, and a shaman that can cast SOW.<br />
<br />
The way Sony has been at it.. I say why not.. the game is still fun for me and the previous changes I mentioned has not made an impact on the games fun factor for me.<br />
<br />
A forth class for rez?  GO FOR IT.<br />
<br />
Actually, I would just be happy if they made EE's buyable from vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Rez is more useful now than it has been in years because of the GoD trials.  Especially considering that 2 of the 3 rez classes (clerics and paladins) are the most likely to die in a trial group (save maybe pullers).  Necros rock in GoD groups for this (and their monsterous sustained damage). FD+rez is a lifesaver, nothing more frustrating than losing your rezzer near the end of a trial.<br />
<br />
I would not mind seeing some expensive type of rez available for everyone, perhaps made by necros and involving several EE's, specifically aimed at this (not for general use).</div></div><hr />
