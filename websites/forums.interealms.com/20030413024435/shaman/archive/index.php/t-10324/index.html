<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sanosake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to confirm the tear is MQ'able as of Jan. 27, 2003. Ranak did the quest without killing Neh and Kirn (I have my reasons for decieding not to do them) and the final turn-in was successful.<br />
<br />
Since I relied on the forum for lots of information, I figured I'd tell people that it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can mq the tear unless you have turned in the scale to Rak to get the epic.<br />
<br />
When I turned in the scale, I lost my truespirit faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same here, Truespirit faction down to indiff after obtaining the spear two days ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">guildie of mine had a tear and MQ'd it with me yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Had a tear MQed for me last night.<br />
<br />
I did everything by the numbers up to that point, helped on a PoF break-in but was unable to stay for the duration of the raid so a guildie looted the tear for me.<br />
<br />
Rak was warmly to me, and I did every step aside from the tear MQ, so hopefully I won't have to do a whole lot of factioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you've done Neh already Grayskies, you should be ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well that's interesting.  I've had no luck getting the Tear so far.  The one time I got to go to Fear there wasn't a full spawn (no Golem no Tear).  All other forays I've planned to go to have been cancelled due to someone else got there first *sigh*.<br />
<br />
I've done the quest complete up to this point, but am becoming increasingly frustrated at not being able to finish what most consider such an easy epic quest.  I haven't killed Neh Ashir yet, but have High Scale Kirn's ring from the Hole.  I believe our guild can easily deal with the CoM part.<br />
<br />
That being said anyone on Mith Mar gotta Tear they wanna MQ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">truespirit faction is changed to indifferent now, but all it requires is the MQer to redo parts to get faction to max ally again, then tear is MQable w/o problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shouldnt we really stop talking about one of the hardest parts of our epic been MQ'able(obtaining a tear) before VI comes after us?<br />
<br />
Just a thought!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, that would be the icing on the cake for VI to ignor all the ranting about rare spells, broken alchemy, parchment turn-ins and fix it so you can't MQ the tear.<br />
<br />
For me the Tear is broken part of the quest anyway because I can't seem to manage to get to Fear before its been cleared.  So fix it so you can force the Golem spawn and I'll be happy to see the MQ'able part go away!<br />
<br />
It seems like a lot of quests are broken in this way.  Provide a way to force the quest spawns and make everyone happy.  Rare and overcamped spawns are frustrating and boring.<br />
