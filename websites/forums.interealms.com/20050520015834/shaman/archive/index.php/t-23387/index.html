<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi<br />
<br />
I was quite curious to get the opinion of raiders, particularly those in the end game and those who take an active part in leading raids or recruiting for guilds about the requirement for clerics in high end guilds.<br />
<br />
My thoughts are that currently clerics are far too crucial for EQ to be healthy, and rosters/recruitment policies reflect that. I do think it is also very hard to make interesting events that are not 'gimped' by having an usually high % of clerics though, which makes things relatively hard to balance. <br />
<br />
I don't think the change is bring druid and shaman healing closer to cleric, because clerics do deserve their own niche, but merely making events and content that does not require around mobs with extreme DPS.  I believe that requiring more than 6 members of a certain class in a raid is absolutely insane, and any raid leader here can testify as how cleric turnout is very often the key to a victory.<br />
<br />
It is too late to change stuff for the current expansions, and mudflation with OoW soon will allow us to do events requiring less healers, but anyone in OoW beta testing the raids should make sure that none of those raids should require more than 6 clerics at the very top.  Raids can be challenging without requiring an army of clerics, and experience groups shouldn't be locked into taking a cleric if they wish to do non trivial experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm sure SOE would love to figure out how to make events that don't require tons of clerics. Unfortunately, they just don't seem to have anyone there any more with enough creativity to do so.<br />
<br />
My guild has been clearing Time for months; we have it down to 6 hours Tier 1 to Quarm dead, and have cleared the zone at least 20 times, plus all the earlier raids that didn't manage to kill Quarm but worked up slowly. And yet, last night, we had to ask 2 people to log their alt clerics on for Tier 5, because our cleric Class Leader wouldn't put together CH rotation with less than 10 clerics.<br />
<br />
We have fought Bartx 4 times now in Uqua, haven't beaten him yet. We don't even bother going in there with less than 8 clerics--out of a 54 person raid.<br />
<br />
Those sorts of numbers are ridiculous. There is NO reason a game with 16 classes in it should require that 1/6 to 1/7 of the total members of a raid have to be from one class. Its purely a lack of creativity in the development at SOE. But then, that shouldn't surprise me, give what we know of people like Rytan, etc.<br />

He is a very cool guy, and while he usually has his own ideas, he is willing to listen to feedback.<br />
<br />
The point is that he is between a rock and a hard-place, while I cannot speak for him, the solution is not quite as simple as it seems.<br />
<br />
I hope that if enough people go ahead and complain about this, then they will be forced to intervene, so our only hope is to be heard.<br />
<br />
I also want to add that in no way do I think clerics should be marginilized.  I think clerics should always be the best healers.  I do not think that clerics however should be required in the numbers that they are.</div></div><hr />

Sure thing.<br />
<br />
Certain encounters require an inordinante amount of * A * class (in this case Cleric) to succeed.<br />
<br />
Poster A laments this fact and offers a tepid solution.  Poster B comments on the lack of imagination of certain devs * WITH A HISTORY OF ZERO IMAGINATION OR FLEXIBILITY * and names one.<br />
<br />
You jump in and defend your friend and ask that the thread stay on &quot;topic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well the &quot;topic&quot; is the state of EQ where * DEVELOPERS * have made encounters that * REQUIRE * an inordinante amount of * A * particular class.<br />
<br />
Such * LACK OF IMAGINATION AND MENTAL FLEXIBILITY * has been seen before by * THIS CLASS * (that would be Shaman) specifically in the area of * STAT BUFFS *<br />
<br />
Point of fact - we ARE staying on topic. You may not like the cold, hard truth that your friend has been painted with the mental rigidity brush, but fact of the matter his own comments DAMN him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As long as Cleric healing is far and away the best healing power in the game, Clerics will be in massive demand.  The Gap is FAR too wide between Clerics and anyone else as a primary healer.  It's as simple as that.  Close the gap and give clerics some other side abilities to compensate.<br />
<br />
What they should have been doing for the last few expansions is closing the gap between Clerics, Druids, and Shaman as far as healing goes.  It's fine for Clerics to be the best, but the gap should be more like CLR 100, DRU 85, SHM 70.  Druids and Shaman would actually be fairly well balanced then, but obviously Clerics would need some pretty hefty tuning to continue to be valuable to groups/raids without their stranglehold on healing.  IMO, that'd be a good thing though.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The main problem is they cannot really change this without making the classes blur together even more. I agree that at LEAST druids should have healing nearly equal to Cleric, but Clerics MUST get something pretty large in return, and that is some of the solo-ability or group utility that Druids have. <br />
<br />
There is no real logical reason for Shaman to be less than Druids heal-wise though. In fact, I think upping Shaman healing to EXACTLY Druid level, including a SotW type AA, would relieve a lot of the dependance guilds have on Clerics. Well maybe not a lot, but perhaps guilds like Fuda's could go after Braxt with 8 instead of 10, or something, so maybe 20%? Just guessing. <br />
<br />
Speaking for myself, I dont want to heal like a druid or cleric. Perhaps instead of a new class like Berzerker, they need one that is more between a Druid and Cleric, or Shaman and Cleric. Something that can CH and port/snare, or CH and slow. Of course, Clerics would never allow this, and if you have ever read their boards, they are almost as arrogant as Warriors. A clkeric sit-in would grind the raidin portion of EQ to a complete halt, heh.</div></div><hr />

Well, you derailed it by trying to defend Rytan.  Hes a tool.  Members of this community have repeatedly shows, through parses and math, that stat buffs are worthless.  Rytan refuses to listen.  He has been shown healing differentials and he refuses to listen.<br />
<br />
All it takes to see that stat buffs are worthless for about 45% of the playing community is to look at EQrankings.  The top 50% have maxed stats.  What good can we do for people like that?<br />
<br />
So, Rytan has decided to change our stat buffs and give us +5% aviodance and what have you.  GREAT!  Now the spells that I will be able to cast in OOW (IF I can get them) wil be on par with some of the effects that are already on armors that are coming out of GoD.  Pardon me while I wet myself with joy.  Here's to  hoping that there isnt a cap placed on the % increases allowed by armors, cause if there ever is, shaman buffs will worthles...again.<br />
<br />
THAT is the work of you &quot;pretty cool guy&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To bring this thread back on track, cleric issues has been plaguing this game for several years now.<br />
<br />
If they wanted/cared about a way to fix the issue of no cleric = no raid, they would have done so.<br />
<br />
There are two ways of dealing with the problem:<br />
<br />
1) Make druids/shamans better healers to fill the clerics roles.<br />
<br />
2) Design encounters differently.<br />
<br />
The way EQ has been going the last 4 years i forsee no change.<br />
<br />
However, they DID make pets zone, so i guess anything CAN happen in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I offered no solutions, and I do think that shamans and monks are the classes that currently need the most boosts in EQ.  I suggested a few things, mostly allowing shamans to slow 'one more' level of mitigation than other classes, so shamans should be allowed to fully slow mostly slowable mobs, mostly slow partially slowable mobs and so forth.<br />
<br />
However, this is not a thread about class balance, at least not directly.<br />
<br />
It is first about the depedence on cleric and its effect on raiding guilds.  I do think that shaman and druid healing should be boosted, but I think most of the fixing needs to be done at the root, by balancing content not assuming a turnout of 6+ clerics.</div></div><hr />

I do not :)  I merely wanted to clarify my position, and quell people who thought I had an anti shaman agenda, I thought I made it clear those two things were separate?  This is more of a fix for 6 man groups, when druids mitigate damage as well as shamans through ATK debuffs, then it is obvious that there is an imbalance.</div></div><hr />

While I said I find Rytan to be a nice person to discuss things with, I don't think I can classify myself as a 'friend' of his, I said that in the conversations I had with him he seemed like an intelligent guy with a good understanding of EQ issues.<br />
<br />
I merely want opinion, and to give a voice to how wide spread the problem really is.  Part of the problem I feel is that a lot of content gets play tested by truly top guilds with inflated rosters, so developers make content balanced against however many clerics the truly top guilds can field.<br />
<br />
I guess I mostly want opinions on the problem, but mostly I was hoping to start a discussion and to clarify the magnitude of the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Blazz I don't think CH for druids and shaman would really solve the situation. It would help in some situations but we use a Holy light chain as often if not mor often now a days. Especially in new content.<br />
<br />
As for people sugguesting they design content differently I ask you HOW could they design the content? There are very few things that can make content difficult. Anything that requires healing to counter part of the difficulty is going to keep clerics as the most desired class. Especially since they are the only preist class that gets group heals other than an AA. The gulf is too great. Any amount of dmg being delt that a shaman or druid could handle healing is going to be nearly trival for a cleric. Honestly who do you think they are going to want healing. The shaman chain casting his heal to barely keep up or the cleric who's easily handling it?<br />
<br />
How can you fail a raid with you heals being the big issue? for those of you sugguesting designing the content differently I ask you to give an example.<br />
<br />
As people have said the only way to make clerics less of a requirement on raids is make it so they aren't the only viable healer. Only way to do that is to drasticly improve shaman and druid heals. Until then Clerics will always be stuck being the only healer and will always be in high demand for raids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">More fights like Mindrider please.<br />
<br />
Mindrider fight is a joke.  The hard part is managing through the lag of the the four wards casting 20 spells each at once every other tick.<br />
<br />
The designer of Inktu'ta did a good job at making encounters that require little healing power.  Kelekdrix doesn't put out that much dps. My guild has done her before with 4 clerics, a few druids and 2 shamans.  Stonemite event doesn't require a lot of healing either.  The cursecaller event actually requires no healing at all.  And we seldom lose tanks on Noqufiel other than unlucky deathtouches.<br />
<br />
However, Txevu requires a decent amount of clerics as the encounters are typically the &quot;tank high dps mob&quot; style, so the trend was broken rather quickly.<br />
<br />
As for recruitment of clerics, it's usually a sad state.  Most guilds that are close to end game often accept horrible clerics as long as they can manage to press a button every few seconds on a heal chain.  The quality of player really varies in clerics in higher end guilds.  That can't be said for most other classes.  I trust only about 3 or 4 of my guild's clerics in groups and on new group content.  The others just suck a the twitch gaming required for being a healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We've done him with 5 clerics and 7 druids.  A lot of GoD can be done with spam healing and druid spam healing is pretty close to cleric power if they have the appropriate AA and foci.  We'll go for any sub-Txevu target if we have 10 healers (druids and clerics) on.  A shaman plus a druid is equivalent to a cleric when it comes to spam heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You really need a 10 person chain for Rallos (bert/ct/inny dont have the DPS that rallos does)?  I dont think we've ever used more then 6 in a chain (+ spams).  Of course we have a lot of botted clerics too.  I've seen raids where 6 of 8 clerics were bots (all on chain too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The biggest problem is the priests have little to distinguish themselves with, and therefore the majority of raid content is very similar.<br />
<br />
If, say, only Shamancould cure poison and disease dots<br />
And only Druids could cure ice and fire dots<br />
And only Clerics could cure magic and curse dots<br />
<br />
Then you could design some raids where certain AE's would need to be dealt with by one priest class.  As it is, all priests can pretty much cure the same things, buff hitpoints, and heal.  The problem is, we are the worst out of all three:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Blazz I don't think CH for druids and shaman would really solve the situation. It would help in some situations but we use a Holy light chain as often if not mor often now a days. Especially in new content.<br />
I realize it wouldnt be a total solution, but it would certainly reduce the need for clerics to raid, which is what this is basically about. Put a few Shaman and druids in a CH chain, the clerics can spam-heal with their superior fast heal, instead of the other way around. <br />
<br />
Its very difficult to degign content around less healing though. There are a couple ways, but you cannot have EVERY raid fit into those couple molds. As it stands now, they have a fairly well varied array of ways to deal damage that need healing solutions. AEs, adds, traps, triggered stuff, spike DPS, etc. The problem is, the more they create these situations, the more you need clerics. A 7500 ch and 2500 fast heal would make Shamans and Druids almost interchangable with Clerics in raids. <br />
<br />
Dont see any of this happening though. I think this is one of those &quot;thats the deal&quot; things. In return for this bump though, I would gladdly give Clerics a minor slow, a small snare, a couple ports, a DOT or 2 and a bigger non-undead Nuke. That would make Clerics interchangable (to some degree) with Shamans and Druids, /shrug. But then, what we end up with, is a pretty vanilla blurring of the classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">With the lowering of raid sizes the cleric dependancy issue becomes even worse. 1/5 to 1/6 a raid being made up of a single class, even if they are half bots isn't right. <br />
<br />
Giving the other priests large slow heals (well so far just druids really) helps, but still what are you going to want on your chain? A cleric that can stand there and cast a 400 mana spell and yaulp to regan mana constantly or a druid that has to cast a 600 mana spell that doesn't have the same ability to regan mana. Adding the large heal made it so duids could fill in for a missing cleric in some situations, but they're not going to be able to keep it up for as long. And well forget shaman all together for any kind of large healing. <br />
<br />
I never want to have my shaman tossed in a cheal rot, but I also hate seeing the ammount of clerics that are required. As mob dps keeps going up and up and up the percentage of the raid thats required to be clerics will keep rising too. <br />
<br />
As far as designing fights that require this kind of insane healing, one solution I can think of is more fights where you don't have one huge giant dps machine with maybe some adds that still have huge dps. What about more wave style events, like 30 mobs spawn that can be tanked by anything from a ranger up to a warrior and have low enough dps that all the classes can provide decent healing against them Quantity over quality? Not sure if it'd actually work, but it would be different from the typical trash then 4-5k hitter boss that it seems the end game stuff consists of now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The argument that clerics are overpowered in their healing abilities doesn't address the real problem(s). Frankly, to stick to topic question asked, when healing is required in such volume - who should be the class to provide it?<br />
<br />
Now, to walk away from the topic question, and get to the real point. SOE decided the direction of the game is for the fast/high dps/low mob hitpoint encounters. Their stated rational is that &quot;players&quot; did not want long fights. I have no clue what 2 players they asked to get this opinion from.<br />
<br />
So in developing these new 2-second fights, SOE opted to remove shaman from the equation. If fights were going to be fast then the challenge was determined to be mass-healing against mobs that cannot be slowed (or who mitigate.) In short, mob dps cannot be minimized. Right there is SOEs definition of new encounters. The counter to this was to provide clerics with faster casting, higher cost yet encounter significant heals that can be spammed in reverse-damage burst. Think of cleric healing for these encounters as the healing equivalent to wizard nuking - fast, effective, dominating.<br />
<br />
To clarify: shaman were intentionally marginalized to change encounter dynamics - clerics were intentionally ramped up due to the new encounter dynamics. Had clerics not been beefed up in quick healing abilities the effect of unslowable/mitigating mobs would have made these encounters impossible to win ... without even more and more clerics required.<br />
<br />
Shaman are looking for that one unique spot to fill. It used to be slowing. It used to be backup healing. It used to off-tanking adds. It used to be a number of things based on the needs of the moment. A good shaman saw what was needed and jumped in to make &quot;the impossible trivial.&quot;<br />
<br />
The quality of those unique spots in newer content are not there. That is not to say a shaman cannot contribute. It is to say shaman are not capable of contributing in the same manner or with nearly the same impact as the class was designed to do (or can do in older content.) This is the crux.<br />
<br />
Keep your heals, clerics. SOE - change encounters to make them worthwhile to all classes, as well as to require all classes to provide their UNIQUE abilities in order to succeed. I know this falls upon deaf ears - but there really is the crux. Give shaman the ability to do their damn jobs as shaman.<br />
<br />
It is a pretty lame argument to justify slow nerfage because &quot;players want faster encounters&quot; ... when it takes hour upon hour to work your way up to that encounter.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Hi<br />
<br />
I was quite curious to get the opinion of raiders, particularly those in the end game and those who take an active part in leading raids or recruiting for guilds about the requirement for clerics in high end guilds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Something you touched on earlier, recruiting. When I was an officer in a guild I got to see a lot more of the recruiting process. We were just short of the ep's at the time and clerics had a free ride really. Didn't matter if they were dumber then a box of rocks, had crappy gear, no raid experience, and no flags. If they could figure out how to make a cheal chain macro (and some really even needed help with that) and played more then once a week they'd pretty much be a shoe in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Yup, if you have a pulse and a HL/CH hotkey you go where you f***ing please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Seconded, I cringe sometimes when lfg and I get a guild group and I see who the cleric is - I know we are going to struggle. <br />
<br />
Some of them are marvelous - I would go into the deepest dungeon anywhere with some of our clerics, others, well, enough said.......<br />
<br />
The highest guild in our server is now recruiting clerics, the requirements for them are so far below what other classes need it is a joke.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to say also, the stranglehold clerics have on the game HAS to be broken. Its going to mean a lot of pain for the cleric class overall but any class that is required to make up 15%+ of a raid force and is automatically a shoo-in for difficult content over any other class but a warrior (meaning any group only has 5 open slots because one of them HAS to be a cleric) is overpowered massively.<br />
<br />
Seriously, the priest balance needs to be re-evaluated. One thing that concerns me is that a lot of shamans are happy being the backup healer, and druids also - we shouldn't be - we are healers and priests, all priests should be capable of forming an xp group, keeping it alive in level appropriate content, having fun and there should be no discernible difference between the rate of xp gain or group deaths with each of the 3 priests (notice no difference).<br />
<br />
Sony have shown in the past they can make difficult choices for the good of the overall game - look at monk nerfs, solo charming chanter nerfs, slow mitigation nerfs, removal of game unbalancing items (manastone, that twig thing :) ) etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I liked the City of Heroes way of healing. You could specialize in Empathy, which was direct healing. Force fields, which mitigated incoming damage. Darkness mitigated the opponents accuracy, etc, etc, etc....<br />
<br />
I've heard EQ2 allows for different kinds of healing through the priest classes as well. I think Shaman use the mitigation there, Druids use HoTs and Clerics have direct heals? I don't keep up with them, this is just what I've heard, but bringing all priests in line with one another and healing in different ways could be a solution.<br />

<br />
IMHO give the cleric some brand new powers (along the lines of Divine Intervention (perhaps uber dmg on a mob when a raid member dies or something) AND buff up heal power of druids a bit.<br />
<br />
My guild is currently at around 50-60 strong in raids, we are currently fighting to EP (Recently killed Bertox, Angnarr, brothers Zek) and typically have in raid turnout:<br />
<br />
5 clerics<br />
4 Druids<br />
8 shamans<br />
<br />
We have noticed (since about Rydda'Dar) that the mobs are hitting harder and faster and clerics are becoming more valuable, though at the moment we are getting by with Druids heavily sharing the load and a battery of Tnargs' from the shamans.<br />
<br />
Given what I have seen on raids, I can see that boosting shaman and druid heals just a bit would have a massive impact (and/or use the idea of shamans slowing one tier more -- after all the more a slowed a mob is the less dmg it does and the less we need to heal it) on their utility in raids.<br />
<br />
As it stands, we are recruiting aggresively for clerics in preparation for EP.<br />
--<br />
<br />
I wish we could make raids less one sided. One way to fix that would (possibly) go for longer term fights. I don't mean Seru all over again but longer fights nonetheless. As soon as fights extend longer, shaman slowing and also dotting start to become more important.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day it needs to be a team effort. As long as everyone in the team has something to offer (no, buffing and handing out pet toys does NOT count) in a raid scenario you have a recipe for challenge and fun :)</div></div><hr />

Just read your original post again Mearis.<br />
<br />
I agree with yor belief. I always wanted EQ to be about groups of &quot;Heroes&quot; rather than armies which is what we seem to have right now.<br />
<br />
I am not in the endgame, I have not raided GoD, but from the fact that when I do the tipt trial I see that you either need massive dps (chanter pets on steroids) or massive healing (EP/Time Tank with 2 Clerics in the group) I am assuming that the same will apply to GoD raiding, and to the new OOW expansion.<br />
<br />
I don't think this is something new, as posters above have said, but has been the trend for quite some time.<br />
<br />
What can we do? I think people who have direct connections with the game design team (is Rytan a designer? You seem to know him yes?) could lobby them for change in the NEXT expansion after OOW.<br />
<br />
I doubt that at this stage (public beta) in OOW testing will game designers want to change the entire premise of raids in EQ as it stands, and will be much more interested in tweaks to make sure the raids are neither impossible nor &quot;trivial&quot; for the &quot;content glutton&quot; guilds.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly new on the Crucible, but I've seen Shamans posting here for donkeys years about how our class was undermined with the move to superfast BAM BAM fights... They clearly didn't read these posts ( I find that hard to believe) or read them and ignored them. The whole &quot;invite you over to San Diego and we will listen to you with a big smile on our face&quot; was a pure PR event. Very common tactic in business and politics.<br />

<br />
&quot;End Quote&quot;<br />
<br />
I've seen this also, not so much but its a definite trend. Or they join a guild as a cleric and then try to change main after 6 months.<br />
<br />
Part of the reason for this is so many people read boards now, or have played for a while, and recognise that their best chance of getting into a full-time, high level raiding guild is to roll up a cleric and level him quick to 65 and 100aa's - not so difficult now with quick xp whereas in the past it used to be a very hard decision if you weren't going to be PL'd. <br />
<br />
The problem with these is they are not really clerics by heart, they just wanted to join that &quot;uber guild&quot; and they find after time that they get bored, burn-out, retire or change class - and then another cleric slot opens. Lets face it, cleric has to be one of the most boring classes in EQ (certainly on raids) unless in extremely challenging content.<br />
<br />
It amazes me when you go to the cleric boards how every one of them created their character to be a healer. If this interest in healing is reflected in RL (given the demographic of EQ players) then I would expect the USA (and other countries) to have absolutely no problem recruiting doctors and health professionals for the next 10 years :p. <br />
<br />
I mean, lets face it, given EQ's demographic of predominantly younger males between 16 and 27 (pure guess here) does anybody remotely believe that 15%+ of that age groups primary wish, when creating a character, was to be a specialised healer as opposed to a melee or nuker of some kind, unless there was another motive for playing that class? This is even excluding shamans and druids, if you say these add another 15% of the population then it looks even more skewed towards the healing classes that 3 classes of 16 = about 1/3 of all classes in game<br />
<br />
Would-be &quot;uber guilders&quot; and those who are going to level to 65 and burn-out through boredom because they are trying to be an &quot;uber guilder&quot; think hard about your choice. So you get to that uber guild by skipping 70% of EQ content, get your full Time+ gear, then become a number in a CH chain, or HL chain. What achievements are left then but to pharm better gear and occasionally kill the next mob in the line of which there will be very few if you are in that uber guild. Yaay, so you &quot;beat&quot; EQ, for me the game is about the journey with close friends not the &quot;skip everything from Tier 3 PoP to end GoD so I can be uber with people I hardly know. :) <br />
<br />

However, I do agree with your paragraph on the &quot;wannabes&quot;. I'd rather have fun with a bunch of people I know and we can challenge ourselves, than have to worry about not lagging and being able to count to 10 (at most).<br />
<br />
It can be way more fun grouping than raiding anyway, as all 6 members of the group have a significant role to play, where I'm sure any raider will tell you that one non-cleric, non-MT AFK, and rarely does anybody notice.</div></div><hr />

My experience as a cleric is actually the opposite. Because raids use more clerics per others than single groups will support (once you deduct the soloers and cleric exp group boxer) there is usually an overabundance of top guild clerics when it comes time to exp. I know that atleast some other guilds have the same &quot;problem&quot; - so I would not consider your point of view as anything but a local problem.

To compensate for lack of specialization (as if there really is such a thing anymore outside of the cleric class) is to bump up cleric melee capabilities.  Give them a melee damage table somewhere between a meleer and a priest.  Shamans &quot;specialty&quot; for damage dealing is dots (which need some reworking) and druids have DDs.

You are right I totally contradicted myself :)<br />
<br />
In my first quote, I wanted to say that I don't think they should have cleric level of healing, not lack of improvement as such.  The reason for that is, if the solution was merely raising the level of healing across the board, developers will just react to that by raising the level of healing required for raid, so instead of just needing 8 clerics per raid, you will need 6 clerics, 6 druids, 6 shamans.  As such, any change has to incorporate both improving healing for healer class, and not making content that requires massive healing.<br />
<br />
It is a two prong solution, thanks for pointing it out though, the way I worded it it did contradict each other totally.<br />
<br />
About Rytan.  I am sorry about the derail, I do not 'know' him that well, but I did chat with him once or twice and those were really good conversations.  I do agree that buffs need to be made a lot more significant, but again I didn't discuss those with him.</div></div><hr />

Mikar, I agree with you 100%.<br />
<br />
Some raids if you are extremly overgeared for them, are doable with a very small number of clerics.  The issue is, that adding more clerics makes them much much easier and you won't get diminishing returns for a long time.<br />
<br />
Realistically speaking, in most situations, whether your DPS comes from rangers, mages, wizards, rogues, or necromancers you don't care.  None of those classes are tipically 'required'.  You want dps, all those classes can provide it in different flavours, however even though tipically wizards and rogues tend to be higher DPS on raid encounters you won't suffer if your DPS classes are shuffled around.  Wizards, tend to do better raid DPS than other classes, but the gain from changing any other DPS class to a wizard is much smaller than changing a healer class to a cleric.<br />
<br />
I agree that 'less' clerics are needed than people think, but if you can make something much much easier by overloading your raid with clerics, why not?</div></div><hr />

Great, but do you realize that as long as raids have a huge need for healing, you will always be more efficient healing than debuffing/DoT'ing?<br />
<br />
Debuffing as is implemented in EQ does not stack, and even if your heals are relatively speaking much weaker than your DoT compared to the parent class, heals are much much more useful than generic DPS.<br />
<br />
For example, if necromancers were given holy light, all their other spells would become obsolete, because they would be expected to just use holy light.  This dilemma first appeared in Luclin, when mages were given modulation rods.  Even though mages could nuke and debuff, since they had mod rods, they were expected to do nothing but make mod rods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Mikar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Giving other priests a raid only CH (functionally if not technically), Paladins a clicky rez, shaman DI and druids a (small) group heal would go along way towards solving the problem of &quot;another clerics is better than another of just about any class&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sure, not all encounters are about CH - but if druids/priests could also CH in addition to other tasks (doesnt have to be in a chain - simply CH) then clerics could act as the spot healers. With DI for shaman and a small druid group heal yet another 2 clerical vital tasks would be shared around.<br />
<br />
In short - the solution very much doesnt have to be in raising shaman/druid spot heals.<br />
<br />

That aside. Technically and balance wise the perfect solution would simply be to limit raids so that no more than 6 of any class can be present - but thats almost surely not socially an accceptable solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Giving other priests a raid only CH (functionally if not technically), Paladins a clicky rez, shaman DI and druids a (small) group heal would go along way towards solving the problem of &quot;another clerics is better than another of just about any class&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sure, not all encounters are about CH - but if druids/priests could also CH in addition to other tasks (doesnt have to be in a chain - simply CH) then clerics could act as the spot healers. With DI for shaman and a small druid group heal yet another 2 clerical vital tasks would be shared around.<br />
<br />
In short - the solution very much doesnt have to be in raising shaman/druid spot heals.<br />

I think giving druids and shamans CH would have been an acceptable solution during the planes of power, but most of the fights right now tend to be very fast paced making fast heals preferred.<br />
<br />
Giving CH would defently help for PoP, but I can hardly think of many raid events where CH is used over HL now in GoD - on the flipside, a shaman with CH will be strictly superior to a cleric in experience groups.</div></div><hr />

Assuming you don't have a beastlord and/or enchanter and/or druid.  Assuming slow isn't mitigated.  Assuming nobody dies and wants a rez.  I'll agree that clerics need something more to do in an exp group - especially if priest healing is leveled across the classes.  But they bring a LOT more than CH to the table in an exp group that are a little less flashy than CH.  Much like a shaman brings more than just slow to the group.  <br />
<br />
The problem seems clear.  The game is FAR too reliant on CH - it's how content is balanced.  You can either spread CH (or better healing) to the other priests, or remove it from the game.  The latter is NOT going to happen.  And if the former happens, clerics need something to push them back up relative to the other classes.  They made a sacrifice when they picked cleric, versatility for healing power (much as shamans sacrificed healing power for versatility).  If the game will be improved by giving all priests CH, that's a great starting point - and it would be nice if they balanced from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Without going into detail, I was in a one group event in the Omens beta last night. Even after being outfitted with 8 times more AA than I have, level 70, and all spells, I was still useless. High resists + slow mitigation on everything + crappy heals + mob dies in 30-45 seconds = shaman is dead weight.<br />
<br />
It's too bad everything I've seen thus far is this way... highly resistant + mitigates + fast mob deaths + still crappy heals. You do the math.<br />
<br />
I refuse to see my fellow shamans get reamed in another expansion and waste another $30 if they wasted their $30 on Gates.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind longer fights, as long as the rewards coincide with it. Sure, it's still in beta and under review, but they have 13 days, and when is the last time an expansion (or even a regular patch) went live without some serious bug(s)/problem(s)? Just look at how long it took to &quot;fix&quot; Gates, and even then ... good luck finding/forming a group for Gates with a shaman. As I've said in the past, I get raves constantly about skill, but I try to find or form a Gates group, someone sees &quot;Shaman&quot; and says &quot;No thanks&quot;.<br />
<br />
We, as the shaman community, don't need to explain this and rehash our usefulness to ourselves. It needs to be explained to the other 14 classes. Considering our &quot;one trick&quot; has seen a nerf stick, our other tricks aren't worth using (for a variety of reasons, depending on the &quot;trick&quot;).<br />
<br />
*plink plink* My 2 cents on it.</div></div><hr />

Ok, so I spend $30.00 on Gates or $30.00 at Hooters or the Gold Club.<br />
<br />
Ok I'll be honest, it's $30.00 at Hooters AND Gold Club.</div></div><hr />

Simultaneously my expectation AND biggest fear about this expansion.<br />
<br />
Beyond not buying this POS, I really wish I could get my money back from Gates of Discord.  Add those together and I just paid for World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Felstaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Great, but do you realize that as long as raids have a huge need for healing, you will always be more efficient healing than debuffing/DoT'ing?<br />
<br />
Debuffing as is implemented in EQ does not stack, and even if your heals are relatively speaking much weaker than your DoT compared to the parent class, heals are much much more useful than generic DPS.<br />
<br />
Therein lies a large part of the problem. Making shaman heals bigger or better would merely further the current harmful trend toward making everyone interchangeable within the 3 basic tasks, damage taking, damage dealing and healing. The more everyone's capabilities are homogenized in that way, the less interesting the game gets.<br />
<br />
I guess it's a double-edged sword.</div></div><hr />

Ahh, so in this world of mitigated slows, pimpn slow out to other classes, and the current paradigm of speed....<br />
<br />
Shaman should accept and be happy with our current healing state because to improve it would - <br />
<br />
a) Upset Clerics and Druids?<br />
b) Make us viable?<br />
c) Do WHAT exactly?<br />
<br />
Man, it's like what the guy said in  Zoolander <br />
<br />
The Shaman has no roles for Christ's sake. Slow? Heal? DoT? They're the same useless outmoded, outdated, mitigated and  pimped out on weapons abilities. Doesn't anyone notice this? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at all. What I'm saying is that any changes made to correct shaman deficiencies at the top should not revolve around making us more like another class.<br />
<br />
Slows, DoT's and buffs/debuffs. Make em worthy Shaman tactics again and all will be fixed, IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild is currently working on the last encounter in Txevu / first encounter in Tacvi. In most encounters in GoD that I have seen putting 3-5 shaman/druids on CHing would be benifitial over spot healing with a 2k heal. Sure, for a cleic with a 4k heal its often better to spot - but thats not the debate here.<br />
<br />
As for the grouping and CH - thats why I specifically state that it would need to functionally be raid only and possibly interfere negatively with Canni too. The details of how to implement that arent really importent here and now - only the concept is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">2 months ago i was being flamed for suggesting healing upgrades on par with clerics for druids, let alone shaman.<br />
<br />
Now people finally got it: having cleric being the only decent healers in the game is like saying one class will do maximum dps and all the other will do half the damage... whats the point of the other classes then?<br />
<br />
I quit, so i shouldn't care, but i love being right, and i love when people are wrong.</div></div><hr />
