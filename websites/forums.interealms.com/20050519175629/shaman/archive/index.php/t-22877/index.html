These are all bracers from Pixtt Xxeric Kex, the first mob in Tacvi.  So casters, ok necros, get the best PR DoT dmg increase possible on theirs.  Clerics and Paladins get the best single target heal upgrade focus.  Druids get the best possible FR nuke focus...  and shaman get...  a focus to increase Malosx duration.   Whoopdee f'in do.   Like any mob is ever going to live longer than the 25 mins that Malosinia already lasts.  We lose out on not getting Spell Shield like casters, we get a lot less Avoidance and Shielding than the Plate and Leather version, yet we don't even get a good focus to make up for it like the Druids get.<br />
<br />
Fix this already, I'm tired of getting screwed over on every single item out there.   Either the item is geared 100% towards the other chain classes or we get some stupid focus that is worthless while other casters get some of the best focuses available.<br />
<br />
Discordant Malaise is a joke of a focus.  Change the &quot;Limit: Effect(Magic Resist allowed)&quot; to &quot;Limit: Resist(Magic allowed)&quot; and THEN it would be worth having.  Till then that focus is crap.</div></div><hr />

but dont we have discordant healing on the qvic sleeves? hmm, have to check that i think .. (and that effect is still better than the slow-enhancer on the bp, hehe)</div></div><hr />

And we get a crap focus.  Thats the issue I'm talking about.  There are tons of other examples as well of unequal loot between the various classes and armor types.<br />
<br />
That focus was specifically put on there for shaman, just as the flame one was for druids.  But as always druids get the good stuff while we get the crap.   Look at our BP's.   We get a worthless focus, druids get Discordant Energy.<br />
<br />
I'm just tired of seeing certain classes getting all the good focuses and effects while certain others get the shaft time after time.</div></div><hr />

If it's Druid bashing then count me in !<br />
<br />
Per the Godfather (Quon)<br />
<br />
Druid - <br />
Nature luvin piss ants. If you really want to keep Norrath beautiful, bring along a shovel to pick up after my horse while you wait for someone to call EVAC. Druids are the exiled pimp class of the nation. Never has a class had it so good for so long. And never has a class taken the pipe so deep and so hard and deserved it so much as these assclowns did. Druids are so out of style now I half expect to see them sporting Mullets and Parachute pants. Hell, the only worthwhile port a Druid can do now is for himself, back to a time when his ****can class was relevent and fun. And Druids...listen up. Don't over-write The Quons buffs. Don't try to drop your second rate CH in front of me. It's just embarrassing. And more than a little sad. On a different note The Quon has a question. <br />
<br />
The Quon's general heal strategy for Druids: None. Your heal's the shizz? Then use it on yourself. <br />
<br />
Respect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well druids and beatslords are sony's Bl0wjob classes, what do you expect?<br />
<br />
them to seriously give other classes not needed for raids good foci ?<br />
<br />
if your expendable, you get jack, if your required you get pampered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think one of the biggest gear mistakes that Sony made was to 'clump' classes together for gearing purposes.  Yes, Rogues, rangers, berzerkers and shaman can all wear chain armors.  Shaman, however, are the only caster in a group of DPS classes for armor.  I personally think that causes problems.  It all started in Velious when each class competed for a chain drop and turned it in for a specific class armor.  In PoP we competed for ornate drops and turned it in for a class specific armor.  In GoD we all 4 fight for the same armor.<br />
<br />
SOE is lazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In GoD we all 4 fight for the same armor.<br />
i am rather glad that its like that, at least a similar mayhem as in PoP cannot happen any more.<br />
I mean, we had in our PoP-Time over 350 drops of elemental leather sketches and under 100 elemental chain drops. Leather always went for minbid or even rotted, the chain classes fought over the rare chain drops like wild dogs over a good steak (i mean, we had all in all exactly a whopping 1 chain helmet and 1 chain leggins drop in about one year of pop-flagging and reflagging).<br />
That way the chances are equal for all and the druid-maffia cannot build up incredible tp amounts with getting every elemental piece any more and cannot use it agains the other classes for shared loot.<br />
<br />
i think that was a very very good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You are wrong, Thorzion. GoD (as well as PoP) has class specific (quest) armor (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=kanlek) too. In the leather section we have 1 pure melee, 1 hybrid and 1 caster compared to 2 pure melee, 1 hybrid and 1 caster in chain section. Plate has 1 pure melee, 2 hybrids (plus bard) and 1 caster. Only silk has 4 casters. This means that every armor class but silk has to balance between  pure melee / hybrid / caster.<br />
<br />
PS: Discordant Posion is not poisin DoT focus. It's for poison nukes. So useless for chanter, wizards, mages AFAIK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Discordant Poison is for single target nukes only.  It's not that great of a focus by any caster class.  By the time most druids see that bracer, they will already have Discordant Flame on their Qvic boots, so it's useless for them.  I'd take Discordant Malaise over the other two any day.  By the Time you reach that mob, you will probably have Discordant Venom, Discordant Energy and Discordant Healing, so Discordant Malaise will actually be non-redundant for most.<br />
<br />
Edit: And you'll get Faerune back most likely, since it's not on the Qvic helm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well Sony has made a habit of lumping chain, plate, etc. together to avoid rottage rather than single class drops.  But, I agree that perhaps they might be advised to rethink that strategy and go priest, caster, dps, tank and adjust the drop rate accordingly.  They do that occasionally on drops so why not make that the norm?<br />
<br />
Grouping classes as I mentioned above would certainly make it easier to put useful stats on gear.  I think that Verant screwed up when they did the chain, leather, etc. they should have just made different avoidance and mitigation tables for each class within the priest, caster, dps and tank categories.<br />

+15 Avoidance<br />
would've made this a much more shaman friendly bracer.<br />
<br />
Not to mention *** is Discordant Time and Discordant Malaise?! When the hell am I ever going to need those foci. Looking into GoD progression I doubt I'll replace my Rosrak's (with a decent focus) with Kanleku's (***?!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Your panties are on too tight if you're complaining THIS much about that bracer.<br />
<br />
Yes, the focus is absolutely pointless.  So what?  Uber stats, great effects, what's the problem?  Also, Faerune rules.  Easily the best effect in the game.<br />
<br />
edit<br />
<br />
Oh, wait.  I just thought of a use for it.  Now when we debuff enchanter charm pets it will last longer!  Huzzah!  That was a joke, btw.  Also the only time I can think of where an 18.2 minute Malos or ~27minute Malosinia could come in handy or practical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I can think of a few situations where extended malos(inia) would have been nice, but they are all PoP not GoD (as Im not far into GoD yet).  Like Rathe encouter, Xegony and any other long arse fights that require keeping mobs alive for a long time.  But again, that's PoP and most of the people that far into GoD only do those encounters for backflagging, some loot and maybe the hell of it.  Over all though, yeah extended malos(inia) is kinda lame, but oh well..the stats and other effects make it more than worth that crappy focii effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ok read lots of posts on various threads on here about how Shaman are pretty much useless in higher end GoD.<br />
So obviously if Shaman are near useless it stands to reason that other classes etc &quot;work harder&quot;(tm) and are &quot;more productive&quot;(tm) so you dont &quot;deserve&quot;(tm) as good a gear as them.<br />
So why should other classes spend as much time doing something &quot;productive&quot;(tm) while the Shaman is standing around tossing the odd nuke and get the equivalent gear to the Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane<br />
<br />
PS<br />
This is a very sarcastic reply as this is how raiders tend to view non raiders and their argument why their gear shouldnt be as good.<br />
<br />
Let the neg rep bumps roll in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right. I didnt mention the drops from raid targets in upper tier GoD  that ALL classes use in their Abysmal armors.  The armor also requires rare drops to make Murmite chain pieces, which triv at 280'ish smithing.  <br />

<br />
Rosrak's has ft4.<br />
Kanleku's has 3mana/hp regen and spell shield 2%.<br />
<br />
Considering the kanleku's are better in every aspect but 1mana regen, I doubt anyone would keep rosrak's over them.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, by the time you can get access to Kanleku's, you won't even have two rosrak's, maybe you will have only one or if you're lucky, you will have replaced both of em.</div></div><hr />
