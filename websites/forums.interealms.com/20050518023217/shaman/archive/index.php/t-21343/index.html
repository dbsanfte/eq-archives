<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I made up a magic controller, but it seems to me there's a lot of those.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have a sense if there's a rare class/combo?  <br />
<br />
That appeals to me more for some reason, but I can't get a sense if there is.  <br />
<br />
The mass communication abilities of COH seem less advanced, or least people don't use them.  It feels almost single player like at times to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As for less advanced vs. people using stuff ... give it time man - it just takes time for folks to get a feel for things.<br />
<br />
Rare vs. common I'd suppose probably changes from server to server, just like auxilliary powers.  On Protector - I've noticed it seems a lot of folks take hover at lvl 6.<br />
<br />
One thing that I have noticed is a LARGE assortment of blasters.  I've even heard of folks that dual-box 2 blasters simultaneously.  I'd say controllers are one of the rarer sets on my server, and probably weather / SS controllers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dullsville</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since there are only five actual classes, it’s pretty hard to tell if one is more rare than the others since I tend to see a lot of each.  When it gets down to primary and secondary power sets within each class though, I would say that is when you might start seeing more rarities.  Granted, in some cases you wouldn’t know what their power sets are unless you ask.<br />
<br />
I do see quite a bit of Blasters, though that’s to be expected when they’re one of the top damaging classes.  The first person to level 40 since the game went live was an Assault Rifle/Devices Blaster, so I’m guessing that wont hurt drawing more people to the class.  I play a Dark Melee/Regen Scrapper, and while I see a lot of Scrappers, I don’t see all that many with my build.  Then again, maybe I’m just not in the right places at the right times.<br />
<br />
I do agree about the lack of communication in the game.  Honestly though, I don’t know if that’s my fault or what.  I started playing this game with a group of friends/guild that I met back in my EQ days, so I already had built in groups and friendships and haven’t had to look elsewhere for them.  With that said, I still don’t really see that much communicating though in the zones that I’ve been through.  I have to say it though, I really hate the chat system in this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On Justice, the most common class is hands down Blaster.  Every group I join is about half blasters - no complaints from me though because blasters are awesome in high numbers.  When you have multiple blasters in the group and engage a boss, it reminds me of watching a group of wizards manaburn gank gorenaire.  The boss will just be standing there and then get nuked all to hell and die before he even knows what hit him.<br />
<br />
Second most common class is probably scrapper, and the vast majority of them take martial arts/regen.<br />
<br />
Controllers are Defenders aren't exactly rare, but they are usually pretty in demand.  Most defenders pick empathy as their primary.<br />
<br />
Rarest on Justice is definately tanker.  I very rarely see them in my groups, but I love when we have one because they are so much easier to heal.<br />
<br />
Note:  this is based on my experience leveling from 1-9, and then again from 1-11.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The overwhelmingly most popular class are the Blasters. Thing is, from information from Beta, a lot of those people are going to be thinking about re-rolling a different archetype once they get to the low 20s, and the monster damage has scaled up a lot faster than Blaster hp/defense.<br />
<br />
Someone did the math, and I believe came up with the figure that there are 137 different primary/secondary combinations in the game. I find it to be reasonably evenly spread, but there are some which are less popular (spines for scrappers, maces for tankers being the big ones, IMO).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I can see why Tankers are rare.<br />
<br />
My level 2 tanker struggled much more than my level 2 controller at the same encounter - and I had a much better idea of what I was doing.  <br />
<br />
He can't separate mobs, he doesn't do much damage, and the increased hp doesn't come close to making up the difference that immobilizing a mob does.  <br />
<br />
As in EQ, avoidance &gt;&gt;&gt; mitigation.  <br />
<br />
And the abilities are themes on being a punching bag.  <br />
<br />
Can they actually do something later on?<br />
<br />
I like the &quot;theme&quot; of the character I made better:  Angry Short Man.  A little guy in a suit with an inferiority complex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tankers are actually quite good. My girlfriend is a stone/super strength tanker.. she wades into a group of 3 or more yellow+ cons, and I barely notice her health drop. Deals a decent chunk of damage too.<br />
<br />
Non empathy defenders are probably the rarest. Overall. Spikes scrappers are pretty uncommon too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unless for some reason they want every class to be identical, it seems that some classes would shine solo, and others would do better in a group.  Scrappers and blasters (up to 10 at least) seem to be phenomenal soloers, however build em.  My defender and controller really only shine when there's at least one other person with me, though.<br />
<br />
For that reason alone I expect there to be fewer controllers and defenders INITIALLY.  Eventually the novelty of soloing will wear off and half the playerbase will roll up one of those two classes, and there will be a glut.  EQ seemed to ebb and flow like that - chanter/cleric/dps/tank seemed to cycle from feast to famine and back again over time.<br />
<br />
The desire to be NEEDED is something that stems from the phasing out of shamans in EQ, IMO - I've felt it myself.  But I've spent a lot of time (and had a lot of fun) filling out my 8 slots on Protector with characters - and getting a feel for what I WANT to play.  What's the most fun.  Because demand for classes is going to fluxuate, no matter what you do.<br />
<br />
Finding a combination of powers that's surprisingly effective is part of the lure of making new characters over and over again.  Honestly, if there were more content for levels 1-10, I'd probably be perfectly happy making new characters for another month or two.  I LOVE discovering what all the powers are - and effective ways to use them together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">According to the Devs, the differences between classes as far as HP, ability to take damage, and differentiation is very small in the first levels, and players are somewhat considerably overpowered for their opposition to give people time to work out the kinks in their characters and figure out how things work. Starting in the late teens, when Dual-Origin Enhancements start becoming common, you'll start seeing the archetypes fall into their categories a bit better. Tankers, for example, just start to be able to stand around in the middle of huge groups of yellow/whites without being in any real danger (it just takes them forever to kill a group like that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Out of all the characters I have my Tank is rapidly becoming the only one I play. He hit 12 last night and I rushed out and bought him 6 DO resist damage enhancements. Can't wait to try them out tonight.<br />
<br />
In groups I just rush in using combat jump and provoke to make everything in the area mad at me and concentrate on the toughest target in the group. The rest of the group can take out the minions while I hold the bosses attention and take a majority of the damage.<br />
<br />
Soloing isn't hard at all and I did it up until about level 8. It is much slower than my blaster or even my defender, but I never had a problem with it. At that point I went to Perez Park for the first time and now I rarely spend more than a minute or two /lfg before I get an invite.<br />
<br />
Now if I could only get people to remember that there are alot more things to do than run around in circles trying to beat the other 12 groups to stupid hydras. For a minute there I almost felt like I was in a BoT group again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The secret to a tanker is to GET A DAMAGE SHIELD EARLY and AUGMENT IT OFTEN.  My tanker would just wade in and start duking it out, with DS on... by the time I turned to the next guy, he was half dead... then typically 2-3 of them would just die on me during that next fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, the tanker is level 5 now and doing fine.  <br />
<br />
It is fun, and god knows I love not buffing now.  <br />
<br />
What enhancements are you guys selecting for jab/punch and for the shields?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fire tankers are the best solo class in the game currently hehe. Though I expect that to change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So I took this post seriously and wanted to create something that did damage but wasn't a Blaster type.    Created a Mutant Controller in the mode of a really small man with a need to prove worth via mind control.<br />
<br />
With my Lev and Pis abilities - as long as the target has mind - even a boss - it can be controlled.   So far I can control 3-4 at a time bouncing between each doing nice damage.   Maybe it's Enc envy but its nice to able to stand off and kill things from a distance without waiting for a DoT.</div></div><hr />
