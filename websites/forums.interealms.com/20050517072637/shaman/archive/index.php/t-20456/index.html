<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I searched the general area, couldn't find anything. I'm looking for some kind of list of all the different run speeds, sow, soe, horses, aa's etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What an awesome question. Here's what I've found:<br />
<br />
115% Spirit of Cheetah<br />
85% Ornate Chain (Emp/Seru) and Knight AA mounts<br />
70% Chain horse, Giant drogmor, Scale of Wolf<br />
65% Flight of Eagles, all Selo's songs (single and group, except as noted below)<br />
60% Silk horse, Large drogmor, Spirit of Eagle (group)<br />
55% Spirit of Wolf, Spirit of Bil'Li (group)<br />
50% Run5, Leather horse, regular drogmor<br />
40% Run4<br />
30% Run3, Spirit of Shrew, Pack Shrew (group)<br />
25% Rope horse, Small drogmor<br />
20% Run2<br />
10% Run1, Selo's Rhythm of Speed (group)<br />
<br />
Please note that the right combination of AAs and gear can reportedly get Selo's speed up to 158%, per posts on EQDiva.com (http://www.eqdiva.com/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=21960).<br />
<br />
Please let me know of any errors or omissions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They say each level of run adds 10%<br />
so...<br />
Run1 10%<br />
Run2 20%<br />
Run3 30%<br />
Run4 40%<br />
Run5 50%<br />
<br />
People say run5 is sow speed which is 55% so logic leads you to believe it is 10% per level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, Itzkul. <br />
<br />
Hey, I don't know much about drogmors - are they summoned via chain/silk/leather/rope, or should I add some additional terminology there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A friend of mine bought a chain (100k) horse and we raced to test the speed. Obviously I was always faster at the start, as the horse takes a little while to accelerate. However, he was WAY faster than me with Spirit of Wolf or Scale of Wolf on. <br />
<br />
We raced in PoTranquility from the house with the PoK book to PoEarth entrance. I was using Spirit of Cheetah, and he was gaining on me all the time after the first couple of seconds and eventually we got to PoEarth almost exactly at the same time (he was 1 meter ahead of me).<br />
<br />
So chain horse must be &gt; 70% (faster than 115% if that is Cheetah speed really).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, that conflicts with what I've seen put out by all the sources, but I don't doubt your empirical data. And I seem to recall not being able to outrun my Chanter bud with his expensive horse, but I don't remember if I was using Scale of Wolf or Spirit of Cheetah, to be honest.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have experience to contribute?</div></div><hr />

This is confusing. Has anyone raced Spirit of Cheetah against Scale of Wolf? From reports, it sounds like they should be similar, although their descriptions don't read that way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cheetah is much faster than scale ... if it has decent duration and sane recast time Id use it while crossing zones all the time ... I used to mem it in freeport and it would just be ready in time for teh run across WK. I hated making that run as a lowbie :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd love to have it listed with the correct, user-reported speed, though. I guess I'll have to create a newbie with Run0, time a dash through EC, and then do the same run with Scale of Wolf and compare.<br />
<br />
This data now listed here (http://morelight.org/samanna/#movement), btw. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Run0: (29.8 coordinates/sec)<br />
<br />
Rope horse (9k): +7%<br />
Run1: +10%<br />
Run2: +20%<br />
Run3: +30%<br />
Spirit of the shrew: +30%<br />
Jboots: +35%<br />
Tboots: +35%<br />
Swift Journey 1: +40%<br />
Illusion Scaled Wolf: +45%<br />
Swift Journey 2: +50%<br />
Spirit of Wolf: +55%<br />
Wolf Form (selfonly): +55%<br />
Spirit of Eagle: +60%<br />
Share Wolf Form: +60%<br />
Greater Wolf Form (selfonly): +60%<br />
Form of the Great Wolf (selfonly): +60%<br />
Share Form of the Great Wolf: +62%<br />
Flight of Eagles: +65%<br />
Scale of wolf (breaks when hit): +70%<br />
Form of the Hunter(selfonly): +72%<br />
Chain horse (100k): +114%<br />
Spirit of cheetah (selfonly): +115%<br />
Paladin AA horse: +150%<br />
Bard speed (at runspeed cap, absolutely max in game): +156%<br />
<br />
I still miss from my list:<br />
Leather horse (30k)<br />
Silk horse (60k)<br />
Emperor/Seru horse<br />
<br />
Points worth noting:<br />
- Spirit of Shrew (indoor sow) is same speed as run3 and therefore worthless except for lowlevel chars without AAs.<br />
- The GoD AA &quot;Swift Journey 2&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Advanced Innate Runspeed 2&quot;) takes you almost to sow-speed.<br />
- Flight of Eagles is slightly faster than Spirit of Eagles.<br />
- 100k horse is Spirit of Cheetah speed which is between &quot;2 times sow&quot; and &quot;2 times soe&quot;.<br />
- Paladin AA horse is practically at runspeed cap (talk about overpowered Im NOT jealous)<br />
- Runspeed cap in game is 2.56 times as fast as Run0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Awesome, updating my webpage now - thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Most lists of horse speed numbers are garbage. The list Gorre posted is believable; I've measured the slowest horse at about 7% -- yes, slower than Run1. Not sure about that coordinates/sec number though.<br />
<br />
Is an SK horse as fast as Paladin's? I would guess it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Scale of wolf (breaks when hit)<br />
<br />
Could of swore this was breaks when you cast or breaks when you attack but NOT when hit.  Granted I dont use the spell except on a rare occation, stone me if i'm wrong =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Scale of wolf used to break when hit when it was first put in (Kunark-release spell I think).  They changed it after a while, now you're good as long as you do not cast or turn on attack.  Which makes it kinda suck, you can't invis yourself and have scale on at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shakurae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Should add these too.....<br />
<br />
Fabled Journeyman's Boots (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68239)<br />

Lucy says 50%<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Scale doesnt break unless you attack or cast, theres a clicky earring with scale on it thats decent for shaman since we get sow boots you can scale when running but still be sowed if you have to fight.</div></div><hr />

Drogmor: Giant Drum &amp; Horse: Chain Bridle = identical speed?<br />
I've been spending plat like crazy lately, was interested in hearing if anyone had verified equine versus reptile run speeds in a race or other test.  <br />
<br />
Anyone with a Giant drum care to comment on the high speed hopping?  Is it nauseating or bearable?  I've had the old glue factory rescue pony tan rope bridle for so long, the rope bridle is pretty frayed now. :p <br />
<br />
With the latest series of patches and all the targeting (even dismounted) problems I've been having, I'm wondering if switching to an ugly but fast Drogmar might be a good idea...<br />
<br />
Oh, and the Reference desk is looking awesome Samanna.  Two thumbs way up!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have a fast Drogmor and at high speeds the hopping motion isn't strong. I find it perfectly bearable, but others might not be as tolerant.</div></div><hr />

You are right. My group has been hunting Velks Labarath and we group at the pok book in GD..I buff and levitate and cast Scale on group and it is off to the races..Many times, a Tazmak or Feral Bear will hit me if we pass to close without the lose of Scale. If we stop to fight, then Scale will fade and a recast is necessary.Spell casting will also make it fade.</div></div><hr />
