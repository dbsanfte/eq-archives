<br />
1. Are the pets from Spiritcall 4 doing more dps then Spiritcall 3 yet?<br />
2. Has their HP been fixed yet?<br />
3.  Has their proc rate been fixed yet?</div></div><hr />

have fun playing with a useless AA, i had a GM roll back my account just so i didn't have it $</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">according to this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20641) I was under the impression that this AA had been addressed.  I do recall seeing elsewhere that someone had managed to allow the pets to tank some mobs and they did put out slightly more DPS than the previous incarnation.<br />
<br />
  They still do not contribute a meaningful DPS to GoD encounters and can't tank past Tier 2 PoP, but it is &quot;fixed&quot; from initial implementation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You are not going to see any other fix to this. <br />
It's fixed and working as intended as in the pets have about 2k HPs now and proc venom claw(3 procs on average for me so far).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm gonna stick with Spirit Call 3 until I got extra aa's and nothing to use them on. Got 477 aa's atm and will be awhile before I get SC4.</div></div><hr />
