I just finished my epic on Sunday Nov 24 2002 and upon handing in the Iksar Scale to the spirit and receiving the Spear of Fate, my Truespirit faction was then reset back to indifferent!<br />

* Killed Neh`Ashiir, looted his/her Diary.<br />
Spirit Sentinel looks upon you warmly<br />
* Handed in Neh`Ashiir's Diary to the spirit<br />
Your faction standing with Truespirit got better.<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
Spirit Sentinel regards you as an ally<br />
* Handed in Iksar Child's Tear to Lord Rak`Ashiir<br />
Your faction standing with Truespirit could not possibly get any better.<br />
You gain party experience!!<br />

Your faction standing with Truespirit got worse.<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
* Received Spear of Fate, but the spirit said nothing at all to me<br />
Spirit Sentinel regards you indifferently<br />
You say, what is lost'<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'You need to prove your dedication to our cause before I can discuss such matters with you.'<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, well. Anyone else completed recently and able to confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only thing that this really changes is that new shaman that get thier Spear of Fate can't MQ tears for anyone.  There's still a ton of Epic'd shaman on most servers, and this change doesn't look like it will stop anyone from cheating their way to max ally at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">cheating? :)<br />
<br />
its a OGC for eq now?<br />
<br />
or is it that you can actully do the quest over and over to get faction wich is not cheating? :)<br />
<br />
why waist alot of time doing the booring quest when its MQ able??<br />
<br />
get over it, this is not life. but hell of a fun game to play and I dont wanna spend hours and hours to get an item as the epic when paying cash for playing.<br />
<br />
btw no expansions will come now and theis is tha last year of EQ before EQ2 why dont ust have fun?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just wish they had kept the final message.<br />
<br />
I was kind of freaked when he took the scale and said nothing, then checked my inventory - spear was there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually the shaman epic is an enjoyable (and pretty easy) quest if ye ask me, I still have fond memories and much pride of the fun I had getting my spear, I don't think I could have any pride in simply running backwards and forwards between a couple of npcs for a few hours.  Each to there own I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This may have something to do with Epic 2.0 that is supposedly loose in the land.  I doubt they can retroactively give people who have completed the SoF a negative faction hit, so there is little point in doing this to &quot;hurt the new guy&quot;.  If everyones faction has indeed been reduced then it is time to start looking for the quest entries into a new SoF quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It gets reduced when you hand in the iksar scale and receive the spear. Shamans who already had their spear and have max Truespirit faction will keep their max faction.<br />
<br />
And like Harvyst said, the lore at the end is gone now too.</div></div><hr />

I thought that someone at a recent Fan Faire said something to the effect of &quot;there will be no &quot;Epic 2.0&quot; in EverQuest&quot;...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, I believe they said there wasn't one currently in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bah, this changes nothing.  It's just an additional timesink for shaman just getting their epics who still want to MQ the tear later on for their friends.<br />
<br />
So what, it resets you back to Indifferent.  Just go find Woe, Envy, and Marr's Promise again, and turn 'em into the Wandering Spirit in WK a few more times and PRESTO - max ally all over again.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  Yes.<br />
Rendered impossible?  No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah but it makes it less likely that I will do so for a friend.<br />
<br />
Our guild has 1 shaman who completed it pre-nerf, so she can keep the MQ tear. But if I were to get a second for a friend of mine who is not in a high guild, it would be a real PITA to get my faction up to MQ it for him. It's almost not worth it.<br />
<br />
Which is a pity, because I was hoping to snag him a tear. His guild, my old guild, is hopeless about raiding... let's put it this way. They wiped horribly on a reaver raid. And never went back to CoM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">maybe damm guilds could stop killing them for the fun of it and stop farming the tears for us ppl that dont log on a hr after the servers come back up or have the spawns timed on their calander</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hiho,<br />
<br />
you realise that the golems you ned to kill for the child to spawn can drop other stuff too? Even for other epics? Thats why guilds kill them when they are in Fear anyway. And most don't have any problem with an outside shammy who asks nicely to loot the tear.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Also, it means new epic shammies won't be able to help their SK buddies MQ certain items. I just MQ'd the decrepit hide for a SK friend since they weren't at the Hate raid when it dropped. I was glad to do it since it sounds like the hide is fairly rare. It sucks that other SK's may have to wait unnecessarily long to get their epic. If someone's done all the work but are waiting on some crazy rare drop, well, that's just painful. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Didn't wizards ask that their True Spirit faction not be trashed when they finished their epic and VI implemented this change for them? I don't know how the wizard epic works so I'm not sure if this was requested by them so they could help other wizards MQ their epics or not. I kind of remember one of the reasons being that wizards wanted to be able to help other classes MQ their epics.<br />

<br />
Wizard epic turnin was bugged, so that the second a wizard turned in their epic, their faction turned to scowl and they were attacked. Then everywhere they went that had a truespirit faction mob, they would be attacked. This was a bug, not a fix implemented to stop Wizards from MQing parts of their epic. They later fixed the issue by having a mob in Temple of Sol Ro that wizards could kill to reset their faction with Truespirit if they had gotten their epic during the bug.</div></div><hr />

Dead on, but you should also take that sparkling gem you get from the wandering spirit and give it to the Spirit Sentinel in central EJ -- it adds another huge helping of faction.<br />
<br />
I just did it. My faction is now back at max, where it will stay.<br />
<br />
I re-did the first part of the epic, then repeated the Woe+Envy+Marr step and the sparkling gem step until max. It only takes about 5 repeats of Woe+Envy+Marr and sparking gem hand-ins to reach max.  Really really easy, especially with Plane of Knowledge ports, just takes a little time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually, you may even want to bug this.  It might be unintentional and we are reading into it a tad.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Stilts Stonebender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Shadow Knights also trash their Truespirit faction doing their epic. I know that both High Scale Kirn and Lord Rak are both KOS to an epic SK that raids with us occasionlly. Lord Rak being KoS on a Druid Reaver hunt is a real PITA...<br />
<br />
We discovered this when Lord Rak popped and wiped our raid for a druid guildy going after the SK. He also proxcimity agro'd HSK in the Hole on a Shammy epic raid. So he spent a while FD'd while we cleared the rest of the area.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I know it really isn't a big deal except for RP reasons but when I get my epic and get all the work done it doesn't seem right to have my faction with True Spirit indifferent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ytsejam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">This kinda relates to the thread/topic I just started regarding doing the epic quest for a shaman who completed his epic, but is transferred to another server (so the epic is deleted).  Check it out.<br />
<br />
I want to do the epic quest again on the new server, BUT because he did the epic over a year ago on the old server, he is STILL ALLY to the true spirits.  In fact, when I did the first few steps, it said his true spirit faction cannot get any better.<br />
<br />
From what I have read above, this would mean that all I need to do is get another tear and do the turn-in at Rak, and I'd get the spear without doing the rest of the quest again.  Is this true?</div></div><hr />
