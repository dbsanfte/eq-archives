<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am seriously thinking of starting a pure melee, the openings are really nice on test, I tried them out and got my monk levelled to 30. (5 levels on top of the /testbuff) At lvl 30 their Dragonstrike does a 70dmg/tick dot for 4 ticks, which is really nice. Also Leg Sweep a 20 second root.<br />
<br />
I am mainly considering Rogue or Monk. Rogue have a really nice sneak attack, allows a sneak attack on a mob doing a crit on their main weapon backstab on first contact. Its definately more fun to play a pure melee now when these go live. I can't really imagine much complaining especially since they may have incorporated a lull for monks, and a Hate over Time ability for Warriors.</div></div><hr />

I'm having a lot of fun playing my rogue....the new ability &quot;Lunge&quot; is awesome imo....it appears to be a double attack coupled with a backstab from the front of an opponent.  Openings seem to happen at least once per mob so far in the week of testing I've done solo/grouped.</div></div><hr />

And finally whether they go in as they are now is another factor.<br />

5 openings in 50 mobs is good to me.  It's not like these meleers should be able to get 4 and 8 crits on every mob they face.  Meleers should pray for one opening per mob and have ahand on the taunt/stun/profanity button...</div></div><hr />

Would also account for a large discrepancy between my testbuff rogue and Furor's test warrior (somehow, I think Furor's test warrior has higher stats than my rogue :p heh)<br />

Umm....pure melee types that don't have high end types to group with to kill uber mobs to get the rare drops already pay through the nose for equipment.  That's the way it's been...casters pay for spells and melee pays for equipment.  If they make it so melee equipment is a rare as say, shaman spells, that'll really be screwing em.

I don't see anything here that gives warriors snap aggro on demand.  Everything is either dependant on an Opening, or a 30 second timer.  The only thing I see here is stuff to make warriors slightly less crippled without aggro procs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues are supposed to be THE damage dealing class because they really have NOTHING else to offer to a group, they cant solo and they more or less have no special abilities (example ranger does more dps with thier bows in many situations, can cast tons of different great utility spells and have tracking, etc).  Since rangers can buy tier 4 weapons in the bazaar, there is a large gap from when rogues can upgrade their weapons and close the gap.<br />

Ever visit the class boards for rogues?  Safehouse (http://pub146.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Bah casters have always had to buy expensive gear and spells, so whats the difference?<br />
<br />
My point is that expensive gear isn't really mandatory for casters, but it is for melee types (at least warriors...not too certain about the rest.)  Don't get me wrong, expensive gear will certainly help casters, but a butt naked caster can still be a relatively effective addition to a group, whereas a butt naked warrior is a huge detriment.<br />
<br />
So, if you make warrior abilities as rare/expensive as Shaman spells, you've now given warrior's 2 huge plat sinks whereas casters only have 1.  Of course, if the rare warrior abilities aren't critical to their effectiveness, then it's not unfair.</div></div><hr />

I think some of you might be surprised how much work it is to MA a mob - either in xp groups or raids.  It's not a matter of hit auto-attack and sit back.  You have to constantly monitor your position relative to the mob, the place you are fighting in, the healers, the position of the other melees relative to the mob, send instructions to people that are not doing something right (usually pet owners), watch to see if the mob is about to cast so you can slam/bash, watch for procs to know when to call for assists, watch your buff list to make sure you've still got slots open for HoT's (i.e., if they used your openings with dots or resist debuffs, etc.) and you didn't lose critical buffs, watch the mob and be ready to taunt immediately if you lose agro or a caster gets summoned, watch for rage, etc.  Time flies for me when I MA.<br />
<br />
In addition to my warrior I also play a shaman and a druid and I know from experience that being MA is a heck of a lot more work in most cases.  Granted, CC is a lot of work for casters (esp. classes like shaman that don't have mez), but unless your group is intentially pulling multiples, you don't have to worry about CC most of the time.<br />
<br />
That being said, yep...I've sent 12121212 (taunt, bash) messages  when I'm the MA  :p   I also like the sounds of the changes they are making, but I do worry about how demanding it will be on the MA.<br />
<br />
Now if I'm not MA...well, that's pretty easy.  All I do is watch my positioning, bash occasionally, make sure I don't get agro, and stay ready in case the MA drops.  (and, yes, I think being a warrior and not MA is simpler than being a caster)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you already have agro, pushing the taunt button is supposed to give you 1 agro point.<br />
<br />
I believe it works like this:<br />
if (tanktaunt+tauntincrement&gt;highesttaunt)<br />
   tanktaunt=highesttaunt+1;<br />
else tanktaunt=tanktaunt+tauntincrement;<br />
<br />
At least that's the way I've always known it to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I've also done the string of numbers in group.

The provoke line (Initial hate increase + Hate over time for 1 minute) Is not keyed to any opening for Warriors. Ryan Barker came to the Steel Warrior forums and gave the rundown on it here. <br />

Some of the rest of the abilities at the very least look like they will add a little fun for fun's sake...headbutting is teh win!<br />
<br />
I wouldn't know how to duel either, that definately is not any basis to make an assumption on someone's playing IQ unless they are on a PvP server. I know how to position a mob and work with a group/raid to maximize their abilities, my Warrior does not duel at all, that's not the game I play.<br />
<br />
You would have a Pally or an Sk in your group for their utility. Pally's group heal LoH rez root slay undead...Sks FD pull, snare tap. Warriors have never had any of that. Now they have better (Not as good as Knights) snap agro abilities. Barring a total clusterf**k implementation live This really sounds like it will close what had beciome a huge gap between Warriors and Knights in Exp group desireability.

O/T: If you're typing something and want to erase it instantaneously, you can use shift-down to blank it out then push enter.<br />

(shift-up scrolls up to your previously typed in text messages during that session, and shift-down scrolls down to the next typed messages-- once you get to the end, there will be no more messages, so you get a blank)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does have the potential to balance things nicely between the tanks if a warrior can hold agro reasonably well now. Groups will give Paladins a preference if there isn't a cleric in the group, SKs if you need FD pulling or Snare, Warriors if you're going after 'big game'. The rest of the time, it should come down to personal preference. <br />
<br />
All the paladin whining notwithstanding, even if warriors got the best taunt I don't see where it would matter. Unless they nerf SK/Pally taunts, those would still be good enough for any exp group and that's usually all that matters.</div></div><hr />
