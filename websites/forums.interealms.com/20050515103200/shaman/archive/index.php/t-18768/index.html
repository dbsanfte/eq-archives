<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's just frustrating.<br />
<br />
The guy had like 130 AA's but it's really rediculous.<br />
<br />
I could not land a single spell other than Malos.<br />
<br />
Having his pet up didnt help either.  It mowed through my True Spirit in no time.<br />
<br />
Pisses me off because a Shaman should be able to own a BeastLord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zyzygy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">whelp, shaman aren't very good duelers.  in fact, any caster w/o lure sucks at dueling if his opponent has any kind of decent resists.  really, -55 from malos, or -50 from tash is very insignificant is your opponent has 150-200 in the resists area.<br />
<br />
pvp isn't balanced.  don't sweat it.  any caster probably would have lost since they can't land spells on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im not sweatin it too much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And beastlord pets are broken in PvP.  They use the beastlord's resists, just like in PvE . . unlike every other pet caster in the game whose pet reverts to its own resist rate when its owner is in an arena or something.  That's highly annoying to have TWO melees on you that can't be affected by spells due to high resists.  PvP just isn't fair.  <br />
<br />
A bst without his pet would be a pushover for a well geared and thinking shaman.  But with the pet bugged as it is, it's damned hard to remove it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I killed a few bst in duels... the trick is to make sure they are in the same group as you, then fight dirty. *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well for those of us who PVP Beastlords all the time. may i suggest you Malos the Pet and then Blind it? Depending on his resists you could blind teh pet and send it on a fear run while you work on the Pets owner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cant land a spell on his pet or him.<br />

They usually are runing around while blind, when it wears off, i usually just kite their losery selves all over the place  :D</div></div><hr />

Dispell the bst to get rid of his ferocity (50 to all resists + atk).  Malos the pet and slow it.  Stand there and heal yourself while bst kills himself on your DS.  His melee damage is pretty unimpressive.<br />

<br />
And Ggrugnuk, your technique works fine at your level, but once you hit high end luclin and beyond people tend to have at least 200 in every resist once they are well geared (I can hit almost 400 mr without sacrificing much).</div></div><hr />

Gear doesn't save you from stupidity. An &quot;average&quot; Beastlord cures his pet and dispells your DS. He will dispell your Q as well, if he's remotely smart(If you are prepared, you can get around this sometimes though).</div></div><hr />

I wonder if Mal Decay then VP on the pet would be worth a shot? I know I can land VP on charmed tanks at the Fire Birds when I MD them first, usually. Keeps em off the clerics, even if they dont do much damage, they interupt.</div></div><hr />

I think this was the problem as well. Unless your Magelo is incorrect, you've still got (mostly) Velious era gear, which isn't that great anymore. You can get better HP gear from trash mobs in PoP zones or by doing LDoN adventures. Tae Ew is pretty cheap these days too. Buy some better gear and then try him again. The MD and VP tactic mentioned earlier might be something you could try to use to remove his pet from the fight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Gear doesn't save you from stupidity. An &quot;average&quot; Beastlord cures his pet and dispells your DS. He will dispell your Q as well, if he's remotely smart(If you are prepared, you can get around this sometimes though).<br />
<br />
First off, when I am about to duel someone, I put up about 7 crap buffs before I put up real buffs, and DS is always the last buff I give myself, because it is often the most important.  In addition to that, I carry 3 instaclicks in to duels.  Good luck dispelling my quiescence, let alone my DS.<br />
<br />
As for the curing, there is a way around that as well.  In my experience, pet classes' pet heals take the first disease buff away, so if you have, for instance, three debuffs with disease counters and turgur's is the third, it will take three casts to cure it.<br />
<br />
So, when I duel a beastlord, his pet's buff list looks something like this:<br />
<br />
1) Spirit Of Relic<br />
2) Whatever their haste buff is<br />
3) Malos<br />
4) Malicious Decay<br />
5) Pox of Bertoxx<br />
6) Turgur's Insects<br />
<br />
When he cures his pet, it will remove malicious decay, which I just reapply.  It goes back in to the 4th buff slot and will be the first debuff to be removed next time he cures, as well.  If I am unable to reapply right away and he gets a second cure in before I can refresh, it takes pox, which I also just reapply (rosrak's legs).<br />
<br />
If this isn't working for you, though, just blind the thing - he can't cure that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Jinheim is correct.<br />
<br />
Dispelling and buff/debuff order strategy makes a huge difference in duels, especially against well gear people. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to lie, a shaman is going to be hard pressed to kill anyone with 200-300 unbuffed resists, which is quite common place these days. However, neither should a similarly equipped shaman die to anyone barring a very few situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just use malos/blind against his pet.  It may take a while, but a smart beastlord can and will cure anything else.<br />
<br />
And I say a smart beastlord.  A *smart* beastlord won't let you land 3 disease-based spells, in order, on his pet.  He will be curing the DR debuff the moment it lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Virulent Paralysis is a very fun toy. Maximize Spirit call (Even in PVP) it's worth 3000 manaless damage as long as the person you're fighting cannot FD or kite, long cast though. A 100k horse will be needed to give you the 115% run speed that allowed us the kiting edge we used to have with SOW pre-Kunark. Even if he has the same horsetype, the pet will be left far behind and you both will have very slow stopping times, and the beastlord cannot interrupt you as much from his mount. I'd mention dispelling resist buffs but it really takes way too long, if you got the time, switch out a slot for it.<br />
<br />
Spell slots:<br />
1) Malicious Decay<br />
2) Insidious Malady (Further reduction on DR)<br />
3) Cloud of Grummus<br />
4) Breath of Ultor<br />
5) Malos<br />
6) Cannibalize 4 (You'll need it for all the bounced spells and cured diseases =p)<br />
7) Switch this one around for your favorite nuke / pet / heal<br />
8) Quiescence<br />
<br />
AAs:<br />
1) Virulent Paralysis (Maxed)<br />
2) Spirit Call (Maxed)<br />
3) Radiant Cure (Maxed)<br />
<br />
Potions:<br />
1) Resist potions (beast pet procs and beasts stole one of our most powerful nukes, every little bit helps.)<br />
2) 10 dose Shadowstep<br />
3) Damage Shield<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that you'll win. After all, you're a priest taking on 2 lawnmowers. I repeat. YOU ARE A PRIEST. Not a Shadowknight, not a wizard, a priest. A druid will get crushed in an arena, a cleric will CH until OOM, a necromancer.... well a necromancer will win, but that's besides the point.</div></div><hr />

As I said, if you are prepared you *can* avoid that. Even though even with 3 clickies, you won't be able to keep Q on you against me(or a Beastlord who is prepared).<br />

Beastlords get Abolish Disease. 1 cast of it takes away Pox, Malicious and Slow<br />
<br />

<br />
Blind works...IF the Beastlord has low MR anyway.</div></div><hr />

Explain to me how please, takes less than a second to click 3 clickies, how exactly will a BST dispell faster than that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">1) Stand by the opponent, put your pet on him and watch for a casting message. As soon as he starts casting, unload the Golem Metal Wand(It isn't instant anymore, but still useful). Once you are down to only 3 click buffs(Seeing as Jinheim starts with 7 crap buffs), you won't be able to reliably Q anymore.<br />
<br />
2) Learn to understand what clickies your opponent is using. Once you have figured it out, you can overwrite/block or reposition them with your own spells or clickies. There's till plenty of stacking issues in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Beastlords get Abolish Disease. 1 cast of it takes away Pox, Malicious and Slow<br />
Abolish only removes 1, the first in the buff order, no matter how many counters the first &quot;buff&quot; gives, and no matter how many counters the cure removes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are correct, Sir. I was thinking it was 4 x 9 instead of a straight 36. Just like disinfecting aura is 2 x 10. I stand corrected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I don't wanna turn this into yet another Beastlords are better shaman than shaman thread but you gotta remember that they are Half shaman, Half Monk, and half Mage =). I don't know how resist debuffs  work on the blue servers but on ours  they all get a 50% boost.  so with malos that like -75 here. <br />
I also notice in your Magelo that you have very few resists and even less HP. IF you can't resist the BL stun you are finshed.  you'll get interrupted before you can cast any spells. Like Heals, Q, Dispell..</div></div><hr />

I have to concur with the poison dots btw...I was dueling a 65 monk and 62 beast a bit back(double teaming bastards). Beast went down like nothing(vp -&gt; spiritcall), monk was bouncing most of my spells. I hit him with BoS and BoN, he bolted for the arena door(lake rathe arena) from the center platform..by the time he got there he had gone from 95% health to 2% health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that is a bit harsh.  shaman are planners and jacks of all trades (at least that is what i get to hear everyday here), we think with enough preparation and the right gear, and buffs, and spell line up, and pet kit, and AA's, and whatever else the game has to offer; we can do anything.<br />
<br />
just because that is not always the case, doesn't mean we won't continue to beat our heads against the wall trying to find the right combination that works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Go to the bazaar and gear up better. That gear was okay before PoP and when the level cap was 60, now you are missing an easy 1k worth of upgrades buyable in the bazaar for under 100k, none of it ornate. 1k more hitpoints will give you a huge jump up. If you are tight on money there are tons of stuff you can just farm on your own, check the equipment and hunting forums. That should give you a huge leg up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I will be dueling a 65 beastlord this weekend in our guild arena bash.  He has 180ish AAs, and I have 61.  He's also in better gear.. he's got almost full set of ornate and I'm only in 2 pieces of Ornate.  But I'm not counting myself out yet.<br />
<br />
I'm going for SC3 and VP1 by the time the event starts.  I plan on using these AAs on him quickly from the get-go.  When the bell rings, I'm going to sic dogdog on his warder.  I know dogdog won't last long but he's only a diversion.  Once dogdog has warder's attention, I'll Malicious decay and VP the beast himself.  Then I'll Torpor dogdog to delay the inevitable and then SC3 on the warder to further impede the warder.  Malo/Malosinia on the BL, then MD/Malo/Turgur's on the pet.  Slow the BST.  Hopefully by this time he's tried to nuke me or DoT me and I've resisted him.  Then I'll DoT him with the 65 DoT, Bane of Nife and E-Bolt and hope they land.  There's around 700/tick, and he's got 7 ticks to get it figured out.  He only has about 4000 hps buffed.  I know he has high CR but weak PR, so I'm not going to use Velium Strike; instead I'll use Spear of Torment to try to kill him quick.<br />
<br />
Somewhere in there, as I gauge the fight, I'll canni5 and Torpor myself.  I might even start the fight off Torpor'd, in case his pet gets on me.<br />
<br />
Of course I'll have my resist gear and buffs on.  He's gonna hafta kill me with his pet if he's gonna kill me, so I've got to manage his pet well.  I'm hoping it works.  I'm aiming to get his Paragon wasted early on.  It will be a tough fight but I think I can pull it off.</div></div><hr />

I know he has high CR but weak PR, so I'm not going to use Velium Strike; instead I'll use Spear of Torment to try to kill him quick.<br />
<br />
Somewhere in there, as I gauge the fight, I'll canni5 and Torpor myself.  I might even start the fight off Torpor'd, in case his pet gets on me.<br />
<br />
Of course I'll have my resist gear and buffs on.  He's gonna hafta kill me with his pet if he's gonna kill me, so I've got to manage his pet well.  I'm hoping it works.  I'm aiming to get his Paragon wasted early on.  It will be a tough fight but I think I can pull it off.</div></div><hr />

Put your back up against a wall and just melee him out.  Have some fakes up for the dispells, and keep regen, focus on.  Cast a few DS potions and Use Q when you need to heal.   I am a time geared Shaman though with a lot of time FT and click items.  I could probably fight a BL for days.  Against an equally equipped BL neither of us is going to get a spell to stick so dont bother.  Your Quiessence is so powerful compared to his heals though (shrug).  Oh, kill the pet first, then your golden.</div></div><hr />
