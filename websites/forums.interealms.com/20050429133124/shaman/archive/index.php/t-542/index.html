<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail and well met!<br />
<br />
I have been enjoying hunting Ulthorks, Walruses, and Woooly Rhinos on the Northern Shore in Eastern Wastes since lv. 39.  Dinged 41 pretty easy and halfway to 42.  I've seen folks lv. 42-44 hunting here, but the exp. must be slowing down (though at 41 and above this is a good place to work on melee skills).<br />
<br />
Anyhoots, I'm looking for some good stomping grounds to move to.  I do not need the &quot;best&quot; exp. or the &quot;best&quot; loot, but prefer a nice spot where loot and exp. both fairly balanced.   I love a steady stream of dark blues to pull.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of the following:<br />
<br />
1)  Pick a side in Velious, start hunting Giants and their wolves in GD.<br />
<br />
2)  Hmmm, I really do not know.<br />
<br />
I've been playing EQ for almost 2 years, but have 3 characters of almost the same level.  Not really familar with the +40 hunting grounds.  Any suggestions?<br />

P.S.  The Shaman is definitely the best to play, he's the main I'm taking +50 :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since you are right there why not try crystal caverns? If you can find a monk partner and manage to get geo camp, you can get great exp and loot.  There are a few places you can solo and you can camp named mobs such as the queen and some named stalag terrors also but the geos are your best bet.  Really is just a fun zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can actually solo pretty easily at the Ry'Gorr Orc Fort in Eastern Wastes. Just go invisible to get inside the compound and park your pet in one of the front corners. If you're careful, you can steadily pull single Centurions and Legionnaires. They drop Orc Fang Necklaces and Earrings. Look out for Elite Guards, as you're too low level to solo them. If some other folks show up, you can group up and pull things to outside the fort, getting loot like Ry'Gorr armor, Spine Chill Spears, and (if you're lucky), a Dark Ember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey, thanks for the suggestions.<br />
<br />
I've been speding a  lot of time in EW and have thought about venturing into CC.  <br />
<br />
I have to admit, I see so many people doing ring quests and triggering events in EW, I would be afraid to camp the Ry'Gorr camp for fear of getting trained.  I may try it sometime, but requires staying, very, very alert from what I can see.<br />
<br />
A guildmate suggested BW at lv. 45.  Anyone have any tips on that zone?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't suggest soloing in Burning Woods, as almost all the MOBs in the zone are wanderers and you will get adds. The best fixed camp in the zone is the Forest Giant Camp, but you need to be in a group to hunt there at your level. Level 51+ Kunark spells, Forest Loops, gems, and assorted stuff drop from the normal giants, Gorgul Paclock drops Treeweave, and Carpenter Grundo drops a staff for a Skyshrine quest (reportedly also Treeweave, though I've never seen that). Gullerback, who drops the Tattered Mantle, also wanders around the fort, and with a good group you can take him down. Basically, the loot in this zone is pretty good, but I've never though the experience was that great (outdoor zone, of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with House.<br />
<br />
What I suggest is to go to The Overthere and solo their for 2 levels and then go to the Mines of Nurga at 44 and do spiders, stay their till 47-49.<br />

Some decent guides are up, check the other posts below this one.</div></div><hr />
