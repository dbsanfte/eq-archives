<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im currently a 58 shammy with no epic or jbb, but I have a horse and a Fungi. Am at 920 ac and 2300 hps self buffed.<br />
<br />
Since hitting 58 I'm finding I exp in 2 distinct ways. When I have the time/am in the mood for it I group in pop. Uber Exp. Sometimes howerver, I only have 30 mins or so to play, sometimes only an hour. At these times and times I just want so peace and quiet I solo. I currently plug away in Katta and imagine I'll be soloing in fungi when I hit 60. I plan to stop and do lots 'o AA at 60 which leaves me the option to still solo non PoP at 60.<br />
<br />
So I have a whole bunch of questions relating to 2 handers and the use of.<br />
<br />
Since I dont have an epic, and I am ungilded atm, I'm kinda stuck at the Tear and final fight part. I've done the rest.<br />
<br />
At 58 when soloing I've switched from letting pet tank to more in your face tanking. I now regen mana alot faster with KM/Cani4. I used to cast a BoN on katta guards after alpha pet had agro and med till guard deaed. If I had Kei I'd also ice strike at 40% to do more damage but not get agro. Disease dots are a waste cause the fights go to fast.<br />
<br />
Now I still have too much mana. So I'm finding im Slowing, BoN, Ebolting, and of course, no way the Puppy can pull agro off me at that point. So I'm thinking its time for a nice 2 hander to add that extra Umph between spell casts. My assumtions are as follows:<br />
<br />
1) I want a damage weapon (doesnt matter if it has a high delay) because often times I'll be casting a dot or Cani4 ing and the extra delay doesnt matter. So ratio isnt a huge consideration (although nice!)<br />
<br />
2) I want a weapon that procs. Shaman pure melee damage is pretty crap and a proc, coupled with our dex stat boosters could add a bunch of damage.<br />
<br />
So my choices are:<br />
Tae Ew War Maul http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12276<br />
Hammer of Spiritcalling http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10400<br />
Dathor Great Hammer http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10201<br />
Goranga Hammer http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10201<br />
Tarnished Driveshaft http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16999<br />
A Sambata Hammer http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10575<br />
Barbarian Spiritist Hammer http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=554<br />
<br />
They are listed from best ratio to worst ratio.<br />
<br />
Some of them are cheap or I can camp solo, others are a pita to get.<br />
<br />
Questions I have:<br />
1) Does My argument make sense? I'm assuming even if I had an epic I probably would do more damage with a good 2hb cause the fights are so short. The epic does most of its damage at the end, and I might not see the end. By the time I slow, and stack BoN and Ebolt, the mob is either on its death run, or dead when the 2 dots wear off. Granted, the epic would be better in root/rot situations, or in situations where the mob had a ton of hps/high damage output where I'd be healing myself and needed manaless dmage, but what about this situation?<br />
<br />
2) Ill be giving up my Sarnak Battle Shield. This really isnt a problem is it?<br />
<br />
3) Do I go with pure ratio, or is something like the Barbarian Spiritist Hammer which has a suck ratio but a good proc worth it? I'm assuming with 200ish (might be higher if I find VoB) dex I'll only proc one time per fight. BSH is 22 damage. With a near maxed out strength I dont know how that calculates into damage on average for a shammy. I'll assume like 30 damage? so thats 300 damage from melee and another 250ish from the proc. 550 damage. Take soemthing liek the Tae Ew War Maul. Nice +hp and maybe 50 average damage. 10 swings is 500 damage and I dont have to worry about the proc. Or go with the Dathor brute and just pound stuff to a pulp?<br />
<br />
4) I currently have a FBS somewheres. Should I used that/SCHW for some extra haste, or does it really not even matter since I'm only swinging between casts and have to pretty much wait for the casts to finish?<br />
<br />
I'm basicly looking for Shamans that have gone through this, thier experiences, and what I might try. I'm no means rich (dirt poor actually) and dont want to waste money to find out its not worth it, or I shoulda went with proc over Damage, or Damage over proc.<br />
<br />
Thanks much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bufflo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You lose your mana regen on the horse if you have auto-attack on, so you want to keep that in mind before you buy/camp one of these. If you have the funds, a JBB could take the place of melee damage and you would still get the mana regen.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I not very knowledgeable about what makes the best weapon to use, so I won’t even try to advise you about that.  However, I do know of another weapon you might want to consider.  It’s the Staff of Living Sand: (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7428).  My druid has been using this since level 20.  And though you don’t have to worry about it, I believe it starts procing at level 22.  I have on for my shaman to practice his 2H blunt skill.  And best of all, its usually very cheap. I’ve seen them in the bazaar on Seventh Hammer for 300pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You really bring up an interesting point.<br />
<br />
Basically it boils down to this.  Without attacking the mob, you will regen on the horse.  Using a weapon to swing at a mob will negate that.  It can be a TON of fun to lay the smack down on a mob.  Is it effective? Probably not, but heck, the fun factor matters, right?<br />
<br />
Tae Ew is nice.  Good ratio, good hp stats.<br />
<br />
Spritcalling is SWEET, Ton of Damage (39) good ratio and a 75 point dot.  I get about 4 -5 procs per fight.<br />
<br />
The only other hammer worth considering is the BSH.  Nothing is sweeter then clicking your JBB, landing 263dd and then have your hammer hit for ~80 points and anout 263 proc.  On my first shaman I had one of those and LOVED it.  <br />
<br />
In terms of stats, ratio and proc, the HoS is probably your best choice though.   Now the question remains SCHOULD you go down that road at all is a different issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing to consider, why not get a REIF (12/19 81 dd proc) with haste item and celerity gives you some pretty awesome damage output without sacrificing your shield.<br />

<br />
Er. Doh. Ok. Quick aside question. I currently target incoming mobs when in a group by /assisting the puller so I can land a Maloxx on the mob as its incoming. This puts me in autoattack. I sometimes forget to stop attacking, thus losing regen. Whats the &quot;correct&quot; way to do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Coupla things:<br />
<br />
1) Had a staff of living sand in my 30's. Used it to train up 2hb. Was nice. but the damage was not &quot;impresive&quot;<br />
<br />
2) If I'm getting my butt whacked on, and am not in attack mode, do I still lose my regen?<br />
<br />
3) If I do NOT lose my regen, I'm still getting my butt whacked on because of the super agro 2 posion dots + slow generate. If a fight lasts 12 ticks, am I better to sit and regen during it getting whacked (12x25 = 300 mana ~ Ebolt) or whack away? Its quite possible the extra damage done with a 2hb wont make up for the 1k+ damage the ebolt does. I assume this would change with torpor cause with torpor I dont see myself meleeing at all... just cani/torpor/dot/dd ?<br />
<br />
The more I think about it, the more I think I shouldnt attack at all, and just regen and any extra mana gets dumped into, worst case scenario, ice strike. I'm thinking a 665 pt ice strike even at its crap ratio is gonna be better than anything I can put out melee (assuming I med during that time while i get whacked, save up the mana, then cast strike)<br />
<br />
Its a shame shammies cant melee worth a darn. Double attack would change alot :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">type /assist off<br />
<br />
thats turns off auto attack with assist, simple yet effective lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hammer of aggresion is great in droga, not tried it on blues really...<br />
<br />
still 17 20  is nice.   go for 1500   on AB<br />
<br />
No proc tho (</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, I'll just add that to my macro. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just type it and you won't autoattack on assist.  No need to macro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I actually really like my BSH.  Self buffed, my STR is only 140ish.  With offense at 200, and 2HB skill currently at 67 I've seen myself hit for 47.  Remember that base max damage is weapon damage rating *2.  You will go above that as your weapon skill increases.<br />
<br />
I do a lot of in the face melee right now, so what I usually do is switch to the REIF until Piercing is maxed out, then work on my 2HB with the BSH until I ding.  The DPS is significantly lower with the BSH, but I just love to see that 263HP proc land.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a side note...if you're wanting to dish out a bit more melee damage, equip an item with Improved Damage I when using the REIF.  That extra 15% on the proc adds up.</div></div><hr />
