55 Tribunal shaman of Veeshan.<br />
<br />
I havew been away from EQ for 2 months now. I am looking for a place to solo to about 61. I understand there is a big xp change thing when I finally Patch. But I was just curious of places to solo from 55 to about 61 or so. Just in case I can't find a group. <br />
<br />
Here is my magelo<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if time is limited or I dont feel like grouping I head for Nadox at the zone to Torigan Mines...standing in the tunnel entrance in front of the shrine I can reach six single-pull shrine bruisers that give good exp and 10-15pp coin and loot.  Generally they are respawning by the time I finish the sixth unless I have been real busy in guildchat and only get through four...I only wish mounts would work here, as I have gotten real use to not having to sit and med...<br />
<br />
<br />
by the way, have been to busy to update signature, yes I am 55</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No offense, you have some work to do on your magelo before you even think about soloing. If you need money, I'd sell the boots, you'd be much better off nicely equipped all around. Basically, I'd get rid of everything in top two rows, except for jbb, shissar gauntlets, and bracelt of sense (maybe). Look at the gear thread listing, it will give you a good idea of what possiblly to purchase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haha he has FT3 booties and a moonstone ring .. oh and a tan horsey ... your gear is on a very broad spectrum, dump the boots and get some good gear as well as a better ring =)  If your gonna twink might as well do it well and the 60-80k you get for the boots will buy you some nice stuff.</div></div><hr />
