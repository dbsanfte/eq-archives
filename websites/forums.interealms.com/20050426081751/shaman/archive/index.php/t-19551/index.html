<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With all this talk of soloing high level stuff I've gotten the itch to take on some old world encounters.<br />
What I want to know is, whats realistic?<br />
I hear people talk of doing Inno, Kunark dragons or Venril Sathir, so my question is, can someone come up with a list of older nameds that I could take on?<br />
I'm 65th and have Can5 and VP1 as well as Quiscensce.<br />
Are Kunark dragons realistic? I see Gorenair is a cleric, that just sounds like a nightmare to me.<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With the new GoD slows the kunark dragons will be soloable.  They are now if you, through some miracle, land a slow on them.  Inno is revamped so hes not soloable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahh I dont have a Magelo profile just yet. My gear isn't all that bad, I'm starting to get elemental/time gear, plus I have a couple pieces of the Incorporeal Spectral armor from the EF camp.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">5300hp with raid buffs?  Maybe I'm crazy but that doesn't seem like much.  I don't have any ornate, EP, time or ldon gear and I top out at around 5100hp buffed wit Virtue, Focus, Sta, Brells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe its not. I said I was &quot;Starting&quot; to get time/elemental gear. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">people solo kunark dragons now, without slow...get yourself some more hp/ac and get a lure procing weapon. ds potions wont hurt...go kite gore till she is oom and then get to work on her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd guess some Stinging Wort potions (instaclick heal) wouldn't be bad either.<br />
<br />
BTW I have 6200+ raid buffed and I'm pre-elemental.  We did spend a lot of time in VT, and I understand that a lot of guilds skip that now.  Never thought to try to solo Gore, but it sure is tempting now that I have thought about it.  If I can line up a rezzer I might try it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Curious as to why Gorenaire of all the kunark dragons? I'd just hate to see her CH at 30%! Kudos to you if you manage it - I'm sure a time equipped shaman with lots of AA (especially LR5) could but pre-EPs sounds tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah thats what I was thinking. Trak is tempting also, but getting down there could be a pain.<br />
Of all the Kunark dragons, Talendor would be my first choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Out of all the kunark dragons, Talendor would be the easiest solo for a shaman. He's almost straight-up melee and his dot is very easy to resist at 65. The only trouble comes from his fear, which seems to land on me with over 300mr.<br />
<br />
Trakanon would be the hardest solo kill as a shaman, for the simple banishment factor.<br />
<br />
Severillous would be somewhat difficult because he is resistant to pretty much all our spells.<br />
<br />
Gorenaire would be the second-easiest, even counting the fact that she's a cleric.<br />
<br />
If you are looking to solo a dragon with your current gear, you really need to get lucky with landing a slow. You can only cast on the dragons in melee range, which makes it harder, but it's doable.. just malo the dragon of your choice, kite it till you're at max casting range, quiesc yourself, and then tank while channelling slow. I, myself, have never been able to kill a kunark dragon solo, the best I've done was with a 65 war and 58 druid trioing Talendor.<br />
<br />
Note: With my current gear, I am at 5900hp raid buffed(pot9, symbol, fo7, bss, and max sta)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for the info there Einnod. I'll prob try dragging along a partner or two first then and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i suggest you get a lure procing weapon if you want to solo kunark dragons...otherwise you are relying on dogs+****ty shaman straight melee dps....i can usually never get spells to hit.  (i have never ever gotten slow to hit.)<br />
<br />
fun challenges with people similar to your gear would be dane, kael stuff, yeld, 1 group dragons are EASY.  1 group trak can be hard depending on the classes you have.  1 group ST is the /yawn but can get hairy at times.  1 group VP depending on how geared your group is and the classes there.<br />
<br />
nice little list einnod, i would add trak as unsoloable though....i really don't see it ever happeneing outside some sploit.</div></div><hr />

Druids solo lodi just by dcing that stupid little turtle near ew. that little thing has like 50kp</div></div><hr />

As for Lodi, I know hes a piece of cake, a 65 ranger buddy of mine took him down on his own.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gordonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Trak's a 32k mob right?<br />
<br />
6 SK's, with AA HT's... 7k each i hear they can get too.<br />
Thats 42k with the right timing.<br />
<br />
You get one guy to HT and eat banish - then 5 others to HT right after that... and bang - dead dragon.</div></div><hr />

errmm.I cap out at almost 5600 with raid buffs and I'm not elemental yet and no EF gear. make a magelo man!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are two problem that I see with soloing the VP named.  The first is moving around in there ... you generally have to clear from place to place and I don't think you could realistically make progress against the repop rate.<br />
<br />
The second is the order the dragons come in.  Could a shaman solo Xygoz, for example?  Maybe, although like all Kunark dragons, the real trick is landing slow.  Unfortunately, Xygoz is far from at the front of the zone, and the first dragon you have to face is quite possibly the most annoying.  Hoshkar's AE is just flat obnoxious, and few of us are going to have the DR to resist it.  For the Elemental+ people not familiar with VP, its the same AE on Balatador the Cursed (PoAir) or the big croc in Earth.  I've also never gotten a slow to land on him, and, even with 7k buffed hp, I just can't stand up to his DPS solo. =\<br />
<br />
Of course, there are folks out there with over 1k hp on me, plus the new slow, so YMMV.</div></div><hr />
