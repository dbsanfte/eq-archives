<br />
15kpp on Karana is HIGH, so high that I get cold shouldered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Koyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">JBB = 35,000k pp on Torvo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">50k-60k on TZ :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I paid 15k for mine. I see them selling in the bazaar for 30k.<br />
<br />
Worth every penny though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Paid 22k on Prexus a few weeks ago, had seen em in the bazaar for 17-21 before I actually had the PP for it.  Have since seen em at 24k and 30k.<br />
<br />
Worth every single PP and more.  Knowing what I know now, I would gladly pay 30k for it, funds allowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I see them in the bazaar from 20-30k usually on VZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Swifthart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">30 to 50k on Torv</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lariat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mine's was a wedding gift, /cheer bards. ;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">22k on BB about 3 months ago. price is holding steady.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">20k seems to be the norm on The Nameless.  I got lucky and snagged mine for 12k though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I thought the new spear off THO was changed to a click?<br />
<br />
Paid 20 for mine several months ago. But I still see some sold for 25k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got one the other day on Karana for a trade.<br />
<br />
I traded a hiero cloak for a JBB and a shadowy assassin sash.<br />
<br />
Got it from a guy named canabull.  Then loaded my necro and archlich popped and got a second for a friend.  I gave it to him tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zazam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Paid 17k on Tunare a couple of weeks ago, worth every rubel. Been a huge improvement to my soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimjakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The only reason they're still that high on Tallon is that one Panda Bazaar mule that has one priced at 60k.<br />
<br />
He's had the same JBB at 60k and the same Fungi at 90k for weeks, and folks coming into the bazaar for a price-check are seeing 'em and pricing thiers close to his... then marking 'em down a bit at a time.<br />
<br />
Actually not a bad way to do things if you have a second computer... hehh.  SoW potions still sell for close to 100p and Shrink &amp; IvU are still 200p sellers.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I see people offering 30-35k on Vazaelle.  I got mine for 20 + my regen plate, was worth the money to speed through 45-51, and still worth it.  I don't think I could sell mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Saw two for sale on Brell this week. One for 25k and one for 30k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">15k is low for Karana.  I paid 16k, usually you won't find them below 17.5k.  22-3k is not uncommon.<br />
<br />
Torpor goes for 70-75k too, and sells quickly at that price :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have notice an increase in price of late, mostly because it isn't camped near as much as it use to be. Everyone is in POP instead of Seb. I have watched the prices on Zeb go from what was standard at 15K to the now standard 30 K</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A month ago I paid 27Kpp and a Barbed Ringmail tunic for mine.  I was really sweating it because that plat took me about 6 months to scrounge up (my playtime is quite limited).  I was hoping it was worth it, after reading all the testimonials here on the Crucible.<br />
<br />
It is worth it.  I was skeptical for the first couple of weeks that I had it, because I had never been challenged by anything yet.  I'm a casual player, and a death in a tough place ruins my playtime for a week trying to do a CR.  Consequently, I have been quite cautious.<br />
<br />
This past weekend, I headed over to the Ocean of Tears to kill some Seafury Cyclopses.  I knew to avoid the Tainted/Corrupted Cyclops, but no one told me about Quag Maelstrom!  :D <br />
<br />
I pulled him with a slow, and ran back to my pet.  As soon as i got there, I tried to cast EBolt, and was stunned to realize that my mana bar was empty!  Mana Drained!  Got real nervous for a bit, but calmed down when I realized that he was already slowed, my pet was already chewing on him, and I had my JBB!  :D   He rolled over like a two dolla' ho!  <br />
<br />
Without my JBB, I'd have been on another annoying CR.  Togors would have worn off long before I could have meleed him down, even with my barb spiritists hammer.  Man, I sound like a bad infomercial testimonial!  :p <br />
<br />
If you have the opportunity, get one!  I followed the advice that I read here last year, which was to quit buying little upgrades and save my money for the JBB.  Now with the JBB, I can farm plat much more quickly than before.  Got 500pp from the seafurbies in 30 minutes last night!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Seem to be going for 30 to 35k on Torvo now.  Not sure why the price has increased so much.  Some joker was trying to sell one for 50k a week ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rarely, if ever, there is one for sale in the Bazaar at a 60k price tag.   Posting to the FV message board regarding buying one was met with only humourous replies. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>adayoner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Been chcking out prices as i try to save up for one.  About 25k on MT and been steady the past month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>zymral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">price on rallos 13-14k been steady for months</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Coralie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">East Common Market was offering better price<br />
me regret the time when EC was the market place<br />
<br />
bazaar tools is great but for me it s a fact with the bazaard tools<br />
price growth a lot on some item and decrease a lot on other<br />
item ( but crap )<br />
<br />
of course speculator ( they buy all low price item that may stop their high price strategy) and perma rooted mule have all their time for to sell high<br />
first rule dont buy too high specialy from a well know mule<br />
if they want empty their bag they must sell normal <br />
<br />
only chance to have a great trade or buy at bazaar is too be like speculator perma rooted here with high money in bank and buy fast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Barghast, I got mine for 30k on FV not a month ago even. They are out there. Be patient. Best place to get them is from a 60 plus shaman that doesnt use it. BTW, you see them for 50, and quite a few have been bought for 40 on firiona vie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">my bazaar mule doesn't buy low and sell high... he buys low and sells normal.  <br />
<br />
I always check the prices in bazaar and go with about 90% of that price unless it seems like the person is on crack.<br />
<br />
case in point i saw an imperial wardog collar for 1k and another for 10k.  I bought the 1k one and offered it up for 6.<br />
<br />
selling high might make you a nice lump but it takes longer.</div></div><hr />
