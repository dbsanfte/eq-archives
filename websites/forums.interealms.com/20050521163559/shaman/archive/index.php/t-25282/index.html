<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all. <br />
<br />
I tried to Solo Ridgerunner Droongar. I ate my death when i had him to 20% health. I am looking for some help with strats on how to kill him. Magelo is attched &amp; everything is update except i have gained level one of Ancestral Aid.<br />
<br />
I had Voq &amp; Virtue<br />
<br />
What i did.<br />
<br />
I pulled with MC &amp; then i cast VP3. I then Malos &amp; slowed. During this time my pet died( no pet hold).I then memmed my dots.. Dropped both of my disease dots(boU &amp; OOw one). then i cast Q on myself. then i cast bane &amp; anathena. I was then summoned. I backed off &amp; cast BoS. but i was interuped twice with summons. I then clicked on my epic &amp; my AA Hot. ( i had Diaku up so it did not land.). I kept getting summoned which interupted my casting so i jsut stood in front of the mob...I tried to keep Q on myself &amp; blast healed myself a couple of times. I went OOM &amp; that is when i died.<br />
<br />
My big question is? should i continue to back up off of mob untill i get sommoned or just stand in front of him so i get less interupts...Is there anything else I can do. I realy want to farm this guy Solo<br />
<br />
I eventually killed him with a bard friend &amp; he dropped<br />

thanks for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Position dog with /guard. If he zooms into melee before you want him to, a /back off will get him out of melee range quicker.<br />
<br />
Mem all debuffs in an initial spellset. Load a second spellset with all your dots. Cast them all as fast as possible. Hopefully you'll have enough time to get a Q on yourself before summoned. <br />
<br />
DS potion. Were you meleeing &amp; getting riposted heavily? Stop meleeing &amp; just use slam when it pops. Try melee &amp; see if Droon ripostes if you haven't.<br />
<br />
Between flubbing the epic HoT, loosing dogdog dps (mage toys!) &amp; time lost due to interrupts, it sounds like you might be able to do this solo. Maybe whip up  stack of Stinging Worts &amp; have them inventory keyed to provide yourself with a little extra margin.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to time melee attacks for spellcasting. Try to get a BoD/BoR if you're not casting fast enough due to insufficient aa's/focus. Tinker with tribute too. <br />
<br />
20% is dang close... that's a good sign.<br />
<br />
<br />
* just noticed you had QB1 &amp; 8 banked aa's. Get QB2. Fast quiessence will do you very well in all situations</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the help...gonna drink a DS potion &amp; get spell haste from a cleric &amp; a set of pet toys for dog dog. I no longer have 8 AA`s banked,  bought rez &amp; Ancestral Aid.<br />
<br />
Should I just stand in his face or should I keep backing away after being summoned. Probably should cast Cripple too, i did not do that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can usually do Droongar with around 40 mana left and full HP.<br />
<br />
Mali decay to pull, hit him with VP. Summon mount and debuff/slow him, get mana back to FM. Once FM hit him with epic clicky, BoWunshi, Blood of Yoppa (in that order) then attempt to HoT yourself before he summons. Make sure you have tribunal and magic resists up to help stop the DoT and snare sticking. <br />
<br />
Everytime he summon get out of range, keep perma HoT on yourself and keep reapplying DoTs. On 25% hit him with a spiritcall and keep DoTs refreshed and he'll die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I do all the debuffing...cast a few dots...hit myself with BoT (and keep it on)...then pop channeling...goes down easy. I never bothered to keep root on him, just chain dotting/healing as necessary. Now that I think of it, keeping him rooted and backing off in between summons would prob be nice help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">really most of the fights depends entirely on your equipment and such, especially on something that summons.  <br />
<br />
for this fight I suggest that you pull him from as far away as you can with MD or malos.  When I pull named, I liked to use MD and then vp when i can, using my max extended focus to enable me to have an extra split second to debuff or whatnot.  After MD hit VP when you can.  Then I do all the rest of debuffs.. using malos and slow and putrid decay if I feel like it.  Then, I start doting him.  I would suggest using at least one disease dot.. your best one or maybe even two of them.  He won't normally summon until say 96 - 97% so you can get a tick or two off on him before he will summon.  Depending on how many you use, use your best magic dot after that.<br />
<br />
Me, personally I usually always use four dots, sisslak, bane, yoppa and blood.  This will drain the mana just a bit, but it will also killhim quicker.  The hardest problem that you will have is he will summon every 4 seconds, so there is no way that you will have time to back away from him and then get a dot off in time.  Therefore, your only form of dps is to let him attack you.  I would stick your best HoT on you first, making sure that you always have it up, and then apply your dots.  If they run out before you can refresh them, start with your best ones again first no matter what.  Even if you still have one of them on him and by the time that you finish casting another one, that other will run out use the best one.  It's more important that it's always on tthe mob, instead of keeping up the weaker ones and leaving the best ones out of the fight.<br />
<br />
use spirit pets early.  Fight will be shorter if you do.  <br />
<br />
for me it's a lot about gear.  I solo RCoD named, but I don't take them for granted.  Haven't really had a problem yet doing any of the NC named, but like I said.. it's mostly about gear and AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AA Hot<br />
<br />
??  which expansion is this from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AA Hot<br />
<br />
??  which expansion is this from?<br />
<br />
It is from Omens of War, 5 AA per rank, 3 ranks (level required for the 1st rank 66 or 67 I think). And not only is it a HoT, it is a group HoT (with a stat boost over cap on a couple of stats).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for all your help. I was able to Solo this guy this weekend. It was tough but I did it. I used the root back up. The whole trick is timing the summon.I waited until i was summoned then i backed up &amp; started casting. If I was in mid cast when i was summoned i did not have time to back up &amp; wait on refresh to get my spell off. Pet with Mage weaps, Virtue &amp; Voq helped me a lot. Was at like 50% hp`s &amp; 15% mana once he died. Well worth the risk. Without AA Hot &amp; Epic Hot i would not be able to do it. He dropped a rune &amp; the Rogue only shoulders that sold for 50k</div></div><hr />
