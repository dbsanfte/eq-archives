<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Edarb Everbuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been getting decent xp in groups in the planes but I would really like to find a nice spot to solo at 57.  I tried Chardock ZI and had trouble with adds.  I have tried Seb ZI and get ruled by wizzys.  I would like to know if any of you have discovered a nice spot to solo around 57.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kill the Luggolds and such in gunthak that are just outside of the Crypt of Nadox zone in (looks kind of like a throne room).  They are quite easy and with KEI I did not stop much.  With Stoicism should be even easier.  Plus they drop weapons you can save for yer puppy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lately (57 Now) I've been soloing PoJ zone out. I have a horse and JBB, no epic yet. Here is what I do. Will be referring to this map (http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/pojustice2.gif). Only the yellow section as I will be referring to these numbers.<br />
<br />
Buff up and equip an alpha pet. Park him in either corner by the zone out room ( I typically use the one to the left, so people can train right if they need to ). If you go out into the hallway there are bunches of rooms with npcs in them. <br />
<br />
When looking at the map above, its the first hallway from zone out room, there are 4 rooms connected to that hallway. <br />
<br />
On the furthest one to the left [room #16] a gnome magician, she nukes for max 275 (to me at least) and can malaise, but isn't that strong in melee.<br />
<br />
The one to the right of that is an iksar monk [room #15], he doubles for 197 max and has a crapload of hp - he's also got high FR and medium MR - He will be the biggest concern of the 4 rooms, as he will assist any of the other ones - PULL HIM FIRST!. <br />
<br />
Next to him [room #14] is a barbarian chick, she is a warrior, decent hp but a little weak in melee. <br />
<br />
Next to her [room #13] is a centaur, he's a warrior too, hits a little harder than the barbarian but has less hp also.<br />
<br />
There are also wandering rats and sentrys in the hallway, I either wait for them to pass or pull them (Only if I've already killed the iksar monk). I usually get no adds. Oh, all the mobs seem to run at 20% health, so be prepared to root or snare if you can.<br />
<br />
For all the mobs I pull with slow (malo__ not needed) and run off to pet and wait for mob to arrive (casters take some time and try nuking you through the walls - keep pet in corner) when it gets to me, root it (mobs there get pissed off easy) and cripple (seems mobs go down a lot faster), thrown on a Bane and let pet eat them up. Canni and JBB as I see fit and its not too tough. I've been getting 12% an hour and 15 mins here soloing - there is rarely loot (got a blue diamond from a  sentry once) but the xp is fairly decent for the amount of effort it takes.<br />
<br />
Now for me personally, I can clear the 4 rooms, the 3 rats, and the 2-3 sentrys that roam in the hallway, and still have mana left for more... if you find yourself in this position there are a few more rooms you can pull.<br />
<br />
From the hallway you're pulling from go around either side and you can safely pull the next 2 rooms on either side.<br />
<br />
From the left of the zone out there is a barbarian female warrior[room #1] in the first room, and a red drake - wizard in the one to her left [room #2].<br />
<br />
From the right of the zone out there is a dark elf shadowknight [room #12] and in the room next to him there is an aviak druid[room #11].<br />
<br />
For these mobs I just pull them like the rest, they aren't very tough, just gotta get used to them :)<br />
<br />
Well I hope this helps U guys level up! Its working for me I just hope people on Ayonae Ro don't try to take my spot now!!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great post on PoJ, Krakur- that's faster xp than I'm earning and I use a 58 dot, er, monk to FD PL.  I'm on A Ro and I usually play early mornings EST so hopefully we don't conflict. :)  If so I'll go check out the other planes, just hope gimp sheal can keep up especially w/ a gimp monk tanking.<br />
