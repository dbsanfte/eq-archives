<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At an upcoming guild meeting, I've been paired up to duel a 44 necro.  I'm at lvl 45 now, and will not have time to get new spells at 49. <br />
<br />
I've always played on a blubie server and have ZERO PvP experience.  Any tips for dueling in general, and for dueling necros specifically?  <br />
<br />
I suppose its a pride thing, but I really don't want to lose...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what does your gear look like? i would imagine go for magic and poison resists, necro's got pretty low HP so i would imagine if you blast a few times that would all but kill them, dots prolly wouldnt work considering they can leach it right back, it all depends on the type of duel also are you going to have pets summoned and a buff period, or once youa re full mana are you jsut gonna say GO!. My advice: Reisist gear and nuke, root the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">get your MR near 100 atleast.  <br />
throw up 3 crap buffs first.<br />
throw on talisman stamina and resists last.<br />
<br />
<br />
if he's using a pet (most good duelin necros don't) root it and forget it till root breaks.<br />
<br />
keep your mana for heals and roots.  Use 1 YES ONE dot.  Disease dot.  DR usually sucks.  When it fades apply again.<br />
<br />
The only time i got beat by a shaman in a duel was when he kept all his mana for heals and beat me down in melee.<br />
<br />
Your DD's won't eat through his damage absorption shield but dots sneak under it and eat from the inside.<br />
<br />
Keep him near, beat on him as much as possible and slam him when he's casting if you're the race to do it.<br />
<br />
a smart necro will have his damage absorption sheild memmed to negate your nukes and it's a pain in the butt.<br />
<br />
shaman/necro duels are long.  Be patient.</div></div><hr />
