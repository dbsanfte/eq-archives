<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ughlei Duukling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I just hit 50th I'm looking forward to 51 and the new spells<br />
My most recent upgrades were the two Bracers of Hammerfal, Shield of the Packslayer, Jasper Kundan Earring, Owlbear Claw Earring, and my Flayed Turmoilskin Belt, I haven't Started Kael raids as my Necromancer is almost done there so I take him to every one for now. I went for the Bracer's for the 10sta and 50hp's the 6 wis is nice and overall it's better than Totemic which I was wearing just for the AC. The Shield it slightly better than a Kunzar cloak which I had before and the Earring's are a nice upgrade from the forest loops I was wearing. I'm up to Kindly with the Dragons now from Exp hunting Giants and I got a boatload of post 50th spells from helping guildmate's on ragefire vigil in SF. What I'm looking to replace (besides the jaundiced which will be replaced by quest gear) is the off slot item's ie Earrings, Face, Neck, Shoulders, Rings, Back and Belt. I see alot of item's you guys have on your profile's but I can't find out where they come from. Well anyways here is what I got so far<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have a fungi tunic, JB pants and a fungi staff, but you have no JBB?  I'd think about getting one of those.   <br />
<br />
I'd also start using a weapon and shield combo over the 2hb.  Can you not swap in fungi staff to cast the effect?   Sarnak Battleshields are nice and pretty cheap now and there's that quest shield in Luclin now... bone bracer buckler, I think.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you have a decent amount of money, but you failed to tell us how much you have to spend or if you were wanting to hunt for your upgrades or what.<br />
<br />
You might want to try checking allakhazam's or another spoiler site.  Just do a search by race/class and specify the ranking criteria for the item.   For me, good equipment has good hp and ac, with wisdom coming far behind.   Or you can do a search for other equipment threads here.<br />
<br />
here's my quick suggestions - rings:shadel bandit ring and 6ac/65hp.  Face:Crystal Spider Eyes or Enshrouded Veil. <br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say you're doing pretty well!  I agree with Hen that the JBB is your next big upgrade- it will increase your power more than anything else at this stage.  You could probably get one (with cash left over) by trading away the JB greaves, if you needed to.  The greaves are nice (I dream of them myself) but won't provide nearly the power the bracer will.<br />
<br />
I'll take a quick crack at upgrades by price:<br />
<br />
I'd upgrade the shoulders to a Tattered mantle (ac 12, +20 hp, +10 vs disease) - couple hundred plat tops, dropped in Burning Woods.  If you get lucky, you might find someone selling one of the lesser dragon mantles (11 ac, +25 hp, +25 mana) for cheap<br />
<br />
Clay guardian shield (ac 25, +50 hp) - these can often be found for a couple hundred pp, and are a great bargain for the money.  25 ac + 50 hp = good !!<br />
<br />
Goranga idol (ac 8, +25 hp, +3 sta, +4 dex, 500 pp?) - nice range slot alternative that provides AC and HP.  I use it instead of the harpoon when soloing.<br />
<br />
AC 6 / 65 HP rings (400-500 pp each) - outstanding value for the money.<br />
<br />
Those are the cheapie upgrades... next ones are gonna be more pricey:<br />
<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield (ac 25, +40 hp, +10 fire/cold/magic, +5 sta, +5 str) - around 2-3k- nice upgrade to the clay guardian shield... similar ac/hp, and resists.<br />
<br />
Ancient seahorse hide cloak (ac 20, +25 hp) - around 3-5k on Karana.<br />
<br />
Crystal chitin gauntlets (ac 20, +10 str, +35 mana) - again, around 3-5k... very nice step up from the JB gloves.<br />
<br />
Shadel bandit ring (ac 6, +55 hp, +55 mana, +10 vs disease, +5 vs cold) - prices vary widely.  I've yet to have anyone offer to sell me one for under 3k, though.<br />
<br />
From here, it just gets more expensive...<br />
<br />
The Bracer - 10-15k- this will make a HUGE difference<br />
<br />
Bracer of sense (ac 12, +15 wis, +6 to all saves) - currently around 10k on Karana, but prices are falling.<br />
<br />
Bone Braced Buckler (ac 25, +10 wis, +55 hp, +55 mana, +10 str) - 10-15k<br />
<br />
Mask of War (ac 9, +9 wis, +5 sta, +2 str, right-click Yaulp 2) - 10-15k<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ughlei Duukling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really don't solo so I never bothered with a JBB I'll get one later though to have it. I mostly do guild based hunting groups 99.9% of the time or I duo or trio with some close friends. I guess I'll toss some rubies Lyguna's way and see if I can upgrade an Earring now. I think my shoulders are my next most important slot as they are really low AC. Maybe I'll sell my Legs now and do the Kromif Military Leggings quest and use those till I can replace with Thurg legs. It's hard to figure out what to do I'm so close to starting decent raids. I don't want to blow the pp on something I'll replace to fast. The Tunic and Staff will be with me forever so these were a no brainer. Also I do change out the Staff all the time I got my piercing in the 170's two hand blunt in the 170's and one hand blunt in the 140's now. <br />
