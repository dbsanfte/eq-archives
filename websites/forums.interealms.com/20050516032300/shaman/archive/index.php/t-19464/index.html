Doesn't say it's a Shaman spell but is it possible it could be once it goes live? Big change from the carbon copy of FA it originally was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a cleric ability currently :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How can you tell that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If that goes to clerics in it's new form, I'll be VERY upset.  The changes have me drooling like an Avatar spell should.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Says its single target not self. I am however betting that it will be made self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Duration 1 tick to 5 ticks though.  Sounds more like a super yaulp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Duration is kinda short.. but why isnt this a shaman ability?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, so it's still a cleric AA on Beta.<br />
<br />
Seems like they're taking our best buff ideas and channeling them to the wrong people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My warrior loves his little toothpick that procs Guard II, sure would be nice if we got one of those damage mitigation buffs. Our stepchild class has one.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if this will stay an AA ability due to it having a mana cost of 350.<br />
<br />
30 sec duration with 1 minute recast time.<br />
<br />
This is the kind of stuff shaman should be getting, our avatar should be along those lines to justify it's stupidly short duration. But who knows, at this point I wouldn't be surpirsed if clerics got this...<br />

<br />
Very disapointing.<br />
<br />
Yea, let me just rush right out and buy GoD. Not. Seriously. Its coming out in 2 weeks or something now right?  Is there a reason for a shaman to buy this thing? I dont see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sure there is, they added two more dogs to Spirit Call.  :P  <br />
<br />
Yes, this is BS, even more BS is the change to Bestial Alignment, seems like they are getting a Super Yaulp along the lines of Divine Avatar, but theirs is marked self only.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4523&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
1:  Illusion: Black Wolf <br />
3:  Increase Damage Modifier by 100% <br />
4:  Increase Chance to Resist Spell by 20% <br />
<br />
Kind of confusing since it says mana cost is 600 mana, but duration is 30 sec.  If it is a spell vs. aa it may be very situational.  They may be making both Divine Avatar and Bestial Alignment spells instead of aa's?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Krakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Kinda funny how the effects of those two spells were basically what we wanted to fix our buffs.

You right 30 second druation 1 min recast is so much better then what we already have at SIX MIN BASE 1 min recast. (shakes head in wonderment)<br />
<br />
Its been known for some time that clr's are getting this skill. /alt act 259. What gets me the most is the people that say this should be a shm ability just becuse it has the word avatar in it. Frankly I am gald that clr's are getting it and not us. One of the last things I would want would be another avatar. Unless it had a very long duration like say 1 hour with AA's +focus effects. Why in the world people would want and cry about not getting an AA ability that is actuly WORSE then the spell it is based off of. I have no clue. Look at it this way...<br />
<br />
30 second duration 1 minit recast<br />
VS<br />
6 min duration 1 minit recast (no AA's or focus effects)<br />
11+ min duration 1 min recast (with the best focus effect and SCRM)</div></div><hr />

Activate Avatar to temporarily give the Mountain King 5 bonus armor, 500 bonus hit points, 20 bonus damage and spell immunity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks Used Car. I dont know if you were contradicting me but I still see similarities :P Although I got mixed up, Divine Avatar decreses size, Avatar on WC3 does increase the dwarf size. 5 Bonus Armor -&gt; Melee Mitigation and 20 bonus damage -&gt; Damage Modifier by 100%. Similar improvements, WC3 uses numbers instead of %'s :)</div></div><hr />

I only mentioned the duration and recast to make a point that it's probably a spell, not aa.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, my reference to what we should be getting was the effects that it had, afterall I said that would justify our stupidly short durations on avatar.<br />
<br />
Guess I should be more obvious in what I am saying...<br />

You know, i hate bitching and moaning, ive been there done that. But even i have to step back at this point and go W-T-F is going on around here. I know we are a pretty good class, we are self sufficent for the most part and we get groups easy and we can solo well enough to go have some fun, but this is getting silly.<br />
<br />
The lack of attention this class is getting is rediculus. I dont expect alot from SoE, but there is no reason for them to not look at this class and not realize SOMETHING needs to be fixed. <br />
<br />
Ok, they dont want us healing as good as druids and clerics (cough *pallies*), then upgrade our stat buffs. We are supposed to be the king ofr stat buffs, but they are null at level 65, if nothing else they just top off the glass on even the weaker tanks. I dont see whats so hard as adding modifiers to a new avatar that jumps the attack and is given say, a &quot;hit for max damage&quot; modifier. Or like strike through modifier, there is so many ways they can fix us, but they dont. <br />
<br />
We have tried bitching and moaning like the druids, cause hey, it worked for them, they made noise and SoE listen. We did that and we got ignored and told that we need to make 1 thread with no flames and good points. Well we did that and still not a ounce of feedback and the only thing we get from it is another class getting what we wanted that would fix us without breaking anything.<br />
<br />
I tell ya, I hate complaning and bitching about this class, but frankly i think we are actualy at a point where we dont just want things, but that we are justified in out protests.</div></div><hr />

The extra damage a melee could do with this in the short time of 30 seconds (more with AA + focus effects) is much greater then avatar does. Imagine you casting this when someone is discing? Huge DPS. <br />
<br />
Who cares if its something you baby sit?  This is far superior to avatar.</div></div><hr />

I understand totally, its hard to look at a well played shaman and say we're weak.  We have a nice selection of skills and a good player can make a great deal out of it.  We are, however, becoming obsolete.<br />
This is exactly how the whole warrior -vs- knights thing was.  First, warriors wanted upgrades and improvements, but after much ignoring, it ended up being just bitterness and calls for nerfs of others.<br />
On the bright side, they did finally take a look at melee improvements, now all we have to do is wait.  Took about a year for war/mnk/rog improvments, so wer'e due in 2005.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and i spoke to a cleric who said wft i want this for? sure i`ll mellee while the  tank dies right?<br />
<br />
although they find mellee fun when can they dont want(general) to be better than us or anyone esle or spend aa on these:) <br />
<br />
ps why do all priest not have offensive and defensive shield ablilities? where about the only class that use a shield all the time?  ahh doh! SoE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Well, maybe not all classes, i mean i cant see a enchanter getting offensive AA. The cleric i can see getting it. They are in the thick of it battling and getting hit ( roleplaying here ). They wade into battle to protect their fellow adventures and have the right weapons line up to do so not to mention they are a plate class.<br />
<br />
But comes on now. You going to tell me that a HUGE ogre tribal shaman or a barbarian isnt going to do this? Can you see a massive troll from a place like grobb not beating down people with his shield and spear with glee? Or a cat shaman clawing its way through the mess of beasts to heal and protect its brothers.<br />
<br />
Frogs dont count. Sorry.<br />
<br />
Ill never understand it. From the start we were always known as the battle priests. The ones that had the freedom to melee things if we arent the main healer. I would never expect or desire another DoT again if they would just give us a trainable bash and some decent melee skills. I mean how unbalnced would it be to give us say ... Double attack ( one arm mind you ) and move us into say, the ranger hit table.<br />
<br />
There it is. Im a happy shaman. I dont feel like your catering to the clerics. No reason to complain about melee no more.</div></div><hr />
