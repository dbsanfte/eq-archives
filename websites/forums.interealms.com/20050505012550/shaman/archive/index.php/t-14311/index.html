<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some of you may be familar with the pretty nice exp bonus to the old world zone 'The Hole'.  I believe it is a 20% bonus if I remember right or perhaps even 25%?<br />
<br />
Anyway,  yesterday, I traveled within 'The Hole' for a little bit until right before the castle entrance where there were some mobs which were Now, blue (some light blue) to a level 65, due to the recent change in exp.<br />
<br />
I was supprised to how little the max damage was that the mobs were hitting me for.  I guess perhaps, I should not have been so suprised.  After all this was an old world zone.<br />
<br />
I found it relaxing to kill these mobs.  It wasn't all that bad AA exp either.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, those looking for some exp with only some casual game time.  Personally, I don't always like to solo PoP mobs that hit for often  the very least of 280+ damage ... I tend to worry if I will live if I go LD with my bad IP connection.</div></div><hr />
