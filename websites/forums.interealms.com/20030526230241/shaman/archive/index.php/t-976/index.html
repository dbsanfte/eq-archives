<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zulan Spiritshifter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a very interesting idea to me.  After hearing it thrown around several times, I wanted to ask once and for all who actually does this?  Lvl 33, I pretty much have been soloing Tizmaks for the past few weeks now.  I open w/ Malosi, run a bit and hit em w/ T's Insects just as they approach me and drop an EB and a nuke or two in while I melee them to death.  Seems to work just fine.  If what I'm hearing is correct though, I should be able to drop an EB and TB on them at the same time? I had no idea you could stack 2 of the same resistance based spells.  Not that TB will give me any more of a marginal edge during the fight that the Nuke will, but it's just interesting to hear that one can actually do this.  <br />
<br />
Right now, I believe it would be a waste to drop a TB which should only do about 65 or so dmg, vs the Nuke that'll do about 145 or so (which hasn't been resisted yet since I generally open w/ Malosi).  But I can imagine the benefit something like this will produce once I get scourge.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps some of you can give me some insight as to which dots you were stacking at lvl 34 to overwhelm your enemy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All Shaman DOT's Stack but not the same spell.<br />
<br />
For example, EB and TB both stack as well as Affliction and Scourge but you can not cast EB twice and have it stacked, it will just overwrite it.<br />
<br />
At your level I was using EB and TB, I would nuke only for emergencies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes all shaman dots stack. I frequently use both bane of nife and ebolt on mobs when soloing. Sure drops the mobs pretty fast that way =)<br />
<br />
You can't have multiple people cast the same dot or cast the same one multiple times but as long as it's a different spell it will stack.</div></div><hr />
