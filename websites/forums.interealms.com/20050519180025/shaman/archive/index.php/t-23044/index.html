<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else notice that the Shaman Mystic in EQ2 is the only totally worthless class with no reason to group with unless you could find no healer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's what I like to see.. consistency ;) But have they actually released enough gameplay information to determine that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No they have not released enough information.. and I think the Heals that shaman will be getting the best versions of will be the most valuable. Each priest gets all 3 types of heals, but one excells in each. Also all 3 healers are supposed to be equaly good at the job. So, the &quot;if you could find no healer&quot; statment is bunk, because a Shaman will be just as much of a healer as a cleric. Also, this time around, buffs only last while the buffer is in the group. So if they give us worthwile buffs, people have to group with us to have them.<br />
<br />
Rune Type healing    (Shaman)<br />
Regeneration healing (Druid) <br />
Direct Healing          (Cleric)<br />
<br />
I think a rune heal could end up being the most valuable depending on implementation. If it is like a EQ rune (minus component), then its the only type of heal that doesn't over heal (unless duration is too short).<br />
<br />
Lately ther has been an influx of uniformed posters on the EQ2 boards saying a bunch of stuff that is unsubstantiated.. and a lot is crap that was true in EQ1.. but basicaly there has been a lot already worked out based on quotes from the comunity represenatives and developers. this information is contained in several FAQ's there.<br />
<br />
Also the game isn't even in open beta yet. Just friends and family of SOE employees are playing the game right now... so gripeing about balance in a game thats at this state is just amuseing.</div></div><hr />

Remember Shaman in the old days of EQ were also king of buffs and were very much in demand :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah,  all healers will be equal in EQII; they will just get the healing done in slightly different flavors.<br />
<br />
If you follow the development in EQII closely you will see that the EQII Devs are really taking many of the problems that are facing the EQLive Shaman to heart.  Heck the whole class system is totally different.<br />
<br />
BUT the biggest reason to believe that the EQII Devs are not out to screw players who like the idea of playing shaman: THERE IS NO BEASTLORD IN EQII, woot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe, good point Wulfbane, but unless they go back on their short duration/group only buffs we wont fall into the same hole we're in now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hope they are smarter than just giving us stat buffs though :). Most stats besides HP's and Mana were overrated in eq1 at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">eq2 is total different from eq, but from what i have seen they have picked some of the worse parts.<br />
<br />
short buff? noone rem how horrible short buffs are?<br />
i suppose they might come up with something that would work but i doubt it. i aslo doubt that if i do get eq2 (which seems unlikely) that i would play any preist class. More likely i be a caster.</div></div><hr />

No way dude, Charisma PWNS!<br />
<br />
Not only does it allow you to tank mobs IN TEH FACE, but a high Charisma allows you to SLOW TIME.<br />

I get really bored on patch days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh.  This is one of those &quot;What's missing from this picture?&quot; things.  If you look under the Magic section and look at the spells you get a feel for the basic concept for the class.  Shaman Mystic is interesting for being the only class with NO damage spells.  Short-term buffs and rune healing is it.  I'd rather have a fast healer (cleric) or HoT plus fast healer (Druid) who can also do damage in the group.  Remember the Mystic is the highest level toon (that we know of).  When stat buffs do little at the high end you are left with runes and some patch healing.  Lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Watching SOE balance so many classes to be &quot;completely different but totally equivalent&quot; should be absolutely hilarious. Bring on the beta so we can see how close they got.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, from eqii.com<br />

# How will buffs work in EQII?<br />
<br />
    Most buffs will be group based, meaning that players must remain grouped with the player that buffed them for the entire duration of the buff. It is likely that buffs will be dependent upon a concentration stat pool of the caster as well.<br />
<br />
So if thats true, then I'd expect buffs to have unlimited duration, but you must selectively pick which ones you want.</div></div><hr />

Actually Cha is the third most common buff I use on raids, after FoS and FA, and outside of Uqua it's the only pure stat buff I ever cast. DI tanks always want it =P<br />

Yeah, I know you were making fun of the old slow-resist fable but I couldn't resist posting.</div></div><hr />

Hmm - try soloing THIS class.  They'll make rogues and Paladins look like solo champs in comparison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This tells me that buffs will have a duration (will wear off after some time) and that they will be dropped if you leave the group to prevent PLing and buff bots.<br />
<br />
So.  No damage and not even a buff bot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not so sure this is true.  From what I understand, mages will also have some buffs which will include a group mana / regen which I would asssume would be in high demand. <br />
<br />
Mages also before level 10, recieve a group mana buff (intel and regen), that requires two slots, so you cannot stack this with your self buff, requiring you to make a choice. <br />
<br />
The previous quote came from EJ Moreland one of the programmers for EQ2 and can be found in this very interesting article:<br />

Pjrell (or anyone else), <br />
<br />
Did anyone ask how they plan to keep Mystics viable at the top end when equipment/stat caps are hit?</div></div><hr />

Not exactly but I assume our main role will not be buffing but will be in healing.  They continue to claim that all priests (which EQ2 shaman are a part of) will be equivalent healers.<br />
