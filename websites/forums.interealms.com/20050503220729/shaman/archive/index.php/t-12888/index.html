<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Scrm = 50% extended buffs and qb3 shortens cast time on buffs by 50%.  Can you further extend these by using focus items or are these the max cap?<br />
<br />
For example 8th Coldain shawl is 20% extended buff.  Will this make a total of 70% extension.  Or will the wicked bone atlatl (20% faster buffs)speed buffs on top of qb3 for a total of 70% faster, subject to the 3 sec minimum limit?  <br />
<br />
Would appreciate some of that shaman's crucible wisdom.</div></div><hr />

I'm afraid I don't know the answer, but does it work with heal over time spells like stoicism or Celestial line of spells (paladins) ? I'd like to know the answer to Gakal's question though: 70 percent more duration would be amazing with heal over time spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Buff extension focuses DO NOT work for torpor or any other HoT.  The buff must have a base duration for 48 seconds for it to take effect.<br />
<br />
I do not believe there is a cap on buff extension.  I have SCRM and EE3, and my primal avatar lasts a good 11 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
Buff haste is capped at 50%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">50% is the cap on spell haste. No caps on extended durations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a focus Item from VT that will extend 24 sec HOT</div></div><hr />

Not true, just need the right effect. There is a couple now that make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Focus of Mediocrity.... I love it dearly. 20% Extension on ALL Spell Durations.  <br />
<br />
Comes on the Crown of Ambivalence. :)<br />
<br />
I have heard rumours to the effect that Buff Extension is capped at 50%, but have not heard any confirmed proof as of yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Buff extension can go over 50%, I don't think its capped at all.  Spell haste cannot go beyond 50% though =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">two items come to mind with added duration to Quiescence<br />
<br />
Crown of Ambivalence  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=26763) has Focus of Mediocrity  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3106) will add some duration <br />
... and Earring of Embedded Coral (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=10242) has Eterninostrum  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3845)  <br />
<br />
the longest duration on lucy is Chrononostrum (25%)  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3846&amp;source=Live) but we wont see that till plane of time opens its doors<br />
so atm 70%+ duration is the longest duration, soon to be 75%</div></div><hr />
