LOL) So I get our CH (Mending of Kragg), and I find out that it does about 1k less healing than the Druid CH!! Now, I certainly understand why the Cleric CH is so much better, but do any of you know why the Druid one is??<br />
<br />
Just Courious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LorriLou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have no idea why the druid CH is better, but I for one am glad.  I don't have to act as healer for the most part, and am not generally considered a good healer in most situations.  Therefore...less responsibility for me...which is GOOD.  Of course, I do keep up my quick heal at all times, just in case, but am never the main healer.  Let the druids have that job.</div></div><hr />

Druid's got the better spell because they have loud voices and make up over half of the population of everquest (I don't think I made that up either).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">druids got a beter heal for class balancing reasons.  They had next to no group desireability befure the upgrade to the cheal.  Snare was shared with too many classes, evac is so rarely used that it's not enough reason to pick them, and their dots are easily resisted on higher end play making them not much of a suppliment for dps.<br />
<br />
Druids probably had the least to offer in a grouping situation out of any class (heck, even necros got mez, some mad dps (on longer fights) and could at very least serve as a battery to the wiz and clerics.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I agree with their heals being made THAT good, as they are supposed to predominately be a solo class, but I think SOE is trying to make every class at least have a small bit of group desireability.<br />
<br />
If druids heals were equal to shamans, then I can't fathom a whole lot of situations in which a druid would EVER be taken over a shammy.  I like that the game has certain classes that can fill certain roles, and having one class ALWAYS being the better fit over another class seems to detract something from the game for me.<br />
<br />
Now, with druids as they are, there are times when groups could prefer a druid over a cleric (already have another form of backup heal, and could use a little extra dps, or something like that)  or possibly a druid over a shammy (already have haste and slows, and might need a little more healing power).<br />
<br />
I do think they are a little overpowered after 58 (i believe when they get their cheal), but not enough to make them a &quot;must have&quot; in any situation, which I really like.  I think having a holly trinity as a base of a group really limits the exploration of new stratigies, as well as limits many's ability to group.  <br />
<br />
The fact that more groups can be created around druids as a healer not only means more groups for the druid, but more groups for almost every class when there are not enough clerics to go around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In theory its because we can slow mobs, thus reducing the need to heal. It would be nice to remind devs we dont slow mob casters.... The spell is functional if you dotn fight castrers till you get your blast heal at 62. We MAJORLY needed a new fast heal at 64 though... 2k blast or so. 1300 is insulting. Yeah yeah... we can buy aa's. So can other classes. And when its % based, they reap more points healed than we do. Sort of like int casters mitigation aa's :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">. . . Now, I certainly understand why the Cleric CH is so much better, but do any of you know why the Druid one is?? . . .<br />
<br />
It gives shamans something to complain about when they hit 58.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't think you'll care much about it when you get your next heal at 62--umm, in about 2 weeks of casual play.  I know you won't care when you get Quiessence at 65.  I haven't cast Kragg in months.  I barely have a chance to cast Tnargs except for spam heals on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Why? I guess that is kinda covered above. The real question that should be asked, why is our heal the SAME mana and the SAME cast time but heal less? Significantly less, not just a little less. And no upgrade in PoP like Druids got. If they reduced mana cost and/or cast time it wouldn't bug me so much. Of course that's beating a dead horse from months ago and that got us nowhere, doubt it will change now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Druids definitely need the better heal . . . and we should be glad they have it.  I played a druid and quit it because my main role, healing, was so gimped I was a hinderance to my group.  They now have a good niche, as do we.  They can Snare, DoT, DS and Heal.  We heal well enough IMO, and I don't want to be a healer.  I don't even like being a backup healer, but I do because that's part of the job.  We have bigger fish to fry than wanting be become better healers, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only reason our heal is smaller is because of hp per mana ratio. If we had a better heal at 58 - thus allowing us to get more HP for less mana - cannibalize would be too powerful. Druids have no means of Canning wich means they cannot exploit a powerful heal, thus it is better.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that our capabilites make the job done good also, when we use the fast heal. We get roughly the same rate of healing with the healing AA's plus we can use Quisence as main heal when the DPS on the tanks isnt too great.<br />
<br />
Kragg i unmemed a while ago, and i doubt i will mem it again on but very few occasions. This will be even more true when i get the healing AA's locked in place.<br />
<br />
Personally im happy druids are better healers, that means i can focus on slowing and DPS when a druid is around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sharlok_Bonespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">and quad-kite, and root, and heal (not including CH), and melee, and cast...any i missed?<br />
<br />
Melee?  What?<br />
<br />
In any case, druids make an acceptable substitute for a cleric in most situations, but they're not replacing us.  Also, when's the last time you saw a freshly ressed druid loot up and have any participation in the next scrap?  It usually takes me about 30 seconds, and I'm ready to slow and debuff the next mob.  <br />
<br />
As far as the difference in healing in the one little crappy Kragg's mending we get and the two nice one druids get, you could look at it this way.  First, at level 58, 1950 is usually a large chunk of hps.  In the 60s, Kraggs makes a pretty mediocre heal, but at 65, we get Quiescence which, combined with either Kragg's mending or Tnarg's mending, is a heck of a lot more efficient and immediate than the druid spells.  Heck, I keep my level 63 Paladin healed just fine with just Quiescence most of the time, and I rarely have any kind of mana issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, don&quot;t name this spell CH, it's heal less than 20% hp a time's warrior :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>umpaa_the_prophet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They really shouldn't have bothered to give us this spell at all but since we're preist and they gave druids a new heal they just gave us one to be inline. As far a balance goes, it's balanced due to our slow. Clerics are the best healers and their Cheal does 10k. Take a 2k off that and reduce it by 75% and you get our heal for 2k. That said this spell is completely useless since with shaman mana regen and the fact mana pres affects the 62 heal and not the 58 the 50 mana difference even with the lower heal amount makes this spell silly to cast. The casting time alone is ridiculous. From when you get it to when you get the 62 heak you might use it some since the lower heal than that is really weak sauce but probably more worthwhile to spam the lower one than watch someone eat dirt while waiting the 10 secs. <br />
<br />
In any case, I can't see any group that's really moving at a reasonable rate have a shaman as a healer at that level range. At 65 with Q and slow you can be a real effiecent healer but until then it's kind of a joke.<br />
<br />

<br />
ok, i played a druid first and I would like to say... NO!!!<br />
<br />
Druids, at 51 could probably not take an even conning mob below 96%hp melee before seeing loading... please wait.<br />
<br />
They CAN'T take more that a couple hits, and can't land more than a couple.  even if they could, at 51, their level 14 dd spells would be more effecient on an exp giving mob than melee-ing.  Ok, i might be overdoing it a little bit, but not by much.<br />
<br />
Druids are pretty over powered as a solo class, but melee is certainly not one of their skills.  They efficiently root/rot, quad kite, kite, and charm kite.  But going toe to toe as a druid is just silly.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. When i am the main healer i have Quiescence up and Kraggs. ITs a great tool when your playing that role.<br />

However i dont understand why it costs the same mana. Nm, i do. It was part of the stealth nerf to the shaman mana regen ability /nod</div></div><hr />

With any healing AA and an IH4 item Tnargs is so much better than Kraggs.  Just curious because maybe I'm missing something here but why use Kraggs over Tnargs?</div></div><hr />

The spell icon's not what you'd expect, the name sure isn't - but the line:<br />

Someone feels the mending of Khura. <br />

makes me think it's a scrapped version of an improved ICH for Shamans. It has the same mana cost and cast time as the L64 druid ICH, which heals 4680 HPs compared with 3120 for &quot;no spell&quot;.<br />
<br />
Khura's Mending (as I suspect it would have been called) would have been a decent upgrade - but given the choice of that or Quiescence, I know which I'd chose!  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just as some information to gather about you and keep in the round file:<br />
Druids are a Leather class and given similar level gear their Ac and such will be around 200-300 points less than what a Shamans is, and 400 or more less than a Cleric; also druids, especially at your level, tend to be more Wis/Mana based than a shaman and thus have far fewer hit points and this, in combination with a lower ac and a lower armor mitigation type in general, means they take far harder hits than you will.<br />
As for swinging a weapon, no shaman or druid can seriously do any melee damage worth a crap, anyone that says that they can is delusional...yeah yeah yeah we all go swinging and tanking in teh face from time to time, and I have a nice bag of toys that I like to play nice nice with mobs with,  but once your level 50+ and especially once your in PoP+ expansions its not that safe to go swinging a weapon (YOU hit a_random_PoP_Mob_001 for 14 points of damage!!!......a_random_PoP-Mob-001 ripostes you for 387 points of damage!...yeah good trade off).<br />
Combine that with the 25 (or is it 50??) points less that their weapons skills cap at and your looking at a pretty piss poor tank, even by priest standards.<br />
Now as to our Incomplete heal, we got a gimp version for 2 reasons: the first is, basically, that it would be broke in combination with cannibalize if it healed what the druid heal did...it would be far far more mana production at that level than is seriously allowable. The second reason is that given the choice between a shaman and a druid with the same heal, which do you think the Main tank in the group would ask for? <br />
Now I am not the typical &quot;bash druids&quot; type, I have met and know several very good druids, but for the most part I do see them as the k00l d00ds of old that bugged the crap outta me in RM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yep I know why Kraggs is so low hp etc but what I cannot understand is why the **** SOE classes it as a Cheal so there is no way we can improve it with AA etc.<br />

<br />
<br />
Wulfbane<br />
<br />
PS<br />
Yes I know it may be too powerful in combo with canni but then why give it to us in the 1st place why not just give us the blast heal at 58 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well we were supposed to get an upgrade in PoP to match the Druids upgrade but hell we didn't even get that. Same mana, same cast time, 1000-2680 less damage healed depending on which spell a Druid uses. They should just give em slow and rez and call it a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Kraggs is worthless once you have Tnargs.  When you have healing AA you exceptional heal with it alot, the casting time is under 3 seconds with some benifical focus's.  I have found it to be extremely easy to be only healer in Ldon using quiessence and tnargs.  I can heal for a while almost anywhere with those two.  Not that hard to heal even in elemental plane exp groups.  Though it is a big strain on mana.  So I prefer a cleric or druid in those groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">regardless of what shaman were &quot;supposed&quot; to get, when i look at the priestly balance out there, i think the heals worked out pretty well. Clerics are overall better at all aspects of healing, we're better than druids at heal over time, and druids are better at burst healing. I see nothign wrong with that.<br />
<br />
It works in practice, not just in theory. I've been the only healer in an earth exp. group and i've also seen a druid be the only healer in the same earth group, but without a slower, his job was much much harder.<br />
<br />
You can look to discount AA's but the fact is that they MUST be counted in the overall balance of things. SCRM is a patent assumption when you get Q, it makes no sence to not get SCRM. so when you look at Q as an upgrade over topor, you're seeing that really what the devs intended was a functional heal over time that healed in the 2400 - 2700 range over time.. which is more than fine with me.  Make no mistake, that was intentional, the dev's could have easilly made SCRM not affect spells under 48 second duration, like they did for EE focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">2700 point Q is a myth.<br />
<br />
The Druid PoP iCH is more efficient and hitpoints/second than Q. So Druids beat us in the efficiency and the direct healing power department.<br />
<br />
Whoever decided that Druids should be getting better heals than Shamans was a moron and obviously no one that followed the original EQ vision(VI TM).<br />
In a situation where i can't use cannibalize i will run out of mana faster than the Druid and heal for less, something to consider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The Druid PoP iCH is more efficient and hitpoints/second than Q.<br />
<br />
Not true with AA and focus items.  Q can consistently heal over 2k for less then 200 mana.  A cleric needs to consistently CH for 4k each to beat that.  A shaman can heal more and for longer then a druid.  Only problem shaman is having healing is with high dps creatures, 1200-1500 hitters, chain casting.  It not a mana issue, but an issues of not burning mana fast enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Kraggs is in the back of the book for me.  I use Tnargs exclusively for my direct heals.  I got an ImprovedHealingIV item combined with max healing increasing AA's and it's actually less efficient for me to cast Kraggs than to cast Tnargs in an attempt to heal a high HP target.  With Tnargs I can crit heal and heal em all the way up quick.  With Tnargs I can do more hps healed per second.  And I don't have to wait that annoying ten seconds.  Also, with my mana pres IV item, it comes out to less mana / hp for Tnargs over Kraggs.  <br />
I'd rather use a fast heal than a slow one any day.  <br />

Yes, in the case I suppose it would be more of a situational thing but I'd still choose Tnargs over Kraggs in most cases and did when I hit 62 without IH4 and no healing AAs.  With AA being so fast to get now and IH4 on the ornate arms I'd think most people have one or the other if not both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't heal corpses. In critical situations mana efficiency is secondary, the only issue is to keep the tank alive NOW with direct heals. Druids direct healing abilities at 65 with Karanas Renewal (4.680 points heal) are far more than 50% ahead of shaman.<br />
<br />
True, shaman can 'heal over time' better than druids, but in reality direct heals &gt; heal over time, even when you consider lesser mana efficiency:<br />
Shaman_01: &quot;Woot, i saved 200 mana compared to a druid&quot;<br />

Yes, I will torpor a tank if I have to.  Just tell them to click it off at 100% and theyre fine.  Ususally dont have to.  KRaggs works fine. Tnargs is a bit mana intensive as i dont have an MP4 item and I don't have canni 5 yet (only 63 still)<br />

Each person has their own way of playing their character.  There is no wrong way of doing it (unless you have a shaman who refuses to slow, but that's another story ;) ).  <br />
<br />
Personally I usually just keep up Tnargs and Qui, because there is usually a cleric or druid as the main healer.  My job is to slow, split tank, and keep the main healer alive.  But that's just my personal way of playing.  I have been the main healer for an 8k hp warrior and let me tell you, it does slow things down.  But we adapt and go on.  We're only in the game to have fun :)</div></div><hr />

With two paladins youre more than ok as healer if you can4/can5  when needed. Tnarg and Q work very good in combo.<br />
<br />
My most frequent duo are the stormriders in BoT garden together with a paladin, its really easy, especially since the paladin can keep those casters stunned so they dont gate/heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I only use Q and Tnargs<br />
<br />
With max healing aa I can be main/only healer in pretty much any tier3 xp camp, and even in some places of elementals (yard trash/island village mobs before castle1 in PoF)<br />
<br />
Kraggs I never use at all, though i can see how its a damn sight more useful at 58 than it is at 65 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Now, I certainly understand why the Cleric CH is so much better, but do any of you know why the Druid one is?<br />
<br />
probably because.. humm... we can slow?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">-Ya, I think Kragg's was really only meant as a temporary heal to tie us over until we got Tnarg's with the AA,s and focus effects.  <br />
-Its totally useless anyhow though,  10 seconds to cast a 2k hp heal?!  Which means, If the person you are healing is getting hit by any mob that hits for more then 200dps (which is any PoP mob) a pop, the persons dead.  <br />
I almost always use Quiescence, but if the person is dying kind of fast i use Tnargs.  The #s speak for themselves.<br />
<br />
Quiescence = 200mana / 2300hp - cast time 3.0 seconds (with max AA)<br />
Ratio = 11.5 / 1<br />
<br />
Tnarg's = 450mana / 1547hp (crit-3094hp) - cast time 3.75 sec. (max AA)<br />
Ratio = 3.43 / 1  (critical -  6.87 / 1 )<br />
<br />
Kragg's = 400mana / 2320hp - cast time 10 sec. (no critical) (max AA)<br />
Ratio = 5.8 / 1<br />
<br />
And I am not even counting focus effects ,(doesnt effect Kragg's) which can increase healing, lower mana,  and lower cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">At 58 I am more than pleased with Kragg's.  It has saved lives where stoicism or chloro wouldn't (druid kiting mobs around us after a bad pull) and has allowed me to stand in as main healer in pos while the cleric was meditating.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, for the level you get it it is a great spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I still use Kraggs quite a bit, when I'm pet-tanking or get stuck clericing.  There are a number of situations where 2500-ish for 400 is better than 1700-ish for 450 even keeping in mind the difference in cast times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I read the first post and only skimmed the rest. So... why is the druid CH better than the shaman one? <br />
<br />
Remember that the druid/shaman mini-CH spells were put in before PoP came out (I think?). If that's so, then arguments regarding Tnarg's mending, etc... aren't entirely relevant. <br />
<br />
In that case, I think the reason our CH is smaller than the druid CH is simple - Canni IV and Turgur's insects. A shaman with those two spells is probably at least as good a &quot;healer&quot; as a druid with a mini-CH that heals 50% more than the shaman version. Shamans have much better damage mitigation and mana regeneration abilities than druids, so they gave us a smaller CH. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think Kragg's mending is just fine at the almost-2k level.  It's enough for my L 58 shaman to be primary healer in dungeon groups without significant mana issues, which he could NOT do at L 57. If it was a lot more, people might start making noises about shamans in CH rots, and I've played my wife's uber cleric on raids JUST ENOUGH to know that I am damn sure I don't ever want my shaman alt to even be considered for such a role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Truth is, druids really need a Better Heal.  So do shaman for that matter.<br />
Shaman could use thier 64 Heal Back.<br />
<br />
Anyway, some number crunching and imporant tidbits.<br />
Heal Over Times are modifiable by focus, and AAs by a HUGE margin more than CHs.<br />
<br />
When comparing the 3 Priest Classes<br />
Clerics: Best Ratio/Largest CH.   Best Ratio 3.8 Sec Heal   Largest Heal Over Time (not best ratio).   Superfast 1.5 Sec Heal.  Group Heals.<br />
<br />
Druids: 2nd Best Ratio/Size CH.  2nd Best 3.8 Sec Heal<br />
<br />
Shaman: 2nd Best Ratio/Size CH.  2nd Best 3.8 Sec Heal.  Best Ratio Heal Over Time.  <br />
<br />
Now, some comparison number crunching.<br />
The true power of Shaman healing isn't in our CH/Directs it's in Quiessence.   Maxed out Quiessence can be:<br />
200 Mana (Less MP say typical 15% which would be 8% average or 184) for 8 tics or 2400 Health in 3 Seconds.   Ratio can top out at 13.0<br />
<br />
Maxed CH: 7500 * 1.19 AA = 8925 / 400 = 22.3  Im not sure if Cleric AA<br />
adds to CH.  so just in case will do the unAAed<br />
Cleric CH: 7500/400 = 18.75<br />
Maxed Druid KR: 4750 * 1.19 AA = 5652 / 600 = 9.42  <br />
Maxed Druid TR: 2950 * 1.19 AA = 3510 / 400 = 8.77<br />
Maxed Shanan KM: 1950 * 1.19 = 2320 / 400 = 5.8<br />
<br />
Pretty easy to see that quiessence can crush any Druid CH for efficiency and come within 50% of Cleric CH.  Not to mention casting time of 3 seconds vs 10 seconds with draw back of taking 48 seconds to do the full job.<br />
<br />
Currently though CH/balance could use some work.  Look at the 3.8 Second Fast Heals:<br />
Cleric 2750/600 = 4.58<br />
Druid 1750/500 = 3.5<br />
Shaman 1300/450 2.88<br />
<br />
Now, the real key is compare Percent Wise.<br />
Druid Fast Heal = 21% Better Efficiency than Shaman<br />
Cleric Fast Heal = 31% better efficiency than Druid<br />
<br />
Now compare to that CH efficience<br />
Druid KR Maxed: 62% Better than Shaman KM Maxed<br />
Druid TR Maxed: 51% Better than shaman KM Maxed<br />
Cleric NO AA: 99% Better than Druid KR Maxed<br />
<br />
Gaps pretty large in the CHs.  I'd argue too large.  Personally Druid 64 Heal should be lower mana than 600, to something like 500 or less.<br />
@500 = 5652/500 = 11.3 ((Cleric CH still 66% Better))<br />
@ 480 = 5652/480 = 11.8 ((Cleric CH still 59% Better))<br />
<br />
Then from there Shaman should get a 64 CH thats a about same 50-60 ratio.  So if you assume KR at 4750(5652) for 500 then your looking at 2850(3391) for 500 = 6.783 <br />
<br />
Clerics should and always will be kings of healing.  But the CH ratios are so far out there, that theres a bigger gap in CH efficiency than in any other aspect of the game.  ((Currently 100%+ if AA work))<br />
<br />
IE: There's not 100% gap in AC/HPs from Plate to Chain Tanks<br />
IE: there's sure as hell not a 100% difference in Slowing between Slowing Classes.  Hell the WORST slower Bards are only 50% gap<br />
IE: There's not 100% gap between Rogues DPS and Monk DPS<br />
<br />
You will notice that the gap in all those other cases is 10% to 25%<br />
which is in line with the gap in 3.8 Second Heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Keep in mind as far as Cleric heals go, they are not gonna complete heal for 7500 very often. I don't know the numbers obviously but I would bet on average it's damn close to what the Druid can heal for with their best heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye and at 600 mana it is still too expensive.  Same as the Druid 64 Heal at 600 Mana is too expensive<br />
<br />
Not to mention, for the current druid spell and for the theoretical and needed shaman spell, the improvement for a 64 Spell compared to a 58 Spell is PATHETIC.<br />
<br />
Lvl 64 KR (4750/600) is ONLY 7.34 % Increase over Lvl58 TR(2950/400))<br />
<br />
Thoeritical KM<br />
Level KM (3120/600) is ONLY 6.6% Increase over Lvl 58 KM(1950/400)<br />
<br />
No other 61+ spell only increases 6-8%.  most 61+ spells are 15% to 40% more efficient than thier pre60 counterparts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">IMO you guys are a bunch of whiners.. when I hit 58 I was awe struck.. you kidding me!? I can now run my own groups slow the guy start the ch on the tank bam 40% =&gt; 70%, then wham! 60-&gt;90.. god damn how powerful.. at one point I did not have torpor or q but was doing a naked CR (I got virtue) to get my body from acrylia.. I would fight some, then Canni V and kraggs WOW what a cool combo.. (and w/o armor sure fills up that mana pool).. <br />
<br />
Kraggs was a blessing in disguise for me, it evolved the way I played my game :) If you don't look at other classes, just look at what you got and try to use it to the best of your abilities you'll have much more fun..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">That is very true that we need to consider all tools given to us as a class.  The only reason we really need a bigger CH is if they move the level cap to 70 in the next expansion.  Then quick, DIRECT heals will be necessary to preserve balance. <br />
<br />
Quiescence is nice, but it's not the same kind of spell as the mini-CH, and it's very different even from a fast heal like Tnargs.  It's far more situational.  Nice to have fo sho, but in many situations it's best to use a fast heal to make sure that your target survives.  For that reason I've taken it upon myself to max the efficiency and PUNCH of Tnargs.  It's probably my most cast spell on raids.  You'd be surprised at how many raids you can save with a well placed Tnargs.  And having one crit for 3100 or so really makes a hp bar jump!  <br />
<br />
If the level goes to 70 tho, we'll need a better version of Tnargs, something that heals bout 2k before AA's/focus's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">With full healing AA, Marr's Gift, and some focus items, you'd be surprised how well Tnargs can heal, and how long we can keep it up. Yes, I'm aware of the arguement &quot;but we need AAs and focus just to be good healers&quot; and I disagree, the statement should be &quot;with AAs and focus, shamans are incredible healers.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can be main slower and main healer campin Regruas in PoWater just fine (although obviously having another shm/dru/clr is safer)--and that's one of the most difficult exp camp in game.<br />
<br />
With the comming expansion, I'd much rather see a large and fast direct heal such as Tnargs, maybe in the 2-2.5k range, than a 3-3.5k incomplete heal.</div></div><hr />
