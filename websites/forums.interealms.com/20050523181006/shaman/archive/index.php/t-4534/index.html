<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">every shaman know our Poison dot and disease dot was best taunt tool when you need to hold agro<br />
<br />
few months ago, disease dot was very big agro before VI add disease counter to our slow spell, disease dot is very low agro now which is good change<br />
<br />
now, poison dot still one of biggest agro spell, I don't understand why a Damage Over Time spell have suck huge agro ? why a DoT have to take instant agro for it damage over time ? a wiz nuke 20,000 damage over 5 minute fight doesn't take instant agro in first cast, it spread agro over 5 minute. <br />
<br />
I want to know when VI look into this agro issue, it should spread the agro of DoT over every tick, let say you take small initial agro when casting dot, then take agro every tick is dot land, this is what disease dot work now,<br />
<br />
I understand poison dot have build in poison counter which share with enchanter's tash lines, which mean change agro on poison counter may effect the agro on other spell, but VI just change agro on disease counter a while ago and fixed the agro issue with slow spell, why can't they do same to poison counter and other counter's agro to fixed the agro on DoT?<br />
<br />
look back to problem again, some Damage Over Time(DoT) spell take instant agro rather then Agro over time,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I actually love the taunt. I was in a hands group all day yesterday with 2 rogues, 1 monk, 1 cleric, and 1 enchanter. In order to kill things as quickly as possible I would slow, BoN, and cripple as necessary. <br />
<br />
This enabled the rogues and monks to get their maximum amount of damage in on the mobs back. Plus it was a nice change for me being the main tank in a way. The clerics were always good on mana because they had just the one target to heal. All in all a good time. <br />
<br />
This of course probably isnt the ideal technique for most encounters, it was just the best example of making the best use out of the situation. If you are concerned about dot aggro I find if I hold off a bit before casting it helps a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as I can tell, DoTs DO cause agro every tick. Many many times I have cast the epic DoT on a mob, and when it gets to the last few ticks, the mob switches from the tank to me.<br />
<br />
This effect is more noticable if I EBolt the mob as well as epic, which suggests the EBolt is also causing agro every tick.<br />
<br />
There is some initial agro from a DoT as well, but unless you cast loads of DoTs all together I shouldn't imagine tanks would have a problem taunting the mob off you again.<br />
<br />
(Talking about xp mobs here, not some uber death creature).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Grippa - I have observed the same thing.  I use a horse, so I have no sit aggro; near the end of the fight, when the epic DOT is at its biggest, the MOB will turn on me every tick and the MT will taunt it back off.  The effect is definately greater with EBolt added.<br />
<br />
EBolt does have that initial DD, I suspect that has something to do with the increased taunt on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually they do need to take a serious look at this, especially now with DOT stacking which would mean they will get used more. Between malo/slow and DOTs, you can pretty much pull a MOB off anyone. While that gets annoying in exp groups, it can lead to disaster on a raid or your death at the very least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know this isn't very big but don't poisons and disease stop the mob from regenerating also?  It use to be when rabies landed on you, your health wouldn't go up or down, it just stopped.  So I the dot in additon to damage being delt stops or hampers regeneration (yes I know it is doing damage)?<br />
<br />
Only reason I know about the rabies thing at one time I was at negative health and the group I was with killed the mummy we were attacking.  They didn't know what was wrong (didn't have a clue) and I sat there for 45 minutes till the rabies wore off.  Mean time they abandoned me and dumped me from the group.  It use to be where you couldn't type if you were at negative health.  Anyway my health didn't go up or down and no wandering monster passsed by and killed me.... just sat on the ground.  That was a long time ago when I was playing a DESK.</div></div><hr />
