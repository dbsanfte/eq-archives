Let's hope they do something useful with the list, now that they have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thought it was another proiritize this list &gt;&lt; sorry :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pretty nice list ... there's a couple I don't necessarily agree with as far as whether or not they're priorities, but it's a pretty nice compilation all the same. The proof is in the pudding, however ... let's see what SOE does with it. Any decent effort -- with results!! -- will be their saving grace, and they're badly in need of it. <br />
<br />
BTW Sud, thanks for the effort you're putting in.<br />

Very much appreciate your efforts Sudedor :)<br />
<br />
Lets just hope SOE developers keep to their side of the bargin, do their research and give us some feedback/changes.<br />
<br />
fingers crossed.<br />

Keep up the great work Sudedor, thanks again</div></div><hr />

I would ask, though, MGB shrink? Would that really be more than a convenience? I would think something like making DoT's viable again would be more important. That is unless, of course, that was meant to be included in point #2 about DPS/burst DPS. Me, I think a shaman should do their damage primarily with DoT's (sickness, poison, etc.) - personal preference, I suppose. /shrug<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hurrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">MGB Shrink is absolutely useless.  Sounds good on the surface perhaps, but would not be used in gameplay.  Having that on the list provides SOE a bone to throw us that, like so many other bones, is meaningless but makes it look like they did something for us.  It's almost criminal having that on the list.<br />
<br />
RATIONALE:<br />
<br />
The only people that would possibly need MGB Shrink are raiding guilds.  They won't use it for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
1.  There are not enough shaman to support fluff MBGs like this one.  We MGB Tribunal and Focus, we conserve any other MGBs we have for the eventual wipe....and you betcha, raiding guilds do lots of wiping.  :)  You wipe before the MGB clocks have reset, and now you are doing buff by groups after a wipe.  Nope, wont do it.<br />
<br />
2.  Raiding guilds advocate self-sustainment.  Meaning, be able to shrink yourself, invis yourself, breathe underwater on your own, see invisible on your own.  Start something like this, and you will start some folks to thinking they no longer have to shrink themselves.  Next thing you know, people will be asking you to play musical group in a raid.  Not gonna happen.  Typically your group role is too important for you to be constantly ducking in and out of groups.  Most especially in those raids where we have to group clerics together for bard resists.  In those events, shamans and druids become sole group healers for their groups.<br />
<br />
3.  People are busy on fast paced raids.  Mr Warrior the Ogre might want to be shrunk, but the cleric group leader (since the advent of leader xp, guess who is usually group leader in raids) is busy as heck, and really doesn't want your tell asking him to kick someone from group, invite you to group, let you shrink, then after you leave group, get the other person back in group.  Heaven forbid anyone be afk for a bio break or something while they (and you, who might just find yourself out of the raid waiting for all this) is finally done.<br />
<br />
4.  You MGB shrink, then your raid starts pulling mobs.....and people start dieing.  They die all night long.  A lot, if not most of the people you shrank with your MGB will have died once and lost the shrink, before your MGB resets.<br />
<br />
If this isn't removed from the list, since its useless, you can expect to get it.  Yay.  Incoming bone from the devs.  Aren't you happy the devs listened to you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>NoYes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I completly agree. MGB shrink is useless. TGB Shrink would be ok, but again its not really needed (shrinkers availible to all, and becoming more common effect on some items)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I doubt they would implement this, since any spell which alters a players appearance or external characteristics out of group could be used for griefing purposes, and probably would be, human nature being what it is.<br />
<br />
Edit: maybe if they had a popup box asking approval it would work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yall being spoiled, Shaman is one of the most powerful Versital classes in EQ. I can dps harder than most classes, we can heal, we debuff, we can solo things no other class can. <br />
<br />
The only thing i see on this list that makes any sense is # 3 and # 8.<br />
<br />
And i kind of wish they would make our HoT's go back to being as efficient or more so with the increase of Level. Our new 70 HoT loses efficency to BoT and Quiescence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What can we solo that no other class can? <br />
<br />
I personally don't care much about soloing now-a-days it is better/faster XP to group, and you get better upgrades raiding. Those two things are my main concerns. <br />
<br />
Am I a useful class to have in a group/raid? What is my level of usefulness? Would the group/raid be better off with some other class?<br />
<br />
Currently I feel useful in OoW, not nearly as useful as from normal LDoNs, or Sol ro and below PoP zones (can't attest for the higher tiers yet). I haven't played much in GoD, so not sure how my usefulness is there now. In LDoN hards I felt somewhat useful, but not moderately useful. <br />
<br />
Of course maybe my usefulness will change with better gear or spells from GoD/OoW.<br />
<br />
How do you do your DPS without getting agro btw? Seems if I put more than 2 dots on a mob I get agro. I try one dot and casting rain spells and the rain gets resisted often. One dot and ice nukes, takes forever and a day to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lillad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">at least Champion is group (and for 1500 mana it better be).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hehe monk boards have pretty much determined that the top 10 list is a carrot to keep you playing/hoping hehe wouldn't expect much from it.<br />
<br />
Seriously I think FA should last 2.5 hours ... why ?  FA is the closest thing melee clases have to KEI (well maybe haste)  and kei is still, no contest, more helpful to a caster than FA is to a melee it would be nice if  it at least had similar durations.   <br />
<br />
New heals would be good fast heals are behind yeah but they are suppose to be some, currently I think they are to far behind I thinkt he lvl 68 one should be of the lvl of the ancient one and the ancient should be 300-400 more than that.  Wouldn't mind a new 10 sec heall.  Druids got a 2900 when we got 1950 druids later got a 4300 we should get a 3k one at least</div></div><hr />
