Combines work again!<br />
Melee Part II!<br />
A new story has been added to your storybook!<br />
<br />
<br />
The grammar police have invaded EQ and they have made many minor spell, item and quest text fixes that are too numerous to list here.  <br />
<br />
We'd like to thank all of the players that took time to provide feedback regarding the melee changes.  We'd also like to send a special thanks to all of the players that helped us test the additions on the Test and Beta servers. All of the input we received helped to shape the improvements you've seen in the melee classes.<br />
 <br />
Please continue to give your feedback on the melee system or anything else that you feel requires attention. It does make a difference.<br />
<br />
Over the last several months there have been several new additions to EverQuest aimed at increasing the desirability and relative power of pure melee classes.<br />
<br />
- Discipline timers were revamped, allowing greater freedom and frequency of use.<br />
- Endurance bar was added as a limited resource to power melee abilities and disciplines.<br />
- Warriors received an innate 5 percent increase in their ability to absorb damage.<br />
- Warriors received the Incite line of abilities, giving them a new tool for aggro management. <br />
- Monks received the Phantom Call line of abilities, giving them a new tool for pulling.<br />
- Several new disciplines were introduced for all three classes.<br />
<br />
The endurance system and the separation of the discipline timers have provided us with new tools to add interesting and powerful abilities in the future for melee classes.  You can count on seeing new disciplines and abilities as the game progresses and as situations arise that require new abilities to effectively balance class power.  We will continue to evaluate the melee system for both balance and enjoyment.<br />
<br />
We will also continue to review and make changes to each individual class as needed.  Class balance is an important part of any multiplayer game and requires constant attention.<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping make EverQuest a great game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
------------------------<br />
We have replaced the spell-like effects on items which produced the following effects: Attack, HP Regen, Mana Regen, Haste and Damage Shield with actual statistics.  The effects on the item have not changed they are just set up in a new way that we hope will allow for more item functionality in the future.<br />
Several Gates smithed weapons have had their damage and delay adjusted to be more in line with the difficulty in crafting them.<br />
The Copper Hammer of Striking will no longer proc for wielders below level 50.<br />
The Wailing Coral Staff is now two handed blunt.<br />
Bolas are now one-handed projectile rather than ammo.<br />
Bola ranges have been adjusted slightly.<br />
All bolas that can proc will now do so.<br />
All items that had the &quot;Cleave&quot; series of effects removed, have had them returned.<br />
<br />
The drop rate for the following Epic Quest items has been increased slightly:<br />
<br />
- Essence of a Vampire<br />
- Decrepit Hide<br />
- Staff of Elemental Mastery (earth)<br />
<br />
<br />
Expedition zones<br />
-------------------------<br />
You will now have to wait 5 minutes before you are able to accept another expedition zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tradeskills<br />
-------------------------<br />
In order to correct many of the issues with the new tradeskill interface it was necessary to remove all learned and favorite recipes.  However the system should now work better overall.<br />
The sell prices for Saltwater Tuna and Saltwater crab, as well as the price for any item made from them, have been reduced.<br />
Rainbow Trout should now be tradeable.<br />
If you are not a gnome, you should no longer be able to tinker with a deluxe toolkit kit.  If you are a gnome, please tinker away.<br />
You should now be able to properly search for recipes.<br />
The trivial level for brewing Fish Wine has been adjusted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Berserkers<br />
-------------------------<br />
Some berserker abilities have had their endurance cost changed.<br />
The duration of Confusing Strike has been reduced.<br />
Berserkers should no longer be told that they can bash at level 6.  <br />
The berserker guildmaster in the Plane of Knowledge has been taught throwing and parry and is ready to train berserkers in their use.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spells<br />
-------------------------<br />
Some Gates of Discord spells should now drop a little more often.<br />
Several heal spells for Gates of Discord have been modified slightly.<br />
The shadow knight Ancient Spell: Bite of Chaos should now work as intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
NPC's<br />
-------------------------<br />
Hierophant Granix should now give the correct text in Cabilis.<br />
Trimdet Trueheart in Abysmal Sea is less of a snob and should now speak with you correctly.  <br />
If you tell Brevik Kalaner in Abysmal what items you [need back], he will return to you any items you've just given him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tribute<br />
-------------------------<br />
A few items have had their tribute value adjusted.<br />
Gift of the Enchanters should now work correctly.<br />
You should no longer be able to donate containers with items inside for favor.<br />
Persistent Boon should now give the proper effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alternate Advancement<br />
-------------------------<br />
Dire Charm will no longer reset after being resisted as the ability was successfully initiated.<br />
Dire Charm should now reset when used on an NPC that is too high in level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
-------------------------<br />
Corrected a faction issue with the wizard epic.<br />
The monk &quot;Phantom&quot; line of abilities should no longer be resisted in the level 65 &quot;hard&quot; LDoN Adventures.<br />
The rogue's &quot;Assassin's Strike&quot; skill line ability will be re-introduced with the next update.<br />
The Shining Bloodstone will now be restricted to 2-handed weapons. Any who have placed this augmentation in a 1-handed weapon will find the augmentation on their cursor when they log in. If you find that you have no practical use for the 2-handed augmentation, please petition and a suitable 1-handed replacement will be made available to you.<br />

<br />

Nice<br />
<br />
Several heal spells for Gates of Discord have been modified slightly.<br />
Holy Elixir<br />
Changed Mana cost from 440 to 480<br />
Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Increase Hitpoints v2 by 550 per tick&quot; to &quot;Increase Hitpoints v2 by 600 per tick&quot;<br />
<br />
Holy Light<br />
Changed Mana cost from 660 to 650<br />

<br />
Breath of Trushar<br />
Changed Mana cost from 220 to 285<br />
(yes, it still heals 360 per tick)<br />
<br />
If Brenlo reads this: Could we get some confirmation as to these changes not being affected by our current debate? Also it would be nice to hear the reasoning for everyone getting a straight increase in HPs/second while shaman only get a higher mana cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
Corrected a faction issue with the wizard epic.<br />
Nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pardon me, but what the heck are they up to? Do they want us to just cave in and make druids/clerics instead. 85 extra mana, for 60 hp/tick - I am going back to Quiescence :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can see going back to Quiescence - Q or Trushar, they both are not real heals and at least Quiescence is more efficient. Also overheals less on Canna 5.<br />
Oh, and the paladin does not have to wait for it to completely fade, he can overlap his HoT with mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">another way to look at it is 42.5% cost increase for a 20% heal increase - I am a little annoyed to say the least. Especially since looking at the other heals they are getting upgraded in power, and only elixir increases in mana, the others (direct heals albeit) are getting lower mana cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They dont whant shaman to be any class that can heal good. They have no clue how what we should do. shaman is a class that is more and more useless wee we got slow but they dont like slow so make all bosses immune to slow and much of the rest will migrate it and give em long time dots that give big agro and do littel dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I almost feel sorry for Brenlo (only almost because it is after all his job) that he has to come here and explain how on earth this makes sense.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I honestly dont care if they changed it to healing 1 hitpoint per second for 1 tick for 1000 mana because its never gonna show up in my spellbook. Like all the other GoD spells its either far from worth the trouble or insanely impossible to get like the ancient spell.<br />
<br />
The way I see it at this point in time the game has outgrown its need for spells dropping off monsters. None of our GoD spells are must-haves or endgame-mob-killing yet only very few people will get most of them. Design decisions like this might keep a few people playing but it will make a lot more people stop caring/playing/paying.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't look like the melee fix to me, that looks like what they have received over the last few months.<br />
<br />
My monk:<br />
<br />
Phantom line: have had it for a few months now, but thanks.<br />
Endurance bar: have had it for a few months now, but thanks.<br />
Several new discs: Yup called phantom line and some loser regen disc, have had that for a few months now, but thanks.<br />
Disc timers?  Well...  not sure, but they're probably referring to the change they made a few months ago as well.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying they didn't upgrade anything, they just don't seem to explain what they've upgraded in the message, hopefully in game monks will let us know what has changed throughout the day.<br />
<br />
*edit* monk boards seem to be thinking &quot;Nothing new in there&quot; can't wait for Melee fix part III!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Biting my tongue, hoping they weren't intending on doing something about healing in this patch, but will be very soon...I mean VERY soon.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is this the part where they explain that they are &quot;still&quot; reviewing our class and deciding if we need improvements for balance?

LMAO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You know, over the past couple weeks, I have been one of the guys saying that our class is relatively OK, just suffering in the latter Gates trials/zones. I have said this because I can be primary healer and slower for an EP XP group in most cases. I have argued with some of you (I prefer to use the term &quot;debate&quot;, since I have mucho respect for most of the regular posters here) and I have defended our position, mainly because at the level we NEED to fixed, many other classes NEED fixing too. We are not alone in the &quot;We suck at this GoD trial&quot; category by any means. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, that being said, this recent change is nothing more than a HUGE slap in the face to our class. Every other heal gets a bump except ours? Is this some kind of JOKE? 360 a tic isnt even CLOSE to an upgrade compared to the upgrade of the mobs that are being fought. And to jack up the mana cost? SHEESH, not that I care much about mana, but WHATEVER . . .<br />
<br />
I don't know what to say anymore. Yeah we have been neglected the past few expansions, punished, if you will, for being so uber during Kunark with Turgurs. But I always felt that it was a case of the rest of the classes &quot;catching up&quot;. Now, not only have they caught up, passed us, but we seem to be running the WRONG WAY. I would seriously like to hear SOEs developer team come here and define their &quot;vision&quot; of the role of a Shaman in this game. Debuff a mob that lives for less than 30 seconds and does 15K damage to a tank during that time? Slow? Cripple? Malos? Is that what they think we are supposed to be doing? It MUST be, because they CERTAINLY cannot be taking our role as a healer seriously. Buffs? Oh gee, thanks, 544 hps and some attack with FA, BIG WHOOOP. Heres a clue SOE, MOST PLAYERS DOING HIGH END GATES CONTENT HAVE MAXXED STATS. OUR STAT BUFFS ARE WORTHLESS.<br />
<br />
I dunno anymore. Might as well go back to my Paladin. At least SOE is actually upgrading that class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Pathetic.<br />

Where are the GoD AA fixes promised?  Nothing about spirithost 4 and 5 being fixed.  Or wards being sorted out.<br />
<br />
They just made our new heal totally crap.  I'm unmemming it and going back to Quiescience also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Heh.<br />
<br />
My guild lost one of its enchanters, they're now insisting I power my chanter alt to 65 to replace him during GoD expeditions, hard LDoNs, and certain raid targets my small family guild is capable of taking down.<br />
<br />
Initially I heavily resisted this idea.  My shaman is my MAIN, and I love playing him.<br />
<br />
But, after seeing this patch, after Brenlo got my hopes up, I guess I may as well go ahead.  Binter will still be my main, but at least that way I have something to fall back on if it turns out that shamans as a class will be ignored to the point of being obsolete...by either accident or design.<br />
<br />
May we all fervently hope and pray that this never comes to pass...but I guess it's prudent to start planning for the possibility.<br />

This means I cannot stand at Gamesh on Henora and zone my druid into adventures to track for nameds to farm.  No named?  Kick him from adventure, zone him out, request new adventure, zone him in, track.  Rinse and repeat, every 30 seconds. Now I have to wait for 5 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Ironically, though, since you can still request expeditions by yourself, you can still check up to 6 every 5 minutes (depending on how many tracking classes you have available).</div></div><hr />

It seems kind of sad to me that after years of EQ content being raped and pillaged by pharmers that they STILL design content that can be easily exploited.  They never learn!<br />
<br />
I'm a big fan of the /feedback tool - and most times you'd think that it's a waste of time - and sometimes I just use it to rant like a lunatic (and it's rarely about shaman-specific issues).  In the last few patches there have been exact changes that directly correlated to suggestions I've made via /feedback.  I don't for a second think they're changing stuff just due to me but it's still somewhat scary to see changes occur that I've /feedbacked about!  It could mean that they actually read user feedback!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Looked like Melee part II was adding + end on non-GoD items. It was added imperfectly, with many logical items (Epics, PoP charm/adventure stone, CUltural armors for RZ and Tribunal) being left out. The endurance added seems to mirror the mana on items that have mana. Not an earthshattering update in that regard, but there is the carrot of more in the future.</div></div><hr />

My copy of Sylvan Infusion came off Umbiki in Vxed and our copy of Holy Light came off a named in Vxed too, might have been Umbiki as well. v Just FYI.</div></div><hr />

Does that mean you'll go post on the paladin board and leave us alone now?    :D</div></div><hr />

The only saving grace of this expansion was breath of trushar and how it was a small upgrade. But then they go and @#$% that up. It's impossible to get chaotic pain as of yet and our other 2 spells are crap. But hey why not increase everyone elses heals and keep their mana the same and just #$%^ us shamans over we're useless anyways.<br />
 #$%^ this S(*T. <br />

That was done some time ago, when the melee revisions were done. The message in the patch is a summary of what was done in previous patches, not what went in on this one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Aqualung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">My bard pal and I have probably killed about 35-40 of the Turd-eaters, and got 6 spells.  which included 1 of his, and none of mine.  We'd only check the front room for nameds, since clearing your way around in there is pretty time consuming for a duo.  It would still take us a half hour or so of reinstancing to get a named up at the zone-in room.  <br />
<br />
We aren't guilded, so we don't get calls to come loot rotting spells.  We've fought our way through the sewers, through the mountains, with repeated runs and alot of named farmings there, and are flagged for KodTaz.  We both have only 1 of our spells (i got Daluda in vxed).  Considering i've spent ALL my play time (a lot, by the way) since the expansion came out in said expansion, it's pretty sad that i've only seen about 10 spells drop.  Maybe we've just been really, really unlucky.  But, either way, I'm oh so glad that getting them just got harder.  <br />
People here used to gripe about having to pay 50k for our top end spells.  I'd be thrilled right now, if i could plop down a grip of cash for Nihil.  Absolutely THRILLED.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spells<br />
-------------------------<br />
Some Gates of Discord spells should now drop a little more often.<br />
<br />
<br />
which ones?  where?  ancient spells?  Were some not dropping at all (i wouldn't be surprised)?      <br />
All i know, is that &quot;a little more often&quot; better translate to &quot;a hell of a lot more often&quot;, or else a lot of people are still going to be SOL for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Woudn't it be funny if they were saying the same about us because of the heal? ;)<br />
<br />
Har, good point :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>smaaltz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I don't want a bigger heal over time.  As far as being effective in tipt+ they might as well give us another disease dot.<br />
<br />
As a time-geared shaman it's really hard to make an impact in tipt+ in GoD.  This expansion is starting to crush my love for my shaman worse than before.  Chanters are godly in tipt..  a charmed pooka is about a billion dps and the other 5 members don't really matter at all.  If you don't have a chanter you better have WAR and probably 2 healers, and no shammies don't really qualify here as a healer.  At least the named slow for slightly so I can really make an impact in Tipt ~.  <br />
<br />
Then the KodTaz trials really make me even sadder.  Shammies are great for the trash but we can't exactly mez so again groups are better off with a chanter or bard for slower, much better off actually.  Not like my spamming my 1800-3300 heal every 5-6 seconds does jack against unslowable mobs quadding well over 2k...  so we're not a healer.  Everyone knows we aren't effective dps..  and the named are about 6 mobs deep from the zone-in and unslowable so I'm not an effective slower..  even at 8k and almost 1600AC I'll still get one-rounded by a named so we aren't a tank :P .. basically we're useless.  It really sucks to be in the ghetto after playing this game for a number of years, grabbin' 350ish AAs, having multiple drops from time and having no value in the expansion.<br />
<br />
Basically if I was starting a tipt+ group there's really no way I'd actively seek out a shaman for any reason, we just kinda suck.  I'm happy to see the devs stopping by our boards occasionally at least, maybe one of them can roll a time-geared shammy on test and go to tipt and kodtaz and figure out there might be a balance issue.  While they are at it take a fully-time geared pally or SK to tank in the first kodtaz trial..   give them 2 clerics and a shammy for healing.   Knights need some luvin' too. <br />
<br />
I've been playing too long to reroll a warrior, chanter or cleric.  I've tried my best to be patient til now but why would I play a game where my skills are not desirable.  I'm not stupid enough to think an ultimatum would accomplish anything but I can truthfully say if our class doesn't receive an upgrade somewhere that let's me do anything useful in GoD content I'll end up retiring and taking my 40 bucks a month to the strip clubs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">paladins can stun a lot of stuff in tipt. SKs need more love than paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I feel perilously close to the quitting the shaman thing too.  I hope it doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, since my strongest alt is a 65 elemental flagged SK...and they stink in GoD...I'm not at all sure if there's much point in staying in EQ at all if I stop playing my shaman, who I've played for what four years now I guess.  <br />
<br />
This holy trinity concept has REALLY got to go.  Sony seems to be regularly either falling back on the worst of their ideas, like that one, getting incredibly stupid new ideas like mitigating slow, or just ignoring thinking entirely like making no real place for what used to be one of their key classes -- us.  Sometimes I think I could ask the magic 8-ball for better answers on how we could add expansions and deal with game progression.</div></div><hr />
