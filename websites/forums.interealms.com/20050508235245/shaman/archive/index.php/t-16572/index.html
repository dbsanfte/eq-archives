<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read alot of class forums and the prevailing school of thought seems to be &quot;dps&quot; over all others.<br />
<br />
Has not Sony substituted one problem (the holy trinity)<br />
<br />
for another?<br />
<br />
Would it not make more sense to award normal points for successfully completing an adventure and offering a 20% BONUS for completing it within 90 mins.<br />
<br />
This way the people who chose CC classes can play their characters stratigically - which is the way I like to play mine as opposed to zerg fest style.<br />
<br />
Zerg fest just doesn't seem to support any skill in dungeon crawling, it's pull 3-4 mobs and kill em all cause we have to beat the buzzer.<br />
 <br />
This post is not to say &quot;shaman&quot; are not wanted in groups, I get groups and my groups do well. I just think Sony should accomodate all classes, and styles of play, CC is one of the FEW reasons I like to play.<br />
<br />
It's far more cooler to me when 4 mobs are coming in and the enchanter mezzes the adds, or the bard, or the ranger peels off one and roots it off to the side.<br />
<br />
Than everyone grab one mob and kill it, no casters, no med time - no down time, move on to the next zerg fest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have yet to find a useless class in LDoN.  We do just fine if we have an enchie along to mez everything as we get it and we do just fine (with no downtime either) if we just pull in whatever comes and root park or OT it all.<br />
<br />
  It isn't really a DPS is drastically needed business IMO.   Those classes which DO dps do so much now that you can easily afford to take along just 2 of them.   The other classes have all been given tools to use to increase their own DPS.  I think the only extra thing they could do to make it simple for everyone to contribute would be to place some Dire Charmable animals and elementals in each zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I won with a group with only one &quot;dps&quot; class. A ranger.  The rest was a cleric, 2 warriors, shaman, and an enchanter.  We were by no means elemental geared and we finished with 20 minutes to spare.  Did I have to contribute a lot of damage?  You bet!  but it was far from a dps &quot;zerg&quot; fest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Doleck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I beat the buzzer by miles with all types of group make ups. And there are many forms of crowd control.<br />
<br />
The other night we had an SK and a Pally, that was our CC. We pulled four, pally took 2 sk took 2 I got three slowed, they droped quick and we moved on.<br />
<br />
I mean its not like these are pop mobs, you can handle several, slow them use pets, split adds, root. There are many options thats a benefit of ldon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Preface your post with Hard Adventures and I would agree with you Tiorr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shamans are awesome in LDoN, have 2 tanks, 3 dps, and a shaman. Shaman Tigir's a 5 mob pull, and then the Tanks/DPS have it at it while the shaman tosses out heals.<br />
<br />
Shaman mana regen is so massive this is easy enough to keep up, and if you toss in a beastlord for SD/Paragon/Extra slows, a Paladin/SK for their Healing/Mana Tapping, you can do things alot faster then normal groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />
<br />
I've also yet to find a useless class for normal crawls.  I would agree that groups looking for one or two more people on Hard level adventures where they don't have as much &quot;cushion&quot; for succeeding will probably be more discerning in who they pick to round out their groups with.<br />
<br />
On normal for me, it really just doesn't matter as long as half the group has skill and the other half doesn't screw up too badly or too often.  Avoid the rescue/collection missions if the possibility of failure scares the group too much.  Slaughter and low collections are very easy with people who can play their class &amp; adapt their normally used tactics to non-traditional groups.<br />
<br />
Won yesterday with a BST tank &amp; me pulling.  I tanked tonight while slowing &amp; sharing pulling duties with only a 62 druid for heals - NO plate classes in the group (only 2 of us level 65) and we finished our slaughter mission in well under an hour (suffering 2 deaths before winning because the finger-wigglers got caught sitting) and then we stayed to hunt a named and play with our new chest spells.  I had a great time.<br />
<br />
My spouse plays an enchanter, and usually accompanies me.  Despite the lack of dps an enchanter (w/o using CoD) brings, I love having them in my group just for the CC (nice fringe benefit - I don't have to haste!).<br />
<br />
When I create my groups, I get one healer (cleric or druid, would even use another shaman if I found one I knew who didn't mind main healing) and then just add people making sure the average level stays 63.00 or better.  Then we go adventuring.  Playing with wildly non-traditional groups (no clerics or no mezzers, no tanks, etc) has made for lots of fun, and working out the most efficient tactics for these new group dynamics is very interesting and enjoyable for me personally.<br />
<br />
I do think hard level groups will be looking more for dps classes than typical normal groups, but that's been the case somewhat since PoP came out when it comes to hardcore exp grinding.  Some people right now are hardcore adventure point grinding.  Leaderboard competition is pretty fierce.  I'm friends w/ the current #9 on E. Marr, and I hope he doesn't burn out.  I'm having a blast even though I'm nowhere near being in the top #100.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>CelEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You should realise enchanters bring alot of DPS just by casting Clarity... of course if you are more like &quot;lets get some crack from a random chanter and then take someone else instead&quot; it's you who is not really playing it by the rules.<br />
<br />
Also in normal mobs are really easy to charm, and dont forget mages can charm summoned in Tak, and necro's can charm undead.<br />
<br />
I exclusively hunt with guildies, and we are almost all fully elemental equipped... so the normal adventures dont form any challenge at all, we just sometimes do a assassinate one just for quick points because we usually end them withing 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Hard is quite more of a challenge but i like challenges so i'm not complaining.. i only think the reward for completing hard is too low compared to the 0% failure on normal.<br />
<br />
On the DPS or not thing, dont you think it's pretty obvious collector/kill-em-all missions are more suited for a DPS group, while assassinate, rescue is more for a cautious group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">DPS isn't needed in LDoN it's wanted. Simply because a good DPS group allows you to complete a mission in 20-40 minutes, maximizing the AP farming potential. Most people want the maximum amount of APs per day, they don't care about 'comfortable' playing styles. So we pull 4-5 mobs at once.<br />
<br />
An ideal group of uber 65s IMO for doing undead LDoN zone in 20 minutes is something like: bard, sk, monk, nec, nec, pal. A few secondary and tertiary healers can easily keep up with pulls of 3-5 and increase the DPS by far over a primary healer. Wave heals + nec zevfeer + nec shadowbond x2 + bard regen song + self-healing melees (monk mend, sk lifetap, pal elixir) can keep everyone going nonstop easily.<br />
<br />
The mobs are so easy to tank once AE slowed, and die so quickly (30-40seconds) that single target slow is a total waste of mana (UNLESS you pull with it). By the time slow lands, the mob is at 80% and dies 25 seconds later. So instead of target slowing, just AE slow and toss quiescence all over and burn.<br />
<br />
This is all just one way of playing, the type suited to max/min players who are AP farming. You can enjoy LDoN equally using standard tactics but you'll get less APs. Or you can try  hard mission, whch nets more xp+fun, and you cannot blitz through it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like to bring an enchanter for cc on LDoN missions ... it lets the pulls come in much faster, 2-4 and the extras are just locked in camp and dispatched quickly, it's much quicker than setting up single pulls in pretty much any manner and more mana efficient than off-tanking, so that mana can be used for offense.<br />
<br />
If no enchanters are around, I'll actively look for a bard, or necro for an undead-heavy dungeon for the same reason.  Necros are loving life in LDoN, but I wonder if we'll be able to get them out of Mistmoore and Guk.  =)<br />
<br />
BTW, I've done shaman/shaman healing groups before... it works fine.  With SCRM and Crown of Ambivalence, I volunteer to play cleric, then just use Q to heal, and rarely have to pop out an actual heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think there's a huge difference between the Elemental-geared people doing normal missions and others. <br />
<br />
For my L 57 shaman, just pulling 4 or so mobs and carving them all up is NOT an option. His groups need to do CC. My last group was two rangers, two shamans, a rogue, and a wizard. So the CC was just slow and root, but it was needed, if just to keep the healing mana burn lower with two pre-58 shamans doing the healing. I would have dearly loved a chanter or bard instead of one of the &quot;dps&quot; classes we were heavy with. <br />
<br />
My 65 bard has a lot of VT gear, and his guild typically has a little VT gear (I was in a VT guild before this one, and this guild only has 3 Aten clearings under its belt so far). Even with them, all L 65's, mostly with lots of AA, it's not efficient to pull 4+ mobs and just tank them all down. The weaponry isn't Elemental quality (VT drops virtually no weapons, so the weapons are generally TZ/VZ or ssra drops, that sort of thing), and the mobs don't drop as fast as the really uber people are used to. They drop fast, but not 20-30 seconds fast.  With bazaar-geared L 65 casual players, I expect the mobs would die even slower. Then you're talking about NEEDING CC to handle 4 mob pulls, as that 4 mob pull is going to take 4-5 minutes to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They need time limits atm, because if they allowed people unlimited time in a dungeon, they could run into a problem with too many instances being active at once.  I always assumed the time limits were there for technical reasons (to keep the number of instances as low as possible) than out of any attempt to screw the players.<br />

The only useless class in LDoN is the class that your group deems to be useless based on standardized thinking.  That is all.</div></div><hr />

This is my experience as well. However, I think SOE did a good job setting up the times for the latter case. Casual groups only seem to fail when 1 or more people are utterly pathetic at maximizing their classes. I dont see myself as the best shaman, but when I get fed up and go tank MOBs ahead of the group to keep their asses moving something is definately is wrong-- with them.<br />
<br />
However, knowledgeable players will always beat out the timer and always have an advantage over mediocre players. My only advise to SOE would be to break hard into 2 levels, one for VT players and 1 for Elemental players, with pts appropriate to both. I firmly believe that once this LDoN equipment gets more common people are going to need harder challenges.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Clerics were the ones that got stiffed in LDoN, IMO.<br />
<br />
Shammies or a druid + any slower (usually BL) can keep up with healing just fine in most cases, and can add DPS as well.  Clerics really don't have any real DPS to contribute.<br />
<br />
In fact, in a group last night with a necro using group AC/ATK/HP taps and a bard twisting heal song, I only healed the MA 3 or 4 times during the entire adventure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last night I played my non-VT/elemental 65 cleric in a Guk adventure ... it was such a stroke fest I could melee 100% of the time and was FOM 99% of the time.  Against undead I can put out some dsp that would equal a shaman pet at least =) .. plus against undead I get a 1200 point dd for 300 mana AND a 1000+ point dot against undead. <br />
<br />
HUSH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Cleric nukes &gt; our nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fearcazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">LDoN is for everyone. It's just how people want to play it. Some group leaders only like DPS.<br />
<br />
We did 3 lastnight with Shaman, 3 Nercos, war, and a wizard. Granted that we can only do MM and Guk cause necros can't mezz the living but it was still fun. We had 20 minutes left to spare. It's slow but the advantures can still be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>laughingowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Clerics don;t add DPS...<br />
<br />
Against Undead (mistmoore) or if they have their proccing hammer,  Cleric can do rather nice DPS.<br />
<br />
Ever watch a cleric with Boon on go to town with their hammer.  Sure it is not Time equipped rogue level, but it is pretty nice DPS.<br />
<br />
I would still ahve to say warrior seems the hardest hit to me in LDoN.<br />
<br />
Warrior is not needed for normal (haven't tried hard yet) adventures to tank, and generally people will take a knight over a warrior if all else equal for LDoN.<br />
<br />
Type of healer jsut changes dungeon a little.<br />
