<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>seayakin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a lvl 40 ranger on FV and I was looking to start the Raincaller quest.  I first go to the Sanfryd figuring I'd start the quest there but he won't do anything.  So, I camp Princess Joleen in Lfay and when I finally get to meet here and hail her I get nothing (I con indifferent to her).  She just says do not disturb our peacefull village or something.  Do you have to start with the wizard in Felwithe to begin this quest or is it possibly broken?<br />
<br />
On another note, should I just save my money for something better (I think I saw the huntsman bow for 1500-2000pp in the bazaar).  I know I can raise this money faster in Rathe than it will take me to complete the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>akgriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it starts with the elf in the main enchanter guild. his name is Kinool Goldslinger, as for doing the quest ya it's kinda hard and yes there are better bows out there but just the sense of acomplishment in doing this quest as a Ranger is awsome !! just like when ya do the CoF quest and the guy call's you a true Pathfinder  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Philby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Huntsman bow is NO DROP.<br />
<br />
There is a 28/40 bow that is a common drop in Plane of Innovation that should be purchaseable for 500 pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>seayakin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
I'm on Fironie Vie no drop doesn't apply ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kimexe Calmbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you want to start Rain Caller, first you have to do is Trueshot Longbow quest. You don't have to fletch Trueshot, you only need to make Treant Bow staff (which is reward of Trueshot Longbow quest)<br />
When you hand in a combined bag of materials, he gives you a treant bow staff and say something like incarnation. which means enchanted form of Trueshot Longbow, the Rain Caller.<br />
<br />
So you go to Felwithe to meet Kinool, say to him like &quot;what about Rain Caller&quot;. He'll begin to talk about lost bow, &quot;She no longer exist&quot; or so. In the conversation, you'll see that you need gold faerie dust from Princess Joleena. So you go to L.Faydark and wait for her, only to find out that she won't give you the gold dust unless you retrieve her wing back. As she mention about 'big' man and smell of oil,  you have to check Ak'Anon (yep, even gnome is big for faeries). so you have to ....<br />
<br />
well, comprehensive and convenient guide is already available in quest guide in the Glade. (thanks Sean. oh?! it's Sean, just realized it )<br />
<br />
Sure it's rather time consuming quest, but with PoP expansion, it became extremely easy to do Rain Caller solo (you don't need port between continents, only one trip of Boat to purchase Kiola nuts in OoT, for Trueshot)<br />
And 320pp for 5charges of Insta-cast Fire Strike is good to have as backup cannon. (1500DD in 1.5sec, you see?) I've unloaded two Rain Callers in Exe Trial against Prime Executioner, result: resisted 2, partially resisted (about 200) 1, full(300 something) 7. (I'm Lv 61 bytheway.)<br />
I'm now carrying Rain Caller #6.<br />
<br />
P.S, NPC venders will buy your Rain Caller for a few platinums, and sell it for a few hundred PP. greed =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I now have most of the components for this quest. I now just need to go to Kedge Keep for the lock of hair. <br />
<br />
When I asked Kinool about the Trueshot he did reply, however he is apprehensibe to me. Will I still be able to hand in my items to receive the rain caller?<br />
<br />
Recently I did the Treppin quest in PoK with a guildmate even though he was he didn't like me. When I handed him the case I got nothing. Just a message saying something to the effect that I need to build faction.<br />
<br />
Will this happen with Kinool? And if it does, how can I build good faction with him?<br />
<br />
