<br />
I'm currently thinking about duoing with my friend, and we would like to make both a shaman.<br />
<br />
Do you think 2 shaman duoing could be powerful ? Since dots stack now...<br />
<br />
Plus I was thinking that since stoicism/torpor was our greatest healing line (hp/mana ratio-wise), it was too bad to use it only to cut by 50 percent the DPS of the tank. Whereas on a shaman/necro it would be 100 percent efficient with no downside.<br />
<br />
What do you think ? What could we do as far a DPS, crowd control, and dungeon crawling go ? And the most important : would it be FUN to duo two shamans ?<br />

<br />
I've never duo-ed 2 shaman, but I have had an amazing group:<br />
2-61 shm and 2-61 warrior (all epiced). Dammmnnnnnnnn that was fun. We were taking down level 65 mobs. (no not nameds lol)<br />
<br />
I think the nice thing about having another shm in the group is the redundancy on slows. Make a quick &quot;/g Slow resisted&quot; button and the other shm can slow the mob while you're still waiting on refresh.<br />
In the case of multi pull, mobs get slowed faster.<br />
<br />
I think you might encounter some difficulties in the lower levels, but the team would rock post-60.<br />
<br />
Best advice I can give ya: try it see what happens, if it's fun, who cares what folks think?  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>joofntool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i dont think it would be fun tho really.........<br />
<br />
1.)if your more of the caster type i would say one of ya's start a necro and use one of these tactics: dot stack/root nook/agro kite<br />
<br />
2.) if you wanna tank stuff i would duo with a SK <br />
he can tank your mobs once slowed / fear kite / over all good utility man<br />
<br />
this is pre 60 im talking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The question was:  &quot;And the most important : would it be FUN to duo two shamans ?&quot;<br />
<br />
Two yesses (actually, I am the third yes) and a no, so far - obviously it will come down to your level of enjoyment.<br />
<br />
root parking, stacking DoTs, two pets, yeah, there is potential for fun there.<br />
<br />
over the long haul, if getting to the &quot;end game&quot; is important to both of you, then maybe not two shaman.  <br />
<br />
I find it to be a lot of fun to be grouped with another shaman.  Not done a lot of duo, but those i have done were really fun, for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It would work out half decently, but you'd run into problems taking down mobs that are immune to some of our best spells or mitigate our abilities. As powerful as we are, non-rootable mobs, our inability to single pull a lot of mobs, etc etc. I'd suggest one of you go shaman and the other go either shadowknight or beastlord. Shadowknight for snares / feign death and all around good tanking ability while putting out decent DPS, or beastlord if you really enjoy the shaman aspect of casting. Beastlords are a hybrid tank class with shaman spells as well as having excellent DPS and a pet that pwns and the benefit of having a clarity type spell as well. If you'd both like to play casters, I'd suggest shaman / necro combo - there's not much that that combo cannot duo.<br />
<br />
Shamans are an extremely effective solo and group class, but having two in the same group outside of raids is pretty much useless - the reason grouping works (relatively) well in EQ is that you get a broad spectrum of abilities; as each class brings something different to the table. If you both choose shaman you'll miss out on a lot of that diversity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yah I have duoed with a shaman before.  It works just fine actually, just gotta divvy up the responsibilities and get to know each other's playstyle and two uber shammies can REALLY knock some **** down!  It's fun.  Used to duo in Seb with another shaman friend back before PoP.  Used to duo with her in HoH on occasion post PoP.  DoT stacking makes kills swift and relatively painless.  When your combined DoTs are doing 700-800 dmg/tic on a 24000hp mob, it only takes 30 seconds and it's dead hehe.  And then it's med time . . . O wait skip med time, we shamans have canni!  <br />
/snicker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Necro probably brings more to the table than another shaman, but a necro can't toss a fast heal on ya when you get in trouble heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, many great answers so far !<br />
<br />
I see a lot of &quot;You should take a necro instead of a second shaman&quot; and I wonder. From what I read, Shaman/Necro would be more powerful than Shaman/Shaman. But as far as FUN goes ?<br />
<br />
I guess it all boils down to what we find FUN or not. For me :<br />
- Having too many things to check at all time is not fun<br />
- Having very little downtime is FUN :)<br />
- Being able to fight deep in a dungeon is fun<br />
- Managing a pet in addition to the spells is not fun<br />
- Having a lot of hit points and beeing able to tank is fun !<br />
- Having a little margin of error in a fight (ie: charm) is not fun<br />
... etc..<br />
<br />
And sorry for the necros, I know I'm wrong but.... necros seem so WEAK ! They cannot tank, they are constantly losing hps due to their lich line of spells, and they wear ROBES !<br />
<br />
What do you think guys ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And around lvl 60 ? Anyone has ever duoed with another shaman around this level ? 2x Pox, 2x Bane, 2x JBB etc... is it managable ?<br />
<br />
And what about the tactic ? Since dots break our root line of spells, slow and tank would be better ? Or maybe let both pet tank ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you think guys ?<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to dissuade you from going shaman / shaman, but I thought pointing out a few things might aid your decision.<br />
<br />
As far as your list of fun:<br />
<br />
- Necro's have very little downtime, probably nearest to shaman of all the classes in terms of mana regen (without outside help from clarity line of spells)<br />
- Fighting deep in a dungeon would be easier with a necro partner than another shaman - necros can mez mobs and FD pull singles if they have enough room<br />
- Managing a pet isn't terribly tough  ;) <br />
- Necro pet can tank very well with a slowed mob ... at 56+ the shaman can tank so the necro pet can backstab ... at 60+ in PoP you won't want to tank <br />
<br />
What are your long term goals for these characters? That would help us give you some advice. A shaman / shaman duo would be fine if you just want to have fun and play casually, but if you plan on making it to the end game you're going to run into problems along the way - most notably, trying to find a good guild with a spot for 2 shamans at the same time is going to be rough. If you ever want to group with others you'll have to do so on your own, as most groups don't want two shamans in the same group.<br />
<br />
Once again, I'm not trying to bag on you, but I can't overstate enough the importance of diversity in EQ (except for 3 rogues in a group which is teh win!~ ). Overlapping skill sets make us all the more powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aelyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What do you think guys think?<br />
<br />
I think you grossly underestimate necros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">One more thing I thought I should point out: if you do plan on playing the game up into the 60's, the two of you are going to need a TON of plat to buy 2x copies of every shaman spell. Even with Torpor and Malo now researchable, they still go for quite a price (Malo in particular is still at 100k+ on my server, while Torpor has dropped to 30-40k).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I regularly tank at 60, although not in PoP hehe.  Actually yes, in PoP I tank all the time when soloing so having two shaman there (one to heal and one to tank) is feasible.  However, necro's get a great line of group spells that heal you over time when there is a mob in camp.  They have amazing utility at the upper levels and their pet is obviously far superior to ours.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the pain you will feel when both of you hit 60 and are looking for Torpor/Malo/Pox etc.<br />
<br />
I say go Shaman/Necro, you'll have much more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can't comment on the high-end game (only lvl 48), but if you do play a shammy, TANK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!!  I've been playing for over 8 months, and am still under 50, so these guys that level from 1-50 in a month know something that i dont know.  for some reason, our dots dont mix too well with out root, but they do stack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, it seems to be a real conscensus : better off with a necro than another shaman.<br />
<br />
Regarding our goal in Eq, I think we intend to reach level 60. I don't know if it is really better after level 60. From what I read, necros become a lot better at 61 than 60. But once again, game past lvl60 seems much more BORING than pre-60.<br />
<br />
Also we don't intend to be in a guild at all. We'll mainly duo, and if someone is alone, we'll take him in our group if he wants to. We'd like to travel a lot, and not really stay in the same zone again and again just to level. We'd like to see a lot of dungeons, and not only the zone-lines ;) We also are two formers eq players who only played meleers.<br />
<br />
That's why I wonder now if Shaman/Meleer combo would not be more appropriate ? Also, what kind of tactics with a necro partner in a dungeon ? You cannot fear there, and pets cannot keep aggro, can they ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My husband and I both play shaman. We usually have a great time grouping.

<br />
<br />
Genine, what kind of technique you use at level 60 ? Root then dot or just slow then tank then dot ? Can you go deep into dungeons too ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have actually had more fun at 60 now than I can remember. Being 60 opened up so many doors as far as being able to single pull. In the old world we use slow and tank (not much to tank compared to PoP!). Funny how the mob will switch between me and my husband depending on who just cast their dot :p<br />
<br />
As far as dungeons go, the only one that I can think that we have been to at 60 is Velks. Seems we only use root/rot anymore is when we didn't stop and get a KEI or just dont want to go run and get one. We spend most of our time in the Grey, FG, CT and PoI. We are both staying at 60 and just having fun racing each other to Canni V AA until the rest of the guild catches up to our level. 13 AA's to go!<br />
<br />
In PoI we almost always do root/rot method. Mobs just hit too hard and until either of us gets Torpor, Stoicism just wont cut it!<br />
<br />
Oh yeah!! We do go to sebilis sometimes and there we do use root/rot. Not having snare can be deadly in places like seb!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Try shadowknight and shaman duo.  Should be perfect for you guys, and pretty easy.

Either class can solo, and either class is a welcome addition to a group.  Combined they make one of the most powerful and adaptive duo combinations.</div></div><hr />

I know some of the best times I had while playing, were back in the first year, when a shaman friend and I ( a wizard at the time) grouped almost constantly. Though most the fun I think came from us just being friends.<br />

<br />
You got me here Landragoran ! How did you know we wanted to be Iksars ?<br />
<br />
So far I have had great advise from you all. Some of you think two shamans duoing can be really fun, and not too hard to play, using basically the same technics as when soloing. Some others would rather take another meleer and then I suppose warrior, shadowknight and paladin would be all  a good choice. And some think the better duo with a shaman would be with a necro, but then again playing a necro requires good caster skills and we are both former old age meleers.<br />
<br />
I think I'm even more lost than before now :)<br />
<br />
So far we narrowed our choice to : Shaman plus <br />
- paladin or warrior or ranger (meleers)<br />
- mage or necro (casters)<br />
- shaman or beastlord<br />
<br />
So if any of you have a duo exeprience with one of this combo, feel free to share !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">65 shaman with 50+aa, 65shaman with 45 aa and a 65 sk with whoknows howmany aa and we smoke as a group.<br />
<br />
also, and this was rare..but try this group sometime, 4shaman , a bard and a cleric ahhaha quite the fun group lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Not to confuse the issue further, but have you thought about a cleric/shaman duo? My wife and I duo a lot and while it's not as efficient as some of the other duo's listed below, it can be a powerful combo (esp against undead). <br />
<br />
Some of the obvious (and not so obvious) benefits:<br />
<br />
a) rez of course.<br />
<br />
b) healing, esp the heal over times which are low agro heals and great while canni'ing.<br />
<br />
c) lull/pacify line which has either been changed over the years or has always been more powerful than we remember. We've been able to split mobs in a lot of different areas that even my monk has trouble with.<br />
<br />
d) new cleric pet and hammer - my wife loves the chance to get away from sit/ch/sit/ch and mix it up. Once a mob is slowed, she makes a pretty good tank and with the hammer procs, yaulp and stuns holds agro pretty damn well.<br />
 <br />
e) undead dots/nukes - situational but fairly powerful. <br />
<br />
f) ac/hp buffs that stack with ours as well as a reverse dmg shield and lower casting time buff <br />
<br />
I'm sure I've forgotten a few things, but if you both want to try casters out this duo might be an option. <br />
<br />
One last thought, we have friends that we group with almost constantly, but I'm fairly certain if we walked into a zone and /ooc'ed shaman/cleric lfg, our chances would better than normal to find one. <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp's. <br />
<br />
As everyone else has stated, find a duo that you like. Shaman/anything will take you a long way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>rosco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Not to confuse the issue further, but have you thought about a cleric/shaman duo?<br />
<br />
(...)<br />
<br />
As everyone else has stated, find a duo that you like. Shaman/anything will take you a long way.<br />
<br />
Yes I agree with you completely. At first we both wanted to play the most &quot;powerful&quot; duo including a shaman. So everyone pointed us to shaman/necro. Then I thought &quot;Cool ! we have our duo ! Plus we can both be Iksars ! (not sure why, but it actually matters :) )&quot;<br />
<br />
Then I asked her : &quot;Do you want to be a necro ?&quot;. She said no and asked me the same thing. I answered no too. Why ? Because it seems veeeeery difficult to play a necro well. Constantly losing hps, tons of things to take care of at the same time etc...<br />
<br />
So currently we're really looking for the most FUN combo ie: the one we would enjoy the most playing. And I think I pretty have an answer now : the FUN part will come from us, and not the classes we'll be playing.<br />
<br />
Anyway keep giving me examples or great duos :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Necro does tend to be a bit complicated to play, they can do a lot of things but not all at the same time. They're the most powerful duo in the game, imo. <br />
<br />
For a more laid back approach, I'd go shaman/sk. Tends to start out kinda weak but it gets better the higher you get, especially if you want to do dungeons since SK can feign pull and snare.</div></div><hr />
