<br />
Click ME (http://lucy.fnord.net/spelllist.html?searchtext=ultradeath) <br />
<br />
Click the top one first then click the others in order.<br />
<br />
I thoguth it was funny and while i do know that lucy can be wrong sometimes it's right most of the time.<br />
<br />
And no hard numbers do not ruin the game they allow us to see just how balanced we really are :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's interesting to note that a designer with access to the mechanics of the game chose to buff Str/Sta/AC and resists.<br />
<br />
Makes you think that perhaps we're on the right track about the relative uselessness of other stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All kinds of silly stuff in the spdat.eff, a lot of which was early testing mechanics.  STR, STA, and AC are usually applied becuase testing dealing damage, suffering damage, and surviving damage are the 3 things that would cause the most problems if they got out of whack.  Hence why LU also includes things like 20001 hp/tick regen.<br />
<br />
One of my favorite spdatt.eff lines is the cast on you message on :<br />

<br />
Although this one is mirthful, as well:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All Your Base Are Belong To Us  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2009&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
theres tons of them out there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Does anyone actually know how the spdat.eff file works?  Like obviously they can put in fake values for spells that don't exist, but what about spells like for instance Torpor?  Could the devs change the spdat.eff entry for torpor to make it a self only 1 point DD that says &quot;Stop reading the spdat file&quot; while still having torpor work as normal (healing you for 300 hp a tick for 3 ticks, etc.)?<br />
<br />
*Edited on 5/13 to correct 300*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's developer bulls.h.i.t<br />
<br />
basically they are angry that ppl read things like lucy which happens to be right MOST of the time.<br />
A mob casts a spell on u and u can't figure out what its doing to u?<br />
type name of spell in lucy and fing out.<br />
then u adapt by wearign proper resists or countering with a spell etc.<br />
They hate that so they add random bs in the dat file however spells that are curently live are workign the way lucy says they are.<br />
Wherever usee exact numbers they are ususaly the way they work in game but for splurt type spells it says thing like unknown formula etc those we are not that sure.<br />
They are adding stuff liek this to make us think the data we read is false. If it was nobody woudl ready lucy.<br />
Lucy is not 100% right always but it is most fo the time.<br />

<br />
yes torpor and q are 300hp/tick :D</div></div><hr />
