<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anybody know of a utility or UI mod that'll let me see maps without having Ykesha expansion? I refuse to download the expansion and I can't find it in stores anywhere.<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can't find it in stores because it was download only.  Although for $30 you can just buy EQ platinum and also get any other expansions you may have missed.  As for a utility you can get ShowEQ, but only if you don't mind cheating and have a linux computer handy to run it.  The only other suggestion I have is to by an #@)$U$# printer.  That's what we did in the old days when all we had was eqatlas.com, and it worked well enough then.</div></div><hr />
