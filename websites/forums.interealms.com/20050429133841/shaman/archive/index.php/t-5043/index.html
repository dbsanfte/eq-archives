<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Santero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a newbie player and I started playing EQ with a Shaman troll (Inooruk follower). I want to know what is the best hunting ground for my lvl/class/race (I don't want to spend hours raising any faction). I haven't any twinked gear. Can I solo at lvl 10? :confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks for you replys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In South Ro, on the grass there are a lot of Orc camps. Three of these had an orc spawn far enough away from the camp that it could be pulled without getting the others. With the enhanced regeneration of a Troll, I was able to pull the one from the camp nearest the zoneline back to the swamp, then run to camp #7 on EQ Atlas map. its southwest  of the Wizard portal, and pull that one. Then run east to camp #9, and pull that one to where the desert starts. By the time I'd done that and run back and medded back to full, the first camp near the zone had spawned again. I did this with my lvl 9 spells, leather armor, and a plain old spear. No twinkage necessary.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Run to Neriak, get bound there (soulbinder not far from zone-in, on left as you walk through the first gate.  Once bound, head back out, turn right, and follow the wall until you get to Lavastorm.  Once in Lavastorm, follow the right wall around to the entrance of Najena.  There are 3 mobs in the ent that will give you good exp and decent loot for the level.  Once you hit 15 there, try to get a port in Lavastorm to Nexus.  Don't whine about it, but let them know you are a true newbie.  I generally port true newbies for free with my druid.  From 15-24 you'll want to live in Paludal Caverns.  Good loot, CRAZY exp.  Having probs myself at 24, can't figure where to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Najena is a wonderful place to hunt because hardly anyone goes there anymore.  If you can find it, and survive, I recommend it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have PoP, use the Shar Vahl book to go to Shadeweaver's Thicket and fight the bandit/poacher camps. You wont have to worry about faction with Vah Shir they love everyone. Not to mention there is a bank, trainer and a few merchants in the same zone. You can also try the bugs in Paudal close to Hollowshade Moor. Just use the book, zone into Shar Vahl, run around the city til you hit the other bridge (that is the hollowshade zone bridge) zone into hollowshade and run right along the wall til you see a tunnel by the lake. I soloed there from 10-15.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Like he said above, if you don't have PoP or even SoL like me, go to Lavastorm and have a blast.  I set up camp at the Najena zone and did pretty well soloing.  I pulled mostly firedrakes and stone dervishes, with the occasional blue or black fire elemental thrown in.  Loot was decent, and I made good money.  And, as luck would have it, I was able to sell all the bile I looted from the fire drakes to a rogue for 20 plat (stack of 10).<br />
<br />
Tomorrow it's back to camping orcs, though.  Just hit 13 and I need those friggin' factions.</div></div><hr />
