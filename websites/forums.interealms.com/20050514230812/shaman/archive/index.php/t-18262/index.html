<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Skip to the end if ya want to see what the post is about.. Here's the details:<br />
<br />
I got home last night around 7 pm, normal for me(I work till 6 or later.) I logged on, went to PoFear to solo some for my bard's epic whip from amygdalin knights(2 boxed with a friend's warrior). Went fine till I got to around the temple. I ended up agroing during a scout about 10 amy knights/warriors and a FF. I trained those around on the warrior for a while at the NE corner, just running in circles. Pulled 1 at a time off on Einnod and soloing them. Went well until I somehow got a glare lord add. Ughhh there went all my buffs. Decided at this time that it was time to retreat, so the warrior died and Einnod gated. Ran the warrior back and got a corpse summon from a SK that was in the zone(they were killing dracho.) used a gate potion and then logged einnod back on for raid time. We're doing reflags this week, and first on our list was AD. We killed him without troubles, and went to HoHb for MM.<br />
<br />
It's close to 9:00 now, and I'm starting to get tired, but figured I'd stay till the end of MM and skip TT(last on our list.) Some of the people decide that they can't figure out how to get to HoH, and we end up sitting there for about 30 minutes. And remember, if you're tired and sitting there doing nothing, it wears on ya. So I'm now dead tired, and mention I want to log. They say we're about to move so I go ahead and stay, then about 10 minutes later we start moving. We clear to the froggie dude, and end up killing him but wiping on adds that came with him(they agroed early, weren't ready) My corpse pops in GY before we can rez, and so that adds a little time to the CR. I get a rez and say that I'm extremely tired and want to log, but the slave driver raid leader shaman says he needs me, so I go ahead and stay on, knowing it's a mistake. And you can see where this is leading. 15 minutes later, we start clearing again to MM. We get into his room and wait for repops so we can do it without adds(although we could have killed him before repops) I say that I'm gonna get up and walk around while waiting so that I can wake up.. and I end up wandering over to my bed.<br />
<br />
Oops :(  I woke up this morning and went over to my computer to find that I had been disconnected, so I have no idea what happenned after I fell asleep, whether or not I'm dead or alive, etc. I'm probably gonna be dead with a rez timer expired now, but we'll see.<br />
<br />
So, a word to the wise: Don't stay up for a raid if you're tired!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh my. Good stuff. That adds a little chuckle to the end of my work day.<br />
<br />
I have thought about building some sort of brace that would attach to my desk and support my neck when I start swaying back and forth late at night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tuibumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's funny you should post this because just last night I happened to fall asleep at the controls myself waiting for a named to spawn. I woke up with a naked barbarian staring at me. I figured I deserved it though considering my sleep was induced by Miller Lite =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Okies.. I logged back on last night to see what had happenned, and I guess I went LD about 5 minutes after I fell asleep, cause I was still alive :) So I logged back hoping that there was no mobs withing agro range of me, to no avail. I immediately agroed 2 wrulans in the MM prep room. So I figure I'll get as close to the exit as I can so my CR will be that much easier. and I found out that the agro range in hohb is about as small as pota ;) I was able to run straight between most of the wrulans without agroing them(till my train caught up). I was able to make it all the way to the exit with 1200 hps left. I zoned out, and immediately got crowned by the 4 mobs at that zone line :)<br />
<br />
But it makes for a great story! and an easy rez</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One time I fell asleep in a Karnars Castle group, my group finally petitioned to get me diconnected which the guide couldn't do so he moved me to the corner in the left moat. This was back in the day when lots of people used to level in KC. Amazingly I was still alive when I woke up several hours later, just standing there, buffs all gone but alive. Another couple times I woke up at Druid/wizard gate points as my group gated me there. Good stuff. :)</div></div><hr />
