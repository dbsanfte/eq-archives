<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know if AA's are affected by Tnargs? Imaging having SCR and SCRM. 1800 heal. <br />
<br />
If QB affects it, that would be sweet. Add in healing AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If it's a direct heal, I doubt Quickbuff or SCRM would affect it although SCM might.   The healing AAs might work as well as focus items like spell haste IV and improved healing IV.<br />
<br />
But if anyone has actual first hand knowledge, I'd be interested to know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Assuming its like a normal direct heal. Healing Adept and Healing Gift should work on it, as well as heal4 focus and pop improved healing crits.<br />
<br />
Really assuming the above this can become a complete replacement for Kraags mending(for 50 more mana) given its sweet fast cast time. Finally might make training the healing based AA skills worthwhile. <br />
<br />
What glori said.. some confirmation please! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">According to lucy's it has the same flags as chloroblast so  it *should* be affected by AA healing skills, Healing Gift, Healing Adept etc. don't have first hand knowledge.. hope i can get this spell soon so i can mem it instead of chloro and KM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have the spell and I hope to ding 62 tonight or tomorrow.  So I can let you know if it works with healing gift.  I am assuming and praying it does.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">is effected by spell haste, 3.2 cast w/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AS expected, QB has no effect on it. Also it works with the BoF spell from clerics. <br />
Sorry I have no healing AA's to test with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jargas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just dinged 63, now to get this spell instead of every other<br />
one so far... bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harpn Guinness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have healing gift 2 and healing adept 1 and I crit heal for 2365 with this spell. Nice when I'm trying to keep my cleric from getting beat into the ground. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First off, it's not 'are aa's affected by tnarg'?  it's 'is Tnarg affected by aa's'<br />
<br />
Second, our aa skills are described fairly well on the aa screen; IE dont ask or hope that qb3 affects tnarg.  Tnarg is not a buff so it's stupid to think that.  Use your brain, that's what it's there for.<br />
<br />
Think, and you gaming will be more effective.<br />
<br />
Healing AA's _do_ affect Tnarg, as does healing focus IV.  I know because I have Tnarg and all of these things.<br />
<br />
Channeling focus and spell casting mastery prolly do affect it, unless bugged in some way (verant is known for this in the past).<br />
<br />
I can't think of other aa's that we have that directly affect Tnarg in some way.</div></div><hr />

I think most people assumed that healing AA's would work, but it doesnt signify you being an idiot because you arent sure that they will on an untested spell. Particularly in regards to what they did with our (in)complete heal like spell.<br />
<br />
For all we knew VI may have decided that allowing it to be a normal heal(and a damn good one.. up there with supernal remedy) would be overpowered for (what they consider) an already overpowered class, and not permitted it to make use of AA.<br />
<br />
Hell, the dog thats whipped enough tends to duck its head and dodge the hand that goes to pet it, much like peoples apprehension on how this spell works for us.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Im stoked about this spell.. finally a reason to not consider healing crits a wasted aa.</div></div><hr />
