<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know if anyone else has come up with this idea yet or not.<br />
<br />
I thought of an interesting way for us to get some better DPS, without crimping on anyone elses style, and without letting us use our &quot;superior mana regen&quot; to out DPS and out last everyone<br />
<br />
An explosion DoT<br />
<br />
Basically, it would work kind-of like a buff, that added no hps, but when it wore off it would deal X damage. (The way your max hp goes down when Virtue wears off, except this time it would subtract from current not max)<br />
<br />
An example might be:<br />
<br />
Pus infestation:<br />
resist: disease -40<br />
cast time: 6sec, recast 2.5 sec<br />
450mana<br />
duration: 3 ticks<br />
When wears off Pus Infestation deals 1600 damage<br />
<br />
I dunno how best to balance it, but you get the idea<br />
<br />
this way we couldn't really nuke something to death, because restacking the &quot;DoT&quot; would actually be WORSE since it would lengthen the damage time.  however, the &quot;buff&quot; or &quot;DoT&quot; wouldn't generate ago until the damage was dealt, instead of every tick, and the damage would occur in 3 ticks instead of 5 - 11.  *and* we could do other stuff in the mean time, like heal or canni ect.  We could still drop this on multiples, however, as I said, you couldn't use this is burn out a monster.  <br />
<br />
Let me know what you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have that already.  Its called tears of saryrn.  3 &quot;tick&quot; rain spell that does up to a base damage of 1950 .  But yeah, I'd love a buffer single target &quot;nuke&quot; with a -40 resist check against disease:)  Although I see little reason why it has to wait 3 ticks to go off.  Might as well just be a normal nuke.<br />
<br />
Other ideas rather than instant damage have been dots like splurt that run backwards.  1200 per tick, 1000, 800, 600, 400, 200, done., etc.. So the majority of the dmg is done up front.<br />
<br />
Or dots that only use mana per tick.  Initial cost 0, but drains a certain amount each tick. That way, you can stack a couple and get good per tick dmg, but not waste mana when the mob dies in 3-4 ticks.<br />
<br />
Lots of good ideas have been passed around for years.  The trouble is, SOE seems very content to just up our standard spell lines by x% each expansion, never making any major changes to the way that dmg is dealt by each class.  About the biggest change I can recall in terms of a classes way of dealing damage was when they gave rangers EQ/AM3 and they all started using a bow instead of melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know, Ungkor ... with this you wouldn't have to worry about hard-coded resists, mobs moving out of the AoE or grabbing aggro from the MT. I quite like the idea of a 'carpet bombing' rotation on raid MoBs, where each shammy could cast this as the preceding one detonates. We'd be like anti-clerics ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doesn't seem like the spell's damage would be affected by Focus or AA.  Neat idea, but that would seem to gimp it a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I'm quite sure that they're regretting that even today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shorter dots, with a -check I think is the only way to go. Any decent damage there going to give us from now on is going to have a long recast delay, so after we slow mob we only have so much time before our group rips them up if we have to malos too 5 seconds plus the refresh plus the dot casting time and the mob is almost dead.</div></div><hr />

Ya know that's prolly right... what would be better would be 1 sec cast time, with a 30 second recast.  It would tick for 2 secs then deal damage... so we could drop it on inc. not pull agro, then malo and slow like usual, and then the damage would hit the MoB after the MT had clear agro.  We could only use it once per fight, but it would be pretty much guarenteed to do full damage....  But ... actually we wouldn't need the recast do to the nature of the DoT...<br />
<br />
Infestation<br />
Casting Time: 1sec<br />
Recast: 6secs<br />
Resist: Disease -40<br />
Duration: 3ticks<br />
When wears off: 1600damage<br />
Mana: 450<br />
<br />
If it had a lower cast time, then we could cast it on inc or after malos without interrupting  our flow too much, but adding a decent amount of damage.  Personally, while I understand all this talk of being better healers, I'd rather be able to add some more DPS to a group...<br />
I see this as a level 60ish spell, I'd like a full line though lower levels too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a delayed nuke,, hmmm possible but i doubt soe would fall for it.<br />
<br />
