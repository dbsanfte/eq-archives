It is all a Scam<br />
I was sitting here reading all the posts when it hit me; the new smarter NPC(s) are just the first step in making the game more tedious and causing additional player frustration.<br />
WHY? <br />
<br />
To make people leave EQ!  In a recent poll, over 70% of the people said that they would not leave EQ for EQ2 because of all the time they had put into the game (EQ). So Instead VI is going to make EQ so problematical that when EQ2 comes out people are going go try it out instead.<br />
<br />
Now, why would they do this; it seems like VI would be shooting themselves in the foot?  Who would want to play EQ2 when they screwed up so bad on the first one?  Because, if everyone is still playing EQ1 then it will cost them money (server upkeep, staffing, updates, etc…)!  If they were to lose half of the people playing EQ now from being so unintelligent, they could attempt to discontinue EQ and not have to spend all that money keeping it going and instead focus on EQ2.<br />
