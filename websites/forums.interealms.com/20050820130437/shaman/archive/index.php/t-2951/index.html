<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeydin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well im lvl 10 now, gonna get 11 soon.  I am curious, I heard you get more exp if you fight in dungeons.  I was curious if this is true and if i should go to one? I heard maybe Najena?  But I dont know really.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dungeons DO have an XP bonus associated with them, anywhere from 10 - 30 percent as far as I can remember.<br />
<br />
My advice: GO to the dungeons!! Now only will you get more XP, you will also learn how to fight in them early - which will save you many deaths later on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure that ALL dungeons have an exp bonus.  Most do, however.  You can usually find the percentage posted somewhere on the web if you look hard enough.  Najena, I believe, has a fairly good bonus.<br />
<br />
Corpse recoveries are a pain if you die in dungeons, but . . . it is best to start learning to play in them early.  You'll miss SoW :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's good experience but stay near the entrance for a few more levels.  Starting at level 18 Druids and Wizards get a lesser evacuate type spell that will put everyone safely at the entrance to the dungeon.  Clerics will get a 0% exp res which will bring a character who is bound all the way across the map to their body.  Necros get a low-level summon corpse spell to get that one body you just can't fight to.  These are all very good things and are skills to learn that will make you a better player in the end run.<br />
<br />
Sure, it's easier to run around the &quot;Idiot Circle&quot; of Oasis, Lake of Ill Omen, OT, DL, KC, Train! but you'll be able to handle yourself in the high-end dungeons better when you get there.  Take it as a matter of pride :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well I'm a tad off 30 now and I been doing nothing but dungeons since early levels. heres where I have adventured...<br />
<br />
7ish - 14:   <br />
Qeynos Catacombs - start off with thugs then move on to Smugglers. They are social so you may have to ask a higher level to break up the spawn or duo with someone. (Smugglers duo is great experience 3 seperate smugglers camps in there).<br />
<br />
15 - 20<br />
Paludal Caverns - There is a 3 mushroom spawn quite close to the Shadoweaver Thicket zone each on a 5min timer. No aggro mobs near the spawn..but do stay away from the Fiends ;)<br />
<br />
20-25<br />
Paludal Caverns - I did a lot of grouping at these levels at the Recond Bandit camps...Best experience I have ever seen. I usually was the primary tank and puller at these camps as there were rarely any warriors / SKs around.<br />
<br />
25-30<br />
Echo Caverns - Needlites (See the Hunting Guide 20-30 for info on these) http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2806<br />
<br />
All of these dungeons have an Zone Exp Modifier and as well as rewarding with great experience and some decent loot, they also offer an insight into the many varying roles the Shaman can take on: Slower, Healer, Tank, Crowd Control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldn't recomend Najena. I rarely see people exping in there and the mob level ranges are fairly mixed making it hard to solo. There are a few entrance spawns but they respawn slowly.<br />
<br />
If I were you I'd look into Blackburrow or possibly Unrest. Unrest courtyard has lots of beetles that are about your level and the exp is pretty good. I usually level all my non-evil characters there between 10-12 (gear dependent) to 17. Unrest is train heaven though so beware.<br />
<br />
If you really want good exp go to paludal(sp) on luclin. You'd need help getting to the lower level side (invis) but the exp there is awsome.<br />
