<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beleg Cuthalion</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(This is my apology for the long-long post below, I’m sorry, reading the other posts sparked me)<br />
<br />
Now what I'm hearing is a lot of talk about being a traditional Ranger.  And if you're like me, and devour Tolkien's literature , then you want a traditional ranger.  The sad thing is, EQ, and for that matter technology isn't advanced enough to make a world where we can actually become a person and role-play our characters, and be massively multiplayer at the same time.  If I thought we could, then I would ask for EQ2 to stay in development for many more years, until they could create landmasses with actual distances to travel and lands that are beneficial and hard to access, and separate cultures that rarely mingle.  That way getting lost in a forest would be perilous, and a Ranger would be necessary as a guide figure, or a hunter, someone that knows the way. (Instead people look for a wizard to teleport them to the nearest city.)  Also in that way, you could actually get away into places that aren’t infested with the games society and that are actually beneficial.  <br />
<br />
Most of us here like the idea of a ranger being the character that gets out and goes the distances and maps the lands, and EQ has to make it possible for rangers to do that and not allow the traveling stamina we must have to leak into every other class.   Now that leaves a problem, what do the other classes do if we are the ones out in the wild.  Well here EQ is going to have to develop structured societies and create methods and ways to make other players want to role-play, and role-play different classes.  And that is the problem with role-playing not only Ranger, but just about any class in EQ.  EQ is more Massively Multiplayer than it is Role-Playing, and every thing that is to be revealed is done with several people, and I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that maybe being your own Ranger just might prove more interesting than a nice guild and raids all the time. Maybe we actually do want a different world in which to role-play the characters that you read in books, or at least do the things they do without relying on 50 other people. But in that same aspect, I would want the game to be massivly multiplayer, and have players dependant on other players (depending on class) just not so much as the current EQ is.<br />
<br />
 So for the ranger in EQ2, I want all of the things that have been spoken in this thread, and more.  But I also think we must realize that EQ2 will have to take a larger leap in gaming than the original EQ had done.  A leap large enough to keep people addicted to a game without making them become addicted together and allow more room for the RPG aspect of EverQuest than the Massively Multiplayer one.</div></div><hr />

I totally like that idea. I think that is not too uber to get early levels and such, but good enough to run when you got a train/huge mob on your a**. But you also have to think about class balancing. We get dual wield, they get those specials, just all in the balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celadreal</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to see a ranger as a ranger, give melee to warriors, they can keep it, give archery to archers or rogues they can keep it. To be honest I would like to see what rangers really are come out in EQ2 rangers were not created as rogues of the wilds, nor as warriors of the wilds, rangers were created as rangers as soon as someone says rangers are the best dual wielders, archers etc. they are wrong, nor are they are a jack of all trades. When rangers were created they were something unique, with talents that no other class had, a ranger is in full control of his surroundings. Expert tracker, trap setter, hole finder. you could not lose a ranger in the wilds, nor could you catch one. Rangers are given moderate melee and ranged ability to compliment their hunting and awareness. I am saying this based on the first place you could ever make your own ranger and they did not have any extravagant combat abilities, High archery? I dont need that, all I want from EQ2 is rangers to be given moderate mixes of melee, archery, and stealth. I would like to see rangers focus more on tracking, ambushes, pit traps, and the like for they were speciallized in these abilities to be unique and so no one would compare them to fighters or rogues, they are just ranger, not warrior of the wild, not rogue of the wild, just ranger.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanithalis</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rangers are so widely defined by different people that nobody can truly say THIS is what a Ranger is supposed to be. If you look at all the different portrayed Rangers you will see the vastness of their skills. Strider was a true outdoorsman who was both good with bow and sword, but great with neither. Legolis who WAS a Ranger was a master bowman but also adept with short blades. Drizzt Do'Urden was a Master of the blade and rarely used his bow, but he was profficient with it. <br />
<br />
Each person should be ABLE to establish themselves as the Ranger THEY want to be not the template of what one developer sees a Ranger as. There should be unlimited choices as to what you can make your ranger, and how you can customize him to your expectations. That is the only true way EVERYONE will be happy playing ANY class is for them to be able to make them whatever THEY choose.<br />
<br />
In accordance with the post I would like to see just that. No guidelines or restrictions on how to make a Ranger, but just being able to create my own unique person to role play. I would also like to see armor and weapon choices.........not a set of armor that is generically fit onto every ranger in the game or a weapon set that is generically placed in every rangers hands. True choice where weapons and armor are unique in their origins and makeing. A person could contract a powerful wizard to create a weapon of power, or do a quest that results in a unique plan to create such a weapon. There are many variables , but the idea of monsters droping the same weapon over and over in just not my idea of how equipment should be handled.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celadreal</div><div class="date">02-18-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mostly agree with you Tanithalis, however there is one big flaw to your idea, if a ranger is allowed to be too variable the title ranger looses meaning. In other words if being a ranger is too varied we basically have just warriors, rogues, druids, beastlords, shamans, clerics, paladins, maybe even shadowknights running around without their proper class name and instead are called rangers. In other words if what a ranger is becomes too stretched there will be no such thing as a ranger. However as I said before. I do believe a few aspects of a ranger should be greatly varied. Weapons and skill with weapons, rangers should not be steriotyped into certain weapon class, some may say  &quot;but you only see them using swords.&quot; I would simply say, &quot;How many people in quasi-medeival stories do you see not using swords?&quot;<br />
the ansewer of course is, with racial exeptions, not many. Rangers should probably be seen with several different types of armor but never plate armor. Spells for rangers should probably vary according to games, however should stay constant within the game.  Stealth should vary according to the player or the armor, this part is the most inconstant thing amongst rangers. The only thing that should be constant through games and books alike is the ranger's affinity to the wilds, no mattter what they should be trackers, woodsmen (or women heh) no enemy should be able to lose them as long as the enemy remains upon land. After all upon their creation, this was the rangers gift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">earthenfist</div><div class="date">02-22-2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take out the warrior class and make it a base class. when verant made the warrior they had to make it tougher than the other melee classes and that's what messed rangers up as well as the other fighters. What they didn't realize is that all fighters are warriors. What makes you a warrior is the path you choose in life and when walking that path you do so with fearlessness and impeccability. <br />
<br />
My point - it is not high hp, ac and weapon abilities that define a warrior or lack thereof to define a ranger. A ranger IS a warrior and like all warriors they are masters of the weapons and trades they choose. It is merely the trades and weapons and path that they choose that makes them a ranger. Am I starting to make since?<br />
<br />
Another thing that defines the type of warrior is the race. Each race has it's own &quot;warrior culture.&quot; Think about the real world and how their enviroment and upbringing affects their &quot;warrior culture.&quot; The native american tribes, the cletics, the mongols, etc... Now think about the races in everquest and any rpg, we all know that an elven warrior and troll warrior are totally different and both have advantages and disadvantages due to their racial abilities. however in everquest 1, only the troll has the advantage. This is why trying to define the warrior as a class will never work (ever read a book where trolls wore platemail?), and I should say that trying to define the ranger as a class is also folly.<br />
<br />
So what defines a ranger, IMO it is a warrior that is trained mostly in the outdoors. His skills, armor and weapons are chosen to be the most suitable for his &quot;home turf,&quot; and for his unique racial abilities. Not all Rangers should be primary archers and knife fighters (legolas). A wood elf would choose these skills because his keen eyesight make him an excellent marksman and his inherint speed would make him an excellent knife fighter.<br />
<br />
Not all rangers should be Aragorn either for the same reasons. <br />
<br />
So, getting to the point, what would be a good template for creating a ranger in everquest II?<br />
<br />
I would say one that allows diversity in reguards to race and culture.<br />

They announced months ago that they were using a class branching system. Warrior is already base class from which you can build into ranger, paladin, shadowknight, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">earthenfist</div><div class="date">02-22-2003, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well I saw fighter as a base class and assumed warrior would be a main class. But if not then I am glad.<br />
<br />
Other thoughts on EQ2 rangers:<br />
<br />
Most utility spells should be innate skills instead like camo and speed.<br />
Archery should be useful pre-60, and hopefully not just for rangers but for anyone who wants their character to be an archer.<br />
Pets are a good idea but not if the ranger ends up being dependent on them. <br />
<br />
I am also hoping that a lot of skills and feats from traditional rpgs make their way into the new EQ somehow, eg. weapon finesse, point blank shot, improved two hand fighting.<br />
<br />
That's it for now, going to read up some more before I say too much...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argonui</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I, like many of you, am a huge Tolkien fan.  With that being said, i want to roleplay a Ranger as stated in previous responses.  Some of you have stated you do not want Rangers to be varied otherwise you lose the meaning of a Ranger.  However, you can have base Ranger skills and then let each person decide on a set of enhanced skills.   That way you get the differences between Aragorn and Legolas.  Both of them could find their way through the forest, track people and beasts, but both had differences in combat styles.  This could be true as well in EQ2.<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for more armor, spells, or awesome weapons.  I just want some very unique skills and abilities that make the Ranger completely unique and desired for groups.  The ideas of only the Ranger being able to go safely and quickly through the forest is great.  Groups would need to grab a ranger if they are going to go through dangerous terrain.  Then they can use his combat abilities on the tasks they are trying to accomplish.  I love the ability to go anywhere in Norrath by clicking on a book, but I would definately give that up for a more roleplaying style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celadreal</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just realised a sort of class related change I would like to see. I want to see EQ2 learn from Elder Scrolls Morrowind in terms of zone size. In otherwords I want to see MASSIVE zones, so big and dangerous that It is viewed as suicidal to venture out alone no matter how strong you are. perhaps things like pits where your character could slip in and die of starvation/thirst or just enemies that wander and are too strong for any single person. This would both help the ranger class and make the game a greater adventure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
D A M N straight!!  =D<br />
<br />
If not making a ranger who can do massive dmg with a bow at least make an archer.  I hate melee. What brutal violence!  Give me an arrow over sword n e day. Also shields should make it harder to hit someone doncha think? Cover?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tineras</div><div class="date">04-10-2003, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since several people have brought up Tolkien, I'll point out something that most people seem to have missed.<br />
<br />
I think most people have been sidetracked by D&amp;D into thinking Ranger is a class (i.e. type) of person (maybe a profession or lifestyle).  The Rangers were, however, a group of people (the exiled royalty of Gondor and their retainers).<br />
<br />
Aragorn wasn't just some random wood wise hunter that could fight.  Aragorn was the King of Gondor in exile, heir to long life, elven magics, secret lore, mighty heirlooms (although broken)...  He had access to councils with other movers and shakers in the world.    He was a guardian of his people, forced to live in the wilds until he could regain his throne.<br />
<br />
If we want to break the D&amp;D mold, we must call the &quot;class&quot; hunter or woodsman, since we aren't playing &quot;The Grey Company&quot; members when we choose ranger.</div></div><hr />
