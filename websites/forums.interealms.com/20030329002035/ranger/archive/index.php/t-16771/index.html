<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kessca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you die during a trial but are not rezzed during the trial and the group does succeed, do you get flagged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Agravain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No.<br />
<br />
To actually get flagged you are usually required to loot something (as in the PoJ trials) or to hail an NPC after a scripted event (like PoI dragon and so on).<br />
<br />
The designers have closed most of the loopholes that were allowing people to stealth flag themselves.<br />
<br />
When I completed my exe trial I got a tell from a gimp monk that had purposely LD'ed himself in room and hung about hoping someone would eventually succeed and not have need of all 6 marks (we needed 4) - he could then loot an unneeded mark. Shame it didnt work for him.<br />
<br />
Odd that someone that could not complete the trial though he had a right to be in tier 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Will the room reset with someone still in it then? What was to stop the monk from helping you with the fight? Just curious..<br />
<br />
Kil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">had one person pop in the middle of an exe trial for a friend, meant 7 peeps in room, meant one of us was kicked out of trial... as it was the rogue, you can guess what happened...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klegore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not to highjack this thread but ... well I just have a few extra questions.<br />
<br />
Do you need to speak with Mauvin before you attempt the trials? I know you speak to him after you successfully complete the trials but is it required to go to him before the attempt?<br />
<br />
And If so can you just invis and head down to speak with Mauvin or are there KoS mobs on the way and you need a group to fight down to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arbok of Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've completed the trial without even speaking to Mauvin(don't quote me on this :) ) so, no you don't need to speak to him to even attempt the trial.   I would say that invising down to his area would probably be a bad idea since the mobs there are kos and see invis.<br />
<br />
You can either:<br />
-Fight your way through, might require a decent group since respawn will eat you up if you're too slow.  I'd say 2-3 melee and a healer type is all you really need to break your way in.   If you can do the trials then this hall is no problem for you,<br />
-Right click Shiny Brass Idol(Insta Divine Aura, invulnerable for about 20 seconds and the item runs about 1k on my server) and 'Whoa Nelly!' your way into his room.   Click his door hail him immediately and gtfo!<br />
-Or you can harmony/lull/pacify your way in.   It works, although sometimes you might miss a mob, but thats only *a* mob rather than a train.   If you've got a mob on you, simply rush the door at the end of the hall.  Hail his arse and gtfo!<br />
<br />
Congrats, you're now flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shugamayatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think folks are interpreting your question correctly. If I understand your question correctly, namely:<br />
<br />
1. you as part of a group of 6 start the trial.<br />
2. you die sometime between porting in, and the final kill.<br />
3. can you be rezed and loot your mark, than leave?<br />
<br />
Answer -<br />
Yes! <br />
you will have to be rezed 2 times though.<br />
<br />
First time will bounce you to the trial staging area, second time will bring you to your corpse.<br />
<br />
Note: chain clicking won't do much as you're &quot;still zoning&quot; from rez one, while recieving rez 2. So rez (bounce to trial stage), then ask for rez 2. Loot, leave, life is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Back when the trial was gimpable I admit I flagged my level 47 shaman with an unneeded mark, simply because I thought it was funny zoning her into PoV and /ooc'ing for a group.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aerwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if you run right through the middle of dr at lvl 60 the only two mobs that will aggro are the last 2 before mauvin door..so i just did a suicide run hailed mauvin died and then waited for corpse to pop in gy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glaurung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Harmony also works wonders with the enforcers/punishers :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you must make sure to get the reses in trial room quickly, or your corpse will warp back to the graveyard (i.e. don't wait till the end to res or the corpse will be gone).<br />
<br />
and the sequence does not seem to matter.  several of us have gotton our trial mark, then do the dialog sessions after (mauvin- tribunal-mauvin).  I dunno if you can do the dialogs themselves out of order.<br />
<br />
and harmony works wonders to get down to mauvin's room with a full basement spawn, have done it a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zeyk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Harmony works nice, but not anymore...good luck harmonizing all 10 mobs in under 42sec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you only need to harmony the 2 you are next to, then get the next 2 harmonied and move before the first 2 wear off.  So max of 4 at a time. (gets complicated with more people though)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Greym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">you can also get the flag from Mauvin before you do the trial. I did this earlier this week. Got into a pickup group in POJ, my first time hunting there and we went down and did the enforcers. Cleared the room, then went to see Mauvin. I got the flag, but have not even attempted a trial yet.</div></div><hr />
