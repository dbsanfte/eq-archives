<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried the serverwide crucible channel and just didn't like it.  Not only was their to much crap being talked about, it didn't really help me with the things I wanted to know about because servers vary so much.<br />
<br />
Is there a channel on Drinal or is there a way to list the channels on the server so I can pick one to use?</div></div><hr />

There's not one on Drinal that I know of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There was a post a while ago listing shamans on every server who are willing to get random tells from other shamans who have questions.  You might want to search for that thread.<br />
<br />
Or friends lists work ok too.  Korman just sent me a /tell yesterday to say hi.  <br />
<br />
But we could certainly make a &quot;shaman:shaman&quot; channel and all /autojoin it.<br />
<br />
You just have to promise never to mention the word &quot;casino&quot; on it. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is no shaman channel I know of on Drinal. And I dare not start or join one .. too much spam on raids anyway :D<br />
<br />
I always try to answer questions about shaman stuff, so just shoot me a tell.<br />
