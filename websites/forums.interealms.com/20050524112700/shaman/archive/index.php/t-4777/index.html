<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shokar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend and running buddy shaman has now built up his 2nd aa point.  He asked me yesterday what I thought he should put those points into.<br />
<br />
His wisdom, after getting Emerald Dragonscale is pretty ridiculously high right now.<br />
<br />
So, my question is hoping to get as many responses as possible, what aa points should he use.<br />
<br />
Why should he do as you suggest....and where to go from there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would put some points into run speed if he hasn't already.<br />
<br />
Get all 3 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally I would get level 60 before doing any AA.<br />
<br />
if he feels he must get AA, runspeed then regen.  Don't waste points on wisdom, it's really not that hard to max with even medium quality level 60 gear and buffs like KEI/bearform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">60 is more important than any aa skill we get.<br />
<br />
my plan is run speed then regen, mental clarity 3 then canni 5 assuming i have topor, if not then i'll just build up aa points and maybe go with MGB first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">agreed 60 before AAs is my feeling.<br />
<br />
the way i did aas was.... first point to run1, then 3 to regen, then the last two into run.  leaving me with regen3 and run3.  <br />
<br />
then i spent 12 points on MC3 <br />
<br />
once i pained through MC3 i got myself cann5.<br />
<br />
next i plan to do MGB if i XP enough to get 8 more points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">runspeed then regen, i would get runspeed before 60 unless all you do is soloing in outdoors zones with sow up all the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shokar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What do the Epic Quest Boots do?  Thought they gave some sort of SOW to the wearer?<br />
<br />
I see most people think runspeed, but for the shaman, grouping in Dungeons, does he really need RUNSPSEED?  I know my Pally is going for runspeed, but the shaman?<br />
<br />
As to level 60...he is sort of holding himself back, as three of the people in our team do not have as much playing time as he does, so he has slowed himself by going 80% aa.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't regen and mental clarity be more important that runspeed?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the info, and will pass it on as more replies and opinions are voiced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you cant sow in dungeons...<br />
my reasoning is, you die, you aint getting xp, if you can outrun that train, then you aint dying=faster xp<br />
<br />
epic booties are instant sow yes :) still not very useful indoors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wouldn't regen and mental clarity be more important that runspeed?<br />
<br />
<br />
runspeed is VERY useful for anybody. even shaman with epic boots can not sow himself indoors, and indoors are some of the places where you MOST want to be able to run (away) fast.<br />
<br />
mental clarity is total garbage for shaman. the only reason to get it is that it is a prerequisite for the almighty Cannibalization class-specific aa ability.<br />
<br />
regen is sort of iffy, it seems to be what everyone gets after run 3 (you have to spend 6 points in general before doing anything else), but imo 3 points a tick just isn't that great. with the new Natural Durability archetype requiring natural stamina 2, that (and one other point) may be a more viable choice than regen 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Runspeed Runspeed Runspeed. <br />
<br />
Those should be the first 3 aa points anyone gets, in any class. My main is a bard, with even better self-runspeed enhancement than a shaman. And his first 3 points were runspeed, and they're still the best 3 points I've spent, even after starting to buy class-only skills. <br />
<br />
Runspeed works indoors. Sure, SoW works outdoors, but if you've been in a dungeon for 30 minutes it's gone. Runspeed isn't. Outrunning the train you're pulling to the zoneline is a wonderful thing. Being able to keep up with your friends who all have runspeed 3 is a wonderful thing. The inta-SoW boots do reduce its value outdoors, but let's face it. An awful lot of high level people already had Jboots too, and they all still bought runspeed for indoor use as well. <br />
<br />
Most importantly, the first 6 aa points can only be spent on basic skills. Far and away the best choices are runspeed 3 and regen 3. The other basic AA skills are fairly pointless, with very little effect.  What would plus wisdom (or any other stat) do? Virtually nothing. Each point of wisdom is what, maybe 12 extra on his maximum mana at L 60... assuming he's not capped out on wisdom, which he someday will. Runspeed is good forever, the extra wisdom is almost meaningless. <br />

<br />
What?  Natural Durability requires points in Natural Stamina?  I've never heard this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">All the AA points aren't as impressive for a shaman as lvl 60 is.  Each AA point you get, you're missing out on getting most of a level and all the 50+ levels are a much larger power increase.  I'm a quarter way into lvl 56 and still no AA points and not regretting it much.  Run3 would of come in handy a couple times but eh.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree with the prevailing opinion here.  I got one AA at 54 and put it into Runspeed, then went back to grinding.<br />
<br />
Sometimes if I don't want to get too far ahead of my RL wife, I throw some XP back into AA, but if it was just me all of it would be levelling XP.</div></div><hr />

What?  Natural Durability requires points in Natural Stamina?  I've never heard this. <br />
<br />
Yep.  It doesn't say it in the Listing, but if you click on Natural Durability, it tells you it requires Natural Stamina 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
My current plan is;<br />
General:<br />
Run speed 1 (if the mob isn't sowed, should let me out run it)<br />
Natural Stamina 2<br />
Regen 3<br />
<br />
Archtype:<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
<br />
Class:<br />
Canibalization<br />
<br />
Archtype:<br />
Natural Durablity 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">How fast is runspeed 3? If it's as fast as sow I'll get it when I can get aa's, but if it's slower then I just don't see the point unless it can be undone when outdoors trying to run from one place to another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's about as fast as level 9 SOW. Just fast enough to outrun most mobs.<br />
<br />
[edit - It's a natural ability which means that's how fast you will run without SOW. When you cast SOW on yourself then you run at SOW speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hardiman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Run speed 3 is almost as fast as normal SoW, I've heard something like 90% of SoW speed.  That can make a huge difference in being able to run to the zone, keeping up with your guildies on a raid, or especially pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">not sure but the way that i understand it, breaks down like this<br />
<br />
run 3 = 30% <br />
jboot sow = 35%<br />
highest PC sow = 55%<br />
spirit of cheetah = 100%<br />
scale of wolf = 70%<br />
SoE = 60%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm going to go the run3 regen3 route. I'm going to turn level exp down from 90% once I get one blue away from 56. I'd think that run3 would come in handy before your level 60, I mean why push hard to get 60 and not have the help of a few AA skills on the way up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yep. It doesn't say it in the Listing, but if you click on Natural Durability, it tells you it requires Natural Stamina 2.<br />
<br />
I can confirm that this is not true.  I currently have one level of Natural Durability and no points into stamina.  <br />
<br />
Maybe the misconception evolved the hitpoints gained via natural durability are based on base sta + sta gear + sta buff?<br />
<br />
When you click on Natural Durability it says:<br />
<br />
This is a passive ability; it does not need to be activated.  <br />
Requirements: Level 55, Must spend 6 ability pionts in the General Abilities.  This ability increases your maximum hitpoints by 2, 5 and 10 percent.  (The percentages are based off of your base hitpoints, which include stamina and stamina effects)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Runspeed is the only AA worth doing before 60.  You don't even need run3.  I had run1 only and it allowed me to outrun most dungeons trains, and saved my life many times.  59 barbarian shaman gets 1 blue of regular exp for every 4.5 blues of AA exp that my 60 sk got when I boxed them together.  Remeber that.  When you are just barely 59, you'll look at your 6AA points and say &quot;damn i could be 60 right now.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">run 3 is good enough that i dont even bother sowing myself when soloing.  while it will take you longer, i'd get run 3 at minimum at 51.  i can't count how many times it saved me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I sat 1 kill from 53 for a while getting 6 points of AA (run 3 regen 3) So that I could still go on Vox and Naggy raids.<br />
<br />
I was tempted to keep on racking them up but decided to head up to 60, and try and get on kunark dragon raids. No luck though sofar.</div></div><hr />
