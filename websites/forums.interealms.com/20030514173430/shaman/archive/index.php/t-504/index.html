<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shayleena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Barbarian Shammys should know that The Warrens in Paineel is better for low lvls 6 or 7-15 BECAUSE you not only get exp for molars turned in to the Warrior guild in Erudin, but you also get RINGMAIL at times, which is very nice for those who need to earn their own way.<br />
<br />
I mean its better than Blackburrow... just a boat ride to Erudin, get a bind from soulbinder, then run across Tox Forest, into Paineel newbie area (careful of the guards, we are KOS to them... just run straight past them and don't stop hehe)  then The Warrens is just inside of the newbie area to the right.<br />
<br />
I suggest waiting to leave Halas at lvl 8 so that you can train 1 point into Meditation (you will lvl the rest yourself).  AND don't leave home without your lvl 9 spells, at least the ones you can get in Halas and the Platform in Everfrost.  Then you are free to head on over to The Warrens.  I outfitted my Shammy with a full set of ringmail at about lvl 13 or so, great stuff :)<br />
<br />
For lvls 6-7or 8 its probably better to group, but i soloed alot too staying close to the zone line.. going down the hallway to the right.  Just kill all the greens too for their molars.  Make sure you got a train button too just to be polite.<br />
<br />
My system was to get the bind in Erudin, then when encumbered, gate there, sell, turn in molars, bank stuff i want to save and change in money.. then sow back to The Warrens.  It worked great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ringmail is good stuff, I had it all the way to mid 30s, from my low 20s. it is heavy though.<br />
<br />
of course, this was back before all these new fangled zones, and that bazaar thingy. sometimes I miss those days, but then I remember that there were overpopulated zones and such, and I am glad it is now and not then.</div></div><hr />
