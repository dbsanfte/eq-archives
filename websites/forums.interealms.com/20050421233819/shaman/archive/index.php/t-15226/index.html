<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jayzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had to get out on my own the other day after getting sick of the Planes.  I went to Burning Woods.  I had only been there once in group killing giants.  Now at lvl 56 I noticed there were alot of Dark Blue cons and lb/green as well.  I haven't found anything yet that I couldn't solo.  My aa bar was moving nicely.  <br />
<br />
Anyway,  What are some other Good Places to solo in this lvl range for a Shaman that knows what they are doing?<br />
<br />
Also, Has anyone found Gullerback the nasty undead gorilla and killed him in BW?  If so do you remember the area of the zone ya found him at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hello,<br />
<br />
I used to duo him with my pally (2box) a lot.  I used to setup shop on the hill just north of the Bee Hive.  I would buff my pally, myself and my pet, then tell my pet to guard.  I sent my pally out to pull stuff back to the hilltop (near the 1 tree by itself).  I would run around the ruins which are nearby and pickup a mob or 2 to fight.  At 55 we soloed them, but by 57 we were taking one for the pally and one for my pet.<br />
<br />
Gullerback will roam from those ruins to right near the Giant Fort.  By staying there I would find him about 1 to 2 times an hour.   You can roam towards the Giant Fort but I had a lot of trouble trying to run back and avoid all the adds.  I don't know how wise it would be to solo him though since I was only ever able to disease slow him.<br />
<br />
Once he dies, one of the named wurms for wurmslayer would show up in the same area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Start adventuring into dungeons.  Entrance areas to Sebilis, chardok, howling stones are all good fun.  The hole might be a little low, but you could always try moving further down.  Veksar would probably be worth checking out at that level, and some Luclin zones like ME, Akheva, and the grey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BW has a great solo spot with no wanderers but lots of mobs nearby, including Gullerback.  Not sure if I can describe how to get there, but I'll try.<br />
<br />
Put your back to the giant fort ramp.  Now go about 90 degrees around the giant fort to your RIGHT and move down the hill - you should see a burned-out area facing a steep hillside.  The mobs don't wander in the burned out area, at least not on the left side of it, but lots of them are wandering the hillside and the green area to the left of it.  Gullerback does wander here.<br />
<br />
Other good solo spots at that level are Chardok, Skyfire, maybe Veksar(?).  KC sewers and Seb would be nice but I found them very hard to single pull, so duoing those spots is better.</div></div><hr />

Are you saying that you looted the Jaundiced Bone Bracer there?  I need one of those.....  WL?  Is that Wakening Lands?</div></div><hr />

No, he's saying what he had for euipment to solo with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did some armors there at the 55-58ish range -- the experience is far from terrific, but at least my wife enjoyed the full set of sentient for her SK twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">JBB drops in the Crypt in Sebilis, Jayzan.  Look it up on Alla.  Need a rogue to get in and a full group of mid to high 50's to be comfortable there.  A resourceful 60 might be able to solo the area, I hear reports of soloing the emp in seb, so I guess it's possible.  I've never really gone down there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zzang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you do not care about the Katta faction, then Katta will be great place for solo xp.<br />
The xp per kill is not superb, but you gain xp faster because of the quality vs. quantity.<br />
Bank yard was my favorite spot, because the area is huge and there are 11 guards that I could pull for a kill and they spawn FAST.<br />
These guards have about 3-4k in hp and hit for average of 70ish.<br />
They have very low resistances so you do not have to waste mana on debuffing, plus when you slow them your pet can tank them with ease.<br />
I usually single pull them with slow then lure him to the area where I want to kill him, then root him and stick pet on him. I also dot them for faster kill.<br />
They also drops okay loot(merchant junks) and you can bank there even your faction with katta is totally destroyed. Just make sure to invis yourself and sneak in behind banker to avoid contact with bank guards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I tried that when I was around 51 or so...  but it was too hard.  Now that I'm 56 I think I'll have to go back for another try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would have to second katta as well. Solo'd there from 55 to 59 rather fast. At 59 is when it gets really lousy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Frankly, Katta's a pain in the rear to get to.<br />
<br />
You can port to Twilight Sea, it connects there, and run in.<br />
<br />
If you have to hoof it, here's your choice of routes from PoK:<br />
<br />
PoKnowledge -&gt; Nexus -&gt; Shadow Haven -&gt; Echo Caverns (Secret Side) -&gt; Fungus Grove -&gt; Twilight Sea -&gt; Katta Castellum<br />
<br />
-or-<br />
<br />
PoKnowledge -&gt; Shadeweaver's Thicket -&gt; Shar Vahl -&gt; Hollowshade Moor -&gt; Grimling Forest -&gt; Mons Letalis -&gt; Katta Castellum<br />
<br />
Either way, it's a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks, too much running for me just to find it probably camped. :)<br />

If you get a port to Twighlight and run East IT's like 45 seconds and your in Katta...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zzang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ask wiz or druid for a TP to twilight sea.<br />
From TS you can zone directly into Katta.<br />
Get a in game map of TS and Katta for easy navigation.<br />
You can get them from http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/<br />
<br />
If you are 57, you have no problem solo pulling the guard as long as you are not in their aggro range. I normally pull him with slow from good distance. Once he gets near me I root him then stick my pet. I will dot him once or twice and keep him rooted if it breaks. You might have to heal your pet time to time. <br />
<br />
If you have JBB and horse then you are golden. Don't even bother dotting.<br />
I bought my JBB because of Katta xping.<br />
Once you have JBB, all you have to do is slow,root and stick pet, then nuke him until he is dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zzang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That's the good part about Katta.<br />
Not many peeps there camping them.<br />
If you get unlucky.. you might find necro soloing at the bank courtyard.<br />
However, there are many other sweet camp spot in Katta.<br />
2nd best spot will be the zone in.<br />
There are 6 guards that you can kill right there.</div></div><hr />

What level are the Naythan (sp) guards? bulding with sonic wolves in the yard. They are a different faction to the rest of Katta. Could be an option, but might be too low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nathyn's guards start to turn lt blue at level 59, and are single pullable at 57. Good spot if you're worried about faction.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jayzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I tried out the guards at the Katta zone line from Twighlight last night.  I got lucky and got in on a free MGB of Tranquility and a temp before I went.  The first guard went down so fast it wasn't even funny.  My pet raped him.  I give my pet a 1hb/1hs combo for the added damage.  Then on the second pull My ISP dropped me and I went LD and died!!!!!!  I changed the Dialup number and reconnected got rezzed and had to settle for KEI and went back.  I pulled consistanly and cleared the first 6 guards and was chain pulling.  I even killed two at once and was pretty much 70 M and nearly full hp the whole time.    And I made several hundred pp in the process from the weapons they dropped.  They also make nice pet weapons.  The belts sell for like 88pp to the vendor.  Gonna get some more back packs and head back!  <br />
<br />
Think I'll be soloing alot here!!!  Thanks guys!<br />

I don't know for sure, but when they expanded the darkblue level range, it effected the Katta might as well.</div></div><hr />

You could probably pull two at a time.  I was just at the zoneline but there are higher level guards further in.  I was killing the Legionaires and I was getting 1-2% aa per kill. The Centurions are 50+ the Legionaires are around 45.  I'm gonna look for the Centurions tonight.  I hope their loot is as good.  I know the xp will be =)<br />

I believe you are talking about bank guards.<br />
You can not single pull them and they are much tougher(has about 3 times more hp and hits for average of 100ish).<br />
They also summons you.<br />
So watch out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too late bud,  I tried the Centurions last night and I got raped.  First problem was that I pulled both of them on one side of the bank.  Then I proceed to train them around the front of the bank yard back and forth across trying to root them.  Then I couldn't run away because they summoned me and wacked me till I died. LOL...   So I went back to the zoneline on the Twighlight side and got revenege on the Legoinaires around there.  =)</div></div><hr />

It all depends on the speed of your killing.<br />
Like I said, it is Quality vs. Quantity.<br />
Loots do not sucks but okay.<br />
You can easily make couple hundred in an hour.<br />
It also depends on the speed of your killing.<br />
For instance.<br />
I was able to kill roughly 8-9 guards before the 1st kill respawns at his spot(I also had JBB and Horse).<br />
At the time I believe I was 58 or so.<br />
Had my Everfrost TP clicky talisman(around only 2k) and bound to Katta entrance.<br />
It was in my opinion most effective setup.<br />
In case if I die, I will respawn in Katta to loot my corpse(one item will be remained) and continue battle until your rezzer arrives.<br />
And used the talisman if I had to run to sell the loots.<br />
<br />
Sorry you got killed Jayzan..<br />
But at least now you know :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Zzang, I was not complaining by any means. I was just lamenting that I really wanted better xp, I just hoped that by destroying faction and taking on guards I would get better xp than by downing similar mobs in Dulak. It was a fun hour or so while I was there. I have the spiritstone of everfrost which is awesome.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Groob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Im at 57 and finding it hard to get groups (tier one planes starting to suck for xp and Im too low to get into pov/cod groups easily unless they are friends) so Katta sounds good - but I have a sneaking suspicion there is a cloak quest in Katta that I might want faction for?</div></div><hr />
