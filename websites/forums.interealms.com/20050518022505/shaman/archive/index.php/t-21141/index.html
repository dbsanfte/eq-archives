<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey. Any help, here? Please? I am stuck and cannot decide if I want to become a Barbarian Beastlord or a Froglok Shaman. To me, Shaman can gate/bind in place of the Beastlords Melee, but I may be wrong. Anyone mind clarifying class defining abilities? I am lost and cannot decide which one I would like to make. Also, I am no planning on playing high end. Maybe get my epic and call it quits, as by that time, EQ2 will be close to out or out. So as far as 'Shaman suck high end', that won't concern me. Well, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Up through the 50s I'd have to say:  Shaman.<br />
<br />
60+ is when Beastlords really come into their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Weren't you bragging about having a horse or drogmor or some such on a frog shaman a few weeks back?<br />
<br />
Just remember...whichever class you choose, EQ still sucks ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you plan on staying under 50 Both are fun classes. Shaman are VERY strong under 50.  IF you plan to go  55+ Bst lord,  but they wont truly shine in power till 60 +</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you are wrong.<br />
<br />
That is like saying that wizards can wear robes in place of a mage's pet.  Two completely unrelated things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anyone mind clarifying class defining abilities?<br />
<br />
Shaman 1-50<br />
Slow / debuff / Buffs / Dots / druid level healage till 50 about / minor pet / no realistic melee ability<br />
<br />
Beastlord 1-50<br />
Major Pet with pet heals &amp; pet buffs / some buffage (mana / hp regen 44+) / very minor slow from 1-50 / small smattering of dot &amp; dd / same level of healing as a ranger / around bard melee levels prolly<br />
<br />
Bottem line play what you'll enjoy, all that really matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Simple way to look at things:<br />
<br />
1. Play the class that supports the playstyle you enjoy.<br />
2. Do you want to sit or stand.  <br />
<br />
In other words, do you want to be a caster that supports the group and tries not to get hit, or do you want to be a melee that will be in the mix most of the time.<br />
<br />
Personally, it depends on my mood.  For the most part I want to be a caster, hanging back, keeping tabs on the battlefield, and doing what is needed to help the group.  But, sometimes I just want to kill stuff with my hands, so I switch to one of my melee alts (Pally or BST).  Usually, a couple of hours of melee and I get it out of my system.<br />
<br />
To be honest, if I had to do over and had not put a year into the shaman (and a bunch of no-drop equipment), I'd go with the BST.  Most of the casting power (except poor self healing), good dps plus a great pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BST &gt; SHM<br />
<br />
That is really all I have to contribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In other words, do you want to be a caster that supports the group and tries not to get hit, or do you want to be a melee that will be in the mix most of the time.<br />
<br />
We're talking shaman and beastlords here, not druids and rangers.  For the levels he's indicated he'll be playing, melee remains wholly viable.<br />
<br />
But yes, play what you think you'll enjoy.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Typo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Beastlord epic is very very easy to get and a very nice weapon.  You'll be very happy with a beastlord, I think.  Lots less aggravating when you don't have to canni like a shaman does, by the way.  You can talk to friends more and just socialize more easily when playing.  I love playing my monk or SK sometimes just so I don't feel like I'm ignoring my friends by cannibalizing all day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>armagedon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In my opinion for soloing :<br />
SHM &gt; BST until lvl 8.<br />
BST &gt; SHM lvl 9 to 33.<br />
SHM &gt; BST lvl 34 to 59.<br />
BST &gt; SHM lvl 60 to 65.<br />
<br />
Lvl 65 with AA dont know :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Solo wise:<br />
<br />
At younger levels a BST is not all that hard to play.  The ability to play cleric to your pet works out just fine.  I would say it is easier then to play a BST.<br />
<br />
Towards the End game the shaman's ability to heal himself and manage his mana in an on-going battle allows to win some pretty hard fights.  <br />
<br />
The problem with BSTs is when they solo they need to kill the mob fast because healing isn't an option all the time unless you can fire your one paragon in the 12 minute time it take to refresh.  Also trying to healing your pet over and over at the upper levels is to mana costly and to risky with the casting time on the heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Group wise:<br />
<br />
Both shaman and BST take different roles in a group.  Thou BST can still slow.  They don't provide healing.  And often haste draining on there mana, to constantly refresh.  And a BST can be limited in CC thou there pet can take one add.<br />
<br />
Primarily BSTs in a group provides DPS.  <br />
While Shamans provide utility and heals.</div></div><hr />
