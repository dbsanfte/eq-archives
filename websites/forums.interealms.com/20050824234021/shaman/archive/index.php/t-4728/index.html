<br />
We've started work on the sound and music engine. If you used to have sound/music bugs, the first upgrade today might help a bit. This is the first step down a long road. If your particular sound/music issue isn't fixed, please be patient. There's no need to re-report existing sound/music bugs. <br />
Gameplay<br />
<br />
Experience: Post-50 characters will now gain far more experience from hunting NPCs at or above their own level than ever before. This is a test of a potential new system. Briefly, the idea isn't really that much of a stretch: The larger the risk you take, the larger the reward should be. <br />
  <br />
Experience: Post-50 &quot;hell&quot; effect levels are gone. There are no longer any levels in EverQuest that are anywhere near twice as hard as their previous levels. Please note: This does not change the amount of experience required to go from &quot;No experience in level 1&quot; to &quot;Full-bar in level 60.&quot; It's just about smoothing out the trip. <br />
  <br />
Resists: More work on the resist system. Please don't expect every spell to resist exactly the same as it used to. However, do feel free to report anything that you suspect is obvious brokenness. (Note: Whoever killed Hobart's two-million HP Fire Beetle of Testing while we were at lunch - That was mean.) <br />
Support<br />
<br />
Two new commands to play with: /viewpetition, /deletepetition. You may now review your existing petition. If you happen to resolve it yourself, you can then delete it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Should mean we loose less xp in 60 =)  Dunno how this would affect those in 59.<br />
<br />
SK's &amp; chanters also get some nice stuff:<br />

AGGRO CONTROL ON TEST, AUGUST 24, 2002 <br />
There have been some modifications made recently to the aggro control spells on the Test Server. Note that because these changes are only on the Test Server, more alterations could be before they go live (if they go live at all).<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights are currently being tested with a range of spells to help increase aggro both for themselves, and for others.  Here are the details:<br />
<br />
Terror of Darkness:  Level 34, Self Only, Increase Hate With Target by 200. <br />
Terror of Shadows: Level 44, Self Only, Increase Hate With Target by 400. <br />
Terror of Death:  Level 53, Self Only, Increase Hate With Target by 450. <br />
Terror of Terris:  Level 59, Self Only, Increase Hate With Target by 500.<br />
  <br />
Voice of Darkness:  Level 39, Target Player, Increase Aggro Multiplier by 2% <br />
Voice of Shadows:  Level 49, Target Player, Increase Aggro Multiplier by 4% <br />
Voice of Death:  Level 55, Target Player, Increase Aggro Multiplier by 6% <br />
Voice of Terris:  Level 60, Target Player, Increase Aggro Multiplier by 10% <br />
The targettable Shadow Knight spells last for 10 minutes with a 9 minute recast time.  They stack with the Enchanter Visage line of spells which have also had their durations upgraded to balance with the Shadow Knight changes.  Here are the details for the Enchanter spell changes (click on a spell name for its current information):<br />
<br />
Haunting Visage:  Level 29, Target Player, Increase Aggro Multiplier by 5%, Duration Increased from 18 secs to 10 min., Recast Increased from 36 secs to 9 min.<br />
  <br />
Calming Visage:  Level 39, Target Player, Decrease Aggro Multiplier by 5%, Duration Increased from 18 secs to 10 min., Recast Increased from 36 secs to 9 min.<br />
  <br />
Beguiling Visage:  Level 54, Self Only, Decrease Aggro Multiplier by 50%, Duration Increased from 18 secs to 24 secs, Recast Decreased from 15 min to 5 min.<br />
  <br />
Horrifying Visage:  Level 56, Target Player, Increase Aggro Multiplier by 10%, Duration Increased from 18 secs to 10 min., Recast Increased from 36 secs to 9 min.<br />
  <br />
Glamorous Visage:  Level 58, Target Player, Decrease Aggro Multiplier by 10%, Duration Increased from 18 secs to 10 min., Recast Increased from 36 secs to 9 min. <br />
<br />
<br />
10 mins in the Visage spells is a hell of a lot more useful than 18 secs and should help out main tanks a bit (as well as help us shammies not get aggro with slow resists) :D <br />
<br />
Hats off to verant, they do seem to be trying hard at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">dang, SKs just got a lot more useful on raids!  That change is HUGE!  I can't wait to test it.  They also just became a favorite tank of enchanters in exp groups.  Grats SKs!  <br />
<br />
Hmm, smoothed out post 50 levels are nice too.  It gets so discouraging when you can't see the bar move.  That's what I love about AA . . the bar moves right along!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The way I see it, lasts 10 min, recast 9 min, kinda like our Avatar line, limits the number of targets. And do you really need more than 1 MT? No. One chanters watches tank transitions, other MT. You don't need instant recast on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good suite of improvements.  I'd like to see these go live!<br />
<br />
Where's our lure slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Where's our lure slow?<br />
- Do we really need a lure slow? Many boss mobs are rooted (pre fight debuff) or easy slow. If Verant doesn't want us to slow a mob it will be flagged. Aaryonar, Dagarn and Idol are tough to slow but can be done with coordinated debuff efforts.<br />
<br />
I rather see DD component gone from DoTs with an added extra tick, maybe a 900-1k NT heal clone. And as a pipe dream, 750-800 DD.</div></div><hr />

I wanna know why they're so irrate about a spell they never use anyway because it's apparently so useless...?</div></div><hr />

Bring back hell levels!  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">very great change, the 9 minutes recast time isn't deal for ubber boss fight, only bad thing for them is they have to keep spell mem all time</div></div><hr />

Not happy enchanters. <br />
<br />
Simple fact of the mater is people will always complain. The changes made where a major improvement on the spell. Previously the spell had a duration of 18 seconds with a recast time of 36 seconds. Took 2 enchanters chain casting the spell perfectly timed to have any chance of keeping this up on a tank. Sure a 9 minute recast time is annoying but the buff lasts 10 minutes so it is actually possible for a single enchanter to keep one of these buffs up on a tank by themselves. I also didn't see any note of changes to the casting cost making these pretty reasonable to use spells.<br />
<br />
You could give people an 1 second casting time spell that cost 1 mana and ae CHed everyone around them and they would still complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bah; they did this to me with my monk.  She just made it through 45 and what do they do, spread out the hell level xp to the following levels.  Now she has to earn that xp pretty much twice.<br />
<br />
Now I just ding 60 a couple weeks ago and they remove 54 &amp; 59 - course, they're gonna have to spread out those to the levels BELOW them.  Ah well, 45, 54 and 59 were serious hurdles that the faint hearted (ie; non-commited) could not pass.  It weeded out the weak.  Ah well, the transition from 50 to 51 is still there, and it's a pain still at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, when they smoothed out 1-50 it really pissed me off, as my warrior had just gotten through 45... And the idea of getting all that exp twice over didn't appeal all that much to me at the time. I finially just set him aside for a while, then when I came back to him, it didn't really bother me all that much...</div></div><hr />
