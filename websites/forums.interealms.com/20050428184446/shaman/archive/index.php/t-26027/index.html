<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">first things first- have some 60+ buddies. that done, run to your guild hall, grab a lavastorm magma from the lil gnome hiding in the wall by the portal. give it back to him.  then jump in the portal and viola- inc lavastorm. invis up and head on over to lavaspinners lair; or grab the &quot;spider's web&quot; task from the merchants ( the female erudite ).  when you get into lavaspinner, run down and to the right to get to the spider area. your task now is to assist your 60+ tank with dogdog, haste him/her up, and slow/malo/incap the mob.  at 46 i was getting almost 5% a kill from the spinners, and the occasional named gave about 8% exp.  KEI and Virtue are almost a neccesity, if you want to maintain any kind of steady pulling... I was grouped with a 66 war, a 67 druid, and a 56 cleric bot, and the only  time we ran into to trouble was when a soloing cleric got owned by a broodling ( just guestimating but id say that sucker had close to 3 times the hps of the spinners ).  in about 4 hours of playing, i went from 46 to 48 with nary a backwards glance... very fun, but very dangerous</div></div><hr />
