733 pentium 3 processor<br />
256mb ram<br />

voodoo3 video card, and thats all i can think of for now, if anyone has any ideas please help me out, i need it bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Probibly not the problem but you need a faster processor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye - and more RAM wouldnt go a miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That voodoo3 card is pretty old now. I upgraded mine a couple years ago, and it was old then. Might still be supported, but not with all features. I know its incapable of displaying some of the newer things in DX8, and most of us are on DX9 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I assume you are only playing one account, and are only going into windowed mode to do other tasks (while in trader mode, perhaps?). Regardless, while I am in agreement that it is probably time for an upgrade (id upgrade ram before processor - much cheaper), I think upping your virtual memory would solve your problem for the time being. Free of charge, just click on the good old control panel in you computer.<br />

Think about upgrading your video card, then save some money and upgrade your motherboard, processor, and ram.<br />
<br />
BUT if you cant or dont want to upgrade, you might want to think about finding a saturday, backup all your information and things, music, emails, EQ, porn, etc., make sure you have all the system/game disks you need for a complete whipe, and do it.  While your at it open up your system and just give it a checkup, make sure there arent any ratty cables, any fans puttering, clean out the dust, stuff like that. <br />
<br />
Then reinstall windows, eq, etc., and get the newest drivers for all your hardware.<br />
<br />
After you do that you should notice a big improvement in your performance, alot of problems compound, especially in windows and starting fresh can fix alot of them.</div></div><hr />

I had somewhat similar problems with mine when I first started playing EQ.  Spec's at the time were: P3 650MHz, 128M sdram, 10GB 5200rpm HD, Radeon 9000 (not pro), and 240W(i think) power supply.  Now, you ask why I include the power supply, well it will be important in a sec.  :p <br />
I buy game, /load, /play, and suddenly, I find my computer locking up when I zone into any place other than shadowhaven, everfrost, and PoK.  It was a MAJOR pain to get out of Halas when I first started.  So I call tech support and they basically say it could be any of the items in my computer that I have listed here.  So, I take a &quot;shotgun&quot; approach to the problem and purchase a Gforce 4 TI4800, wester digital 80GB 7200rpm HD, Athlon XP 2400, an Asus MB (8X), and a 512Mb DDR stick of Kingston.   I put it together, hit /on and brought my beast to life.  /re-load game, /connect to server and begin playing.  Cross my fingers, zone into Halas and...BAM.  Computer locked up.  ***? I call tech support again, and tell them about my impressive list of new specs, to which he tells me &quot;get a new power supply.&quot;  Now, I am thinking to myself.  This guy is a moron, I'm no computer dummy, but I can't seem to wrap my mind around the idea of a power supply causing my game to crash.  I bite my tounge, head to my local &quot;bob's computer shack&quot; type place and pick up a fresh new power supply. 450W I belive.  Slap it in, /log-in.  Head to zone line, fully expecting to crash,  I have my hand on the power cord for the computer, because this time I am NOT going to give my CPU to satisfaction of shutting down properly should I crash.  Zone in, no crash.  Not a crash since.  The basic point I am trying to get across to you is that it is VERY possible it is one, or multiple things wrong.  However, there IS something wrong, and if you have the means, I would suggest a complete system revamp, and if not, then you may have to live with not multi-tasking on the same computer while gaming.  Definitely do some homework and make sure your bios is set up for optimal gaming, and like the quote above, wipe that old hard drive of unnecesary zero's and ones.  A fresh HD is a good HD.  Sucks, yes.  You may not end up going to the same extreme as I did, but it is possible.  And if you do decide to, send me a shout, and I will give you a whole list of excuses for your wife as to why/how these new parts will help her play solitaire, or check her e-mail! (my wife currently plays EQ, but I still got her to bite off on this whole Yahoo Messenger story!) My 2cp. :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I know when I went from 512mb to 1 gig ram, it made an enormous difference.  Before that, the hard drive would spin like a top turning around in high traffic areas as it spooled to/from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Look, it doesn't matter how much RAM you throw into the box, you're just wasting money by sinking more cash into it in its current state.<br />
In order of importance: new vid card, new motherboard/processor (will have to be bought as a set, new processor won't work on your mobo), and you'll have to buy new RAM to go with the motherboard and processor.  Or you could go the easy way and hit your local Best Buy and get in on some financing so it's not such a big hit all at once.  OEM machines are pretty decent now, and having a warranty can be extremely helpful, especially when you can't find the source of the problem on your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As you can see, ask 50 computer users how to fix a computer and you’re likely to get 50 different answers. *grins*  For what its worth I’ll add my opinion into the mix as well.  Ideally you should buy a new system.  There have been so many fundamental changes in everything from RAM to the bus system on your motherboard that upgrading your system piece by piece really isn’t worth it in the long run.  It’s just the nature of computers to become obsolete within six months of purchase.  And the prices for a new system have dropped a lot from what they used to cost.  So they are much more affordable.<br />
<br />
That having been said, not everyone can afford to upgrade their computer even if prices are relatively “reasonable.”  If you can’t afford to rush right out and buy a new system, there are some things you can do to clean up your current system that might help your performance.  First, empty out your Temporary Internet files.  This not only clears out a bit of space but you could have some nasty files hiding there that can wreak havoc on your system.  I’ve worked on systems that couldn’t connect to the internet until the Temporary Internet files were deleted.  You can also delete the files in your Temp folder.  This used to be a big deal when hard drives were much smaller, but even on today’s larger hard drives it can’t hurt.  There is also a free software program I would recommend you download and use regularly.  Its called Spybot (http://www.safer-networking.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=download).  It’s designed to seek out programs that are known to cause users computer problems and remove them.  I’ve used it on twenty or so machines at work and my home PC without it causing any problems.  And finally you should deferment your hard drive.  Depending on how fragmented you PC is, running defrag can often improve your processing speed.<br />
<br />
If you do decide to upgrade a part of your current system, I’d suggest starting with your video card.  I say this not because of the speed of your video card, but because Voodoo cards are known for having issues with numerous games, including online games.  Unfortunately, there’s no way of knowing which part or parts of your system are causing the problem without spending the money to replace them.   It could even be a problem with your motherboard, which could be an expensive discovery if you’ve replaced everything else on your system but the motherboard.  That’s why I suggest buying a new system if you can save up for one.  It’s far easier to buy a fully functional system, I currently own a Dell, and it can even prove to be cheaper in the long run.<br />
<br />
Best of luck,</div></div><hr />

voodoo3 video card, and thats all i can think of for now, if anyone has any ideas please help me out, i need it bad<br />
<br />
<br />
Have you changed any settings recently that may be affecting video performance, update to DX9 by chance, etc.?  There is a slight possibility that DX9 is so far removed from the Nov '00 V3 drivers that it's causing these problems.<br />
<br />
Since I don't know what changes to your system may have occured from the last time it functioned properly until you started having this problem, I'll just throw some ideas at ya.<br />
<br />
1.  Run scandisk.  Pretty basic and guaranteed to not solve 99.6% of all Windows related problems but hey, it might work.<br />
<br />
2.  You run fine in full screen but crash in windowed mode - try setting your desktop to 16 bit color (which is what a Voodoo will run any game in) and make sure the desktop is running at least one resolution higher than the windowed game (eg., EQ windowed at 800x600 and Windows at 1024x768).<br />
<br />
3.  If you have NOT installed DX9a then go to www.microsoft.com/directx and look for the link to the DX8.1 (might be DX8.0a) drivers and reinstall them.  If you have installed DX9a try running it's installer again or do a search on google.com for a DX uninstaller, run it, then patch 8.1 back in.<br />
<br />
4.  Download a utility like regclean.exe or better yet, hit symantec.com and get the trial to Norton's Utilities and run the full spectrum of tests and repairs.  Even if it doesn't fix your problem it'll improve your system.<br />
<br />
5.  Re-install the Voodoo3 drivers from Nov '00.  This is the last set of drivers that are approved by SoE to work with Everquest.  The Feb '01 drivers and most &quot;aftermarket&quot; drivers do not work with EQ.<br />
<br />
6.  If anything in your system is overclocked, return the hardware to original operating speeds.  Blow the dust out of your computer while you're at it.  :)<br />
<br />
7.  Go into the BIOS and disable Video BIOS shadowing and caching along with Video RAM caching.  Disable System BIOS caching as well.  Some software/hardware configurations have problems with these being on due to memory address spaces and certain low level system calls.<br />
<br />
8.  Visit the Windows Update site if you haven't lately to install any critical patches.  This is unlikely to resolve your problem but it's a good idea to do it anyway.  You can find it under Start - Settings - Windows Update...<br />
<br />
9.  If you've disabled virtual memory or limited it in size for any reason make sure to return control to Windows.  If you've never messed with it then don't sweat it.  It doesn't change on it's own.  Note:  Norton's Utilities may want to set and optimize a permanent swap file.  You can go for it but it's safer to just leave it under Window's control for now.<br />
<br />
10.  Disable any unecessary programs running in the background and in the taskbar prior to playing EQ or any game for that matter.<br />
<br />
11.  Make sure V-sync is enabled for Direct3D and Glide/OpenGL applications.<br />
<br />
12.  As a last resort re-install Windows over itself to restore any possible missing files.  Make sure you run the setup from a normal boot of Windows and not from DOS or safemode.  When the setup ask if you want to preserve newer files say &quot;no&quot;, finish the install then visit the windows update site and install all critical patches and reboot.  Re-install DX8.1 (or 9a maybe), the Nov '00 Voodoo3 drivers, and sound card drivers... in that order.<br />
<br />
13.  Shake the monitor and slam your fist on the desk screaming profanities at the system box.  I swear to you this works.<br />
<br />
14.  There's more but I'm too tired to think straight at the moment.  By the way, these suggestions aren't listed in the order you should do them.  Just pick the easiest ones first and test your games after each one.  Doing them all (except for uninstalling DX and installing Windows again) isn't a bad idea though.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to agree with other posters here on upgrading your system although I know for a fact that a 733MHz P3 is sufficient processing power to run EQ at 1024x768 with a decent graphic card.  Try looking around for a GF4 MX440, GF3 Ti500 or better at a local computer shop.  They run around 50.00 - 100.00 US.<br />
<br />
If you want a faster processor without having to upgrade your mainboard and system memory visit powerleap.com and look at the Celeron 1.4GHz w/adapter, heatsink and fan for 119.00 US.  It's not the best option but it's there if you want to take that route.  Upgrade your system memory to 512MB as well.  Don't bother with more than 512, the memory is obsolete at this point but still cheap enough to warrant adding an additional 256MBs if you want to get a little more out of your system before ditching it for a new one in the next year.<br />
<br />
Good luck and keep in mind that you don't need a 3GHz, 1.5GB DDR RAM, GF FX5900, blah blah blah just to play EQ if you decide to upgrade.  It certaintly can't hurt, just a waste of cash in my opinion.  I used to do top o' the line for years, but now I generally keep my system two steps below the top.  My $$ go a hell of a lot farther that way.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />
*EDIT:  Download Ad-Aware and a Virus scanner as well if you don't have those two utilities at your disposal, run their patchers and do a system scan with both.  Ad-Aware is a decent spyware/trojan cleaner that's easy to use at www.lavasoft.de and Anti Vir is free for personal use at www.free-av.com<br />

<br />
What?<br />
You want him to buy ram that his system might not support so that he can have it sit next to the computer in a static bag, ready for &quot;when&quot; he gets a new board.../nodd Sounds good.<br />
<br />
Just buy what your board supports, if you want to upgrade the ram.<br />
<br />
You'r issue has the sound of an os or driver related issues, as it only happens when you alt tab, or try to camp out. Almost sounds like something is hanging in the background, possibly a call to video or sound would be my guess.<br />
Your board is most like just a AGPx2, so be carefull if you try to by a newer card as your board most likely doesn't support the power requirments.<br />
If you have another video card, depends on how geeky you are, I would suggest switching it out and seeing if it makes a difference.<br />
<br />
Whens the last time you FFR'ed? (Fdisked,format,rebuild)<br />
Has horrible as it sounds, if your haven issues like this it might be the best place to start first before you through money at a porblem you haven't pin pointed.</div></div><hr />
