<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Damn these bastages own me everytime with their 1k ice comet nukes. I've bought some resist gear so that my unbuffed FR and CR is 102 and 105 respectively but it's still not enough. With self buffs I'm at 130ish. I could buy more resist gear but I'm wondering if it's really going to help, do I need near 200 resists or do I need 200 resist s and a few more levels?<br />
<br />
I absolutely love seb and plan on being there for a long time. You can't always have the luxury of an enchanter so I'm usually CCing with slow+root parking. No big deal with the bok and jhin wizards/shaman because I can laugh in their face as I resist 99% of their nukes while they are parked. But man oh man.... those damn krup wizzies just nuke me into a pile of ashes so damn fast.. Get 2-3 of those guys on one pull wthout an enchanter and cleric and it's goodbye shammy and goodbye group lol.<br />
<br />
I currently have a froggie crown, BD bracer, 2 velium diamond wedding rings. I could afford another BD bracer but what else is there that could pump up my resists to at least 170ish? Or am I deluding myself into thinking I can resist a krup wizzy at 57 even with lots of resists?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Levels do effect resists massively.<br />
<br />
There is a +30 CR/FR range item called Stone of Morid or something.<br />
About 2k in bazaar normally. Another +30 CR may help quite a lot.<br />
<br />
Also Cloak of the Icebear is dirt cheap (100 plat?) and adds +20 CR.<br />
<br />
You can also ask a mage real nice to summon you a +15 FR/CR back/shoulder item maybe.<br />
<br />
Potions of Greater Heat (shaman made) add +25 CR/STA.<br />
<br />
There are probably other cheap items that add decent resists.<br />
Do a /bazaar search for Shaman/+svc price range 50pp to 2kpp and see what pops out.<br />
<br />
Think u can search by +svc (save vs cold).<br />
<br />
Or go to www.eqprices.com and do a similar search (limit it to exclude nodrop items).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lol I forgot all about my cloak of the icebear sitting in the bank. Omg that stone of morid would be perfect , thanks for the suggestion. That stone, the cloak and one more BD bracer and I'm at 180FR, 200 CR :) Should be interesting to try it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At level 60 in Seb today, wearing standard gear (~50CR/FR) my resist rate was well over 50%.  With self resist buffs, ,I'd guess at my resist rate being upwards of 90%.<br />
<br />
The best resist gear you can get is levels unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Levels help quite a bit when it comes to resisting regular spells.  At 57, you will prolly want to get your resists into the 150's range at a minimum if you are looking to avoid some of abuse those Krup casters are shovelling your way.  Some spells that mobs cast have negative modifiers to your resist values so you may need to go pretty far above what seems reasonable to expect any resists.</div></div><hr />
