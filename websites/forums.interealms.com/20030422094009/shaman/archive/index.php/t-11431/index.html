<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">from the title, i am looking for a good partner for my shaman. he is 62, and gear is no worrie. just looking for a good tank class to PL and use a good duoing partner. anything but another wis caster and preferred doesn't cast really at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Buddha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd go with an SK. Just because they can snare, tank and dish out decent damage.<br />
<br />
Rogue for non caster, that's providing you tank for him :)<br />
<br />
I've seen some pretty damn mean shammy / mag combos too..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have a 56rog already.....too much work to waste healing myself and him just because i have to tank and he out taunts me.<br />
<br />
the mage thing was an idea that crossed my mind a few times, wasn't quite sure.<br />
<br />
SK's hava mana and no real good hp-to-mana regen till high lvls....<br />
<br />
can you elaborate more on the mage combo possibly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarlen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I 2 box and 61 shaman and a 63 monk. A monk can tank very well, can pull in tight places with out training and is just damn fun to play :)<br />
<br />
<br />
hmmm having some sig issues =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lovisla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Must say the Shaman/Mage combo work very very well together. Duoing HE guards, with me playing a 51 Shaman grouped with a 46 Mage we broke the 8 guard spawn and held it till we were tired about 8 hours ...in the end we allows our pets to dual and his fire pet throughly spanked dogdog ...we made loads of xp and money with no deaths (couple close calls though ..and oh god the newbies lol)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I partner with my wife's Pally frequently and that works real well.  The down time is really mitigated by the fact that her heals can help offset my cannies.  Plus her buffs are of the cleric variety (valor and eventually heroism) which stack well with our own.  <br />
<br />
Also heard that necros make good partners.  But havent tried it for any extended period of time.  Supposedly rangers are good too, as SLOW really helps offset there weaker damage mitigation, but my assumption is that this is really only true at the lower and mid-game ranges.  I wouldnt want to be the healer of a ranger on the wrong end of a flurry or rampage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've had my 52 ranger tank in poi before against slowed mobs and wasn't alot of difference in the amount of damage taken versus tanking the same mobs with my 55 warrior. My rangers ac was around 950 buffed, my warior is closer to 1250 buffed. The atk rating of the mobs is higher than the ac of either toon so ac doesn't matter as much. I've heard of many a well geared ranger 62 or so tanking in tier 2 and even 3 PoP zones with the right aa's. A ranger can get agro as fast and hold it better probably than any other melee, combine dual wield with a snare, a flame lick and any old dot and hes gonna get pissed and stay pissed. If you do go ranger make sure you put all points into stamina and he'll have decent hp's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bgum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">make a ranger cause we need them.  :D <br />
<br />
besides Aesa already made a sk to go with the legions and legions of sk's we already have.  And Herific has a monk.  Be different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kiegar Dar`Grunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As my Ranger I was duo'ing with a Shaman friend in PoJ, in the basement. He was 60 and I was 53. I was tanking just fine after he got it slowed. 0 downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You said you wanted a tank and that limits it to 3 classes.  Wars just dont have any plus besides us needing to heal more hit points on them.<br />
<br />
I would go with a sk because of snare.  Both pallies and SKs can single pull, pallies with lull line and SK with FD.<br />
<br />
Plus if things go to bad shaman can gate and SK can FD.<br />
<br />
Both SK and pally will be able to keep agro over your shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">leave it to barboki *guildie* to get all up in my business, christ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Alot of people on these boards bash warrior 2box but with the amount of attention it takes to play a shaman Well it is still my favorite combo. Snare is unecessary so many places with the percentage of mobs that are immune to run speed changes. FD splitting isnt that useful to me either in xp situations because of the time it uses up. Plenty of places to fight at all levels where singles are possible. Shaman can rootpark or warrior with good enough gear can easily tank more than one slowed mob if need be with a little practice.<br />
<br />
Dont let anyone talk you into something. Try em out and find something fun that works for you. Nearly any class can combo well with shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have been duoing with a SK for awhile now and it works great. They can tank pretty well, they do good damage, FD pull to get you single mobs, they have great agro control so you don't have to worry about them holding agro when you slow the mob, they can snare and they can keep themselves alive pretty well with their lifetaps and such and at higher levels even get a spell that heals you and gives you mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am currently 44 with my shm, and am bringing up a warrior to 2 box with, he is currently 18.<br />
<br />
the reason I went warrior is cause I have a full set of crafted for some odd reason :)<br />
<br />
I also went frog for their good starting numbers. right now it is great, we will see what happens higher up, but I think it will work well. snare is the only thing that I think would be nice, but IMO not worth it for the loss of AC and HP, not to mention I don't have any ranger gear :(<br />
<br />
I am pretty excited too, I picked up a wakizashi of the frozen skies and a mithril 2 hander for 400plat.<br />
<br />
one question though, do I have to have the weapon in my primary to gain in skill? so if I have a piercing in primary and a 1hs in secondary, will I gain 1hs as well?<br />
<br />
anyway, I vote warrior, but I have always been a fan of tanking, why I chose a shaman in the first place I guess :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kyntanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My cleric grew up with a monk and it was awesome to group with him. He was always saying the best duo would be shaman/monk.  On the other hand I play with my son's sdk a bit and I really enjoy him as well.<br />
<br />
I would go with a monk or a sdk.  Both can FD, snare is nice to have but like someone said not necessary.  The spells the sdk has to gain agro and keep the mobs off us is nice too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Yes you will get skill gains for both but as your secondary attacks are based on your dual wield ability, you wont get skill ups at nearly the same rate.<br />
