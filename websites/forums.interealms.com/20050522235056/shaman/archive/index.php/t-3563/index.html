<br />
Currently I'm on my 8th day. Broke my wrist 2 weeks ago so  very slow typing for me and I haven't been playing eq much. sDon't have to work since I&quot;bve got a physical job, and gone through 5 flats of beer so far (5x24=1290 i think??) as well as two quarst of rum and 1 pint of vodka, in addiotion to going to the bars 5 out of 8 nights so far.<br />
<br />
Dion't mind me I'm drunk.</div></div><hr />

edit: ps. Pudding helps the beer go down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't decide if it was the one and only year I spent in college or the first 20 years of my marriage. I can't remember either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm....while in the AF we would end up drinking about 15-20 beers a night. We took Sunday's and Monday's off cause those nights were country night at the club. I think we did this for about a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A few years ago...<br />
<br />
I was transferred from Chicago to Florida... six months later I was assigned to go back to Chicago to shut down my own office (still populated with the 80% of my friends who hadn't taken or been offered the transfer.)  Everyone had to hang around until the end- financial incentives- so it was definitely a month long bender.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's 10:00 AM and I'm not drunk yet !!!&quot;<br />
<br />
And to make matters worse, my hotel upgraded me to this huge suite... so every night was party night at my place once the bars closed down.   I vaguely remember catching some zzzzz's in the sauna, the lobby, anywhere quiet.  :)<br />
<br />
Good times!  Somehow in the middle of all of that I managed to find a Chicago job, too, so when I got back I was ready to put in my notice.  Yoo-hoo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I remember when getting drunk was cool, back in high school.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmmm...17hour non-stop binge when my girlfriend passed her finals. I think we hit every bar in South Belfast on that one....all very hazy now hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">5 days straight every year when I'm tutoring new students at my school. Get up at 7am, open the first beer, finish at 2.30am at the school and enjoy a quiet beer by myself on your bike going home (in a more or less straight line). Do this 5 days straight and add a weekend 2 weeks later with dead drunkenness and no sleep for 72 hours. Of course, this wreaks havoc on my EQ time and I just might have to play a couple of hours this year... hmmm..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Promptly spent the next day cleaning it up and never wanted to repeat the experiance.<br />
<br />
A buzz is nice now and again but it takes so damn much booze to do it for me. If I skip straight to the hard stuff then I don't have all that much fun. Just the meaness and the headache so I just drink a couple and move on now.<br />
<br />
I once had a dentist comment to me, (After giving me like 6 extra shots in both sides of my jaw and 4 extra turns on the Laughing gas) &quot;You sir, have the brainstem of a horse&quot; <br />
<br />
I though that was quite funny actually (well it was laughing gas after all) But my AT must be at 200 and I never even practiced.<br />
<br />
(Sigh) Damn Irish Genes.<br />

I get a little sick and tired of smart ass kids thinking it is a cool thing to do, to brag about abusing alcohol. I see people who have not only destroyed their own lives but the lives of their families and friends on a daily basis. <br />
<br />
If you want to drink that is your business!! But don't try to make it sound like a macho wonderful thing to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember children,  sure drinking alot is fun for a few years.  But after you see a couple of your friends get alcohol poisoning from binging and they almost die or they get so drunk they think they can run away from the police and drive over some elderly man trying to cross the street you may not think it is so cool.<br />
<br />
Moderation is the key.<br />

Right on.<br />
<br />
Drinking everyday is for college students or drunks. After college I had to be a work everyday no matter what and be at 100%. Drinking all of the time wonk make that happen. <br />

Another one with some sense!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bragging about drinking is lame.  Kinda makes you look high schoolish, as someone mentioned earlier.  It's just not a propos.<br />
<br />
Hell, I'm a college student, and I drink.  It's actually required to finish my degree.  I can't help that!<br />
<br />
Sure, it's generally okay to drink, or get drunk, for a couple of years while you're young.  It's never gonna stop, and damned if it isn't fun.  Nearly everyone does it, and they come away from it just fine.  <br />
<br />
Just gotta keep in mind those few that end up alcoholics, die from poisoning, get pregnant, or drink and drive and kill themselves or someone else, etc.<br />
<br />
Moderation! Even when you get drunk (and I do every now and again) don't make a habit of getting piss drunk like 5 days in a row.  It's just silly.<br />
<br />
Generally when I get really drunk, I can't even think about drinking for a few days anyway, but that's just me.  I have friends who can drink one night, get up in the morning, and have a beer.  That just disgusts me, heh.</div></div><hr />
