<br />
Headlines! <br />
- Boat Gnomes are now available all the time. (and I thought gnomes were only good as appetizers) <br />
- A new edition of the newspaper is available in your home town. Come and get it! <br />
<br />
<br />
Boat gnomes <br />
---------------------- <br />
<br />
The boat gnomes and other alternate means of travel are now available. During this period of gnome servitude, the boats will be in drydock and receiving some much needed repairs. <br />
<br />
only took 4 years to kill the boats... thank god!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The boats were back??? <br />
<br />
Havent stepped foot on a boat in who knows how long. I could guess this is referring to the the boat in Gates but have no idea since I didnt waste the money.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Aye but it was a bitch for me to get to abysmal sea with the current screwed up mess that we have. The last time I went there it took me 3 boats to finaly zone.<br />
<br />
I also fall through the damn lifts in kelethin too, but I 've figured that one out. If you move as the lift starts to move you stay on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Last night I was PL'ing a group of twinks in Overthere who then decided to run to Dreadlands... (yeah, that says a lot about my days as a shaman lately - I know)<br />
<br />
So I take off running my SK and SHM through FM, then into DL - just 2 zones over right ...<br />
<br />
Everyone else runs straight to the PoK book, hops a stone to FV, and then to DL and is there waiting for me when I get there.<br />
<br />
:(  And I remember when running from Greater Fay, or worse, Steamfont or Erudin to Dreadlands used to be a HIKE... now it's just a couple (small) zones away too ... <br />
<br />
I haven't actually charted it, but I think now, every point in the game is at most 5 or 6 zones away from any other point, and that's being extreme like VT ... most are much less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I also fall through the damn lifts in kelethin too, but I 've figured that one out. If you move as the lift starts to move you stay on it.<br />
<br />
Aw geesh ... I dunno about these days, but back in '99 in Kelethin lots of folks had lag/packet problems with the lifts.  Your position didn't update if you lagged, and the lift would go through you, so when your client caught back up you were below the lift and fell to your death :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had to run to Chardok the other day, was quite a hike still but that's about as bad as I can think of. Katta is a fair way if you don't get a port and just use pok stones. Karana's are also a bit out of the way, splitpaw or NK for example.<br />
<br />
By and large though travel times are a thing of the past. I can't think of any run I did recently where I had time for Spirit of the Cheetah to come available before I actually arrived, or very nearly did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">worst zone to get to would have to be split paw, as far as without a porter.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Without any porters ... Sebilis can still be annoying ... where else.... <br />
<br />
Split Paw, just stone over to Qeynos and run ... not too bad, but still ... not like it used to be.  Qeynos itself used to be annoying.<br />
<br />
Or running from Erudin to Crushbone back in the EARLY days in '99 ... that was a night's worth of playing in and of itself.</div></div><hr />

Actually, you can cut a little bit of time off of that trip by going GD &gt; PoM &gt; CS &gt; WW &gt; ToV.<br />
<br />
So, assuming just PoK books, how about Ssra?  Nexus &gt; SH &gt; Echo &gt; FG &gt; TS &gt; SD &gt; Grey &gt; Ssra.   Luckily several of those are small zones, but I hate running to Ssra.   Other than porting to TS, is there anyway to cut time getting there? <br />

Once to the necro in QH, once to Goonda (i think thats his name), twice in NK from various mobs and twice in highpass.  That was before I knew druids or wizards could port.<br />
I think that adventure was what really hooked me on this game.</div></div><hr />

Oooo! Caanus, you bring up a good point, I just got a seru gate key last week, and after wandering around that place for 30 minutes or so, I ended up gating out (Gate potion, since I'm a ranger).  How do you get out of there and back into the &quot;normal&quot; section of Seru?<br />

<br />
Most of it are just ports but the feel of the run is just like running from halas -&gt; freeport, stressful, long and can't wait to get there and bind your ass somewhere safe.. (ya I know you can't bind there but I try to after every patch :)</div></div><hr />

Only run through if you're nonkos-- or you'll seriously die.<br />
<br />
Best to turn off Height Filter with a map to see where you're going.<br />
<br />
Entering Arx, you are facing south.  Turn left and go forward (east).  Go up the stairwell to your left (north).  You'll end up in a NE corner (stairwell will continue and go back down to where you came from).  Exit the stairwell to the southwest.  Take the hallway south all the way to the end, and make a right, entering room through a door to your north.  You'll note on your map a secret passageway on your left (west center of room)-- go through and make another left through another door to your south-- enter room and click portal.<br />
<br />
This brings you to the maze.<br />
<br />
Go:<br />
left (S) at the junction<br />
right (W) at the junction<br />
continue briefly til another junction<br />
right (W) at the junction<br />
left (S) at the junction<br />
right (W) at the junction<br />
right (N) at the junction<br />
left (W) at the junction<br />
continue long way til another junction<br />
left (E) at the junction<br />
continue briefly til another junction<br />
left (E) at the junction<br />
continue long way til the end, click on portal<br />
<br />
Basically, if you do it enough, you'll be able to memorize your own path (or just follow the map with height filter off).  I just remember:<br />
<br />
L,R,L,R,L,R,R,L,L,L,click<br />
<br />
<br />
This brings you to the central hallway around seru's chamber.  Go straight (N) past door (can peek to see if Seru is there if you wanna, he shouldn't agro if you're careful-- even though you're nonkos in the arx, he is likely kos), make a right at the end (E), and the portal is to your left (N, center of hallway) (this is just one big square hallway with chamber in the middle).<br />
<br />
This click sends you right to the zonein next to Marus Seru.</div></div><hr />

Being a nerd, I know the exact sequence... U,U,D,D,L,R,L,R,B,A-Start<br />

Actually, Capcom had a similar sequence on their first release of Street Fighter 2 for the Nintendo (American version)-- it allowed you to play two of the same characters at the same time (i.e. Ken vs Ken, Ryu vs Ryu, etc).  I was mocking a friend of mine who ordered the Japanese version and he found out that this feature wasn't in it-- plus he got it later than I did. haha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was still having this problem in Earth last night, sometimes I would un-duck, sometimes I wouldnt (I swear shaman use the duck-interupt feature more than any other class. Our spells cast so slow, so if your slowing and you see another shaman got it, you duck. Or if your nuking and you see the mob died 10 minutes before VS went off, you duck). Finally I just got an SoE, its never been a problem while levi, only when standing.<br />
<br />
As far as the whole &quot;Boat ---&gt; Ports ---&gt; Nexus ---&gt; PoK Stones&quot; progression thingy discussion, I personally like the fact that I can go places MUCH faster, but I think it has created a generation of spoiled rotten EQ players. I hear constant whining about how far away Gates is, and there is no good ports or stones, etc etc. When I ask people if they want to go here or there for some tradeskill or loot items, I get answers like &quot;Too far to run&quot; etc. I think this is why Luclin is mostly empty. I think its why casual players dont experiment with Gates more. People just don't want to run anymore. <br />
<br />
Heck, I remember being bound in Kelethin, taking the boat, not being able to find a bind in FP, trying to meet some friends at the Derv Camp in WC, getting eaten by griffens multiple times, and STILL kinda having a blast doing it. Boy it sure was nice when people FINALLY started getting to level 29 so they could port! Of course, Druids cornered the market on the &quot;Fay to Antonica&quot;traffic in those days, cause they got WC and Wizards got CT, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(Searching &quot;Arx Key&quot; or &quot;Concilium Report&quot; doesn't show anything under equipment)</div></div><hr />

   Here is the allakhazam link to the Arx key quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2001) ...  Hopefully soon somebody will submit the actual key to allakhazam so they can link the actual reward of the Arx key..<br />

Anyone know any quick and easy way's to rais seru faction?  Killing Thought Horros in ML works, and they are all green so I can kill them nonstop, but it looks like it's gonna take A LOT of them to do the trick.<br />

Participating in a Grieg kill is a HUMONGOUS hit ;-P  I went from dubious to warmly in one Grieg kill.<br />
<br />
It's also unlimited charges, plus it's a GROUP teleport (know anybody you hate? muhahaha)</div></div><hr />

--- bah someone beat me to it.. Barindu kinds sucks to get to... it's like (least zone wise) everfrost-&gt;natim??-&gt;natimbi-&gt;quimi(sp)-&gt;barindu.. 5 zones if invis drops at the wrong time kiss your ass goodbye.. <br />
<br />
Most of it are just ports but the feel of the run is just like running from halas -&gt; freeport, stressful, long and can't wait to get there and bind your ass somewhere safe.. (ya I know you can't bind there but I try to after every patch :)<br />
<br />
Carry some invis potions with you. If you click them as your invis icons is blinking you dont actually become visible, since they are instaclick. The only real issue on the run is the possibility of hitting a see invis along the way, which seems to be an issue primarily in Q. Just have to be careful there and con the archers first before gettign near them :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Hrmm ... no ports at all - I think the worst has to be Temple of Veeshan.<br />

Closest is Great Divide for PoK stone.<br />

Then:<br />

GD &gt; EW &gt; Kael &gt; WL &gt; SS &gt; CS &gt; WW &gt; ToV<br />

That's 8.<br />

<br />
I count 5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">worst zone to get to would have to be split paw, as far as without a porter. Not only is it the most number of zones away from a book but think the zones themselves are the largest landwise.<br />
<br />
Actually you could always take the Antonica Portal in Nexus to the karanas which puts you right at the bridge which takes you to S Karana.<br />
