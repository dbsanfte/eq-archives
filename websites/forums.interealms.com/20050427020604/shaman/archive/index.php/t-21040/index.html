<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some info on Droga please.<br />
<br />
Specifically - I'm looking for Goblin Depredators that drop the Blade of the Depredator, and Goblin Dust Hoodlums.<br />
<br />
What region are these goblins located in? <br />
How tough are they?<br />
What's the best way to pull them?<br />
Are they solo'able?<br />
<br />
I've been reviewing some of the Droga threads here, and this thread on the beastlord forum:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqbeastlord.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=7713<br />
<br />
Can any of you Droga experts glance over this and tell me what region on that map I can find the Depredators I need.  I have a sinking feeling that the Dust Hoodlums I'm looking for will be near #20, since that's where the main Dust Hoodlum is, but is he/his camp solo'able?<br />
<br />
I know nothing about the new Droga.  Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
My magelos are below.  I'm trying to farm some quest gear for my SK an earring, and my SK and SHM both possibly that regen ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seen those items drop near the king camp, so anywheres in that vicinity. If you can single pull em ya can solo em, every mob in droga should be able to be soloed by a 65 shaman if able to get single.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Once you get a little ways into the &quot;inner sanctum&quot; area the mobs that have a chance at droping the quest items are common, Hoodlums and Depredators included. <br />
<br />
As Stolastorv said you can solo them, as long as you can single pull them.  The Hoodlums are rogues, and as such have no tricks to worry about.  The Depredators are SK's and do have a pesky HT, send dog dog in to take it :).<br />
<br />
I assume you're looking for the quest drops.  I found that the quest drops were hyper-mega rare (or maybe the RNG gods just hate me) and it was not worth my time soloing them, as after weeks of soloing them I got one sash, and thats it, not a single ice fetish or dust symbol (the two I wanted).  I had hoped to purchase ice fetishes from the bazaar in Ay Ro, untill I saw one sell for 40K, then the market dried up.  At that point I decided that the prayer shawl was not that long of a quest.<br />
<br />
If you want to get the quest drops, I'd say get a couple friends and camp the kings room (or any of the named in the inner sanctum).  You'll get drops that way and it makes it easier to kill lots of goblins.  At least my experience is you need to kill and kill and kill and kill to get any of the quest items to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In the bazaar on Maelin at lunch when I was home they had 3 of the ice fetishes for 4k each, and 1 of the ice staff for 3k.<br />
<br />
So what's that 15k for the whole shoulder piece - ready made right there in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In the bazaar on Maelin at lunch when I was home they had 3 of the ice fetishes for 4k each, and 1 of the ice staff for 3k.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sigh, you're braking my heart Cicero!  If you can buy the parts for under 90K i'd just do that.  If you can buy the parts for 15K I'd definatly just do that. Droga is one of my favorite dungeons to solo in, but the stupid drop rate of the ice fetishes seriously made me decide that the shawl quest was not THAT bad.  <br />
<br />
Good luck either way, and I almost forgot!<br />
<br />
I did not mention beware of the wandering gobs.  They are often gaters that can cause trains, especialy if you have two, and loose track of one while dogdog is on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
Also beware of runners, especially when fighting on raised areas or nearby other mobs just out of aggro range.  Bind outside and I'd recommend just gating if you get 3 or more in camp at once if you are in the Inner Sanctum.  Yes you CAN manage 3, but it isn't mana efficient and generally leaves you vulnerable afterwards.  3 mobs in the NE section on the other hand are pretty trivial to deal with. ;) <br />
<br />
Hoodlums and Depredators are scattered over much of the Inner Sanctum section, as well as several other areas (which I'm sorry I can't recall off the top of my head).  Get a clicky invis item if you can (Ring of Stealthy Travel, Tae Ew Ritualist Mask, etc) and you can easily search for them.  <br />
<br />
Just remember the non-named mobs can respawn as any of several types (kill mystic, hoodlum respawns) so you might be better off just mowing down mobs in a large arc from say King all the way down to Ice Master Cialin with maybe an occasional foray to nail Heaprit's PH &amp; any of the other Rogue/SK named/PH's, because they will always be guaranteed to be the same class as their named.<br />
<br />
The Quest drops from the trash mobs are as already mentioned EXCEEDINGLY rare.  I camped the sashes for my spouse's enchanter.  We were lucky in about 5 hours the first night to get ONE sash.  Second day we spent about 8 hours and got none, but I bartered some of the named drops we had picked up w/ another Droga farmer (a necro) for one that he had picked up.  Be sure to network with any other Droga farmers while you are hunting - some are only aware of the named drops and can be unfamiliar (or uncaring) about quest pieces.  This can really help you out sometimes.  :cool:   My third night in Droga camping sashes for hours finally netted us our third one, and we were VERY lucky.<br />
<br />
Since that time I have soloed in Droga many many times and I have only rarely obtained any of the other non-named quest drops.  Friends who farm in the zone have similar tales to tell.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend that you bring at least a full group with you, the more DPS the better.  Just pull w/ Malos &amp; Slow and you can also double as main healer if your friends are equipped alright.  Soloing there for quest drops would be torture, though I have a Mage friend who did it for a few weeks before he got quest pieces for himself, his cleric friend, and his bard alt.  He's a bit crazy I might add...<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Prices on torv are crazy, ice fetishes are 20kpp, never see the other stuff for sale. I got the shawl for my cleric alt since I had a shoulder item I liked already. I got 1 fetish myself, friend gave me one amd another friend bought me the third (i paid him back) for like 7kpp. I've spent a few hundred hours in droga, seen 5-6 cave lord sashes, 3-4 ice fetishes, and maybe 1-2 of the other drops. About 50-60 hours were in the inner sanctum, never seen em drop elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree on the multipull, there's too great a risk that you'll get a runner while getting beaten on and you'll end up with 10.  Control the multipull if you can, root them all, back off and gate.   Doesn't take long to run back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went down there last night.  On my way down, I saw a bone depredator in the hallway ... figured, &quot;HEY!  There's one.&quot; ...<br />
<br />
So I back up, get dog, and pull the depredator.  Dog eats HT, malos / slow and I'm golden ...<br />
<br />
Then a roamer walks up, shaman type, and starts dotting me and dog.<br />
<br />
So I switch dog onto shaman, malos / slow it, and root the depredator.<br />
<br />
Shaman gets worn down ... GATES!  I'm figuring, well, lemme finish that depredator fast.<br />
<br />
So I'm back on Depredator waiting to see how bad the damage control's gonna need to be since I have no idea where that shaman came from ... <br />
<br />
Next thing I know, I've got about 12 lvl 60ish goblins pounding me ... can't channel gate, and well - it wasn't pretty.<br />
<br />
I'm going back down again tonight.  1 on 1, or even 2 on 1 I was ok.  But 12 was just plain messy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If it makes you feel any better, that Depredator probably didn't have a blade anyways :)<br />
<br />
I have solo'd in droga on and off for a few months (5?) now.  I've never seen any of the quest drops  (except 3 or 4 Drogan Warlord Insignias...which aren't for one of the new quests).<br />
<br />
As you mentioned, there are roamers now that make Droga a little bit tougher...especially when they gate.  I ran into a Ice Master (lvl 60ish wiz) that was roaming through the *Piklo* area (lvl 52ish mobs).  Surprised me, I didn't have any resists buffed and when he gated I have no idea where he went.  Didn't wait around to see that train. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As it stands now - after bazaar scrounging... I have 2 blades of the Depredator, a Hoodlum Symbol of Dust, and a mark of imprisonment.<br />
<br />
So ... from Droga/Bazaar I still need:<br />
<br />
5 ... Hoodlum Symbol of Dust<br />
2 ... Heargrin's Heart<br />
1 ... Blade of the Depredator<br />
<br />
========================<br />
<br />
I'm going to go back and keep working on these pieces.  I need to look into that Heargrin guy and his area and see what it'll take to do him.  I think if I can just hole up somewhere with no roamers I'll be ok.<br />
<br />
After my defeat in Droga to a few goblins, I went to VT and solo'd one of the Pli Va Dyn there near the entrance to make me feel better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've done a LOT of hunting in Nurga, the baby-brother zone to Droga.  There are similar free-the-slaves quests in Nurga, with the same type of rare-item drops.  These item drops in general are incredibly rare - I'd say a 1% chance or even worse - the drop rates are really unbelievable.  The quest items are so nice - it would be really nice if they'd up the drop rates a bit.<br />
<br />
I can hunt for hours in Nurga and not see a single item drop - running through about 16-18 goblins in each spawn cycle.  <br />
<br />
From this post, it sounds as though Droga has about the same type of drop rate.  Goody - something to look forward to  :p <br />

Yeah, if one gates on you and you're not with a VERY strong party, root the other mob fast and gate.  Once one gates you've got maybe 10 seconds before the adds arrive :).<br />
<br />
edited to add<br />
<br />
Its easy to underestimate the gobos.  One on one they're no match for a moderatly equiped shaman, as their slowed dps has a hard time outpacing any of our HoT, but if you get a couple on you, especialy the ice and flame masters nuking away with no way to interupt them, you've got issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I tried it again last night.  EXACTLY the same thing ... same spot and all... Depredator was still there, so was that roamer.<br />
<br />
This time I ignored the Depredator and went for the roamer when he came strolling by.  I still couldn't stop him gating, but this time, when he gated, so did I :D<br />
<br />
Question now:<br />
<br />
Between Spirit Call AA and VP - which should I focus on next?  Would the Dogs be a better choice for their push, plus last longer or would VP work... and with mobs that chain gate, would VP really be that effective?<br />
<br />
My spell lineup in Droga is:<br />
<br />
Tnarg's Mending<br />
Gate<br />
Cann<br />
Malos<br />
Turgurs<br />
Blood of Saryn<br />
Breath of Ultor<br />
Quies.<br />
<br />
I use Ring of Immobilization for it's 2 second chain roots, and Pendant of Malosini after I get the mob malos'd and slowed to help those roots / poisons along.<br />
<br />
I have that hammer Righteousness from Ssra, but would it even be worthwhile to try and rely on that for a stun?  To bring out my epic or that hammer I have to unequip my staff of lost rituals, and I REALLY prefer that to be up.  And can those mobs even be stunned?<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with mana or HP one on one, or even 2 on one vs. the SK and SHM when I tried to take them both at once... but 3+ and I get bogged down really fast, especially when one of the casters basically says &quot;**** this - I'm outta here.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i have done a lot of hunting in Droga.As for a strat here is mine<br />
spell line up is<br />
1 Q<br />
2 Canni<br />
3 BoS<br />
4 Nabe<br />
5 Pox<br />
6 BoU<br />
7 Slow<br />
8 Gate<br />
<br />
I can pull singles or 2 for most camps...i can Do the king room all singles...my strat is root rot...For all camps except the king room i do not malos...<br />
<br />
i Root(scaled avatar leggs) slow...epic...root...BoU...root....Pox....root...bane....root....BoS...root... canni &amp; Q...root...bane...root...epic...root...BoS...now they are dead...some mobs require fewer dots. If I pull 2 mobs i cast VP to get separation...then i follow above strat &amp; every 3rd root &amp; re root the add...i do not dot both of them jsut one at a time....<br />
Another strat when you have a pull of 2 or 3 mobs is to root park the adds &amp; kill the PH now gate out...no need killing the adds if you are only after the loots...when i do Runri i cast a pet to eat his HT<br />
<br />
there is no refresh on root so while gems refresh i cast root...loos almost no time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, with that 2 second root-ring, I just re-root 'em while the gems are refreshing from a spell or after a canni.<br />

Maybe my problem is that I'm still trying to kill the first depredator I see out in the hall instead of going to a camp somewhere.  I may try a different spot and see if that has different results.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure where you are exactly Ciccero, when I was trying to get quest drops, and was soloing, I found the easiest place for solo pulls is by the hidden room.  There is a single static spawn there, and a walker.  I wait till I see the walker walk up, then walk away, the unpack dogdog from suspension and kill the static spawn, then kill the walker as it comes by.<br />
<br />
I have had problems with gaters on occasion too, but not a constant issue with it.  I ussualy slow and tank the gobs instead of root rot, and try to get a set of procing weapons for the dog (GHL if I can find a pair in the bazaar, or beg mage weapons from a guildie).<br />
<br />
But seriously I would not advise trying to solo for quest items.  For me at least it seems like I had to kill roughly a million billion goblins before a fetish dropped.  Try talking some guild friends into camping one of the named in the Inner, offer to let them have all the items that drop if you can loot the quest parts.  Its just easier to kill the hordes of goblins needed to get quest drops with a good group, than solo (at least for me, but I'm still not particularly well equipped, and only have 56 aa, so I'm not a killing machine :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You're actually better off rooting the wanderer and absorbing all his spells, finishing the depradator, and then gating.

<br />
....or<br />
<br />
1. Wait for the roamer to leave. Depending on the path he takes, when he wanders off it could give you enough time to kill the mob you want before the roamer comes back.<br />
<br />
2. Invis up and follow the roamer to his spawn point and kill him there.<br />
<br />
3. Pick a camp that has mobs you want that doesn't have roamers, if possible.<br />
<br />
4. Pull your mob to a safe spot and fight it out of the path of any roamers.<br />
<br />
I usually don't mess with the roamers in droga. They seem to channel gate 9 times out of 10, and it's always ugly. My problem was 2 boxing a beastlord and when a roamer gated, the BL just stood there waiting to die.<br />
<br />
Now I two box a necro, problem solved. Roamer gates, shaman gates, necro feigns death. If the mob gates when it's rooted or VP'd, sometimes you have a minute or so to gate (or finish off the other mob) before the train comes.<br />
<br />
Droga is a great zone, but the price of loot from there has gone down drastically, so I for one am looking at other places to farm / PL my necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ospri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I avoid new spots in Droga until I figure out the roamer pathing, and where/what order I need to kill mobs in to either avoid them gating, or so that it's no big deal if they do (i.e, there's nothing up for them to aggro along the path back)<br />
<br />
On those occasions when I screw this up, I root them while they're casting and gate (or camp if I'm reasonably sure there's nothing by their spawn point that will aggro even though the gater can't move)</div></div><hr />

Yes, thats the one, the NPC for the &quot;magic pool&quot; quest.<br />
<br />
On one side of that room is a hallway with a single static spawn near the hidden room, and a walker, on the other side of the hidden room is a room with three static spawns iirc (that room then leads to the courtyard, then the kings room).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does anyone know if &quot;pet pulling&quot; works for the PH/King spawn?<br />
I've never tried it.  I generally invis to the King/PH spawn, placing myself immediately behind him against the wall, and tank him in the face (without swinging any weapon) without a pet.  At 65 you won't get adds unless you move around or push him out of his spawn location.  There are a few threads in this section of the boards that describe this strategy for killing Droga named in greater detail.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>KaeruWak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hey guys...I just recently finished the hybrid earring quests, after a lot of fighting down by the king.  Just stick with it, and bring as many friends as possible and you'll roll it out in no time.  With the cash you can come out of with that place each night, it shouldnt be too hard.<br />
<br />
My favorite spot down there, is a small room due West of the entrance to the king's cave.  There is only 1 pather there, and he spawns just outside the room, so he will never gate.  Also, if you pull it right and dont overextend yourself, you'll never get adds on gaters either, if they do get away.  From that spot, you can take the king and seer, if you've got some dps friends, and get maybe 3 or 4 of their drops in a 3 hour period, plus 2 to 3 quest items a night.<br />
<br />
Pet pulling the king was very easy with my SK, for you duo'ers.  Q'ing the pet helped greatly, but I've now got shrew, and its hardly needed.<br />
<br />
Other safe spots include just before the Jail area, where theres a small ramp with no pathers.  Excepting himself, Seer Gramolk's spawn point is also safe.  There's also a great safe spot by the tables, but it doesnt always have the right mob types for quest drops (there are ice masters around there though).<br />
