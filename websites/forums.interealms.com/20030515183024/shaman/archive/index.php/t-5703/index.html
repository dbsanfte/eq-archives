<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had an awesome awesome thread with all my hunting experience post patch, but when I went to post it it told me that I had too many images in my signature (i have none?) and when I clicked back my awesome awesome thread (THAT I TOOK ALMOST AN HOUR TO WRITE) was erased.  So you get the condensed version, maybe i'll write it again tomorrow:<br />
<br />
1)  moktors in UP are decent exp, but they vary in level.  some give 4%, about 1/2 give 1-2% (in my experience).  all the lower level ones make it not worth it to fight here, imho.  If all I got was the highest level variety it would be great.<br />
<br />
2) xin thall centiens in ME.  in the NW corner of the compound, there are a few high level ones you can pull.  I get 3% or better every time from these.  They also drop cool loot.  here's what I wrote on eqmaps about centiens:<br />
<br />
These come in one of two varieties: cleric or gimp-shadowknight. <br />
<br />
The SK version casts dooming darkness, despair, invoke fear, a 220ish lifetap, and boil blood. I have killed about half a dozen of them and have yet to be harm-touched, although once I think I did see the HT spell particles, though i never got hit by it. <br />
<br />
The cleric version comes in three flavors, which I distinguish by which nuke they use to own me. <br />
<br />
Retribution Version - Level 51-53. They nuke for 500ish max, but I am level 60 with 110MR and their nukes barely touch me. They probably have about 10k HP. Since these are lower level, though, they only give 1% AA per solo kill :( <br />
<br />
Reckoning Version - 54-55 mob. These hit with you with reckoning for about 650. Probably have about 12kish HP, and give 3% of an AA, usually. These are pretty dangerous if you are not on your toes. <br />
<br />
Judgement Version - 56+ mob. Very, very, very nasty if unprepared. The will nuke you for 925, and have about 15k HP. They give me 4-5% of an AA per solo kill. The first centien I ever killed was of this variety, and dropped a vah shir claw earring and gave me 5% of an AA. This motivated me to kill more! The second time I found one of these, he dropped the pally spell Healing Wave of Prexus. The third one dropped a stone idol (thanks!) <br />
<br />
I find these to be a very fun and rewarding mob to fight against, as well as giving great experience. I might be able to get better exp by killing goranga gatherers 10,000 times, but centiens are MUCH more fun and exciting, because there is danger! You never know if your next pull will be a judgement mob that gives you the fight of your life :)<br />
<br />
3)  Gorangas in ME - These are exactly what you expect.  Slightly under 1% of an AA per kill.  Boring, but the goranga chief drops divine inspiritation which would be a big upgrade for me.  They're worthwhile exp because you can chew a bunch of them at once by root rotting.  There are a few (hunters for example) that are higher level and give 2 or 3% per kill sometimes!.<br />
<br />
4)  Our favorite mob:  FG shrooms.  I timed myself, and I got 41% of an AA in 2 hours time exactly.  I had KEI, but not canni5.  I had no down time at all.  This was using a conservative technique of killing one at a time.  Tomorrow I will try killing entire patches at once.  The zone is not as crowded as it used to be.  since the resist changes, the slow is much harder to resist and it really slows down exp for melees by destroying their DPS.  However, I laugh at their slow (100+DR) and even if it does land, I don't care :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes FG shroom still very good, it is rarely camped after resist change.  <br />
for my expreience, if you fight 2 or 3 at same you can actually kill more spawn than single fight; <br />
<br />
I ususlly pull start with FM, pull 1st shroom with slow, pet agro, cast pox, plague,epic <br />
then start pull 2nd shroom with slow, cast 3 dot(or add bane if you want faster), then re-dot epic on 1st shroom<br />
now start 3rd pull(or torpor yourself before 3rd pull) with same spell,except I add bane to 3rd after some canni<br />
<br />
after 3rd, I canni and ususlly regen 40% mana back after all die, dance for few and ready again; if you don't use bane and canni a bit between pull, I can usually keep 2-3 on me unstop without canni5 aa<br />
<br />
with this killing method, I can clear 8-9 spawn easily while only killed 6th if single fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">centiens dont' sound like fun to me =) got 3% aa per gargantuan in M.E. and they hit for tons less than moktors. However if shrooms in FG don't resist our dots as much as I thought after trying torrent of poison in a group a few times I might have to go try them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Killed another 50 mushrooms tonight using Shamam's technique.  I noticed that I do indeed kill more mushrooms over time by fighting several at once and using slow, but more efficient disease dots.  Thanks!<br />
<br />
Beermine:  This week I've killed about 300 mushrooms, and have yet to get a single resist :)  This includes slow, disease, poison, and epic dots.  Resists are definately not something you should worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am a big grouping shaman. Don't have the patience for soloing and i am really not good at soloing. 4c and 2nd floor ssra have been some of the best exp i have seen so far.  In 4c i had paladin 2 rogues me shaman enchanter.  Too bad we weren't there for long.  Fortunatly, i'm gonna be fighting on 2nd floor for a long time b/c most of my guild still needs that piece for emp key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Galamann... you said it's the best exp you've seen so far... how much was it? need to quantify data to make it useful =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kudadan_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Killing the level 60 guards in seru is pretty good xp. I haven't<br />
tried soloing it, would probably be pretty slow, but not too hard.<br />
I get somewhere between 1/2 - 3/4 blue per duo, so about <br />
2-3%? That's in AA, not lvl 60 xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ok but where in seru? have to scope it out myself.... I need the faction and the exp =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry Beemine, i'd say 4c was like a yellow every 45 50 mins with 90/10 exp.  Was hard to tell b/c some people were going ld from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm a big grouping shammy and by far the best xp I've seen since the xp and resist changes was single group juggs.  Full AA in 3.5 hours.<br />
<br />
We went down last night with a 60 monk, 60 mage and his bot 60 cleric and stayed in juggs at Trak's lair all night.  Made a full AA in 2.5 hours. VERY fun.  Sold most of the spells back to the undead bard at ~30pp a pop so its a sweet loot spot as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Anyone VP enabled try to take a group in there when the Bosses were dead and kill the lvl 60 yard trash?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kudadan_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Plenty of lvl 60 guards over by the arena Beemine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As deep in chardok as I can make it :)<br />
<br />
Clearing through ancient guardians solo is super fun.  Almost have canni5 now and plan on trying battlemaster solo once I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">with pet or no jaidin? and I thought ancient guardians would have adds when pulled?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hermana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">PoM 2% or more per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">With pet and oh ya theres adds hehe.  I think I only got two once, but usually three.  Its realllly hard to get anywhere past that solo though as backspawns start catching up.</div></div><hr />
