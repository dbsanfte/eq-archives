<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Formaldihyde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sunday Febuary 2nd I took a raid into COM to kill Rak for the scale. The raid consisted of a<br />
one  65 Cleric<br />
one  61 Cleric<br />
one 57 Druid<br />
two 52 Rangers<br />
one 53 Druid<br />
one 58 Pally<br />
one 62 Necro<br />
one 52 mage<br />
one 57 Rogue<br />
one Ranger I forgot his level<br />
and myself<br />
We killed 9 Reavers, got lord Gos.. once, killed many of the goloms and undead before we got Lord Rak to spawn. We were pulling to the left corner of the zone when facing the castle.<br />
When Rak spawned the mage brought up his best fire pet. We all buffed the pet with everything we could think of, had the mage take off all resist gear buffed ourselves and I turned in the tear.<br />
After turning in the tear I got as far into the corner as I could and died. I was bound there so np. The necro sic'd his pet (a level 60 warrior) to keep Rak busy and the mage moved his pet within aoe range. The aoe pulled the mage pet to Rak, the necro pet died, and 20 minutes later after many heals from the clerics, druids and me Rak was down to 1/2 bubble of health and the Pally ran in and finished him off. I'm now an epic shaman woot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">did the aoe appear to effect the mage pet? Was it the level 49 fire pet?<br />
<br />
Was the pet summoned before the mage removed his resist gear/debuffed himself or after?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Formaldihyde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes the aoe did do some damage to the pet but not even when the aoe hit it was partially resisted. It was the level 52 mage spell, which I think creates a level 49 fire pet.<br />
<br />
He was summoned before the mage chacked his resist gear but he discovered he didn't have any on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kariina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you had a 47 rogue pick the door? i always thought that the rogue had to be 50+ to be able to open the door. The few reaver raids i have been on there has been a high level rogue there. What is the minimum to be able to pick the door of the castle<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Formaldihyde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">correction it was a 57 rogue sorry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Formaldihyde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll get this straight yet 57 rogue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Killed him with zero mages, using a warrior to tank him the other day for a guild shaman<br />
<br />
Was really easy, 5 min kill (warrior solo'd him down a bit , then everyone zerg rushed Rak at 50%)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xrojbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just killed him last night with no Mage.  <br />
<br />
2 Groups<br />
<br />
Group 1<br />
65 SK<br />
62 Cler<br />
62 Shmn<br />
57 Rouge<br />
62 Ranger<br />
60ish (cant remember) Rouge<br />
<br />
Group 2<br />
62 Shaman<br />
57 Rouge<br />
55 Druid<br />
58 Druid<br />
57 SK<br />
55 War<br />
<br />
Grou 3 - The shaman handing in the tear<br />
<br />
We were in the first room past the bridge, fighting an already spawned Rak. <br />
<br />
Buffed to full - the 65 SK main tanked.  Pulled the entire room quickly.  Moved in, Shaman handed Tear in, SK took aggro.  After the SK had good aggro (about 5 to 10 Secs) all the rouges engaged, and the Ranger started popping him with arrows.  He dropped REAL fast.  Only deaths were the Shaman that handed in (He survived the initial hand in, but kept getting summoned) and one of the rouges died at the end.  Over all it was probably overkill.  The cleric ended with 80mana (and did not have KEI).<br />
<br />
His AE did hit the SK, but not hard, was not nearly as hard as I remembered it to be from 6 months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sanosake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It takes 200 skill to open the CoM door, which a 40+ rogue can have. So no, you dont have to be 50+ to open the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggibabi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am a level 64 warrior and had a group in COM killing Black Reavers for the Jade Reaver needed in Ranger and Druid epics. Anyways we had a ranger, a rogue, Paladin, 62 shaman, and my 2 boxed 61 Druid. SInce most of us have been involved with the shaman epic a few times.. we knew not to attack Rak if he popped.. we were in the throne room killing the BR.. when Rak spawned.. the ranger, attacked.. I moved my druid behind a pillar and also stepped there myself.. knowing the paladin could just rez the ranger after he died.. and Rak lost aggro.. But it wasnt to be.. rogue and ranger died to the AE within 30 seconds. and Paladin fell soon after, while we all yammered at them to hide from AE. Anyways.. after they were dead. I thought .. What the heck... I will attack him and have my Druid evac when she is almost OOM from healing me.. I was lucky to have her FR/CR resist on me from my earlier excursions with some wizards..so my FR was at 78 (which is low.. but level dif helped some too)<br />
I attacked and noticed that I couldnt cast any DOTs on him with druid.. since she was staring at a pillar.. and i really didnt want her to get AEed. well anyways about a few secs into fight I noticed the 62 shammy was smart enuff to hide behind a pillar too =)..  she helped heal me and dotted a few times..  I pretty much chained healed me with my druid which only does about 1/2 my health.. since its capped near 3k and I had 6.5k HP.  well.. we killed him.. much to our amazment since we always used 2 groups before with nukers and mage pets =P.. <br />
Just wanted to post my little story in case some people cant get  2 groups or mages to come help them.  just get a warrior and 2 druids with the 58th level heal.. and you should have no problem. <br />
If you can add a damage dealer.. would be great .. as we all know..Warriors arent much on damage..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As mentioned in other threads  - Rak is really a big wuss nowadays. The AE range is small, so casters can easily stay out of range of it. With a high level tank (58+) with resist gear and buffs, Rak is easily tanked. When I did it we just zerged him and he didn't live long enough to cause significant damage.</div></div><hr />
