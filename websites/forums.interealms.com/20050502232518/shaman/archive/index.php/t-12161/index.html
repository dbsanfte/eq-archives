<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All,<br />
<br />
I wanted to thank you all on your awesome advice about my REIF.  I sold it for 4999 PP and sold my Tin Mail Shirt for 3500 PP and I was able to by a Lizzy and I had a friend make me a Tae Ew Chain Tunic from 2 Tae Ew bloods I won.  This was the best purchase I have made in game so far bar none.<br />
<br />
Now onto AA.  I just dinged 58 this weekend and got 11% into it.  I am now working towards AA # 3.  I have Run 1 and Regen 1 so far.  No sure how to progress through AA's or should I just lvl to 60 then AA?  I was thinking of doing Regen 2 and 3 and then Wis 1 &amp; 2 before I started to exp grind again.  Please let me know what is good to do.  What should I not waste my AA on and what are must gets.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Take everything with a grain of salt and only my personal opinion..  Innate Wisdom would likely be trained about the time I hit 300 AA points.  It's just that worthless to me.  Wis gear comes as you gain in levels.  You will likely look back and wish you never gotten it.  If I had it to do over again.  I had 117 wis when I dinged 60, and now have 248 wis at 65. I have never once taken any item because of the wisdom on it. It just happens to come on the items you start to take.<br />
<br />
I would go run 3 first.  If not in a guild, I would go straight to 65.<br />
<br />
RS3, regen 3 are the old stand bys.  Cannibalize 5 is an enormous change.  MC3 -&gt; Canni 5 next. Then ND3 <br />
<br />
You're a long way from that so I'll leave it there.<br />
<br />
Pretty much just do whatever is fun, but I'd suggest very strongly against putting an AA point into Innate Wisdom.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get Run 2 and 3 then do nothing but 100% regular xp till at least 60.  The 60 and stop for aa or 65 first debate has been done in other threads so I'll just comment on AA.  First, imo Wis 1 and 2 is a waste, you don't need it.<br />
<br />
After Run 3:<br />
<br />
Meta 2(or 3)  (get some nice stat food/drink, it will last ages)<br />
Mental Clarity 1-3 (we don't need this but it is a requirement for Canni V)<br />
Canni V (massive AA, better than anything)<br />
Spell Casting Mastery 1-3 (This will greatly increase your abilities in casting, huge mana savings)<br />
Natural Durability 1-3 (Good HP upgrade, about 250 hp based on your current gear)<br />
<br />
After that its dependant on your play style. MGB is good if you are in a raid guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Run3, Regen3, MC3, Canni5... in that order.  Metabolism I suppose you could substitute for Regen3 but IMO, food isn't THAT expensive anyway.<br />
<br />
After that there's lots of room for debate depending on your playstyle, guild, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What's the deal with regen3 and races that already have innate regen?  Is it worthwhile to get or is it partially nerfed for those races?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The other races get the exact same benefit for the same cost that non-regenning races get.  <br />
<br />
I agree with Jaradis and the others, don't get Innate Wisdom.  <br />
<br />
Proceeding to MC3 and Cann5 depends on if you have Torpor or not, imho.  If you do, then yes; if no, then maybe think about just heading for 65.  It's a no lose call.  Either way works just fine.  <br />
<br />
I had like 9 AA after being 60 for about a year before PoP came out.  That's how little I worried about it.  Since then, I finished MC3, Cann5, SC1 (which is great), RC (which is also great), MGB and QB1.  I suppose I'll get QB2 next, then switch over to SCM, because everyone seems to think that one is great.  ND is very tempting, because my gear blows considering how long I've been around doing stuff.  <br />
<br />
Achetype AA make me cringe for some reason.  Maybe I'm having flashbacks to working on Mental Clarity, which seemed so worthless except to get to Cann5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Run3, Regen3, MC3, Canni5 in that order is the route i suggest. After that you need to decide for yourself whats good for yourself , just look at them and think what you want your shaman to be and how you want him to grow in power.<br />
<br />
But definetly focus on can5 for now , that is truly a game changer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Radiant Cure 1 is another one that is a definate one to pick up.  It cures a lot of things and is very very handy.<br />
<br />
And the reason I say Metabolism is because once you have Torpor/Qui (and I guess Stoicism too) regen just doesn't seem to make much difference, and I hate having to buy food and things like Tormenter Stir Fry (+50 hp) are not easy to just go pick up at the local merchant.</div></div><hr />
