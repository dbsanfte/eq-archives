<br />
this may be a bonehead question too considering my years of play, so DOH ahead of time.<br />
<br />
i consistantly contribute loot to the tribute system (guild) and yet have NO idea how to use it! is this a GL function only? and say if i decided to make a personal tribute (never have yet) how the heck do you *turn it oN*?<br />
<br />
i have not bothered with personal tribute because of having to go to my hometown...and also because usually i am grouped with guildies, and not soloing.<br />
<br />
thanks for any insight=)</div></div><hr />

  alt u brings up the tribute window.  there is a personal and a guild tab.  The guild tab can only be accessed by a guild leader.  For personal tribute, you have to go to your tribute master and pick which skills you want.  Then by clicking alt u you can activate/de-activate it anytime you wish. <br />
  There are some nice focus effects if you are missing them for spells up to 65 like mana pres 4 etc.. (dont know if they extended it for oow spells) and you can get hp/mana/stats/resists.  Personally i just have 25 to all resists that i use for quarm and GoD prismatic/chromatric AE's.</div></div><hr />

All the major focus (IH, MP, ER, etc) have up to level 5 focus now, which covers all spells to level 70.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad to hear that they extended the tribute system to cover level 5 focii.  I figured, given Sony's penchant for ignoring the obvious, that they wouldn't get around to extending Tribute to support level 70 spells until sometime after I had achieved level 80!</div></div><hr />

Guild tribute goes up to lvl5 Focii?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yup. I upgraded to Mana Pres 5 and Magic Resistance 5 for today's Emp raid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">can click your origin hotkey to go straight to your hometown also, after you purchase it. not a bad way to get to Oow quickly from anywhere in Norrath either.<br />
<br />
does have a reuse time of over an hour though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was looking for a way to get Q to cast quicker and longer during battle, so I figured I'd get the 2 tributes for quicker and longer lasting buffs, since supposedly quick buff shortens Q cast time.  (I have QB1 AA and it does shorten Q cast time).<br />
<br />
So I singled out each tribute and activated it to test its effectiveness.  The buff extension tribute at Tier 4 had no real effect on how long Q lasted -- the buff icon showed 30secs remaining for an instant but then changed to the usual 24 secs left and proceeded to countdown from there.  <br />
<br />
Then I tried the quick buff tribute.  It did shorten all the normal buffs like Fot7 and such.  However since it didn't work with our heals, I won't be using that tribute for quickening heal time in battle.<br />
<br />
I did find that Power of Alacrity shortened cast time on our heals, and that is the one to use for more effective healing in battle.</div></div><hr />
