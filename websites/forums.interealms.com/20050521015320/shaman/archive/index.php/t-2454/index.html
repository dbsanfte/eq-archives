<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at a point right now that the thought of quitting EQ has come across my mind...<br />
<br />
I'm lvl 55 and no guild.  Very frustrated with EQ right now.<br />
<br />
The reason I have no guild is the last one I was in lost most of its members to another guild.  The few remaining didn't do very much grouping... no raids what so ever in 2 months.  <br />
<br />
So I ended up staying guilded during that time and went on 1-2 raids when invited by friends in other guilds.  (I stayed guilded out of loyalty, but left after some things were said to some other people.)<br />
<br />
I'm frustrated with this &quot;game.&quot;   For the last few months I had some poor results on: exp, gear, epic, groups, etc.   So I've been soloing a lot.... doing something... trying to work on quests...<br />
<br />
I think I've hit a dry spell perhaps... maybe I need a &quot;vacation&quot; from the &quot;game&quot; for a few weeks.   ...then the thought of just letting it all go came to recently. <br />
<br />
What I would like to know from any of you is what would drive you or make you consider quiting for good?  (Yes, it all comes down to what I want with my shaman, but maybe someone will remind me of something that I've forgotten about when it comes to having fun with this game.)<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Toh<br />
<br />
PS  Not looking for sympathy or anything like that.  Just feel like I am at a cross-roads with this game, and would like some advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">take a few off and see how ya feel then. I felt somewhat what you are at 55 too, and came pretty close to leaving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I completely understand your post, for a game, it really doesn't seem like much fun sometimes.<br />
<br />
If you like raiding, the best thing to do would be to level (as a member of a raiding guild, I would welcome the freedom to just do what I wanted, when I wanted including leveling like crazy) to 60 and attempt to join a raid guild.  It doesn't have to be the uberest guild on your server, but any nice, high level, stable raid guild on your server.<br />
<br />
If you're bored and you see a guild where you know some folks doing a raid, ask to come along! Help out all you can and learn as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Network!  In a guild, I find myself grouping with the same people 95% percent of the time.  I have a passing acquaintance with lots of high level people on my server (mainly from my server board) but few out of guild close friendships.<br />
<br />
As far as good exp groups, pay attention to who are the same people on every night the same time as you.  Build a regular group of likeminded, daring yet skilled adventurers, do fun things!  Crawl Chardok, crawl HS, crawl SG.<br />
<br />
Because a grandmaster in one of the tradeskills.  The Xanthe earring quest has really demonstrated the value of being a 250 tradeskill person (250 tailors are insane, imo).  Hopefully, more quests like this will come along, that reward individuals for their hours of clicking.<br />
<br />
Stop into Halas, buff the hell out of some true newbie shaman, give them a little trinket and let them see what a shaman can do.<br />
<br />
As far as gear goes, you would flat out laugh if you had seen what I was wearing at level 56.  RMB?  Jarsath pants? Epic quest shield?  The availability of very nice gear attainable by a single group is staggering.  Divine inspiration, bone braced buckler, bracelet of sense....  <br />
<br />
If all else fails, take a break from the game.  Norrath can be a very frustrating place to be sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find that taking a break is very useful. Best solution is to delete EQ from your pc. That way, you have to really WANT to log back on, so you have to go through the crap of installing and patching eq to start playing again. That stops you from logging on when you &quot;have nothing better to do&quot;, and perpetuating the frustration. Not having the immediate option to log in is cool cause then rather than re-installing and such, you can (for much less effort) clean the house or read a book or play Doom(TM)! (Unless you are too young to remember what Doom was, in which case, i dunno, some old fashioned first person shooter, or maybe an rpg, or something =P)<br />
<br />
Personally, after dealing with the human's on the other side of the keyboard that dominate my server in the GMT +8 timeslot, and finding out what c__kheads they, in the majority, are... I just cancelled my account. I actually deleted eq the day I finished my spellbook (minus eb/lev/acu dar khura/primal) then recently re-installed it to log in and cancel my 2 accounts. At least that way I don't have to pay A$100 per 3 months for eq for a while.<br />
<br />
Still trolling these boards tho =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One simple thing to remember:  Its a game.  Its meant to be FUN.  If its not fun, make it fun or stop wasting your time.<br />
<br />
Now... what is fun to you?  Is it fun to pal around with some friends in a chat room while slaying virtual monsters?  Is it experiencing new things in a &quot;harmless&quot; environment?  (I've been harmed by lack of sleep, but thats just lil ole me).<br />
<br />
EQ has much to offer, even a seasoned veteran such as yourself, but you need to be sure you can have fun in the game.  I've been playing almost 3 years now (No, not a beta... not even close), and went through a depressing stage where the core officers of a guild I worked hard to help along decided to disband as friends rather than bleed to death and be bitter.  I almost gave up EQ then, but instead played some of my aspiring alts.  My main was/is a 53 Ranger (Hyppy Wayfarer, at your service), but I put him aside back then and worked on my second highest toon... my Shaman.  I started him to play with my wife's alt (Warrior) and my best friends primary (gee, another ranger).<br />
<br />
That was at level 20, now Seanus is almost planar, and I enjoy playing both my toons -- each for their challenges (Ranger -- staying alive, Shaman -- keeping the fool melees from dying).<br />
<br />
My suggestion to you is dig up an alt, and play for a while considering next steps for you shammie.  If the game is no longer fun after that... take a vacation.  Many I know have done that, and come back the better for it.  It is a game... its supposed to be fun =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zumzal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very SImple- When you  are no longer having fun. Especially if it starts to feel like a job.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">speaking as a person who has 'quit' - and now returned, i think i can add something here.<br />
<br />
i quit playing everquest because i was burned out on the game.  i was in a fairly large raid-oriented guild.  due to guild politics, server politics (tribunal) and my own personal distaste for the way the game was played by most people.  <br />
<br />
i came back to the game to play with a few friends.  none of us are in a guild, though we used to be in various 'ueber' guilds.  now, we relax and have fun.  we level twinks, do AA in chardok, do quests, tradeskills.  whatever.  we play the game to kill time.  not to accomplish things like full sets of ueber loot.  <br />
<br />
i have 1 AA point.  i have leftover no-drop stuff from when i quit for gear.  i am missing almost all the luclin spells (have group regrowth and disease resist from a friend).  i don't do raids.  i'm having more fun playing Eq now than i have in two years. :D</div></div><hr />

2.  Play above game for awhile<br />
3.  Go out and see the sun this weekend, it's still there<br />
4.  Come back to EQ after at least 1 month of being away<br />
5.  My EQ break was 3 months and made me appreciate the game all over<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My longest EQ break was a 3 month period.  (2 of em actually)  For 3 months I didnt log on I didnt check the message boards and I didnt even patch.<br />
<br />
When I came back I had a fresher outlook on the game, and it was fun again.  This game requires so much time playing it your going to get sick of playing it.  Everybody does.  <br />
<br />
Just keep your account going, it's cheap and logoff for a month.  You'll feel better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Start a new guy.  Maybe 1-54 is the only fn part for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think the game is at it's best at lower lvls. like 30 and lower.  You are still young to your class and have been able to explore for new hunting grounds to find whats best for your char.  Once it slows down I imagine you know the game too well to actually see it as a game.  I rotate between my online games so they stay fresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I left EQ for a year and came back.  I was in a big raid guild on Xegony and we'd done everything there was to do.  Epic quests, ToV, etc. and the squabbling and bickering over this or that was just too much.  When the chance came to go to DAoC, I took it.  I stayed on DAoC for a year (and am still there), but in truth, I've enjoyed EQ more in the last week since I've restarted, than in the last 6 months before I quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If things do not work in what's left of the guild, don't drown yourself with sinking ship our of loyalty. Don't take me wrong, I hold guild/friendship loyalty most important in game, but I think if I understood the situation correctly you should consider is it time to re-evaluate the things and where your loyalties stand ;)<br />
<br />
Find a guild that's fun for you. Where you're friends are. Where you can get exp groups. Where you can go to raids. Which ever ticks your ticker :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rypt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I too have quit for 6 months, but it was due to family problems. Then I got caught up in a uber-raiding guild, that burned me out rather quickly. Now, I'm playing an alt (my shaman) and in a relaxed guild that can raid but doesn't require you to devote time/resources for raiding. I'm enjoying the game again...well, for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Definately take a break.<br />
<br />
One poster suggested getting Morrowind.  Gonna have to agree with that.  Awesome game.  Just make sure you have the resources to run it.<br />
<br />
I left eq 9months ago and was thoroughly disgusted with the game.  Now that I've come back, I'm very much enjoying myself and my little troll shaman.  It probably helped that I played DAoC and saw just how good eq was compared to that steaming pile of sh**.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Quit when you stop having fun.  If you aren't having fun because of a guild issue, take some time off and come back to EQ when you are ready.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This may be sort of a rant - but I too am having my gaming experience ruined.  When EQ isn't fun, it's just time to just take a break, and if you don't feel like playing after a few months, then it's time to just cancel the account.<br />
<br />
I have a RL friend who is a pain in the butt to play with in-game.  The problem is he helped me out quite a bit and he's a real nice guy - but he's the WORST example of a tank who wants buffs NOW, then goes and pulls when you're OOM, then bitches when he dies /sigh  Med break?  What is that????  Just keep pulling is his mentality.  I worked hard to get to lvl 51, and I'm very seriously thinking of trading my remaining gear to a brand new account, and starting ALL over again...I even gave back the Iksar Regen BP last night so I can start over and not tell him...<br />
<br />
But then I think, maybe I'll just cancel for good - pick up basketball again or pay more attention to my wife...  It's funny how so many different things can cause the same reaction in EQ.  <br />
<br />
It's a game - when you aren't having fun - then stop playing and either do something else, or play another game...  You wouldn't have posted this messagae if you didn't know deep down that it's probably time to give it up (or at least take a break)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Personally, I'll quit when a) the game loses all prospects of being fun (there are certain key people I play with, if they leave, I'm gone), b) my wife tells me to quit again.<br />
<br />
If I were you I'd consider:<br />
1) taking a break and coming back to see if its still work and no fun.<br />
2) get out to OS or Velks and hook up with various pick up groups, many will suck, but you will meet a few quality people.  Ask them about their guild, make all sorts of inquiries.  Find the guild that works for you, shop around.  Find a match.  Apply.  If you like raiding, join a raid guild, if you like exping, join a more casual guild.<br />
3) roll up a twinkie.  I found a wealth of great people including some true newbs in the lower level range while playing my ogre SK.</div></div><hr />

I've decieded to simply take some time off from playing my shaman.  If I get the urge to play I'll play my low level mage on the Tribunal Server.<br />
<br />
Figured about a month.  Won't even visit the boards.   :)<br />

I've told myself that sometimes you need to lose something in order to find it.    I haven't played my shammy to 55 to stop now.  Just need some time away.<br />

<br />
I was very frustrated around level 57 due to slow exp gain.  I stopped, leveled my nearly forgotten cleric from 21 to 29 in a week or so (of just casual playing).  After that, I felt great to pick up my shaman again.  It's about a year later, cleric is still 29 and I love the shaman more than ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">When you start taking EQ out of what you feel its intended context is.<br />
<br />
I will explain with a personal example:<br />
<br />
About a month ago (as some here may remember), I made a post saying I was taking a step back from EQ because I felt like a hamster on a wheel, chasing after rewards I could never catch.<br />
<br />
EQ, obviously, means different things to different people, but to me, it's meant to be a game that I can enjoy, fine-tuning and customizing my characters until I feel they are &quot;done&quot; (which will probably never happen).<br />
&quot;Fun&quot; in EQ to me is mainly experiencing new things and advancing my characters (both in levels and in equipment).  Also, perhaps more obscurely, EQ satisfies my creative hunger.  I have an extremely active imagination, and if I do not find an outlet for it on a daily basis, I get very restless and frustrated.  For me, EQ is that outlet.  By immersing myself in EQ's fantasy world, I am able to create my own fantasy worlds and satify the aforementioned &quot;hunger.&quot;<br />
That being said, the above requirements of my having fun in EQ should never overshadow the fact that, when it comes right down to it -- EQ is just a game!<br />
<br />
But I digress . . .<br />
<br />
At the time I made that post, I no longer felt that I was in the context of what I thought EQ should be.<br />
I was seeing and doing the same old things; I was stuck in the same old gear; and it really was not the creative outlet that it once was.  But, more importantly, I was taking these things too seriously.<br />
<br />
So I took a breather for a few days and re-evaluated what I wanted out of the game.<br />
Sure, I want to strive to see and do new things, fine tune my character's skills, and get new gear.  But I also needed to put it all back into context (that context being the fact that EQ is a computer game and should not run one's life).<br />
<br />
When I decided to come back, I resolved to actively seek out these things I needed instead of whining about them and waiting for them to come to me.  Since that time, I got my epic and a pair of SS chain boots waiting to be turned in.  Not huge upgrades, I know, but fairly big steps nonetheless. <br />
Also, I really worked hard to build up my twink ranger.  He is currently lvl 40 with decent gear, and is really helping me to enjoy the game more.<br />
And the most important thing is -- I am advancing again, instead of being stuck in the same old mold. <br />
<br />
Anyway, the point to that long-winded response is that it's time for a break whenever EQ stops being what you want/need it to be.<br />
And I say &quot;time for a break&quot; instead of &quot;time to quit&quot; because chances are, you will return to EQ eventually once you leave it.<br />
I know this for personal experience, hehe.  I've probably &quot;retired&quot; about ten times.  <br />
Also, hang on to your gear!  Don't sell it, give it away, or delete it.  Because, again, chances are you will come back eventually and want to jump right back in again. <br />
There are, of course, special cases that require one to flat out quit EQ (like serious RL problems, computer issues, relationship problems, etc.).  And RL should always &gt; EQ.<br />
<br />
But anyway, that's my 2cp.  Take them for what they are worth, and never forget that the decision and reason to leave EQ is ultimately up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Leave EQ when you really feel like its controling your life and its making you so pissed and totally burnt out...<br />
<br />
i left a while back after 2 1/2 years of play time.. it was just time to move on. lvl 60 and always raided. just got to me burnt me out made me depressed,<br />
<br />
when i left its a brilliant feeling a whole weight was lifted from my shoulders and i will not go play such a game.. iam 20 now and after leaving EQ my life going alot better so no looking back.<br />
<br />
do what you feel is right. its just a game.<br />

i do miss my EQ buddies ive made over the years but thanks to ICQ\Email i can still keep in touch with some but not all...<br />

<br />
If you decide to come back in 3-4 months, the value of the things you sold will have plummeted, but you're unaffected because you have pp in the bank.<br />
<br />
You'd be able to buy back all the gear you had before with 1/3 of your pp, and keep the rest for twinks/upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">&quot;I'm lvl 55 and no guild. Very frustrated with EQ right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Look around for a guild that suits you. Keep in touch with your friends and enjoy whacking stuff as a bear...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">When I first moved onto my current server I joined up with a guild a RL friend was in.  The guild probably lasted a few months.  All of a sudden all of the officers left and joined another guild.  At the time me and another mate that I play EQ with werent of a high enough level to join this guild.  I was pretty down over the whole thing and another guild on the server kindly offered to take up all of the members that got left behind.  From that day on the game hasnt been the same for me.  I have done new things, seen new places, got my epic, killed dragons, all sorts of stuff.  The people I now play the game with are fantastic and I dont think I have ever enjoyed the game as much as I do now.  <br />
<br />
What I am trying to say is it is worth finding a guild you want to be in - it really can make a huge difference.  If you cant find one that you feel happy in and the game is depressing you IRL then that is the time to take a step back for a bit.  Do as others have said and remove it from your system for a month or so and see if it makes a difference.  It should give you enough of a chance to see if you do actually want to still play.</div></div><hr />
