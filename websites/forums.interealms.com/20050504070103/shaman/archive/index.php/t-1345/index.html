<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am returning to EQ after an extend try at RL. :D  I have choosen to star Zzard, a Iksar Shaman on the Cazic-Thule server and was wondering if any of you have any advice. I do not want to strip my druid to twink him, but did give him a few minor items off my warrior. I have no cash. Also if any one is on this server I could use a few to add to my friend list and would also appreciate a mentor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">do the cudgle quests while you can get exp off the camps. <br />
<br />
do the scaled mystic armor quests as soon as you can...that armor lasted me a long long time ( no twinkage ). when you hit lvl 10 or so start hanging out in kurns and KEEP all the bonechips you get...easily sellable at 3-5pp a stack to people in the zone wanting to faction. <br />
<br />
and dont give up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A good piercer and a set of banded is all you need to get started. This is basically what I started with and I was able to work my way up. Dunno what lvl your other toons are but this shouldn't be too hard. Just remember....ac/hp&gt;wis and you will be alright. <br />
<br />
1 mroe thing, If I was restarting, I would be a troll with pts in sta, as would about half the other posters here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Reroll as a Troll JBB is UBER!<br />
<br />
;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Keep the Iksar. I like the trolls too, but i love being Iksar. <br />
Second, put as much into Sta as ya can and go from there. Never assume your gonna be lvl 50 at most and have crap gear. Make a goal to get 60, get awesome gear and be a god and then go make it happen. I never thought i would kill in ToV, AoW, Burrower and so on, but i have and now i have 255 wisdom and some to spare (259 if there was no cap) So i ended up taking the sta as AAXP. <br />
Third, see if you can get lucky in Karnors with some jarsath items. I got the tunic my first trip at lvl 14 with a few other items. <br />
<br />
Iksar race is a blast and i actually enjoyed the difficulties from the start with the faction and uniqueness of the class. When i made my shaman I was one of like 6 on my server. A lot more now but was still fun to be unique for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks. I choose Iksar on purpose, so I will not be rerolling as a troll, though I will reroll for the stamina. What should be my secondary sta? Wis? Str?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">put the rest into wis, after sta. Although str would be nice for us weak leezards it isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />
