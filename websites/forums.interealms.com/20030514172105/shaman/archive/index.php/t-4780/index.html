<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Copper25</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am only level 41 and would like to prepare for taking him and his buddies out.   How many friends will I need and what level would be nice to know ahead of time.  I want to try to miminize the amount of times I die trying to kill him. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Copper25</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nevermind, I just saw the previous post about it.  /em mumbles about beind an idiot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll throw a few comments.  I recently soloed him to get another set of boots (corpse rotted about a year ago, long scary story ;) and figured, hey I have torpor I can do this...<br />
<br />
Wow he is a good challenge.  First I had to figure out how to fight him solo, I dont have malo so he is basically 100%mr, pr, and also dr (epic landed but no other disease).  I had to train him to the zone over and over to get him away from allt he other darkies.<br />
<br />
I ended up having to flat out nuke him and barely made it after quite a few tries.  He hits fast and hard, 200 is max but usually low to mid 100's.  He doesnt have that many hp though.  Bring a cleric, melee and someone who can nuke with cold spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">duo'd him this weekend with a 54 shaman ( go little brother! :) ) <br />
<br />
not too tough once slowed ( malo'd, slow landed first time) but does hit for 200, and doubles. <br />
<br />
also duo'd him for myself at lvl 58 with a 58 monk. Took a few casts of malosini but it landed and once landed, pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Let a pet take the HT.  (600ish )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree - DD Cold spell was the only thing I could land on him nuke-wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Either I got lucky or Jaidin got unlucky - at level 56 I landed malosi first time, and then turgur's first time.<br />
<br />
His harm touch is an ouchy, but once slowed, it was plain sailing, but then again we had loads of people just along for the ride :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds like I was extremely unlucky hehe.  In 4 or 5 attempts I couldnt land a single spell that wasnt cold based (cept ID and epic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bakumba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I soloed it with my 60 cleric ended the fight with 10% mana. my cleric is ally to MM so i just kited him ... hope that helps =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont think his MR is that high i have done him 3 times with guildies at lvl 45 and got a slow to land every time the ferst time we had 54 tank and a clr but never got a rissist on the slow's even at 45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Black dire can be done solo.  I soloed him at level 56 with jbb.  Also i had to kill advisor to get him to pop.  I invis up go into room with advisor.  I bound at zone by the way.  I dotted advisor as much as possible and jbb him to death.  You will get attacked by others that are close but i just dealt with it and just killed advisor as fast as possible.  When dead, gate out.  Invis back up and go to black dire.  Go up the hill next to him and I casted slow on him and run back to zone.... wait to see black dire near the zone and then zone out.  Zone back in, make pet and buff pet with everything.  Med to full before doing black dire.  Then send in pet and jbb to death and keep pet alive was pretty easy really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did him at 45 with a lv 43 cleric and 53 druid, took us 25 mins kiting at zoneline :)<br />
<br />
Fun as hell, druid died and cleric but we ressed in.<br />
<br />
make someone pull him to zone, train everything dont matter, he will stay at zoneline when all the other mobs walk back.<br />
<br />
Dont need to talk to him or anything, just kill him and loot scale</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if you have trouble getting him debuffed, try casting Malise (yes, just plain Malise, the level 19? one), then Malisement (or maybe straight to Malosi if you are 49+), and then finally slow him. have not tried this on BD but it works like a charm on quag maelstrom in OOT -- could not land malisement or slow the first time in 6 tries, was a real tough fight, next time we pulled him i had malise + malisement up and everything landed first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>MGP4ever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I remember doing him for a shaman friend of mine.  Only 4 of us.  Lvl 60 warrior(uber...NToV/ST/ect), 54 cleric, me (51 monk) and him who I think was 35-40 at the time.  Battle was laughable and over fast.  I think warrior tanked all of them at once and just laughed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kelilea Vallkarie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hey ive heard theres a way to avoid his pathing, by standing on the roof and nuking just the one wolf, is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think Dire is pretty easy actually - I did it with myself (3 characters on two accounts).  52 druid, 54 enchanter, 44 shaman.<br />
<br />
Basically just pull to zoneline with tash - tash him, run and zone, go back find him, tash him, run to zone etc until he is solo.<br />
<br />
Log in shaman and cast malaise, slow (both landed first time) - log out shaman log in druid<br />
<br />
Keep rooted with enchanter and cast dot with enchanter (really easy to keep him rooted)<br />
<br />
Dot until dead with druid - log in shaman and loot.<br />
<br />
So basically I did it with just two characters but shaman debuffs help alot.<br />
<br />
He does have a lot of hit points so it was a long fight (15 mins approx), but fairly easy as long as he doesn't touch you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>slicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Rampaged thru castle with 60war and 54 ranger til we found advisor, dire popped at his death. Camped ranger and logged on troll. Summoned puppy. Was gonna have puppy take the 600point harm touch, warrior pulled black dire to me and I send puppy at him... and with the wonderful pathing in mistmoore puppy ran right past dire LOL. <br />
<br />
At 46 landed slow on second try, no debuffs. 3 or 4 heals on warrior, half dozen JBB blasts ( maybe 3 hit for full, 2 for half, 1 resist and 1 40ish damage hit). Puppy biting all the time ( think he decided warrior had more hp then him so HE should take HT :) )<br />
<br />
Earlier harmonied wolf guards and killed them with 54 ranger and a couple 40ish warriors. Black Dire was up when I entered zone but despawned before we could get to him. Didn't know where advisor spawned so stayed away from castle without a healer... inside of castle WAY to cramped and packed with mobs to go walking around without overkill<br />
<br />
if you can't level-pull the Black dire a ranger or druid can break the spawn up easy enough :) <br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heh, BD's cake if you're level appropriate.  Duo'd him at 56 with my 56 monk friend.  Got absolutely no resists.  The greens were nothing more than a minor annoyance.  Clear them out first then kill the BD's wolf buds then sit down and share a cup a joe with the BD and then kick his arse.  Never even had to heal.</div></div><hr />
