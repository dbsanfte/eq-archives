GUild mentioned something about bypassing the 4 sewer trials by some smith event in GoD.  Haven't seen much info on it, and heard it mentioned once here.  Guild heard that you can bypass withit, but doesnt know much about it.  Anyone able to give some insight on this Smith event, how it works, if it's anevent, a mob, and whatnot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is a way to pass the 4 groups missions in the sewers by doing a raid event.<br />
<br />
If you follow the break down in communication quest you will get all the info you need but it comes down to a simple trigger and kill routine.<br />
(it is actually a kinda fun event the first couple of times)<br />
<br />
PS no spoiler info but this is the quest you need to farm the 4 items for in this zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's fairly straightforward, but needs some planning beforehand.<br />
<br />
The event itself is based in Ferubi. Someone needs to have done some farming of nameds there to get the 4 trigger items (needs a strong group), and to have done the first stages of the Breakdown in Communications quest (needs some farming of bits all over GoD).<br />

<br />
Once someone has done the prep work, you can do the event. It will only give out 54 flags, but you can have as many people along as you want. CoH works in the zone, so you can even park alts at zone in and CoH them to get flagged when the flag mob is up. (Note, evac point in Ferubi is the Riwwi zone line, not the Qinimi one which you'll probably zone in through).<br />
<br />
Oh, and there seems to be some bug with the event. My guild has done it twice and both times several people (myself included) hailed the flag mob, got the text, but didn't get the flag (there's no way of knowing this until you check by hailing the High Priest/Scribe).<br />
<br />
I've heard that it's a bug with the z-axis, and you need to be on the same level as the mob, and not levitated, though I don't remember being levved myself, so not really sure if this is the case or not.<br />
<br />
I never got a reply from the GMs on this (Euro timezone sucks for that), so I don't know if they can/will fix it. In the end I simply did the trial I was missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it's bugged giving flags i'd recommended /report'ing when you get the flag, because that is the only proof GMs will accept that you got the flag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with that is, most likely, by the time you've found out you're bugged, the text from hailing has gone out of the window, and so you can't report it. I found out on a different day that I hadn't got the flag.</div></div><hr />
