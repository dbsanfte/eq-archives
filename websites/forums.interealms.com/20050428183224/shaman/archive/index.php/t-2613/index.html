<br />
I was killing Hill Giants in Frontier when my longtime friend and shaman extraordinare lured me to Mistmoore for some fun. Unfortunately, my baby woke up and I had to camp just on the other side of the zone before I got to see any action. <br />
<br />
We are expecting a session tonight, and I was wondering what to expect, as I have never hunted there. He will have his 32 Mage to accompany me, which brings up the following questions:<br />
<br />
Where should we set up shop?<br />
Who else would be ideal to round out a group of four?<br />
What should I expect?<br />
What would be your choice of spells for Mistmoore?<br />
<br />
I have never hunted there, and was hoping to get a little better understanding before I start running naked through Lesser Fay.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bind just outside the Mistmoore zone.  Don't do it inside as this place can have trains as dangerous if not more so than KC.<br />
<br />
I love this place from level 20 to 30 myself.  After 30 it can still be decent, but you can put yourself in more danger.<br />
<br />
Here is some of what you can expect.  Many if not most are casters of some sort.  Typically Wizards or Clerics.  They like to nuke.<br />
<br />
I would make your way in killing stuff so you get an idea of the one way in one way out nature of the zone.  The greenies can be killers.  Make your way to the Graveyard which is relatively half way to the Castle.  Try that area for a spawn or two to get an idea and see if that is what you are capable of or if you need more of a challenge.<br />
<br />
If you need more proceed slowly towards the castle.  You should find harder stuff working your way in.  Then you can either take the ramp up towards the castle and (I would suggest keep the enterance and ledge by the bridge clear as your camp) either wait outside or you can stay down in the valley or pit area and try the spawns down there.  Consequently at the end of the pit area is where the Black Dire spawns that will give you the pelt needed in the Epic quest.  But unless you group is decent be warned that he can be one mean mother.<br />
<br />
Mostly just be aware that once you clear stuff and pass by any respawn will be exceptionally nasty if you are running for your life.  The mobs do dispel on ocassion now.  Though nothing (98% of the time) can see through invis intil you enter the castle.  So CR isn't too bad with invis.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A warning about the graveyard.  There is a mob that wanders through it that won't aggro, but you can attack it.  This mob is ghosting from within the keep.  If you attack it, you will bring one ugly train out of the castle.  As far as I remember all of the spawns are static in the graveyard, so if you see one wandering against a wall, don't attack it unless it comes after you.<br />
<br />
This bugged mob has been in Mistmoore since release, don't know if its been fixed in the last 6 months or not but its doubtful as they haven't bothered in the past to fix it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking forward to killing stuff in Misty someday...but as of now I am loving Guk right now. Halfway to 32 already, with just two nights of killin....I can't stop! Partnering with a 34 mage and we are owning. Never thought to partner with a mage, but it's working out nice. <br />
<br />
Misty is just going to have to wait.<br />
