the new G.o.D. pet buff aa for 20 cost os teh best !!!!! get that instead.<br />

<br />
get healing gift, the crit is better than increasing our gimp heals by .2%<br />
the ammount from the crit is actually marginally useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do you mean the first AA's to get? Or which to get first of the two healing AA ? :)<br />
<br />
If the latter.. I spent one level in each first, with adept first, then gift second.  Then finished out Adept, and currently working on the PoP ability adept to further it out.   <br />
<br />
The overall increase (although it is slow to increase and marginal) in the base healing of your heals is more important then the random crit.   When I need to heal, it's cause oh crap something has gone wrong and they need hps now, and dont want the crappy random number generator to rely on (for the critical heals).   After finishing healing adept, and having first level of the PoP healing adept, I average from 1500ish to high 1700's with Tnargs, and the occasional and rare crit for 3k and up.  (this is with an improved healing 4 item, elemental/ ornate sleeves).<br />
<br />
But, to step back, I finished out all my spell casting reinforcement aa's first, and quick buff to 2, to get the most bang for my buck out of Torpor (and later Q), before I did  Healing adept.<br />
<br />
Hope that all made sense, and Im sure others opinions will vary.  Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get AHA3 and an IH4 or better item and your heals become a lot less craptastic.  Random crit heals might be cute, but they are very far from reliable.  With AHA3 and Marr's Gift, my heal went from 1300 to around 1850 max or so.  Not super, but way better than before.<br />
<br />
After getting CS3, I was going to start saving AA's for GoD.  As it stands now, I have no reason to save them anymore, unless &quot;Consumption&quot; turns out to be an improvement on Canni 5.  If not, I guess I will go for healing gift next...it's about up there with innate Int though on my priority list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Honestly, I'd say it depends on what you do.  If you are a raiding shaman, I'd give the edge to crits.  Let's face it--we're not uber healers.  When we need to heal (especially on raids when raid buff characters are nearing or at low health agro and mobs hit like speeding mactrucks), we need a good heal NOW.  Those crits usually come at a good time because when we heal, it's usually needed badly.<br />
<br />
If you're not as much of a raider and just exp a lot, then I'd probably give the edge (just barely) to the % increase over the crits.  It makes your heals marginally more efficient, and generally speaking the damage taken in those situations makes crits a bit less important.  The additional (permanent) efficiency is probably more useful than the crits in experience groups.<br />
<br />
This is kind of a switch for me, since before I got both skills, I would have said go with the % increase all the way!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm going to agree with Used Car here, but it is VERY close. Crits are showy, and are nice. But lets face it, the chance of heal crits even with maxed Gift is tiny, and the chance that they will happen when they really count is even smaller. Adept coupled with an IH4 item however causes Tnargs to heal almost as much as the cleric Supernal Remedy spell, and crit for over 3600.<br />
<br />
I would personally start with Healing Adept, and then do Gift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">get healing gift, the crit is better than increasing our gimp heals by .2%<br />
the ammount from the crit is actually marginally useful.<br />
<br />
The crit is maginally useful WHEN it happens, the other 90% of the time its not doing you anything.   Healing Adept adds up 20% to our heals, not 0.2%.  Without an Imp Healing IV focus that brings our 1300 Tnarg's up to 1560, and with a IH IV item its almost 1900.  I use Chloroblast on raids for fast patch heals, Healing Adept with IH IV brings CB up to 620ish max.   Healing Gift doesn't do a damn bit of good if it doesn't ever happen.  Healing Adept always adds some extra healing.<br />
<br />
I'd go with one level of Healing Gift first, its 2 points and gives you the chance to crit.  Then go all Healing Adept till finished, then go back and finish the rest of Healing Gift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Healing Adept good.<br />
Healing Gift bad.<br />
<br />
I like predictable healing performance.  The once in a blue moon crits will get wasted as aften as not.  Full healing adept AA will make Tnargs do nearly as much as our uber 10 second CH.  Advanced healing adept is overpriced, but still better than Advanced Healing Gift imho.  <br />
<br />
I hate AA's that scale up in price (2,4,6), but don't scale up in performance (3%,3%,3%).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IMO get healing gift 1 then max out healing adept. After adept is finished complete healing gift</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail,<br />
<br />
I'm with Used Car on this one as well.<br />
Get HA&amp;AHA first.  1807 Tnarg's with Ornate sleeves are pretty nice, and happen ALOT more frequently than a crit will.<br />
<br />
When I'm main healing in an adventure, I don't plan on getting a crit.  I manage the MA's lifebar w/ Q &amp; Tnarg's.  Since I don't have any other option in terms of heals, making these two spells go further (SCRM for Q, HA&amp;AHA for Tnarg's) makes more sense in my opinion than trying to guesstimate whether a spell will crit or not.  <br />
<br />
When I'm patch healing on a raid, a crit *may* come in handy, but making Tnarg's a better standard heal is worth more to me.<br />
<br />
They are both good AA's, but I think HA has the edge in terms of prioritizing which to get first out of the two.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Morizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for all the responses. I have Ceramic totem of the rathe so IH4 is good. <br />
<br />
Once again hearing different opinions on the shaman clas make me a little wiser.<br />
<br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">just going to agree, overall the slight % increases of HA/AHA add up and are far better than the crits, which take too much luck to be guaranteed any usefulness from.<br />
<br />
With ele sleeves and maxed HA/AHA my heals range from high 1500's to low 1800's.  very frequently and more often seem to hit for 1600's and into the 1700's though.  it's great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have AHG1 and I crit usually one out of every 5-6 heals.  Yes it's streaky, but that can be good.  I got 3 back to back to back crits that saved part of the group on a bad pull.  If they hadn't crit, we'd have wiped.  I have sleeves as well and I'll max out HA/AHA and AHG once I get LR5 (currently LR1), SCM3, SM2 and VP3.  In short ... a long time from now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">grab the first level of crits, then go all out on adept.  the first level of crits is nice because it's cheap yet you get a lot of bang out of those few points.  go adept for reliable healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd bounce between them and get whatever costs less first.  i.e. 2 2 4 4 6 6.  They're both useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">adept &gt; gift</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I personally used to be of the school of thought that a reliable increase was better than a random one.  I've since changed my mind drastically.  Gift is way more useful because it can make a difference.  A 3k+ heal (well 2600 base with no focus) makes a sizeable difference on a tank or anybody.  But more importantly it saves time.  If I crit a heal I'm saving about 5 seconds worth of casting time which is a huge amount of dmg done to the person taking dmg.  Yes it fairly often gets wasted, but it also fairly often saves someone's life when stuff goes sour.  And unless you're the type to use tnarg's when the person you're healing is near full health (I generally use Q if they're not in danger of dying fast and are only around 1300 hps from full, or even a few k from full) you wont' often end up wasting a crit except on spam healing a MT or whoever on a raid...which is also when crit heals are most useful.  So I'd personally recommend hg, then either ahg or ha, then the other, and aha last.  Also with HA the difference isn't that noticalbe till you get quite a few AA points invested into it, whereas with gift you notice right away (though the amount of crits sucks a bit at level 1 and 2, but is very usefull at hg3).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I much prefer Gift. The relatively small bonus from Adept isn't going to save anyone if the base spell itself isn't. Crits do.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is simply outlandish luck, but I find that the crits go off *FAR* more often when the target is very low on HP. I only have Gift 1, and it has saved my groups on many many occasions. At max level, the % chance of the crit going off is what, 18%? That's nearly 1 in 5. Fairly reliable odds, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree with Arriana. Adept is marginally usefull. A crit will save someone much more often than a couple extra hundred points.  When mobs hit for 600 a 500pts bonus to heal means exactly jack and squat.  <br />
<br />
I had many, many arguments with fellow guild shaman about this very same thing.  I did adept only after i had gift maxxed and LR5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zerrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Healing Gift doesn't do a damn bit of good if it doesn't ever happen.  Healing Adept always adds some extra healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
When buying my AA, I went with the a lil more all the time instead of &quot;chance at&quot;. I did, however, buy critability later.<br />
