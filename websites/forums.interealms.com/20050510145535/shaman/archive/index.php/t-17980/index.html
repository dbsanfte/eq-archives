<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sambow87</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, my shaman just hit 27 a couple minutes ago, and I plan to get him to 29 before friday. I'll have my dads 64 paladin to PL myself for 3 days (friday, saturday, sunday). Wondering where I should go, and how I should go about PLing myself? He has a 9 point DS vambraces item, which will help. What are the best spots, and how many levels (if its almost non stop playing) could I look forward too :) hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hello there!  IMO, the key to making your PL'ing session effective will be steady kills.  Your pop's pally should be more than sufficient support for this endeavor.  I have helped a friend who was mid twenties lvl get a few levels in a few hours in OV(overthere).  We camped the skyfire ramp.  The kills were pretty slow, but he was getting 1 blue bubble per kill.  So it didn't take long to get him to lvl 30. (not long with respect to how long it would normally take to acquire those levels) Just keep yourself healed, and you shouldn't have any problems.  Would be great to have a high level slower there with you, but you should do ok.  My opinion is by no means law, and there may be better places out there, but this is the one that I normally hit up for a few levels for the mid twenties-early 30's toons.  Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Find a nice, quiet corner of Dawnshroud, DS yourself with the paladin, keep a heal hotkeyed in case you get into bother, other than that just keep killkillkill all weekend. If it's hard going at first, pull with the paladin and use him as a beating stick to lay on some debuffs until the mob aggros. Just try not to have the mob beating on the front of him or the ripostes may KS you.. ;)<br />
<br />
It's not going to be interesting but it'll sure be quick. You're looking at around 25-30 kills per level up to around the mid 30s in there and no more than 40ish kills from there up to 40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would say echo caverns, Mutant outcast area, but thats just where I have Pled peeps that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Basement in Unrest.  Hard to beat the ZEM at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can't the higher level paladin kill stuff that's green to him that cons higher than green to the shaman so that the shaman gets ridiculous xp?  (nice game design flaw, btw)<br />
<br />
So, find anywhere inside (dungeon with xp mod), park the shaman, and go to town with the pali who should not be challenged vs. greens that give the shaman xp.  You could probably slaughter the pirates in Dulak and get great xp for the shaman, nice loot (if you bother to loot while PLing), and also acquire a flask for your stoicism quest.<br />
<br />
Personally I think PLing is weak and cheesy, but that's just me.  Basically I feel that if playing the game is too tedious for you to actually play it then WHY are you playing it at all?  I usually see the PLing mechanisms in MMORPGs as exploitation of game flaws (and so do devs, read up on EQ2 and see how they're working to eliminate PLing).  But anyways, I'm one of those oddballs that plays games to enjoy them and moves on if they become too much like a job.<br />
<br />
There are drawbacks to PLing.  One, you don't learn your class.  Two, your skills get retarded (and often you spend MORE time later trying to raise them outside of xping to get them up to where they should be).  Three, it's boring - level grinds are tedious enough when you are involved and challenged - running around slaughtering greens way beneath you is beyond tedious.<br />
<br />
You could always group up for some LDoN and make a level every 2-3 adventures...the xp in LDoN is awesome at that level.  You'd also learn your class, meet some people, get some adventure points, and probably have a lot more fun.  Shaman are fun (at all levels even)!  Shaman are great for groups.  Play and enjoy your shaman!<br />
<br />
But whatever works for you.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.  You can only get exp grouped with someone up to 1.5 times your own level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Zhahz... use the pally to buff up your LDON group and then adventure the normal way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gubthup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ec (echo caverns) at the needlite camp is great exp.  They hit fast but don't do much damage.  Once that is cleared if the bogling camps right beside it are open then you can clear then too.  If you can hold all three camps you will be flying through the exp up to level 31 or so if memory servers me correct.<br />
Should be a breeze to do with the Pler you have.<br />
<br />
Good luck in the leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sol A. Huge ZEM, will only last a couple of levels though. Then I'd go to Kedge Keep and do the entrance, if you can put up with the whole underwater thing.<br />
<br />
However, I agree with the above poster about winding up spending more time later to fix fubared skills, although your defense woun't be one of those fubared skills at least, and while fixing spell skills you can read a book. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Somewhere easy to get to makes sense.  Start with echo caverns on the easy side, as a previous poster suggested.  Mosquitoes hit super fast so you optimize the use of your DS and get lots of defense skillups.<br />
<br />
Once your defense is maxed for each level, I'd approach it like this:<br />
<br />
 - paladin pulls with something fairly high agro like a stun<br />
<br />
 - shaman casts a couple low level spells on it to keep the casting skills up.  dots/nukes/slow/whatever.<br />
<br />
 - shaman starts beating on the back side of the mob.  hopefully it turns to the shaman for those nice defense skillups.  Use low level heal over time spell from the paladin coupled with regeneration spell to keep shaman health topped off.  If defense is maxed, a couple quick low level stuns chain cast from the paladin will keep the agro on him where it'll do minimal damage.<br />
<br />
- at some point, the mob will be below 40% or so health, at which point if the shaman's defense skill is already maxed out, the paladin can turn on auto attack.  If you find that the paladin KS's the shaman, then you can do one of two things, either wait longer (til 30% or less health) or equip a lower damage weapon on the paladin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sol A is some of the best experience in the game up until 43.  Some of the gnomes will be light blue, but you'll still levelling very quickly.</div></div><hr />
