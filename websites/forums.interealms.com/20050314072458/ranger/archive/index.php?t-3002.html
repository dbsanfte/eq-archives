<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidar</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have been working on these new bow recipes that came out with the last patch. I'll admit the idea is cool. I'll even admit that the recipe and the work behind it has merit.<br />
<br />
However I am disapointed in the ocst vs reward and the sheer dificulty in making the highest end bow even with Max skill. <br />
<br />
Let me break down for you the cost of this weapon based on Prices on E Marr.<br />
<br />
Mithril Alloy Rod: 3181 pp estimated Value<br />
<br />
 Large Brick of Acrylia - 50 pp if bought from a Vender. 20 pp or so from a player and is a substantial time investment to farm a handful of these from the various zones. Took me 4 hours of nonstop killing in Tenebrous to get 3 Bricks. Estimated value of 35 pp<br />
 Enchanted LArge brick of Mithril - 27 pp for the rick plus the cost of Enchanting. Those in a guild can probably get this enchanted for free. Others may have to pay a fee. For intents and purposes lets say this is Valued at 35 pp also. <br />
 Celetsial Temper - Given the new Tradeskill recipes BD's are now worth in the ball park of 3 K. Finding words and Runes of the appropriate type is not as easy as it sounds once your level passes the areas where these normally drop. Have found a few on Venders costing me 6 pp per word. Solvent is cheap, couple gold. Jar of acid is also pretty cheap, about 6 gold. Estimated value per Temper is 3100 pp. <br />
 Smithy Hammer - 14 pp and is consumed with each combine. Note: I think this is a bug as the by product of smithing the rod is the Mithril Knife. I think that someone screwed up and your supposed to getthe Hammer back instead. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mithril String - 17 pp estimated Value<br />
<br />
 Silk String - couple pp bought from Bowyer Vender<br />
 Oak Bark tanin - made from Oak bark and water. Cheap parts for sure but significant time investment required to gather the bark for multiple attempts. Estimated value of 6 pp per tanin.<br />
 Small Brick of Mithril - About 8 pp and change from Vender<br />
<br />
<br />
Mithril Knife - Small brick, 2 molds, and water - Truncating this one as it is a by product of the alloy rod anyway. If you made it yourself estimated value of 10 pp<br />
<br />
Fletching kit - Same as above. Small brick, 3 molds, and water estimated value of 12 pp.<br />
<br />
Cams - 30 pp each. Bow requires 2<br />
<br />
Branch of Planar oak - Requires many hours of time in Plane of Growth foraging. Took me on the area of 8 hours to foarge 3 branches and on average over the last week has taken me almost 3 hours per branch. Significant time investment and more considering once inside the plane we have no means to leave without help or with a Gate potion. Estimated Vlaue based on time invested and dificulty associated with the aquisition is about 1500 pp. <br />
<br />
Total cost for the materials alone for the Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt - 7,780 pp<br />
<br />
For those who are curious while possible I would not even think about trying to make this bow with a skill less than 230 fletching. The failure rate is way  too high. You can infer then the cost of raising your skill from 200 to 230. This will cost you thousands of pp easily. It is not uncommon to blow 5 K for 3 skill points. Once attained this no longer figures into the value of the weapon but it IS a one time cost potentially totally 20 K pp as a ballpark figure.<br />
<br />
The cost of raising Brewing and smithing to the appropriate levels is much less but can cost you around 2 K all told. Again this is a one time cost. <br />
<br />
Alright fair enough. However, even with the highest skill of 250 the failure rate is horrid. Out of 20 attempts you MIGHT get lucky and make 2 bows with Max skill and max dex etc etc. Chances are you'll only get one bow. Add that cost up in materials alone.<br />
<br />
With that kind of failure rate I doubt I would ever even think about trying to make this bow beyond a few for myself and my guildmates. I cannot ever see this being a market item and this is why - Given that kind of monetary investment the minimum I would charge someone to have me make this per atempt is 25 K with 50% upfront fail or suceed just to cover expenses and time. If I succeed I would collect the other 50 % but the initial payment I would have to keep fail or succeed. With the failure rate that is a lot of money that a player would have to fork over. Is it worth it? In it's current state no I do not think it is. I certainly wouldn't be willing to pay anyone that much money with a very good chance I will not see anything for it. <br />
<br />
This recipe will fall by the waysidew I think once the initial novelty wears off. <br />
<br />
How do we fix this so that people would be willing to pay for the bow?<br />
<br />
I have a few ideas. <br />
<br />
<br />
 Give Fletchers an arrow combination that is mostly or all store bought that we can use to practice skill to 250. Use parts that are semi costly still but not as outragous as what we have now. Acrylia arrows are not cutting it. The drop rate on the Small bricks is too low to make this viable. While it works for short stints of fletching your just not able to collect the volume of arrow shafts you need to gain skill points from. <br />
  Increase the stats of the 4th bow for sure and possibly the 3rd as well. 4th bow is 30 38 250 range 5 str 5 dex 5 agil 5 wis 10 FR CR MR 50 HP 50 Mana.<br />
<br />
Not a bad bow by any means, but when compared with the equivilent Smithing BP for High Elves it doesn't return as much as that BP does for the investment. That BP is bar noine on par with the best BP's in the game for some of the classes that can wear it and only slightly behind the best BP's in the game for the others. Our bow on the othe rhand falls way down the totem pole on the list of bows that it can compoete with. <br />
<br />
If this bow were 33 dmg 36 delay ac 5 250 Range 5 str 5 dex 5 wis Hp 50 Mana 50 10 FR CR MR then I believe people would be willing to pay the outragous prices for this Bow. <br />
<br />
This would put the bow on Par with Bow of doom, Slightly Behind Windstriker and Primal and on par or a little better than AoW bow. making this about the 3rd best bow in the game which I think is where it belongs. <br />
<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents. This bow in it's current form is way too much of a frustration to make and eats up way too much cash to be worth making when it's a simple deal and easier to go kill Doomshade for a Bow of Doom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benji</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can BUY scent of marr from a vendor in EC, and it supposedly works to make the celestial essence. and on a second note, 1500pp for time invested to get a branch of planar oak? seems a little much, and im sure you could find some druid to pop in and port out with ya if your nice enough. And even with the stats this bow has, it is better then going to get a bow of doom. if you CAN go get a bow of doom, great. Some of us cant exactly just pop into umbral and kill doomshade and be lucky enough for it to even drop, much less to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too was looking into this bow briefly, and I think I'll take a pass.  The best of the DN bows has better DPS (like anything else matters).  If I want stats and resists (which are nice), I carry around a non-bow range piece.  It's really hard to justify the expense let alone the time and trouble of making one myself.<br />
<br />
I still believe the price of the bow will drop to 10k each within 6 months, but by then I'll have a bow of doom, and I won't care.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a cultural fletcher you already have this. Blessed Champion Arrows have a trivial raiting over 230. It is unknown at this time if they go all the way to 250. Though considering how high the failure rate is, I suspect they well.<br />
<br />
If you don't like farming acrylia or don't have the time for it, you can fall back on making cultural arrows until they trivial (if they even do.) Although there is a high failure rate on these, nobody is going to be flooding the market with these arrows anytime soon. So every success can potentially sell for 2-3k (or more) to a non-cultural ranger to cover your costs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only us non-cultural fletchers lack a viable alternate to acrylia based arrows in order to reach 250. My poor bank account took a big hit when I was testing this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wood Elf Fletcher #1<br />
Not 200 yet, but if I'm willing to finance his skill ups... he'll try making them.<br />
<br />
Wood Elf Fletcher #2<br />
Only has skill of maybe 20, but claimed to have a 202 wood elf fletcher friend who was supposidly online but never contacted me.<br />
<br />
Wood Elf Fletcher #3<br />
Didn't know how much he'd charge. The way he wanted to do it was that I give him all the ingredients, and play him a fee on the combine attempt (regardless of outcome) then he pushes the button. Now repeat this process over and over again until he gets a success. The guy didn't even have 200 fletching, so I suspect that he just wanted to use me to pay him to raise his skill.<br />
<br />
Wood Elf Fletcher #4<br />
This one was at skill 190. I almost went with this one, but then heard about...<br />
<br />
Wood Elf Fletcher #5<br />
Skill 200 and working with the fletching tool. Cant go above that as he already took another skill higher. His success rate was 1 out of 40, and he only had 3 arrows total available. No, they were not cheap.<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point in time, any fletcher able to make them can charge whatever he wants. Maybe in a month or two, the market will be completely trashed on these things and prices will come down. (Though server economy is pretty trashed over here.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creac</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is still a limited market for these arrows.<br />
<br />
If you don't have Endless Quiver, you're not likely to pay that kind of money for a disposable item.<br />
<br />
I was skill 200 fletcher a long time ago - shortly after they released the silver tipped arrows.  I'm now 203 simply because I've been asked to make the odd bow for a twink or a batch of arrows for someone (who really had too much money to be firing off class 6 steel silver tipped arrows).<br />
<br />
I have some acrylia arrows thanks to another ranger and fletcher on my server, and to a guildmate who also fletches and gave me some.<br />
<br />
I have a source for the damage 12 arrows - a fellow ranger and fletcher - with whom I will discuss price in due course.  I will be generous, so as to contribute to his costs and hopefully help with progressing his skill.<br />
<br />
However, I can not see someone without Endless Quiver paying for these - they're simply too expensive to fire off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL It was 1 arrow. Seriously. I'm almost done with arch skills and have been collecting all my elemental arrows ahead of time. Just missing the ice arrow at this point.<br />
<br />
I was not even looking for a bow and people should not be asking me to finiance their entire fletching career just for one arrow. These were all rangers on top of it. I had to go with a wood elf bard to get price that would end being below 5k for one arrow only. Sorry, if I sound like a cheapass but I cannot put out that much for one arrow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering what I consider extortion pricing for just 1 arrow, I am definately not in favour of Verant giving wood elves:<br />
- addition fletching bridges to make it easier for them to get 250<br />
- ability to make bows better than the AOW bow or what drops in NTOV</div></div><hr />

Of course, i only live on Tallon Zek.<br />

you just have to find the right fletcher. (like me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elured</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's amazing that people are citing DPS as a reason to go with DRV bow (best Necropolis bow there is, 30/37) instead of the Thunderbolt (poorly named, and unlike the Helm of the Tracker, a true slap in the face to all non-fier'dal rangers).<br />
<br />
If one more delay is reason enough to eschew a bow that:<br />
<br />
1) Looks damn cool, no denying.<br />
2) Has better stats than a bow dropped by a dragon (Wuoshi's Skydarkener, which has a crappy ratio to boot).<br />
3) Can be fairly easily crafted, as opposed to being a random/rare drop off of a 60+ creature in Laglin*.<br />
<br />
I think you have some kind of degenerative brain disease.<br />
<br />
It is even more ridiculous to just say &quot;eh, get a primal.&quot;  On Fennin, there are maybe two or three guilds that can even get to Sleeper Tomb with a sizable force (remember the key).<br />
<br />
The only thing that makes getting this bow prohibitive is the combination of the high difficulty and the use of blue diamonds.  3k?  BDs on my server are still dirt cheap; they've gone back up to a whopping 1k which is what they used to sell for 6 months ago.  Why did they even go down to 500 plat anyway?  It's not like everyone's suddenly stopped or started killing things that get you BDs.  Oh, that's right, it's because for the most part the economy is completely random and arbitrary.<br />
<br />
*Yes, that's the correct spelling.  It's in reference to the fact that Luclin hates anyone who doesn't have 768MB of RAM and a SCSI HDD, even if you have the minimum requirements that were listed on the box.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaffis</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I fully agree with Elured. Those of you saying that this bow isn't something to get worked up over are either nuts or so uber that you're in your own little world.<br />
<br />
Frankly, since ratio is everything on archery (with the exception of Trueshot, where damage can come into play somehow.. but with DN bows this is negated since they're all 30 damage), the difference between Light Velium and Double Recurved Velium is on the order of 5%. That's the best and worst velium bow outta DN. Now, this bow has identical dam/delay to Wrapped, which was previously the second best droppable bow in the game. Now, toss in a nice dex modifier on the bow, and miscellaneous other very nice stats (hp/mana, resists, and sta, all w/o swapping in and out), and this bow is truely amazing if you don't have primal or a bow of doom.<br />
<br />
The icing on the cake is: a) it looks cool. b) It has the best range in the game, folks. Look at your Double Recurve. See that 130 range? You have to have Primal/Priceless or a Bow of Doom to have a Trueshot/AM bow that will also serve well for pulling from long ranges. And this beats even those on that count.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidar</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those of you guys saying this is easily craftable try making one yourself. It's not even in the realm of Hard. It is nearly impossible.<br />
<br />
The reason I would value 1500 pp for the planar oak is that in order to even have the slightest glimmer of a chance to make a bow your gonna need about 12 Branches. Getting together that many branches is gonna take you like a week. <br />
<br />
That's the one big hit with this bow. Doesn't matter what your skill is. If you want to see a bow made then expect to go through 12 to 20 combines WITH a geerlok Tool and maybe if your lucky you might succeed. As such you have to collect parts in bulk. And I do mean in Bulk. <br />
<br />
Prices for BD's on E marr dropped to 2 K. That is the lowest they ever got. Now they are back up to 3 K based on the new Cultural stuff. It may fall in price again but that is not a garuntee. <br />
<br />
The main beef I have is that the reward does not meet the effort involved in Making it. Gathering all these parts and getting your skill up to a point where this bow would ever be possible to make is not as easy as some of you make it out to be. It's a royal pain in the arse and will break the bank of most guilds I know not just an individual person. <br />
<br />
&lt;shrug&gt; I don't expect price to &quot;fall&quot; on these ever. Instead I expect that people just wont make them anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elured</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crydee: According to information on EQTrader's, Regular (non-blessed) Champion Arrows have the same trivial range so far (&gt;230) as Blessed and do not require an emerald shard, saving quite a bit of plat.  Even so, the cost of mithril arrows is exponentially higher than farming your own acrylia.<br />
<br />
Vanidar: BD prices, like most prices, are completely arbitrary.  Some guy once said &quot;Hey, you can have this for 3k&quot; and they paid 3k and a tradition was born.  If you want, like I do, to spend a little time camping instead of shelling out money (even the 1 or 2k or so it would cost on Fennin), camp ulthorks for a while.  It doesn't take a prohibitive amount of tusks to get a BD or two.<br />
<br />
Now, it's long and tedious to get to 230+ fletching, but not actually hard per se (more like boring).  I have seen many people with fletching in the area of 230 have a very high success rate on the Thunderbolt.  I myself plan to make my first attempt at 230 skill.<br />
<br />
Edit: I also think valuing planar oak at 1500 plat is kind of silly.  I wandered into PoG to look for some and got two branches in about an hour.  What's your Foraging skill?  Is your Luck! (1)?  Is my Luck! (200)?  Is it...hm...extremely random?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pravda Boga</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man you are terribly pessimistic Van.   Unless this bow trivials at greater than 350,  chances are  for success are better than the 5% you seem to say these bows have.  If this is the trivial btw no sense skilling up at all cuz you have pretty much the same chance of making this bow no matter what your skill.  Oh yes I've HEARD of people going 20 attempts w/o success on 250+ items at 250 skill but this is bad luck, not the normal situation to be expected most of the items i have heard enuf tries on have a success rate closer to 50% even at skills around 230.  <br />
<br />
Now I pretty sure this is gonna sound like a flame but its not meant to be, its pure curiousity since for all i know the trivial on this bow could actually be high enuf that there is only a 5% success rate.  The question i have is how did you decide that 2 for 20 at 250 skill is a good run?  By your initial post you yourself have only gotten enuf materials for 3 combines and even the results of 100 combines could be skewed by a stread of good or bad luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That may be so, but it still does not justify people who are technically not even anywhere near high enough to make these asking me to buy all the ingredients for a combine and give a donation (price to be determined) for each attempt. Now think how expensive this is going to be when the person is not even at 150.. so I would be paying them to work up their skill using these arrows. I am sure I come off sounding like a cheapass being L60 and not wanting to financee the fletching career of some ranger that I just met, but I really do not have that much plat in the bank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Acrylia farming on the other hand is time consuming. It really is not worth it unless you have at least 2 empty containers to fill up and many hours to waste doing it. If a merchant sold the stuff (even if costly) in addition to mob drops, it would be great for those times that I want to fletch but don't have the time to farm acrylia.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And as for pottery and blacksmithing, these really are not hard nor expensive to raise. Blacksmithing is very cheap to get that high IF you max out your STR while doing it. Pottery is also cheap if you eat the cost of each combine and don't bother firing anything. These are probably two of the easier skills to raise to the mid 100s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think Zhemau will back that up as will Kuvu, Zhemau contacted me and wanted 5 of each arrow i said donation per that he felt appropriate, i said ppl had given between 500 and 750 per arrow, he offered 1k and i felt bad so i said 10 @ 750 each, I told Kuvu what I had done and he thinks im nuts.  This is one elf with a set of morals and ethics that wont bend, hence my nickname in my guild of the Judge, as inflexible as the law.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 205 skill and I can't afford to attempt combines without the materials being provided (since I have already beggared myself on fletching and the related skills recently). That means I can't make the arrows to keep in stock but if the parts are provided I will click the  combine button for free. The customer risks the cash and I get the remote chance of a free skill up. Asking for a donation on top of that seems excessive, regardless of whether I succeed or not.<br />
<br />
If any Warders on Antonius Bayle want these things and don't mind running from Felwithe to Kelethin carrying a backpacks of mithril then I'm happy to attempt the combines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I am concerned, the only worthwhile trade skill is Jewelcraft.  Even that is torture, but at least you can make some money from it.<br />
<br />
I really really wish that VI would find some more creative (fun) ways to keep us hooked on the game.  This is like a drug dealer taking advantage of a junkie.  It's not right.  Where exactly is the entertainment we are paying for?</div></div><hr />

<br />
this bow can be more of a accomplishment then a tool , A symbol of your ranger hood like the orc shovel! see what i'm saying?</div></div><hr />

I'm going to make that bow.  I'm going to make a lot of acrylia and mithril arrows to get the skill to make that bow.  If there is a market for the arrows, i'll be happy to sell them at cost.  If there is no market, i'll sell back to the vendor or give them away to other archers.  <br />
<br />
Would i charge to make someone arrows if they provided matierals?  No.  I'd jump at the chance for a free possible skill up.  Factoring coin loss from failures into a price to me is ridiculous.  Failure is a part of learning.  Why should someone else have to pay for my failure?<br />
<br />
I have always been proud of my archery and fletching skills.  So far, i've paid out a small amount to get my fletching above 200 and my other trade skills above 100.  I've a lot of plat and a lot of combines left to reach my goal.  But, i will reach it.<br />
<br />
Plat is just plat.  You can get coin anywhere in a lot of different ways in a lot of different amounts.  Bank accounts can be filled back up.  <br />
<br />
Where can you get this bow?  From your friendly fletching ranger :)<br />
<br />
Tae</div></div><hr />

As to the rant.  If you don't want to pay the price, don't pay it.  Jeezzz</div></div><hr />

I did not get into fletching to make money, period.  I am a ranger, therefore I fletch.  If a fellow ranger, or guildmate, or friend, wants an arrow or bow, and they get me the items for the combine, I will always do it for free, its just silly otherwise.<br />
<br />
I understand the argument for charging, and to an extent agree with it.  If you are a 250 Tailor, you have put in a very obscene amount of time on raising that, and deserve some compensation.  But by the same token, most of us are happy enough to do it for free.  I make money off of mobs, not players :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceridwen</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This bow is not really particularly intended to be a great easy moneymaker.  If you think you're going to get free money out of ANY tradeskill, think again.  Jewelcraft is probably the cheapest to raise by the time you get to ~230, but there are now so many 250 jewelers that it isn't all that easy to make much plat off it.<br />
<br />
If you don't like the time and plat investment, DON'T MAKE IT.  Period.  Buy it off of someone who enjoys trade skills and rejoice in not having spent all that time and plat just to get a *chance* at a bow.<br />
<br />
For how hard skilling up is:<br />
<br />
a) REJOICE! you are a wood elf, you have another option that non woodies don't get<br />
<br />
b) REJOICE! you aren't a tailor, getting to 250 in tailoring is 100 times harder than fletching<br />
<br />
c) REJOICE! you are a person, and you can make the choice of whether or not you wish to continue to invest in the skill<br />
<br />
And for anyone who wants arrows/bows on Bert, my wood elf ranger now has a fletching skill of 215 + geerlock, and I will try any combine for free if you bring me all ingredients (however, this does mean ALL, you get there and tell me &quot;Oh yeah I dont have xxxx&quot; there will be a minimum charge of 500pp for me providing xxxx ;) )  I also have a druid who is a master tailor (189 + 15% mod), brewer (168 + geerlock), smith (126 + geerlock), baker, jeweler, and potter (122), and a wood elf to boot, so she can do cultural combines :D  Same rules apply for cost of combines.</div></div><hr />

In some sense, it is kinda insulting when someone who is nowhere near skilled enough asks you to buy all the ingredients and pay a donation per attempted on top of that. Do these twinkie ranger alts really think that the rest of us that dumb? (No real ranger would pull that.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ueauvan</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for info i provide all the items for combines as i smith it all thats why people are happy to donate<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benji</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vanidar, i was in PoG for 2 hours total doing things in RL with a button made to do 2 forages that id come back and hit whenever i thought to.. i picked up 3 branches, one of which while i was waiting for my ride out to arrive. YES, the planar oak is a rarer forage. NO, it isnt THAT rare. It truly is not hard to get. If you were willing to take the time to get 230 skill, then a little more time to forage the branches shouldnt be too big of a deal for you. And as far as the BD's go, you would just seem to have terrible luck on the costs for those. they have been 500 pp on the servers i have seen them for sale since a little after kunark came out. Of course, they may cost more NOW, but you just have to be willing to stand against someone who wants to sell them off for 3k now. whether it means spending some time in seb at bugs trying to get some, or maybe like it was said, camping bulthars, its just a little more time.. guess what? since luclin came out, EQ has been mostly timesinks to get new stuff. Verant WANTS the amount of bows made to not be extremely high. If they had wanted these bows to be EASY to make, the top end bow would be 20/60 rather than the first bow being the same. Personally, i think the tradeskills are supposed to be HARD. How good of a tradesmen are you if you cant collect the pieces to make something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidar</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, I am not really foaming at the mouth about this Bow :p Some of your replaies seem to think that I am pulling my hair out or something. <br />
<br />
Basically I was trying to make a few points. <br />
<br />
After having put in the time and the effort and the money to make the bow I do not foresee this as a marketable item. <br />
<br />
The bow is very hard to make. In the end I think it will boil down to dumb luck. Some have gotten combines on the first try with a lot less skill than I have. Others have tried almost twice as many combines as I have and still don't have anything to show for it. <br />
<br />
I listed prcies for one reason only. Because not everyone will always be able to get the items on their own. Some may have to purchase each peice. Those prices I quoted are based on the economy on MY server. That's a relative thing guys. Just because something costs a certain value on your server doesn't mean it is the same on another. <br />
<br />
For my attempts I was lucky enough to have access to our guilds gem mule. We have about 80 BD's sitting on a mule and nearly everyone has a resist gear set already. I was allowed to grab a stack of BD's and work with that. In essense this part didn't cost me anything but potentially could have cost me a lot if I didn't have access to the resources that I do. The average Fletcher I would imagine doesn't, hence the vlaue estimate I put on it. <br />
<br />
As far as people bring me supplies yes, I'll combine for free. I have always lived by that rule. However if I have to gather materials myself and buy parts that price I quoted will stand. I want to at least be able to cover my costs and the time invested if I have to foot the bill on all the parts myself. <br />
<br />
All I am really saying is that with the investment required I do not think this Bow will be in demand anytime soon. Once the novelty of it wears off it's going to get left by the side of the road. Right now it's still new and exciting. Pretty soon though I believe people will start deciding it's not worth the effort and they will stop trying to make them. <br />
<br />
This is disapointing to me because the High Elf BP is an item that I believe will be in high demand for a very long time. I would like the Bow reward to be good enough that it will give people incentive to go through the work.</div></div><hr />

I was talking about the original post, of how hard it is to make the bow and what you had to do to collect it.<br />
<br />
As to the dorks that you described, I agree.  People pulling that are just being greedy.  But then again, you do have the choice not to pay their price.  =)</div></div><hr />
