<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeneran Orcreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I like all of these abilities, but figured I ask for opinions from more experienced rangers(ie. those with the skills :) ).  I'm about to hit my 16th point tonite and am debating what to do with it.  Currently my Arch skills are CF1, ND1, MC1, and CA1.  I'm leaning towards spending the last 4 points on ND2 or CF2(unsure though even amongst these 2) or picking up FB1 and CS1.  I'm not in an uber guild so I dont just raid all the time and end up doing a little of everything when playing EQ.  I'm basically debating what I will get more utility from; 2 lvl 1 skills or upgrading one of my previous choices, thanks in advance. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have your sights on AM3 go CF2. The increase in crit percentage is really nice even if its just eye candy. If you think Hunter is a long ways away then go ND2. If you get CS1 you won't even notice it. FB1 depends on where you hunt.</div></div><hr />
