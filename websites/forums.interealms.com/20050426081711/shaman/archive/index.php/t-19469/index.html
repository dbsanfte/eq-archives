<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hk2001</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for nice, steady (easy?) experiance for a 51 rog/51 shm duo.. <br />
<br />
The Rogue dosn't have LoY, or we'd be in Dulak :-P<br />
<br />
<br />
Tried CoM for a while, but some mobs are starting to go light blue, and i fear exp here may soon come to a halt.. <br />
<br />
I'd prefer Lots of mobs, with fairly low HP.. Quanity over quality :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nobles/Bards/Guards in HHK may be a viable option.<br />
<br />
Dunno how long 'til they crap out, but they are old-world mobs, gimp when slowed and fairly low HP and damage.<br />
<br />
I've seen a druid/monk 2-box here often. The druid just buffs, goes away, kills guards and comes back for heals as needed. The monk is buffed up pretty good, and can nearly solo them. Plus he has a DS and regen... The same tactic could be implored here as well. You may not want to go around killing guards in mid-fight, but I think that the Nobles and Bards would give good XP.<br />
<br />
Also, I kill the baker. She's in the room next to the bards, has nice HP, decent damage (both being higher than bards' nobles'), and streaky resists. Sometimes I go with no resists (Slow, EBolt), sometimes Slow will get resisted four times. If I get a spell resisted twice, there really isn't a point to it anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Karnor's would be ok if you have the stomach for it... Might want to check out Sol B too.  You might be getting a little old for there but I remember hunting in Sol B into my 50's back in the day.  Sol B falls under your category of a ton of mobs with not too many hps (talking about the Kobolds).<br />
<br />
*Edited cause I can't spell... at all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have you tried the entrance to The Hole?  I have not been there in a while, but the zone has a decent xp mod, and I was able to keep the entrance clear.  XP started to really thin at 54 - at the entrance.  I think all the entrance mobs were warriors.  Since the revamp, I heard there is a wanderer now.  I cannot confirm this since I haven't been in this zone in a long time.</div></div><hr />
