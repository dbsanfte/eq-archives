<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what do you guys think good prices for those potions are?<br />
<br />
atm i have been farming the gunthak fort of bandits ect for meats and parts and ive been selling the potions for 300pp each.. so far its selling really well, im not sure if its because its brand new or if it actually is a price ppl think is fair.   for the first time im actually making good money off alchemy.   this could be the only real alchemy money-maker.<br />
<br />
what do you guys think a fair price for the illusion potions are?<br />
<br />
ps: havent heard about anybody else auction, sell or make them in my server so far so maybe that has something to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My suggestion, 150-300pp...<br />
<br />
Let's make some profit off one of the rare good potions that we have :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">priced mine at 200pp a pop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Within the week they'll be worth less than the wormroot is worth, people are so selfish theyll just price it 100pp under you just to spite you ruining the economy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice optimism there...<br />
<br />
Im testing out the pricing at this time, some I sell cheaper than others because of the meat avaiability. Farming Halfing meats is super easy done by lvl20 noob, where in there arent as many low lvl half elfs or gnomes... Look in bazaar what meats are avaiable at what prices; Ive sold Halfing for 150pp, darkelf/woodelf for 250, Troll/Gnome 300.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">seen vendors with illusion potions 100pp now.<br />
<br />
Its not unoptimism, its the truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, pessimism is pretty justified when it comes to alchemy potions and pricing. <br />
<br />
I price my SoW potions at 90pp and they sell. So why do people sell them at 75? 90 is a fair price (must be or they would not sell) but i see a couple of certain traders on MM selling stacks at 75, just undercutting to make a quick sale. <br />
<br />
They don't realise that if they priced them at what the market will bear, they would make more money for the same effort, or the same money for less effort.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've been selling illusion potions from 160-250 based on meat availability which I just generally buy whatever is for sale in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Don't get too wrapped up in what other people are selling potions for. You can use them as a general guage for what to price yours at but don't take it as gospel. If someoen wants to price their 10 shot sow at 75pp, more power to them. They will just sell out faster and then people will buy mine at 100pp. If they are selling at 75pp they are making what, 2pp or so a potion? My time is more valuable than that and while alchemy is fun and a nice change of pace at times, I'm not going to sit around and grind potions for a 2pp profit. Either mine will sell at 100pp or they won't. Meanwhile I will be out having fun. If you are determined to sell potions however, prolly the best bet is to bring the potions to the customer rather than just stick em on a vendor in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mine are priced 150pp each, with 10pp discount for providing meat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd just like to note that the shamans out there ruining the alchemy economy (ex: sow potions) are doing so with VENDOR PURCHASED SUPPLIES.<br />
<br />
Let's think about this a minute.  Sure, there's the odd chance you might have a shaman find some meat occassionally on a merchant.  And sure, they're going to zip all the way out to Gunthak just to purchase wormwood and make little to no profit on it.<br />
<br />
Nah.  I don't think so.<br />
<br />
Because instead of popping to a merchant and buying thier supplies, they have to FARM it, and Gunthak is out of everyone's way as well.  Unless you're serious about this, that isn't something you are going to do.  And the trivial is high enough and the cost high enough, it will discourage the younger shamans who want quick pp.<br />
<br />
No, I think we can look forward to 150p MINIMUMS on Illusion potions for a long, long time to come. :)<br />
<br />
PS - I am selling Vah Shir potions right now at 500p a pop, because the meat can only be gotten in one place in the whole game. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">and are they selling?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">my advice is dont combine them in 10 dose.<br />
<br />
i made a 10 dose potion and had to use it on myself because nobody would buy.. im selling individual potions for 250-300pp and the 10 dose for 2k.    for some reason ppl buy the single potions fairly well but when they see the 2k, even though its a good discount, it scares them off.    exeption for this would of course be if somebody requests you to make a 10 dose one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've been selling all mine at 200pp a single dose.<br />
<br />
Fuudce, raise your price mate, they sell on AB for 200pp without any problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">heh, i've taken mine off the market. Gonna take requests only &amp; they'll be priced at 200</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why have you taken them off the market?<br />
<br />
I'm mostly making them for guildmates for just the cost of the wormwood. They bring me the meat and I do the combine ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There is a guy on fennin that is selling 10charge SOWs for 69P each.  He had 49 of them.  I swear he must be using some sort of script.  That's 539 combines with 2940 clicks to drop the three components in the med bag.  When the bazaar first went live I purchase my emerald dragon scale tunic with sow potion money alone.  I sold them for 90-95p each.  I could double my money in 12 hours afk in the baz.  Now...it's just not worth it anymore.  Ah what can you do?  Just camp and sell I guess hehe.  My wrists were starting to hurt anyway.</div></div><hr />

&quot;OMG, u r teh R1PPING us off!  Wormwood only 80 platz, NO ONE BUY TEH POTI0Nz!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hopefully when they see that shamen stop making potions due to the extra effort and low profit involved, they'll be more willing to buy em for a decent price :p ... hell, I'm sure you've all read the &quot;Cost to get 180 skill&quot; thread.<br />
<br />
Sure this isn't a plat making skill, but it sure as hell isn't 'spend-10k-so-you-can-make-cool-potions-for-exorbinant-prices' skill. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
ROFL!!  You have zero comprehension of basic economics.  What you are suggesting is commonly known as &quot;price fixing&quot; in the real world, and is a felony.<br />
<br />
The market obviously can only bear 75pp, as long as there is a ready supply for that price.<br />
<br />
Someone is giving the consumer a *much much much* better deal than you are, and you have the unmitigated audacity to call *them* selfish????<br />
<br />
ROFL, oh my gawd, some people......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Prices have already been screwed up on Tunare. I was selling them for close to 200pp and they were selling. Then some guy decided to start selling them at 135pp. What's aggravating is that he had no real competition but dropped the market so low anyway. Then of course someone else followed and dropped the prices to 130pp. I just checked now and there's someone selling them for 120pp.<br />
<br />
I was excited when these first went live because it was finally something I could make money on after pumping in tons of coin into alchemy. But with a 155 skill I do get fails and by doing the math I'd have to sell these for over 150pp to make a profit. <br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I sell the potions for 200pp each.  I have no problem selling them.  They sell better than anything else I got right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It still seems like demand exceeds supply for these things, certainly for Iksar and DE, on Vazaelle anyway. I've been pricing all of mine at 200pp each, and despite people occasionally selling as low as 125pp, I still sell out most of the time.<br />
<br />
If the market requires I drop my prices on these at some later date, I won't really mind all that much - they're only a couple of clicks to make...  I really don't understand the people who want to sell 10-dose sow potions for like 5pp profit, though...  Like 120 clicks for 5pp profit?  They can own that market. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>whytstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I am on Vazaelle as well and sell the potions for 200pp as well.

<br />
Though usually there are up to 4 or 5 people now selling and they all sell between 120-130pp each. Even worse I saw a 10 shot last night going for 1100pp.<br />

Price is pretty stable at 150pp each on EMarr. A fair price I believe considering the recipe requires a drop and component only sold on one vendor located in a relatively out of the way place.<br />
<br />
And I agree with the earlier poster regarding 5 and 10 dose potions. They just don't seem to sell near as well as singles. <br />
<br />
Ones that seem to sell best/fastest are the iksar, dark elf, and halfling. I use a halfling one myself sometimes when I'm too lazy to shrink myself for horse. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>shotzy inaglass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">price is stable around 130-200 on rathe server for a singe dose.  but get this some bonehead was selling 5dose potions for 500 pp each so if he buys component at 80pp he makes a whopping 100pp lmao and dont forget the failures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">2 situations come in mind<br />
first, the shm is practicing alchemy, he made a ton (like i made stats potion from 100ish to upper 150)<br />
he knows potion wont sell fast, he rather take no profit or even 50% loss to get alchemy fund back.<br />
<br />
Second, its infamous undercutter, who like to be selfish and screw everyone over.<br />
<br />
However, I would like to see a shm cartel going on /grin<br />
Shms gather and talk about price they want to sell, and everyone mark it the same price, so there wont be undercutter.<br />
<br />
But like how all cartel fails, once a guy want quick sell and drop the price..its over..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Cattail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">On Fennin Ro, the potions sell for 150 to 200 plats in Bazaar.  Guildies have had them combined for 10 plats per successful combine, with the person wanting the potion providing all the components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I sell mine for 120-200p each.<br />
<br />
The meat is so easy to come by, I have 3 bags FULL in the bank despite making the potions.  I could personally ruin the economy on the The Nameless by putting them all up for sale at the same time.<br />
<br />
I price them cheap because I don't care to hold inventory.  However, I generally only make about 3 of each variety at a time.  That way I sell mine quickly, and then the people that might actually be using them to skill up on can sell theirs.</div></div><hr />
