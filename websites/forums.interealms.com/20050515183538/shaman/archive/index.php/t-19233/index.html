Don't like people annoying you but you enjoy ridiculing them?  Well, change all the text in the posts. You're so powerful and cool. Oooo. Everyone and their dog knows you don't have that power.<br />
<br />
Yes, Mr. Admin (and I know you're a mister, that much is obvious), you can change anything you want... but you can't change the account name that it is posted from, and that is good enough, in my book, to be downright hilarious.<br />
<br />
Its rude to do stupid things, isn't it? Maybe if you stop, I will.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The people who posted on the newbie forum made as much fun of the supporters of the proposal as some shaman on the crucible (myself among them) made fun of the posters there.  They think we are unintelligent for wanting upgrades when they feel our class doesn't need any, and we feel they are unintelligent for not realizing that the class is broken.<br />
<br />
was making fun of them wrong?  I am not sure... I do somewhat regret my posts ridiculing  them.  But does it warrant ruining many peoples boards because you were on the other side of the debate?  I don't see anyone from this board participating in these type of troll tactics on your boards to get back at those we dislike.<br />
<br />
please, stop ruining many peoples good time to get back at a few people who were rude to people who were first rude to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I never said any of them were unintellegent for not agreeing with us. They got their right to think otherwise. I sure as hell didn't go over there bumping random posts, posting crap that has nothing to do with the board, and being a general jackass. <br />
<br />
Stating stupid stuff like shaman are hybrid is what will get you called an idiot by me and theres plenty more examples on that board. <br />
<br />
Hell I posted about the tactics exp exploit there on Monday and that degenerated into mindless drivel in about 20 minutes. Absolutely nothing to do about shaman there. That board is just bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Trolls feed off attention. It was my fault the situation escalated here, I gave him too much attention.<br />
<br />
I'm going to lock this post so we can concentrate on shaman issues :)</div></div><hr />
