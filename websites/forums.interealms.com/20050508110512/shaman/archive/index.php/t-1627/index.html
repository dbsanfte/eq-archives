<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greymane shadowbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">being a lvl 24 shaman, i am confused as to the number of buff spells available.   can someone give guidelines as to what buffs to cast on different classes - what to give to melee, int casters, wis casters?  <br />
<br />
my usual partner is a monk and i cast ac, agi, dex, regen, str on him.  is that ok?<br />
<br />
please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, shaman buffs are more designed for melee types, but we have buffs for everyone i guess =).<br />
<br />
For yourself i suggest dex and sta in a group, dex so you learn skills faster and sta so you have more HP to canni down.  Im not so far past your level myself(30), and i find that the 24 sta buff gives me around 30 more HP.  <br />
<br />
For melees i suggest pretty much all our buffs.  When i duo w/ my monk friend i normally give her what you give your friend.<br />
<br />
At 29 you have to give haste, always haste =).<br />
<br />
For casters the only thing they need is dex to learn skills faster, or whatever.  Our buffs arent great for casters, because we buff the stats, but not wis or int.<br />
<br />
when soloing, give yourself whatever you find nessecary.  I suggest pretty much everything, but that can be mana intensive.  Most shammy solo'rs tend to lean to tanking a slowed mob w/ a few dots on.  If you do that then buff up, but if you root rot then that you dont need to be buffed to the max =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When you partner with a monk, give him every stat buff you have.  Quite often they will protest and say that some of the buffs aren't really necessary, but DO NOT listen to him.  He is wrong :D  My usual partner for a long time was a monk, and I noticed a huge difference between him having no stat buffs, and him having all of them.  He took much less damage and killed things faster.<br />
<br />
It is good to do the same for every melee class, but sometimes mana will not permit it, or it just might not be necessary.  A warrior without proccing weapons doesn't really NEED dex, I believe.  The most important thing to give them is HASTE, assuming you do not have a chanter in the group.  After that, give the main tank regen.  Your first regen spell heals for 400 damage, which can really lighten the burden on whoever is the main healer.<br />
<br />
As for wis and int casters, they don't really need any of your buffs right now.  Later on, it is nice to give them HP buffs (talisman series of spells), but you don't have that line yet at 24.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lets see I'll list the ones I think are most usefull to least by buff then class.<br />
<br />
Haste - All Meeles &amp; Pets<br />
Str - All Meele's (Increased Damage)<br />
Agi - Main, Secondary Assists, any casters if mana permits (Increased AC)<br />
Talisman - Main, Secondary Assists, any casters if mana permits <br />
Dex - Warriors &lt;helps Crits&gt;, Procing Meele, Anyone working meele skills<br />
Sta - Main, Secondary Assists, any casters if mana permits (Increased HP)<br />
Regen - Damaged Casters and Secondary Tanks <br />
Most often in full group I found it works best to just try keep Haste and str on everyone as things dont ussually live long enough for any the other buffs to matter much.  In smaller groups having the main Meele fully buffed makes a huge difference in mana spent on heals.  Untill resently I didnt really regen others in my group due to mana requirements though choroplast helps alot with me healing.  Dex &amp; Agi are very close in their usefullness.  Dex increases all the tanks Procs so in large group it would be better then Agi but will have be cast on more people.  Agi works for AC so can be limited to only those people that are getting hit more the 5-8 times a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Because everyone plays their own way it is always a good idea to ask your group if they need any buffs every once and a while.  While you would want to buff up your main tank like crazy you would spare only a few for an alternate melee like a ranger who doesnt need all out buffs.  Don't get yourself strapped for mana by giving everyone everythign you have got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I usually only buff haste, regen and hp. I will often add in a group str or a dex if I we have a proccing melee. The amount of difference that an agi buff or dex buff makes is pretty minimal. <br />
<br />
I often ask why they want certain buffs. I find that monks think that dex will help them with their double attack and having their offhand attack more often. I see no difference in their damage output, of course. <br />
<br />
Haste and regen are important. They are efficient in that they will pay for themselves manawise. Most of the other buffs just serve to slow the group down in waiting on more mana to come. Yes they do something, but it isn't enough to make the group wait for the mana to come. <br />
<br />
What I really don't like is when I am the main healer in a fast moving group and the non-proccing monks and rogues start asking for dex so they can land attacks more.<br />
<br />
Just know what your buffs actually do and you will often know which are worth actually casting. I don't even fully buff anymore when I solo, yes it makes a difference, but not more than the 1 heal you cast every 5th pull because you didnt cast 3 buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Chazic pretty much right...<br />
<br />
Str - Melee's(and annoying chanters that have dire charm and want me to focus their pets...err... /rant off =p)<br />
Dex - same as str<br />
Agi - Not gonna notice a large difference with this imo, normally just give to anyone who asks<br />
Sta - Everyone...period ;)<br />
Talisman - Everyone(unless asked not to by casters, dunno what talisman's overwrite what - less its same as focus *shrug* forgot ^.^)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">just find out who prefers what and learn what needs to be cast when. dont waste mana regening anyone that shouldnt be getting hurt.<br />
<br />
talisman should never be cast on casters or clerics unless specifically asked. if a caster knows there spells they will never ask for it. there shield line adds ac/hp/mr so is better for them than talisman is.</div></div><hr />
