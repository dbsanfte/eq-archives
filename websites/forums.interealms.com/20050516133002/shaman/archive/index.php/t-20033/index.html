<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So there I was, practicing my alchemy (three points to go until 200) when out of the blue, a very nice guildee sends me a tell asking me if I want my level 65 slow (it dropped for his guild group, which had no shaman).  <br />
<br />
Of course, I said sure and proceeded to get to the sewers in Barindu where I looted the spell and scribed it.<br />
<br />
I played with it for the entire evening during a bertox run (for those who have not done it, its 90 minutes of constant slowing).  I kept Balance and Turgurs up, and used whatever was handy at any given moment during the event.<br />
<br />
Initially I thought this slow would be a mild improvement over Turgurs, but wasn't too excited.  As the night went on, though, I started to get more and more excited by this spell.  <br />
<br />
The -40 resist adjustment is definitely noticeable.  The spell still gets resisted, of course, but on the whole I could definitely see a trend of less resists when I was using it vs. when I was using Turgurs. <br />
<br />
The cast time is snappy, but not exceptionally faster than Turgurs if you have good detrimental spell haste (this spell is not affected at all by detrimental spell haste).<br />
<br />
The duration was noticeably shorter than Turgur's, but in most situations you'll never have a mob outlive it (unless your soloing).<br />
<br />
The difference between 60 percent and 75 percent was...  meaningless, actually.  When I'm doing an LDON, I normally use Tigirs instead of Turgurs just because I like the AE effect and I'm not too worried about the difference between Tigirs and Turgurs.  This seems like a more happy middle ground.  <br />
<br />
All in all, over the course of the evening, I was very impressed by this spell and I would certainly encourage people to seek it out.  It doesnt drop in some obscenely hard to get area, it doesnt cost you 100k, and it really feels like an actual upgrade to our slowing capability (despite the reduced percentage).<br />
<br />
I feel like I can slow almost as good as a beastlord now.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a quick follow up to my own post, I checked my log and here is some (rather unscientific but still interesting) information:<br />
<br />
Turgurs:  99 casts, 40 resists (40.4 % resist rate)<br />
<br />
Balance:  83 casts, 17 resists (20.4 % resist rate)<br />
<br />
I did not debuff anything prior to casting either slow (who has time, its the Bertox event!).<br />
<br />
The resist numbers may be slightly wacky, because I just brute forced the slows through when I got resisted.  (ie, 1 mob might resist 5 times and then no mobs will resist for 10 minutes).<br />
<br />
I wouldn't place too much weight on these numbers, but I found them interesting and if they hold true then I'll be very pleased indeed with this spell (since the only time I malos is on highly resistant mobs or on raid targets).<br />
<br />
EDIT:  It might be significant to note that the distribution of mob levels was on the high side:  maybe 60 percent blues, 30 percent evens, 5 percent yellows, and 5 percent reds).  Thats a guestimate, but sounds about right.</div></div><hr />

60 to 75%  no difference really?  well not true on fully slowable mobs, only on mitagating ones. it still means that beast will overwrite this spell, which for a level 65 shaman spell is just a slap in the face. it isnt really faster than turgur casting , just the -40 help it stick 20% more mobs than turgur?  wow great.<br />

<br />
at the least you can cast TA turgurs 3 times to 2 balance of nihil?</div></div><hr />

Giving us a slow inferior to a BST is an insult.<br />

The beastlord thing was a joke.  You know, humour?  Ha Ha?   No, I guess not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't dismiss the resist mod.  Ask wizards if they discout the resist mod on some of thier spells.  I will tell you they don't, because it makes those spells worth it.  <br />
<br />
With that being said, I think it is hard to dress this lesser percent slow up to make it attractive.  Less than bst, less than ench, maybe bard too, and the mod isn't all that great (it does have value though!).  If it was 70%....or -100mr resist at 60%....  I don't know, it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense as far as the spell line goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the only thing going for this spell is -40 resist , take that away would you still like this spell?<br />
<br />
Why would I take the -40 resist adjustment away?  Its there -- and I agree its the primary reason why the spell is worth having and using.  I thought my post made it pretty clear that the resist adjustment was the big deal.<br />
<br />
60 to 75%  no difference really?  well not true on fully slowable mobs, only on mitagating ones. it still means that beast will overwrite this spell, which for a level 65 shaman spell is just a slap in the face. it isnt really faster than turgur casting , just the -40 help it stick 20% more mobs than turgur?  wow great.<br />
<br />
I didn't say there was no difference, by the way.  I said that the difference was meaningless.  To me, it is.  To you, it may not be.  I guess thats a personal preference thing.  When I'm doing an LDoN, the mobs are dying so fast that to me my primary concern is first getting the mob slowed (by any percentage) fast, and second getting the mob dead.  The amount of damage that the mob is doing during its life (ie: 30 seconds maximum) is not really significant to me.  If the beastlord slows it, good -- I'll cast a nuke instead.  If I slow it by 60 percent instead of 75, good.  Its *slow enough*, really.  Is it inefficient?  Sure.  Is it my best slow?  No, not at all.  Does it get the job done?  Yep, sure does.  On mitigating mobs the difference is much less, as well, as you pointed out.  For the sake of argument, though, assume I'm talking about non-mitigating mobs.<br />
<br />
Also, bear in mind, I'm not saying I always do that.  Different situations call for different tactics, of course.  If the fights going to last more than 30 seconds, or the mob hits especially hard or fast, I'll of course reslow it with Turgurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dont know about you guys but during Bertox event we have necro's slowing as well and they have no problems.   This slow is a freaking insult and is useless no matter where I bring it!   I will always use turgur there's no excuse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If this spell had been put into the expansion as a &quot;sometimes useful&quot; side spell, instead of supposedly the BIG UPGRADE spell for the entire expansion for our class... it wouldn't be so bad.<br />
<br />
But considering the kinds of abilities and spells that other classes got in GoD (did you know paladins can radiant cure now? group lay hands every half hour?), I'm wondering how long until we actually get an interesting, useful upgrade of a spell or AA.  Instead of castoffs from other classes and situationally useful rehashes of our old spells.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong.  I think Balance would have its uses for me, and I wouldn't mind picking it up.  But it's disappointing, to say the least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The original poster mentioned &lt;her&gt; observations on the results of this spell. Which, unknowingly, unleased the shaman dogs of war.<br />
<br />
I see nothing in &lt;her&gt; informative posts claiming a love for this spell. Or a preference for this spell over either turgurs or better changes in the game to meet shaman needs. They were just ... simply ... only ... comments about what &lt;she&gt; has noted in comparing the 2.<br />
<br />
Frankly, the keypoint in the information provided (as I took it) is being able to have 2 slows available in those few rare events where getting a mob slowed quickly has to happen. GoD zones come to mind. I regularly group with another shaman who has this spell and she casts it on incoming while I cast maloXXX. I then follow up with Turgurs (which ironically overwrites this spell.) A combination of the best of what is available to us.<br />
<br />
Why does she cast Nih first? Combined with my maloX her resist rate is minimal. Turgurs, of course, is still resisted an abnormal amount whether mob is debuffed or not. I have better luck with my snare necklace landing.<br />
<br />
Back to my point: jumping on the poster for providing information is moot. I am sorry yall are so ticked off by the lack of serious change shaman received with GoD. I am sorry for me too, as I am in total agreement that we have been slapped in the face by the SOE.<br />
<br />
That does not mean I will not scribe this spell if it drops. That does not mean I will not use this spell. If it comes down to landing a slow or not landing a slow, and this spell is the determining factor, I am casting it.<br />
<br />
So, folks, in short, stop shooting the messengers.</div></div><hr />

Mobs that are very hard to slow and/or where 60 % or 75 % slow doesnt matter - we just want them slow are probably a handful in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There is nothing wrong with Deria finding success for this spell.  And those test numbers are nice to look at.    <br />
<br />
However, the bottom line is, it's still a limited spell compared to using Malos/Turgur's.  An upgrade isn't an upgrade, if it's compromised.  Balance was compromised.  With a 14 level difference, Balance should have been by default, 75% with the -40 resist adjustment.<br />
<br />
Lastnight, the guild did a small raid in GoD.  I was the only shaman.  After a messy situtation (several died) and with some people having to log, I ended up also being main healer for a group.  With needing to heal (had a warrior) and the constant buffage requests of rezzed people, the two beastlords we had, did the slowing for me.  It was my request, because I had way too much to do.  They slowed just fine.  I wasn't even malos'ing for them.  So that tells me something right there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to Ikkinz and higher, then ask your tanks and clerics if they want you have to have 1.5s slow with -40 resist adjust.  Trash in those zones hit very hard.  Not to mention most run at amazingly fast and are in your camp before malos even lands.  The ~6-7 seconds to slow a mob is enough time for it to kill someone.<br />
<br />
<br />
I told them it was only a 60% slow and all the melees in the group said &quot;at least that's 60% less damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
I've noticed many mobs in later GoD levels don't mitigate slow at all.  In those cases Balance of the Nihil is superior to Turgur's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are many mobs early in GoD that don't mitigate.  Even the Blademasters(and cousins) don't.  So Turgur's &gt; Balance against nonmitigated mobs.  75%&gt;60% :)<br />
<br />
But like I said, there's nothing wrong finding uses for it.</div></div><hr />

That's hilarious and so untrue.  By this logic a 100% slow would stop time...oh wait, it already does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Be careful comparing the spell in this thread to paladin AA abilities. Yes they can radiant cure now but they always have had hand of piety ( the group loh'ish aa) Its base off of LOH and improved LOH is the prereq. With the aa prior to pop the timer was down to around 36 minutes as it was. With God were able to increment it more. <br />
<br />
As for radiant cure they have already been able to use remove greater curse and they have a cure line Crusaders touch. But when you compare spell to spell they didnt get anything to great either. <br />
<br />
<br />
AS for this spell. Its not the be all end all but at least they are trying to get us other options. I dont know this but maybe they dont feel comfortable trying to improve upon am already powerful slow at 75%. Really all you can do is tweak it and alot of people wouldnt be happy with the tweaks. Anyway thanks to the poster posting his experiences with the balance spell. I havent had time to go to do alot of GOD stuff yet and dont have any spells from there yet. Has been curious about how people been feeling about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The percentage on this slow REALLY doesn't matter, since the most crucial areas where you'd need it are on hard LDON's where mobs mitigate &quot;mostly&quot; and in GoD where mobs mitigate also.  Turgurs would be mitigated to almost exactly, if not exactly the same percentage of slow as this Balance slow would be mitigated.  <br />
<br />
The only real issue is the duration, which isn't that bad.  I'd like to get a copy of this spell.  Thanks for the rundown and testing Deria.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">60% vs 75% is a huge difference on non-mitigating mobs by the way.<br />
<br />
75% slow means the mob is doing 25% damage.<br />
60% slow means the mob is doing 40% damage.<br />
<br />
40/25 = 1.6<br />
<br />
That means a 75% slow will mitigate 60% better then a 60% slow.<br />
<br />
Now, on mitigating mobs the math looks far better of course. So far GoD has been pretty mixed - sewers have been mostly fully slowable for me, mountains mitigate, ikkinz its a lot of fully slowables again. But if you use  Nihil on fully slowable mobs odds are Turgur's would be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Soon we'll have to make the obligatory thread to list all of the mobs that are now-slowable that used to be effectively un-slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Khethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Had to respond on this one. Happily played my shaman for.. oh.. 3 years or so and still havin fun at about 335AA's. I don't consider myself to know it all.. probably won't ever, but I think I know a thing or two about shamaning for groups. Anyway, to me...<br />
<br />
1. Whomever said that using less than Turgur's in LDoN was *spot on*. You are gimping your group if you use less. <br />
<br />
2. The only time Tigirs is appropriate is when you expect you're going to get flooded with mobs and then, only as a prelim to turgurs. Any less, and you're gimping your group<br />
<br />
3. The new slow, to me, seems to have only one real purpose: For those mobs that simply resist Turgur's so far into the fight as to be meaningless. Some of the slowable pop-bosses come to mind for this. Anything less, you're gimping your group. <br />
<br />
I'm sure there are some fantastic points out there, but a lot of this just feels like excuses for not doing your best for your group or raid. I suppose I get riled up when I think our shaman bretheren are taking the easy way out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">In a normal LDoN with high DPS, I use less mana just healing the MA than I do slowing the mob AND healing the MA.

You haven't been in GoD yet, have you?  <br />
<br />
When there's a mob in your tank's face tripling for 1200 plus kick/bash (some also quad) AND sometimes proc a DD/dot, you don't want to watch your cast bar tick down.  Some of these mobs hit very fast (the kyv archers come to mind) and don't mitigate slow. Having 2 uncontrolled GoD mobs loose in a trials group setting will usually wipe you before you can finish casting malos.  So, you can spend 4-5 seconds casting malos first, then wait 2.25 seconds (or not wait if you have TA), then spend 2-3 seconds casting Turgur's or you can get almost the same result in 1.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Many happy CRs to you. :)</div></div><hr />

I haven't done trials in god yet, so I don't know, but wouldn't dropping slow on a tripling-for-1200 mob 1.5 seconds after it comes into range tend to get you turned into a fine mist?  Or do you wait?  Or is aggro not a problem?</div></div><hr />

What you seem to forget is that among the population of 65 level shaman (thezre's a lot of us around), only a very few of them will one day see a Time Antithesis (sp. ?), let alone the fact of possessing one.<br />
To me (note that this is based on figures, not on use of the spell itself), Balance looks like pure garbage, I wouldn't even give it as a bone to a Dogdog. Now maybe it is a good spell, but figures stink.<br />

When there's a mob in your tank's face tripling for 1200 plus kick/bash (some also quad) AND sometimes proc a DD/dot, you don't want to watch your cast bar tick down. Some of these mobs hit very fast (the kyv archers come to mind) and don't mitigate slow. Having 2 uncontrolled GoD mobs loose in a trials group setting will usually wipe you before you can finish casting malos. So, you can spend 4-5 seconds casting malos first, then wait 2.25 seconds (or not wait if you have TA), then spend 2-3 seconds casting Turgur's or you can get almost the same result in 1.5 seconds.  <br />
<br />
With SCS3 and Spell HasteIV, normally Malos hits as the mob's trotting into camp. After that, Turgur's goes on pretty good. Yea... you have a point with multi's... time can be very short (thinking especially in the first trials/Sewer where we've been working most of the last week - just won it too :) ). <br />
<br />
The point is, that when one can do the best slow for their group, I think they should. And yes, spent an awful lot of time in GoD...</div></div><hr />

Still kind of a bummer for me, because the thing that made me most excited about getting a TA someday was getting a new spell slot.</div></div><hr />
