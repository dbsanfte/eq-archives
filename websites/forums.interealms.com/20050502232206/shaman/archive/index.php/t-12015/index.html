<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What a horrilbe change, charm was unbalanced before, but now its worthless.  What I see is a bunch of greedy, jealous people who are glad another class got nerfed.<br />
<br />
They certaintly didn't make it a more group friendly spell, they just made it a worthless spell.  The part that pisses me off the most is the exp part.  Charm is how chanters do damage, why make an exp penalty for that?  Should there be an exp penalty on nukes, or dots?<br />
<br />
I can only speak for the lower tiers, ie no elemental planes, but the chanters that i group with, if they arent charming, they are basically bored, and have nothing to do, unless we on purposly train ourslevs.  SOE screwed up and made a bunch of boring outdoor exp zones, that are easy to pull singles in, and now all a chanter has to do is haste and clarity people.<br />
<br />
Charmed mobs made exping fun again for me, now its back to old hack and slash for hours on end in a boring safe group.<br />
<br />
If they are unhappy about charmers soloing aa points in 20 mins, then do something about soloing charmers, but why nerf every use of the spell?  Do you think any group is going to allow an enc to charm something if they think its going to take exp away?  Especially since it increases the risk to have the charmed mob in the group?</div></div><hr />

-Charmed pets now take a percentage of the exp. It's apparently on a sliding scale, based on the total percentage of damage the pet does. <br />
<br />
In other words, Charmed pet experience will now work like Dire charmed pets have been working.  Don't see a problem with that.<br />
<br />
resist change - 'chanters have to tash before charming in PoP now?  Horrors.<br />
<br />
aggro change - 'chanters have to learn aggro control now? Horrors.<br />
<br />
I admit, all three taken together sound a bit severe.  I'd probably try any two of them together and see how balanced it comes out.  (Of course, SOE has a long history of banging some half-baked &quot;fix&quot; together, not testing much, and calling it good...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not sure I like these changes. Charm does need a nerf. However I think that Charm should be changed in some way so that a charmed mob is a valuable addition in GROUPS, but charm soloing should be very risky and exceedingly difficult.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how they would do this, but that's what I would ideally like to happen.<br />
<br />
Just totally nerfing the crap out of the spell altogether is kind of harsh, although up to this point enchanters really have been spoiled like the chubby children of filthy rich parents, so this nerf at least for a while is definitely fair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overall, this is bad for us shamans.  What it means is that all those enchanters who typically soloed will now be LFG.  In many groups, they replace us.  So shamans will not be quite as desperately wanted in PoP anymore.  Many groups will still want a shaman for a backup healer/slower.  But the hardcore people will just do chanter/cleric/warrior holy trio and add DPS to taste.  We don't qualify as DPS, so we are out.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Charm was so ridiculously overpowered it was silly.  This nerf should have gone into effect months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This nerf is bad for chanters, but it's too little too late. Most chanters already farmed the crap out of AA points. It won't hurt them that much. Plus it's something that should never have been in the game. 500+ DPS pets are very bad for game balance.<br />
<br />
How can VI balance a 500+ DPS pet in XP groups when the highest DPS melee is barely 180ish? They can't balance such a high damage output unless PC melee do the same DPS (maybe in 5 expansions). I was grouped with chanters and by the time slow landed on mob it was already at 75%ish health. A hasted quadding Diaku is murder, period. Also enchanters have a small life insurance, they can stack a crapload of runes to soak up damage and allow them to recharm. <br />
<br />
Resist changes don't mean that much. XP changes means that the spell will be mostly useless in groups. However, the spell still remains an insanely powerful raid spell.</div></div><hr />

So overdue it wasn't even funny. Now enchanters will look for groups, some may indeed take spots shammies could have taken..however it's a big help having more slowers available for groups.<br />
<br />
It was a horrible situation having a dozen people sitting lfg while the classes that could have made several working groups from those present are off charm soloing. <br />

I really feel for them that they aren't getting an aa an hour anymore(yes, that's sarcasm).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>zymral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What they did with this nerf would be equivlant to taking our topor/quint away.  You take a class that depends on a line of spells and make it basicly unuseable.  Yes the spell was broke but how they have changed it they took any dps out of the enchanter class. a class that's only saveing grace compared to shams was charm.  Basicly you had either healing or dps and i can tell ya they never took a group spot from me in POP.  All chanters are left with is a class that can haste a bit better than anyone else slow less than shammies and die alot more.  I think it is sad that a class that has been abused so much would cheer that another class gets destroyed. And forced into LFG status. And as charm looks right now why would anyone want a chanter other than to use as a bot.  (another side note they can still SOLO THE SAME MOBS they just dun get awsome exp for it... so dun expect to see more bot named up)</div></div><hr />

It's been turned from the ultimate no-brainer most over-powered spell in the game into a merely powerful spell that has to be used strategicly.  Boo fricking hoo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As usual (c.f. monk nerf), SOE is going to nerf a class/class ability into oblivion because the top % of the class was able to do things that weren't in the Vision.  So now a L30 chanter soloing at the FM giant fort will get jack for xp compared to the mage/necro right next to him using a pet and blowing them away.  So sad, so typical- if there's a problem charming mobs in PoP using CoD, then NERF CoD and leave the rest of the &lt; 60 game alone!<br />
<br />
Why you'd ever invite a chanter into your group other than as a friend after this I've no idea- KEI is a gate away in nexus and like that extra haste % is that big of a deal, esp. when many melee in the planes are already at the haste cap.  Let's see, you don't do damage, I don't need your mana regen (hello horse + nexus KEI) and even if we do overpull, root/slow will more than handle it.<br />
<br />
Sorry non-CoD chanters, welcome to monkdom. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Charm wasnt even a part of 75% of enchanters lives before PoP. They are still slowers, still have the best mind candy, and best haste in the game. They are GROUP friendly to the extreme. Charm isn't a core enchanter ability and never has been unless it was in an over powered form (Kael and PoP being prime examples).<br />
<br />
This doesn't even begin to undo the fact that people basically sidestepped the game to end up with 400 AA's. It's already been abused to the point that nerfing it doesn't really hurt anyone but the up and coming twink enchanters who were made because of this ability specifically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The agro part of it has already been removed on Test leaving only the XP and Resist aspects.<br />
I don't see how this is affecting chanters much at all.  Now they get less exp from it, but they can still solo BoT named, etc... <br />
Doesn't make their pets do any less dps.  How does a class with mez, c3 c4 and c5 get this kind of dps?  Its just not balanced, classes like monks and rogues should be the dps people, not charmers.<br />
however it's a big help having more slowers available for groups<br />
In pop groups I've been in with chanters, we've both had our hands fulll, between buffs, mezzes, slows, and debuffs.  Much of PoP is un-doable without a chanter anyway (kinda hard to root-park resistant adds who triple for 500+), and it was hard to get any exp when no chanters were lfg, they were all too busy farming armor patterns and rune spells solo.<br />
Charm is how chanters do damage, why make an exp penalty for that?<br />
You ever think of a class like monk or rogue?  ALL THEY DO IS DPS, WHY SHOULD A CHANTER TRIPLE THIER DPS ALL WHILE MEZZING, CLARITYING, AND HASTING???  Hello?  God just called, said he's got that brain ready for you, and he's sorry he forgot about it when you were born.<br />
<br />
Chanters are in DIRE need of a nerf, and this doesn't cut it.  Less exp for soloing bot named for armor patterns and runes?  Oh those poor chanters, now they'll have to group for their AA's :(  (or buy PLs with the millions of plat they can solo farm or get from selling crack in the nexus)  Sony proves once again that they know NOTHING about the game they bought from Verant.  They spent 500x the resources making a new, profitable expansion (LoY) than they'd EVER spend on class balance, the result is chanters who are still gods and monks whose asses are still sore.  Great F'n Job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">They should've just coded it so the DPS of charmed pets is based up on the caster lvl versus pet level - not taking the straight charmed pet DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">About time. One class soloing where no one else can solo, on planes, was way over the top.

The abusers will just laugh and wonder what in the hell they would spend any more AA's on anyway.  The up-and-comers who didn't quite make it to the abuser status will be pissed that they don't get their chance.  <br />
<br />
Most everyone else will breath a sigh of relief that things are getting back to normal and chanters will be once again available for groups instead of being solo/duo machines.  Druids will bitch cuz their source of unbelievably easy AAxp (CoT) got nerfed (same as chanters) but will still continue to abuse it . . with about half the returns as before in exp.  So if they can charm solo 1AA/45 min before nerf, it will take them 1hr 30 min after nerf.  I weep.  really i do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well some perspective. I grouped with an enchanter yesterday who charmed a mob in Tactics. If I maloed and then slowed, the mob was down to 70% life. If slow was resisted by the time I could recast the mob was down to 40%. If we got two mobs, the pet would be on one and the rest of us on the other. The pet outdamaged a rogue, Ranger, and warrior almost every time. And these were well equipped people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Heh, I recall FM Giant fort always being a group kinda place at level 30, but that was a couple years ago or so...  Times change I guess.  thx mudflation.<br />
<br />
All in all, Charm was vastly overpowered.  Anyone who argues that is simply blind.  500-1k DPS pets... Come on, it was nice if you happened to be the charmer or in the charmer's group but it was obviously out of whack when a single pet could out damage pretty much any single group without a charm pet.  Not only that, it wasn't something that only the top of the top enchanters could do...  Anyone that had the spell could do it.  You didn't need high end gear, skill, or anything else.  Any smart charmer and his group were at very minimal danger from the pet.  Add in a snaring class and it was trivially easy for any conscious person barring the occasional string of bad luck, but then again the increase in xp gain was so great that even if you had to eat an unressed death or two a night you'd gain more xp than no deaths without a pet.<br />
<br />
Are the changes overboard?  Hell, if I know...  All 3 together seem overboard to me, but until you see it in practice it's rather hard to guage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">about time they atleast try to do something about it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well, some kind of nerf was needed. The Resist change looks reasonable. The exp change looks reasonable (dire charm). The agro.. well, I'm not sure about that. Thre needs to be SOME agro modification... Is 50% too much? I dunno. I'm not a charmer and cant tell if thats gonna make the mob go after me or not.. Maybe the correct % is 25%. Dunno.<br />
<br />
I do know that a mob thats getting whacked to death by a charmed mob at 400% the rate of the other melees should logically go after the charmer. From an AI perspective it makes sense.<br />
<br />
If you were fighting a NPC that had a higher level charmed pet, you'd of course kill the npc instead of trying to kill the pet THEN the npc. Only makes sense.<br />
<br />
The agro for a soloer isnt that bad.. Just agro kite. It only hurts the grouping chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'll wait and see what actually ends up live but so far even all three sounds pretty reasonable change.<br />
<br />
The high end charming was just compleately and rediclously broken. A guild mate of mine has a lvl 65 froggy pally that had 75aa the last time I checked. Probably over 100 aa by now. How'd he get all that? He basically sat afk on his pally while he charm soloed with his enchanter.<br />
<br />
Enchanters don't need to be damage dealers. That isn't the purpose they where put in for. They are buffed and crowd control. Them being able to charm pets that can outdamage a group is just rediclous and should have some definite disadvantages and side effects.<br />
<br />
The removal of the resist modifer on CoD is an obvious change and I think in part a result of the stupidly broken Total domination aa.<br />
<br />
I do like the pet taking some percent of the exp depending on the percent of the damage they deal. It's a good way of allowing them to use the pet reasonably in a group with out letting them solo for rediculous exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Charm was definitly overpowered but these nerf it to the extreme and make it a rather useless spell except for just item camping.<br />

Truthfully I can't even begin to understand why anybody who has played a shaman, a class that has taken a decent amount of nerfs, could ever wish for nerfs on another class. In some ways I almost wis hthey would nerf torpor or quinsience just to screw with the asses all happy about it. <br />

It makes me sad to see people act like this after being hit with the nerf bat themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">If this only went after the 60+ crowd I'd have far less an issue, but the &lt; 60 game still exists, believe it or not.  Yes, seriously, I know this is going to come as a shock- but not all chanters are L64 w/ CoD scribed soloing named in BoT.  <br />
<br />
When, other than in dungeons that are virtually ghost towns in the post-PoP era, do &lt; 60  groups need chanters?  Forgive my ignorance, I regularly group w/ my rl friend who plays a chanter and charm is his bread and butter, really his only redeeming feature at this point (L46).  Mana regen is a non issue since we can both gate to Nexus for KEI at any time, clarity I/II is pretty much useless for xping when for 15pp I can get 2.5 hour+ FT 14.<br />
<br />
The resist change I can live with, but the xp change for the &lt; 60 chanter is flat out wrong IMO.  Oh well, prolly beating a dead horse- after watching monks get nerfed repeatedly, both directly (mitigation) and indirectly (PoP mobs, mob caster changes, itemization), I realize that chanters will prolly end up the same way.<br />

This barely touches BOT mini's, and doesn't really effect the use of charmed mobs on raids (a crutch for alot of guilds). I think people are overreacting, alot of them because they have a Chanter/Druid/Necro sugar-daddy. I know I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Typical of SoE to solv an easy problem with such a strange set of &quot;fixes&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem was simply that a charmed pet is very strong in comparison to other pets.  All they neaded to do was bring the charmed pet into line DPS wise with pets apropriate for people for the level of the enchanter.  The DPS of the pet could simply be braught in line with what a pet for another int caster could do at the same level.<br />
<br />
Instead,  SOE has to do some kind of complicated garbage with experiance,  resists, and agro which will have zero impact on the enchanters ability to do all kinds of  strang and out of balance things with charmed pets.  The only thing it seams to truly impact is the ability to use pets to grind exp.<br />
<br />
Charm is clearly more dangerous ( exluding DC ) then just casting a pet, but a charmed pet would still have other benifits like a lot of HP and turning it into a pet for CC reasons.<br />
<br />
SOE blew it on this nerf and it will be disruptive without truly addressing the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Gurck I played a necro back in the old days when we were getting nerfed everypatch for 6-7months straight.

<br />
Believe me I understand nerfage and I also understand that no old school necro would ever ask for a nerf for another class and it bothers me that shaman would. Makes me think that maybe we need more nerfs so people would stop asking for nerfs period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Kelt you've gotta draw a line somewhere.  Enchanters can (and still will be able to post-nerf from what I've read of the changes, albeit with less xp gained) SOLO runes (spells) and armor patterns worth 50-150k.  Come on, this is nuts.  I'm not the type of person to gleefully enjoy others' pain (therefore I'm in the 1% minority of the population) but charmers, especially enchanters, really do need this nerf.  And it is kinda nice knowing that some of the folks who are upset by this are the same folks who told me to sthu and stop whining about my monk :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">&quot;Monk nerf still has monks useful&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, my monk is useful for FD PLing my shaman to 60 so that I can strip him to equip an SK.  They tank worse than I do, worse than BLs, worse than any other non-robe wearing class (yes, worse than rangers/rogues).  I 2 box heavily and watched monks go from a great partner to &quot;if mob's not slowed, you're FD or dead&quot; even in emergencies.  Pitiful.  This has been beaten to death at monkly-business ad nauseum.  Monks are &quot;rogue lites&quot;, but that's another topic.<br />
<br />
I _hate_ seeing other classes nerfed, necro, monk, whatever.  Particularly when SOE claims to be aiming at the high end player doing the &quot;abuse&quot; but end up really nailing the non-uber.  I've yet to see how the proposed charm nerf will stop the farming of BoT named, but I can easily see how it will kill the &lt; 60 charm soloing crowd w/ those PHAT 40 dps pets in Dulak Harbor, what a joke.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">The xp adjustment eliminates charm soloing at lower levels, too.  Why can't they just change that one high-level spell to a bigger resist, shorter duration and a sizable slow?  That would keep the 95% of the enchanters who don't need the nerf untouched.<br />
<br />
Or, if they must nerf xp, let the critter get a full share of xp from the kill.  Soloing, an enchanter gets 50%, and a group would still get good xp.</div></div><hr />

My main play partner is a Necro, these were a nice three weeks or so for us. I totally agree this needed nerfing badly, and I don't think there are many out there who didn't see this coming in the near future. I just wish they would have adjusted the risk factor in the Risk = Reward equation instead of destroying the reward. Upping the resist/break rate was fine, and so was the aggro increase. It's the exp nerf that hurts the most for practical mostly-non-abusive use. I know a lot of Necro who were finally sought after for groups because of this, dunno what's gonna happen after this change.<br />
<br />
Making the Charmed pet take exp like the DC pets is a bit overkill considering the level of DPS the DC pets can put out versus the level of DPS the CoD/WoT pets are cranking out. The best Necro pet in Tactics puts out roughly 500 DPS, and there aren't many groups that can put out more than that consistantly over a long period of time (in an exp group).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the solution was aimed at (the people soloing BoT nameds or the people making exp) but I kinda wish this wasn't aimed at the latter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>talas213</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">High end monks were able to take about 6% less dmg than an equivalently equipped warrior (note that this did not take HP pools nor CH into account) and they received a heavy (unwarranted IMO) nerf to their mitigation ability.  Monks are only very situationaly useful now.<br />
<br />
Enchanters were able to do solo what whole groups might struggle to accomplish.  Enchanters were able to solo insane amount of AAXP.  It was badly broken.  Enchanters still have the best haste.  Enchanters still have by far the best mana regen buff.  Enchanters can still significantly contribute to a groups DPS.<br />
<br />
Are enchanters notably less powerful than they were ? yes<br />
<br />
Did the nerf make enchanters obsolete or only useful in very specific circumstances ? hell no.<br />
<br />
Will they still be able to pull off solo what it takes a full group to do normally ? yep, they just get less exp for it, but will still be able to get faster solo exp than pretty much every other class (300+ DPS pets are still unbalanced).</div></div><hr />

Sony waited waay to long on this and it's too late, the uber-chanters (and their friends/twinks) already have those hundreds of AA's banked. I say scrap this whole XP nerf if all it's going to do is anger those young enchanters who haven't been abusing anything. How about requiring the enchanter or her group to do 50% of the damage to get full loot/xp, for CoD only?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I don't see how those changes do anything really.  Let me see if I have this straight: the aggro changes that may have actually altered the way charm is abused have been removed; The spells have a slightly higher chance of being resisted  (OMG they have to tash now);  and now they will get somewhat less uber xp from slaughtering mobs at triple the rate of a full group of melees and healers?  <br />
<br />
Sorry but BFD.  I will continue to be reduced to mooching xp and loot off my chanter friends who are nice enough NOT to go solo (God bless em).  Enchanters will still be able to solo mini's and get rich.  CoD will still be more lucrative for them than their other money maker, the 5k per hour+ from sitting on their ass buffing people.  <br />
<br />
Is it jealousy talking?  Yep.  Does that make the deification of Enchanters okay?  Nope.<br />

KEI and its relatives are grossly unbalanced.  Dire charm is grossly unbalanced.  CoD is grossly unbalanced.  I see nothing in this nerf that changes any of that.</div></div><hr />

point a)Chanters are not a dps class, and shouldnt be able to make 64th and suddenly outdamage entire groups of rogues, monks and wizards all by themselves.<br />
<br />
point b)fixing a HORRIBLY HORRIBLY HORRIBLY broken spell/ability is not a &quot;nerf&quot; its a fix. This should never have went live in the first place.. it wasnt like monk tanking which became evident as the game progressed, this was something that was broken the moment PoP went live, and the early discoverers already farmed their AA to max and have 800k sitting in the bank from ripping people off on runes and ornate bps/legs they solod for weeks on end, screwing anyone who went in with a group to like.. play EQ like normal human beings.<br />
<br />
point c)slow mitigation? Spell durations in general compared to other buff classes? Hello McFly? What more could they really nerf.. its not shaman that solo for 1aa per 20 minutes, or solo for the best armor that 98% of eq will ever likely see.<br />
<br />
So yes, I will laugh.. and cheer.. and dance in circles at the FIXING(not nerfing) of CoD. It was truly broken. Chanters still have 2 of the most godlike abilities in the game(mez, slow) in addition to the best haste and best mana regen buffs. <br />

It only tells me that you are a newb who doesn't know much.  <br />
<br />
This change will also impact NECROS and DRUIDS.  Small surprise so many are against it.  Of necros, only a small minority were lucky enuf to get the lvl 65 spell that allowed them to charm high level undead.  More druids were seriously abusing Command of Tunare in places like Plane of Storms for an easy AA every 40 minutes or so.  <br />
<br />
The alternative to nerfing this ability is to blatantly come out and say that Enchanter, Druid, and Necro are the favored and dominant classes and will get to be more powerful than any other class by default.  Maybe this is cool with some of you.  But I really don't see how it could possibly be construed as balanced.  <br />
<br />
As for shamans, nerfs, and nerf fears . . . we've already been nerfed back to the Stone Age.  Any &quot;improvements&quot; we've gotten recently were grudgingly given by Sony, scoured over with a jaundiced eye for anything remotely overpowering, and then sterilized of all exploit possibilities.  And finally shipped in about 1/10th the quantity they were needed.  <br />
<br />
You can't really nerf shamans any more.  I feel safe, personally, from the nerf bat.  In order to nerf us, they would have to drastically nerf all classes or all casters or something.  <br />
<br />
In matters of relative power, the shaman is perhaps less equal than his contemporaries.  Not more equal.  Our minor powers can be put together to do marginally cool things by competent players, but NOTHING like what at least 3 other classes can accompish. <br />
<br />
Relative power is where it's at.  And that is the reason charm is getting nerfed.  It was not only more powerful than any other class ability, it was easy, and it made all other class abilities obsolete.  <br />
<br />
When the abilities of one class make all other classes obsolete, something should be done or the game will be as broken as a first edition of Diablo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If charm pre-PoP, sub 60 was so overpowering, why was this not an issue until now that warrants nerfing an entire spell line for a plethora of classes at all levels (if that's how it's implemented)?  Really bothers me that &lt; 60 charmers are having their uber 40 dps pets nerfed as well as the 300+ dps PoP charmers.

I just wish they would have adjusted the risk factor in the Risk = Reward equation instead of destroying the reward<br />
Risk vs. reward in this case is 10x the exp rate vs. a chance of death?  You could eat an unressed death every 30 minutes as a charmer and still get absurd exp.  That's not much risk for the reward.</div></div><hr />

bs chanters have always had the ability to charm mobs which OUTDAMAGE rogues, rangers, etc even you and dogdog at similar level.  the 64 charm had a higher success rate but after 64 levels chanters should get a reliable charm. they &quot;enchant&quot; after all.</div></div><hr />

Jathu:<br />

In his twisted, spoiled mind, its fine and dandy for enchanters to be FAR more powerful than any other class.  He even goes so far as to rationalize it by linking it to reality - &quot;They enchant, after all&quot; LOL.  People did the same for the monk nerf heh, they said stuff along the lines of &quot;plate &gt; leather so ha!&quot; and other high-IQ gloating.  If you want to talk about reality, when was the last time you cast a spell IRL?  Reality goes out the door when you log in, what SHOULD matter is balance.  Monks tanked better than rogues or rangers, but not as well as paladins, sk's, or warriors.  Rogues did more damage, rangers did excellent damage and get spells also.  This was balance.  Enchanters without charm still provide excellent DPS - as an example, let's assume a group has.. a warrior, a rogue, and a monk, all with decent gear.  Together those three do (this is an estimate) oh, somewhere in the neighborhood of 200?  225 dps?  Now the  enchanter hastes them all by 70%, adding (at the low end) 140 dps to the group.  The enchanter also ups the dps of offensive casters and the healing power of the group's healer(s) with clarity 3/4/5.  The enchanter mezzes adds, turning what could be a bloodbath into a neat little line of exp &quot;next please&quot;.  This is balance.<br />

I have -ZERO- compassion for charmers. None. I look at the tedious grinding I've had to do to scratch out aaxp, and it makes me absolutely sick to think these classes can spend the same amount of time exping and get 20 times the exp.<br />

If you don't see the problem with that, and the reason for nerfing this broken ability into the stone age, I wonder at your capacity for rational thought. <br />

It never should have gone live..but then the dev team doesn't understand their game. They should have gotten a clue after how bards were using charm in velious what could happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Coercer Nefandus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Man, I can’t believe the entire shaman community is rejoicing at our nerf. Seriously, what will you (as shaman) have gained by this nerf? What do you think will be next on the nerf menu at SoE. Hmm, maybe your FT189? (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=11999) I mean, for the love of god I never knew shaman mana regen was that insane. How great will you guys feel when all the other classes are laughing at you saying how “FT189 was just broken, good thing they fixed it, ha ha ha” while you sit there playing the unfun class that remains.<br />
<br />
Mezz is not required (or even desired) in the vast majority of PoP. Pacification/harmo/fd are much more efficient and safer. Enchanters are not needed for haste, and C3 can be bought. Ask any chanter, the only reason we get groups is for slow. And then only if there aren’t any shaman lfg.<br />
<br />
The –50mr on this spell was perfectly chosen to balance against PoP mobs higher level relative to the caster, and higher MR. “Just having to tash first” changes the whole dynamic of this spell, and destroys its use for crowd control (which we often use it for thanks to bliss’s obscene mana cost and woeful resist rate). Tash is not like malo. If I cast tash on a mob, there is a 100% chance I will be tanking an unslowed mob. Having to channel a 5 second casting spell when you have 8 seconds to live for the same resist adjust you used to have just by casting the spell is a massive reduction in effectiveness.<br />
<br />
And just an FYI, enchanters have not been able to solo BoT mini’s for a while now. The ability to do this was nerf a long time ago so please do not perpetuate this complete falsehood. All the mini’s regen to 100% when they lose agro, pacification only lasts 48 seconds now, and you can’t bind in the zone. These cannot be done solo anymore, period.<br />
<br />
Thank heavens we have our “upgraded” 6 second casting time 8 second refresh time nukes :rolleyes:  Why every other class wants us to be nothing but a buff bitch is beyond me :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Enchanters have always had the best DPS in the game although POP has expanded the gap noticably.<br />
<br />
What people do not seem to understand is that there were enchanters like myself that did charm before Dire Charm and the new POP charms.  Ever see a 60th level enchanter charm, haste and dual wield a warrior frog in Sebilis?  I outdamaged entire parties then and I still do now :)<br />
<br />
The problem with POP is the content and the additional tools that we were given that make Charming easier.  Arcane Rune/Eldrich Rune being the two most noticable.  Now every enchanter charms and groups have realized the power of charm.  I was lucky I grouped with RL friends who understood the power of charm and I used it early on.  Tash, Malo, Haste and Dual Wield a Kobold in VL and watch him wipe all his buddies and triple the kill rate of the party ... this is nothing new.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a dual wielding hasted Giant in Kael?  I could outdamage a party with my DC pet in Kael and that was with a level 46 pet.  Using my higher level charm, I could outdamage small raids.<br />
<br />
As for soloing boss mobs with charm, they have done a pretty admirable job of making that impossible but quite frankly that is also a content issue and an exploit issue.<br />
<br />
POP has reduced encounters to single mob encounters which can generally be pulled with little or no effort single.  Which means that enchanters do not have to do CC and can concentrate exclusively on holding a pet.  POP has given us areas like the pit in tactics where we can charm and zone in the middle of a zone.  It is the POP layout that has made charm way too easy to use.<br />
<br />
Is charm overpowering?  No more than it has ever been however the currently designed game content was not carefully considered and that is what is costing them now.  Easier than correcting the content is to nerf the ability.<br />
<br />
The problem is I used to Charm, Stun and Mezz ... I used to CC ... but there is no more CC in high tiers in POP you pull 3 mobs and the enchanter bounces a mezz he is dead.<br />
<br />
I cannot mezz, I cannot stun and have not been able to stun for many expansions and now my ability to Charm is currently in question. <br />
<br />
You may say that I can KEI, Haste and Slow still ... well, KEI you can get from EnchanterBot_01 which lasts near 4 hours, Shamans can slow better and their haste although worse than ours pushes melee to the haste cap, so what is the point of my haste ... why is it needed?  My DoTs and nukes will not hold up to a shaman, with cannibalize a shaman can regen mana for whatever purpose faster than I can even without KEI but since it lasts 4 hours they will likely have it.  A shaman can also heal and does not wear a dress so they can take a little damage :)<br />
<br />
Worse comes to worse you can root an add for CC since it has a -30 MR built in vs Bliss with a -10MR.  My CC goes like this now:<br />
<br />
1. Greater Fetter <br />
2. Tash<br />
3. Bliss<br />
<br />
There is nothing stopping me from holding the mob permenantly rooted.  Shaman resistance debuff costs more mana but is more efficient.<br />
<br />
There is really no reason to bring an enchanter along to do CC, Shaman can do it better.  We are not looking at pulls of 6-10 mobs anymore when 3 Tier 2+ mobs is more than enough to wipe a party.  What shaman cannot hold 2 mobs rooted and slowed then heal themselves of any damage they took.<br />
<br />
So, do not sell yourselves short compared to enchanters, we are not what we once were.  The reason we are so welcome in groups these days is due to charm which is getting nerfed.<br />
<br />
I play both a 65 shaman and a 65 enchanter but my main, to this point, has always been my enchanter.  I have been shifting to focusing on my shaman more and more and my enchanter less and less.  I can do more with my shaman than with my enchanter who is sliding farther and farther towards being a Clarity Bot.<br />
<br />
Charm is the one exception to this, when I am charming I use my shaman to keep me alive ... without charm however my time is better spent in my shaman.<br />

Yes, my monk is useful for FD PLing my shaman to 60 so that I can strip him to equip an SK.  They tank worse than I do, worse than BLs, worse than any other non-robe wearing class (yes, worse than rangers/rogues).  I 2 box heavily and watched monks go from a great partner to &quot;if mob's not slowed, you're FD or dead&quot; even in emergencies.  Pitiful.  This has been beaten to death at monkly-business ad nauseum.  Monks are &quot;rogue lites&quot;, but that's another topic.<br />

I _hate_ seeing other classes nerfed, necro, monk, whatever.  Particularly when SOE claims to be aiming at the high end player doing the &quot;abuse&quot; but end up really nailing the non-uber.  I've yet to see how the proposed charm nerf will stop the farming of BoT named, but I can easily see how it will kill the &lt; 60 charm soloing crowd w/ those PHAT 40 dps pets in Dulak Harbor, what a joke.<br />
<br />

<br />
I dont play a monk. That said, Monks got screwed. The monk nerf and the enchanter nerf are NOTHING alike. A Monk could never go into a zone and exp 4 to 6x faster than a  group. A monk could never do 500 dps. A Monk could never solo mobs that droped items 50k+.<br />
<br />
Monks simply tanked almost as well as Wars when they had high AA's and equipment. Thats not the monks fault. Thats War's being unblanced. So now Monks do less damage than a rogue, and tank worse than a ranger. They only really thing they are good for is pulling. The ironic part is those of us that were around in the beginning will remember that Monk FD's were never intended as a split/pull tool. It was simply a way to avoid death. Now the whole class is balanced around that one skill.<br />

Well unfortunately in an attempt to solve the charm problem, they jacked most mobs to near instantanious regen when they have no aggro.  So how do we get xp for our massive damage dealers?  <br />
<br />
Farm rares perhaps?  They nerfed that as well by dropping the time on Pacification and making mobs with no aggro regen almost instantly.  Which prevents the exploits that were the original issue.<br />
<br />
3. Enchanters are more sought after than shamans.  Incorrect!<br />
<br />
Why are enchanters more sought after?  <br />
So their newly nerfed pet can take most of the xp?  <br />
So they can KEI instead of snagging a 4 hour KEI from EnchanterBoT_01?  <br />
So they can slow less efficiently than a shaman by 5% and get beat into the dirt doing so with our paper armor, lack of hp and lack of healing ability?<br />
So we can use a similar version of the root spell (Greater Fetter) that a shaman will be using (Greater Immobilize) to do CC because it has a better chance of landing and costs much less mana than our mezz?<br />
So we can MR debuff with a massive aggro spell vs the shaman debuff with a minimum aggro spell and do it better?<br />
So we can use our better haste to put the melee at exact same haste cap that a shaman can put them at with their slightly lesser haste?<br />
<br />
What does an enchanter add to the party that a shaman cannot ... then add the fact a shaman without KEI regens mana faster than an enchanter with KEI, not to mention a shaman with KEI and Canni.  A shaman can heal, a shaman can toss out HP buffs, a shaman has better armor and HP, a shaman has better DoTs, better Nukes and a pet that does more damage and is controllable and best yet does not take XP from the party for the damage it does.<br />

Seriously, what will you (as shaman) have gained by this nerf? What do you think will be next on the nerf menu at SoE. Hmm, maybe your FT189? (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=11999) I mean, for the love of god I never knew shaman mana regen was that insane. How great will you guys feel when all the other classes are laughing at you saying how “FT189 was just broken, good thing they fixed it, ha ha ha” while you sit there playing the unfun class that remains.(<br />
<br />
Bah.<br />
<br />
1) That the theoretical max. 80 or so FT is average.<br />
<br />
2) Get off your ass and look at the mana cost of our spells . Try lucy. Ok, notice how our spells cost ALOT of mana. Not jsut alot, but I mean ALOT. Guess what, our spells are balanced around our mana regen. Funny that heh?<br />
<br />
3) Becuase everything costs so much, nerfing our Regen would break us,, yes. But in reality, all we seem to do now is Debuf and slow now during a fight. Our Dots are horribly broken so we cant cast them. Our DD's do pathetic damage and cost a LOT of mana. If you took away our mana regen, we would stil lhave enough mana to debuf and slow. We simply wouldnt do any damage after that. That would be ok inmy book. Hell, half the shammies now adays are sick of the cani/heal dance. Its a Pita and easier jsut to sit down and regen.<br />
<br />
4) Our class defining skill (slow) has already been nerfed HARD this expansion. I dont remember enchanters giving one bit of sympathy over this. Yours was nefred too, but you dotn care cause you have a 500+ dps pet... so why even care?<br />
<br />
5) Because of 3 and 4 there is literally NO way they can nerf us any more. None. Nada. Zero. They have already taken everything away thats within the realm of reason. Our primary ability is now no better than at least 2 other classes. If they nerf our regen, it wont matter one bit. Seriously.<br />

6) Go cry somewhere else. Being from a class that has experienced more nerfs than you ever have, we simply dont care anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does a chanter add to the party vs a chammy? Lets look at it.<br />
<br />
1) Your slow is just as good as ours alot of the time. When it isnt, its only 5% worse. Your haste is better. Even when your slow isnt as good, your haste more than makes up for it.<br />
<br />
2) You can add mana regen to the casters. We cant.<br />
<br />
3) We can add buffs to the melees. Basicly one buff thats 400 to 600 hps. The stats buffs dont do jack cause a) stats dont do much post 255, and b) everyones stats are maxed anyways.<br />
<br />
4) We can both root.<br />
<br />
5) You can mezz. We cant.<br />
<br />
6) We get a pet that does 25dps. You get one that does 500.<br />
<br />
7) Your nukes do more damage than ours. True, we can cani, but we have to constantly cani to keep up with the damage your nukes do.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
True:<br />
Your slow costs 25 mana more than ours and lasts 2x as long<br />
Your nukes cost the same.<br />
Your DoTs cost alot but you do not cast them because they are horribly broken.<br />
Your Resistance Debuffer line is 8X more expensive than ours but hey at 80 FT from canni you are not doing too bad compared to our 14-16 from Clarity and you may well have KEI for an additional 14.<br />

4) Our class defining skill (slow) has already been nerfed HARD this expansion. I dont remember enchanters giving one bit of sympathy over this. Yours was nefred too, but you dotn care cause you have a 500+ dps pet... so why even care?<br />
<br />
<br />
My class defining skills:<br />
<br />
1. Mezz: still here but toned down alot, no more 10+ trains locked down, no more irresistable mezz, root lands easier for 1/7th the mana and handles the max 2 adds that you can bring without wiping hte party quite nicely.<br />
<br />
2. Stun: our stuns are gone<br />
<br />
3. Charm: charm is being nerfed<br />
<br />
4. Mana Regen: Every class gets mana regen + FT and can BOT KEI thats last 4 hours<br />
<br />
5. Haste: Several classes can haste melee to the haste cap, sure ours is better but the cap is the cap.<br />
<br />
6. Slow: Well since yours was nerfed so hard, I guess that ours was as well, frankly I have not really noticed the difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
6) Go cry somewhere else. Being from a class that has experienced more nerfs than you ever have, we simply dont care anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually the Class defining skills of Enchanters have been systematically stripped from them from Luclin onwards.  We just had a longer way to fall before we hit rock bottom.  Enchanters have been nerfed more than shaman.<br />

<br />
Im sure you will console your self later by looking at the 500k you have in the bank, and the multiple backpacks full of ornate molds. And the 500+ aa you probably got in 2 weeks of CoD soloing.<br />
<br />
Its a FIX not a nerf. Chanters are just upset that they wont be outdamaging entire groups full of VT geared dps melees. *sheds oh yet another crocadile tear*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">2: Er what planet do you live on? Read your own boards. Chanters are still getting in excess of 3% of exp per kill on test. Solo. You kill 4 to 6x fast than a group. HELLO? WAKE UP?<br />
<br />
<br />
You need better groups hell I get 1% per kill in a raid for crying out loud. I used to get 7% per kill with my old pet.  I can get 2% per kill with an optimized group.  Imagine that, you can solo for more per kill ... is that why all those wizards, druids and necros solo ... nifty.  Is that why you saw also those shaman/monk teams in SoL ... interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
What does a chanter add to the party vs a chammy? Lets look at it.<br />
<br />
1) Your slow is just as good as ours alot of the time. When it isnt, its only 5% worse. Your haste is better. Even when your slow isnt as good, your haste more than makes up for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hate to break it to you but slow is the most powerful spell in the game, the mitigation works on a sliding scale so our slow is always worse than your.<br />
<br />
Our Haste makes up for it?  What do you not understand about the haste cap?  Your haste puts a melee at the haste cap, my haste puts a melee at the haste cap.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) You can add mana regen to the casters. We cant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice way to completely dodge the fact that we are not needed for it.  Yes, we can add mana regen to a group but as I said before and you so pointedly ignored because of course I am correct.  You can snag a 4 hour KEI from a KEI_BOT, so why bother with an enchanter in your group?<br />
<br />
It is not like we are talking deep dungeons and camping the rare spawn anymore ... every 4 hours everyone bails and snags another KEI ... or I suppose you could bring an enchanter along to cast it on you every 4 hours ... seems like a waste to me though.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) We can add buffs to the melees. Basicly one buff thats 400 to 600 hps. The stats buffs dont do jack cause a) stats dont do much post 255, and b) everyones stats are maxed anyways.<br />
<br />
<br />
So a 10% increase in HP is not worth it?  Stats are not maxed even in the uber guilds ... sure your stamina may not help out a melee but it will likely help out a hybrid or a caster.<br />
<br />
<br />
4) We can both root.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yep we both can root<br />
<br />
<br />
5) You can mezz. We cant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Root is a safer form of CC, -30MR, 150mana, 1.75sec casting<br />
vs<br />
-10MR, 300 mana, 2.5 sec casting<br />
<br />
Since the beginning of EQ shaman have been rootparking and functioning just fine for small pulls.  POP is the land of you pull more than 3 and you die ... hell in some places even 3 will wipe your party.  <br />
<br />
Root has a noticably better chance of landing than Mezz does, you can debuff a mob using malo without having it stick to you like glue, I tash so I can land mezz or root and I am toe paste.<br />
<br />
<br />
6) We get a pet that does 25dps. You get one that does 500.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes and you are cheering the nerf of said pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
7) Your nukes do more damage than ours. True, we can cani, but we have to constantly cani to keep up with the damage your nukes do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our nukes do a little more damage than yours and take longer to cycle.  Yours cycle faster and do a little less damage.  You have poison and cold, we have magic.  You canni and super canni to handle the fact your nuke/damage ratio costs you roughly 20% more mana which is 60 more mana per nuke.<br />
<br />
A shaman can out nuke an enchanter hands down, I know ... my shaman has FT4 and my enchanter has FT8.  When I single group the acidic ooze and I duo both my enchanter and my shaman guess who outdamages whom by 2.5 to 1?<br />
<br />
<br />
8) We get Malo. Yup, we got you there. We are the king of debufs. Oh boy.<br />
<br />
<br />
You malo line costs more mana but it does more<br />
<br />
<br />
Gee, I wonder which a group would rather have.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I suppose if you fail to mention the fact you can also heal and you can handle aggro better with more hp, better armor, better defensive skills.<br />
<br />
The only reason an enchanter is a better pick for a group is the fact they have a pet and quite frankly I am not certain I would want to have to maintain charm in a group without malo and a shaman to slow/spot heal.<br />
<br />
The problem you are running into here is the fact I actually duo box both characters so unlike you I actually know the pro's and con's and dynamics of playing both classes ... sure enough from an enchanter bent :)<br />
<br />
Barring Charm, I would be playing the shaman on my master box and the enchanter on my secondary box.<br />
<br />
So yes, as I have stated ... charm is definately very powerful but all that other woe is me BS where you tried to make enchanters without charm more desirable to a group than a shaman is just that ... BS.<br />
<br />
I like how when challenged about it you ignored all the justification, restated your initial arguement without refuting a single part of my initial arguement and quickly added &quot;charm&quot; in there as well though ... very well thought out :)<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Your nukes cost the same.<br />
Really? Compare a Shm with Velium Strike + Cannibilize to an Enc with Insanity + Dementing Visions. Shaman nukes twice, it takes 18 seconds and does 1850 dmg for 600 mana. Enc nukes once with each, it takes 14.5 seconds and does 1875 dmg for 550 mana. <br />
<br />
3. Charm: charm is being nerfed<br />
It's getting nerfed some, but its still probably overpowered and definately viable.<br />
<br />
Mana Regen: can BOT KEI thats last 4 hours<br />
Enchanters make tons of platinum selling KEI, man that must be rough for you?? And if you are in a group with an enchanter you can get Voice of Quellious which doesn't last as long but gives more mana.<br />
<br />
5. Haste: sure ours is better but the cap is the cap.<br />
Let's not forget your haste adds +41 ATK and lasts 42 minutes.<br />
<br />
6. Slow: Well since yours was nerfed so hard, I guess that ours was as well, frankly I have not really noticed the difference.<br />
Basically your slow is just as good as ours now except for the duration.<br />
<br />
edit: im sorry, I forgot to ask, isn't draining mana another class defining skill for Enchanters? It didn't make your list so maybe no one does that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Heard of mez?<br />
<br />
Exactly, you boil it down to mezz because that is the mainstay of enchanters, that is what everyone wanted an enchanter for in the previous expansions ... the shiny toy we had that made us the 3rd member of the trinity.<br />
<br />
Well in POP you do not get 6+ mobs pulled to camp.  In tier 2+ zones you pull more than 3 to camp and you wipe the party.  But why would you?  You have no need to pull that many and it is safer not to.  It does not take any additional time to FD break thru chain aggro ... mobs in POP are nicely set up so that in dungeon or out you can pull 1 or 2 with no trouble.<br />
<br />
You do not find yourself in the situation where you pull 6 because of chain aggro issues ... you pull 1, sometimes 2.<br />
<br />
Are you telling me that with a root that lands more regularly than a mezz you cannot hold an add or even 2?<br />
<br />
I do not mezz anymore at least not for initial CC, I cast my -30 MR 120 Mana Root.  It lands better, costs less and lasts longer ... the only disadvantage is that it is random.  It &quot;can&quot; break, of course by that time the mob is slowed.<br />
<br />
An enchanter is not needed for this, an enchanter is actually at a disadvantage because they cannot take the damage, they cannot heal, they do not have the defense a shaman has.<br />
<br />
Why do you need mezz to stop a pull of 1 or 2 mobs, will it save you if the puller gets 6?  Nope, nothing will save you if the puller gets 6.<br />
<br />
So, yes we have mezz and if you want to go back to somewhere it is needed then enchanters will be more popular in a group than shaman ... but it is not needed, not even in an emergancy because it will not save you.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">See my point? You are advocating a nerf on the bassis of a rumor! <br />
<br />
No, I am advocating a fix, based on first hand experience watching Enchanters use CoD in several different situations. I have been advocating it for MONTHS now as a matter of fact. <br />
<br />
And FYI, its not just chanter charming. Mages with the 65th charm and frenzied burnout are almost worse. It is(maybe was.. never saw it announced in a patch that it was fixed) bugged to NEVER fade on a charmed pet.<br />
<br />
Maybe its fun for chanters and mages to charm solo for an aa point every 15 or 20 minutes, but it isnt balanced, not by a longshot. It is not &quot;one or 2 of the top chanters&quot;. You dont need to be a top chanter to out DPS whole groups of VT geared melees. That is what makes it so broken, and what you fail to understand. When one spell invalidates entire groups of peoples efforts, then it is BROKEN BEYOND BELIEF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Out of curiosity, I looked at the top 200 total aap by on EQRankings and counted them by class.<br />
<br />
1st off counting by class I only can come up with a total of 194, I can't for the life of me figure out what happened to the missing 6 (4 on the 1st page and 2 on the 2nd). What I mean is I counted all 15 classes and added them up. Done it a few times and used a find feature to make sure I didn't miss any. Add all the class numbers up and I only get 194.<br />
<br />
Anyways, here are the top 194 folks ranked by class. I also figued out there % ranking among the top 194 and there polulation % listed among EQrankings 12723 listed profiles to give us a rough idea of how any classes population numbers might be % wise. Not 100% acurate, but good enough for goverment work.  Their 194% is 1st, followed by their population %. I rounded all the numbers to the nearest .1<br />
<br />
45 - Enc 23.2%/5.8%<br />
25 - Nec 12.9%/4.9%<br />
23 - Wiz 11.9%/8.6%<br />
15 - Dru 7.7%/7.2%<br />
15 - War 7.7%/9.8%<br />
13 - SK 6.7%/5.4%<br />
11 - Clr 5.7%/10.8%<br />
10 - Pal 5.2%/6.8%<br />
9 - Mnk 4.6%/6.9%<br />
7 - Rog 3.6%/6.1%<br />
7 - Brd 3.6%/4.2%<br />
6 - Shm 3.1%/7.3%<br />
5 - Rng 2.6%/7.6%<br />
3 - Mag 3.1%/6.4%<br />
0 - Bst 0%/2.4%<br />
<br />
<br />
Was suprised by how big the Enc's lead was over the necro's. The warriors must be doing lots of 2-boxing to keep up with us dr00ds. Suprised the rangers were ranked so low, they can solo pretty well and are nice in groups.<br />

As I said earlier, this only screws the up and coming twink chanters or people who switched back to chanters hoping to capitalize, and as far as I'm concerned anyone here whining that chanters are worthless after this nerf falls into this category. <br />
<br />
People who have 400+ AA's and all the equipment from charming are just gonna sit back and laugh. Think they care about the rest of you? Hell no.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Athenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">No, I am advocating a fix, based on first hand experience watching Enchanters use CoD in several different situations. I have been advocating it for MONTHS now as a matter of fact. <br />
<br />
And FYI, its not just chanter charming. Mages with the 65th charm and frenzied burnout are almost worse. It is(maybe was.. never saw it announced in a patch that it was fixed) bugged to NEVER fade on a charmed pet.<br />
<br />
Maybe its fun for chanters and mages to charm solo for an aa point every 15 or 20 minutes, but it isnt balanced, not by a longshot. It is not &quot;one or 2 of the top chanters&quot;. You dont need to be a top chanter to out DPS whole groups of VT geared melees. That is what makes it so broken, and what you fail to understand. When one spell invalidates entire groups of peoples efforts, then it is BROKEN BEYOND BELIEF.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like you took my quote out of context in order to try and disprove me or something.  I was responding to the above shamans claim that I had 500AAs, and 500,000 plat in the bank.  But then you go on to prove my point again.  Another rumor is that echanters can make 15 minute AAs.  That is not a sustainable figure.  People don't figure in the downtime from death, medding, getting the necessary buffs etc etc.... <br />
<br />
You say you don't need to be a top enchanter to out dps a few melees, once again you took what I said out of context.  I said you need to be a top enchanter to be soloing PoP bosses that drop runes and ornate molds.<br />
<br />
No you are right, you don't need to be a top chanter to outdamage a few melees.  But you sure as hell better be ready when charm breaks or you are gonna get owned badly.  You talk about charm damage as if it is free sustained damage.  Warriors don't have to chase down their sword every so often while it shreds their group members to pieces.  Rogues don't get mysteriously backstabbed by their own dagger every few minutes until they get it under control.  Melee damage is different than charm damage, it is more sustainable, more reliable and much less work for everyone around them.</div></div><hr />

I didn't come here for sympathy from you, I'm just pissed that you shamans as a community seem to be celebrating the biggest enchanter nerf ever.  I thought you shamans were our friends and yet you stab us in the back.  Our two classes have so much in common I find it hard to believe you could be so happy about such a harsh nerf a class defining skill.  <br />
<br />
Beleive me when I say the combination of all these nerfs really does hurt our class.  I rolled my enchanter three years ago for the ability to mez and charm.  Likewise I rolled my shaman becuase I think they are an awesomely powerful fun class to play.  You guys have very little to be jealous of so I don't see where all the hate is coming from. <br />
<br />
I don't have 500,0000pp I farmed with charm.  I am level 64 with 12 AA points so far which I'm sure many of you here have WAY more. Charm was a huge part of my style of play.  This nerf affects all enchanters not just the uber exploiter enchanters that appearently are running rampant.<br />
<br />
If these nerfs go live I will probably retire my enchanter, and probably retire from eq.  I'm tired of this crap, I can't believe they release the expansions with little to no testing, then a year later totally rework the entire mechanics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">**** you Flargy, I have both an enchanter and a shaman that group most of the time as it is.  I just wanted to say I'm disgusted by you ignorant ****s over here cheering about a massive nerf.  I'll remember this the next time you get brutally beaten with nerfs.<br />
<br />
1) there is never excuse for that kind of language. Your mother would NOT approve.<br />
<br />
2) As I noted before I welcome the nerfs. Not much more they could possibly do to effect us. You'll eventually feel this way after all your major abilities have been systimaticly stripped away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">There's not really all that much hate going on for me.  I empathize with the level 50 and under enchanters; I really do.  Charming is just about the only way for a chanter to get decent solo exp, and nobody groups under 50 anymore, its all twinks and their powerlevelers.  Enchanters under 50 can't charm any mobs that have insane damage output the way PoP mobs do.  I also don't hold it against enchanters whose feeling on this is &quot;yep it was powerful, I used it, I have 5 gazillion aa's, guess it had to end some time&quot;.<br />
<br />
The only real hate I have is for the idiots who got so used to the amazing lack of sony's foresight, that they now feel that exp and loot/pp farming on such a grand scale was their 'right' and are getting some kind of shaft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">I like how all the enchanters are coming here and looking like morons trying to defend themselves  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">True:My class defining skills:<br />
<br />
1. Mezz: still here but toned down alot, no more 10+ trains locked down, no more irresistable mezz, root lands easier for 1/7th the mana and handles the max 2 adds that you can bring without wiping hte party quite nicely.<br />
<br />
2. Stun: our stuns are gone<br />
<br />
3. Charm: charm is being nerfed<br />
<br />
4. Mana Regen: Every class gets mana regen + FT and can BOT KEI thats last 4 hours<br />
<br />
5. Haste: Several classes can haste melee to the haste cap, sure ours is better but the cap is the cap.<br />
<br />
6. Slow: Well since yours was nerfed so hard, I guess that ours was as well, frankly I have not really noticed the difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually the Class defining skills of Enchanters have been systematically stripped from them from Luclin onwards.  We just had a longer way to fall before we hit rock bottom.  Enchanters have been nerfed more than shaman.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Ok I can agree that your stunns and mezzes have been watered down. They should not have been. <br />
<br />
The Kei argument doesnt cut it though. Kei only comes from chanters. They fact that everyone has it from chanter bots is really the chanters fault. Its pure greed. Don't bot kei and this wont happen. And yes, I understand the few can ruin this and it is not practical. Still, it is a problem with the way the class is playing the game.<br />
<br />
Haste: Yes we both hit the haste cap. Thats not the point though. We have to haste ALL the melees 3x more often. Its annoying as hell. If i had a slower haste that lasted 5x as long, I'd use that more often. As a class that casts bufs, I'm sure you can appreciate that argument.<br />
<br />
Slow: Both of us have been nerfed. However we used to be the &quot;best&quot; slowers. the 5% did not really mean that much, but it helped us get groups. In groups, perception is everything. Now others are starting to realize that on mitigating mobs, we slow as well as, say, beastlords. Beastlords do alot more damage than us. Chanters charming and slowing do mroe damage than us. WY pick a class that only slows, when ya can pick one that slows and damage? Granted, playing a chanter thats slowing and charming is kinds dangerous. But the argument holds well with beastlords, and even bards now adays. Hell, a melee with a Willsapper can literally slow as well as me now on some encounters.<br />
<br />
I DO empathize on some level with you about the systamatic stripping of skills. I've been through it. First with a mage through kunark, velous, and luclin. Then with the shammy through luclin and now PoP. Its frustrating as hell, and its purely cause the game designers dont THINK about what they are adding. They are a rush to add things to sell a product instead of slowly rolling out product.<br />
<br />
However please appreciate my viewpoint. As a player hardned by nerfs and playing a class that really is no stronger now than kurnark, its hard to feel bad for a class that even &quot;nerfed&quot; can still dish out so much damage, and still bring so much to a group.<br />
<br />
You havent seen the flipside. I'll be looked over for a chanter in a sec if one is available. You dotn see this cause you arent passed over for a shammy when you try and find a group. Plus you have SOME kind of option for soloing. We have non in PoP... at least none thats any where close to a PoP group.<br />
<br />
Don't misunderstand me.. im not whining trying to get shamans upped, and i never sent a feedback asking for a chanter nerf. Still, I can see how the nerf was indeed needed to bring the game back into balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">I hate to break it to you but slow is the most powerful spell in the game, the mitigation works on a sliding scale so our slow is always worse than your.<br />
<br />
Our Haste makes up for it?  What do you not understand about the haste cap?  Your haste puts a melee at the haste cap, my haste puts a melee at the haste cap.<br />
<br />
Er.,. Buzz. WRONG. Thats what SOE said. Thats NOT how it actually works. Its a hard cap. There are parses here on teh board to prove it. Use the search feature. <br />
<br />
The fact that this is isnt self evident to you (melee procs willsapper and it overwrites your slow, cause the wear off message) just illustrates that you dont group alot, and probably solo a ton.<br />
<br />
(Btw im trying to address each and every point here, since you seem offended that I did not earlier, hence the edit)<br />
<br />
The kei thing. As stated in an above post, the KEI argument doesnt hold. Chanters cast Kei, you are a chanter. The fact that chanters sell Kei in the bazaar which in turn lessens the chance of them getting a group really is a chanter problem. Saying its not is trying to have your cake and eat it to. Either dont sell it for plat and get a group, or harvest plat. I WISH i had that problem with a Shammy buff.<br />
<br />
The hp increase. The 10% is not worth it for int casters. They DONT WANT IT cause it overwrites thier shields. Mages, chanters, and others routinely scream at me for casting it on them. Melees do like it. If 400 hps is 10% on an ageo melee, though, the group is going to wipe.<br />
<br />
The stat buffs dont stack. Its focus, sta, and agi. Thats it. Thats what we bring to the table. The agi really doesnt do much. The focus and sta is nice however for melees and I'll admit that. We also tend NOT to cast it on others (Trials) unless we get in the group. This tends to encourage groupage to get the stats.<br />
<br />
Root. root is a safer form for 1 add. 2 adds unslowed or more somone is gonna die. Your point about mezz is valid. Mezz needs to be fixed. I'll say it again. Mezz needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Now the pet. I'm not cheering it. I AM saying that its called for. You still get a pet that heads and shoulders better than anything else out there, melees included. I'm puzzled how you believe that a 500dps pet with literally NO downside (besides teh ocassional death, which you dont even bother to get rezed) is balanced. Please form an argument for me on how out damaging a balanced 60+ group all by yourself is balanced?<br />
<br />
Nukage: You may be right. I havent played a nuking chanter. I'll conceed this point for lack of experience.<br />
<br />
Debufs. Ours are WAY better. Tash sucks and gets yopu beat down. I can chain Malxx and I'm safe. It cost more, but its a nice spell.<br />
<br />
Heals. please. Out CH takes 10 seconds and heals 2k. Guess what. Tank is already dead. So we cant primary heal. Spot heals we can do. However, spot heals are jsut a niceity to help out the cleric. If the cleric cant keep up with the ch and the occasional spot heal, the group is in trouble. I'm happy to spot heal of course letting the cleric concentrate, but my spot heals dont bring a heck of a lot to the table. A Pally group spot heals better.<br />
<br />
I admit i dont dual box shammy/chanter. I do Mage/shammy though. I do not have the mage charm though. However I think your view is a bit jaded being that you 2box arguably the msot powerful combo in the game. I dont dual box the mage much anymore being that the shammy is my main now. I group alot (cause i ahve to). Perhaps I'm arguing from a group view (You know, that group thats pulling 1 mob for ever 2 you kill dual boxed?) and you are arguing from a solo/dual box view?</div></div><hr />

So you see this nerf affects all enchanters not just the uber exploiter enchanters that appearently are running rampant in gross numbers.&quot;<br />
<br />
This just proves my point. The people that are whining haven't had a chance to exploit it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Lenine (Suddail) is the type to give a bad name to an entire class.  Unfortunately the /ignore feature doesn't work here, but do your best, its not worth the headache.<br />
<br />
As far as being happy about the nerfs, that's really too broad of a statement.  Firstly, I think I speak for everyone when I say I'm *only* happy that PoP level chanters with CoD will no longer be so overpowered.  I don't think they should hit lower level chanters with this, as lower level potential 'pets' aren't overpowering the way PoP mobs are.  Yes charm is a viable way of solo exp pre-PoP, but with the longer kill times (mobs in PoP have much better damage but only somewhat more hp's) and without the insane 100-150% ZEMs, the risk vs. reward pre-PoP is balanced.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you will still be able to charm for exp, just not as much exp.  You will still be able to exp and aa MUCH faster than a class like shamans, who have to group in PoP to get any exp.  You will suffer no damage to your ability to farm items worth 5 and 6 digits of platinum.  The potential changes on test server do nothing to fix the out-of-whack state of the game as it currently stands.  You call it a nerf, but I call it a fix, and not a good enough fix at that.  You still, as a class, are both more wanted in groups, and can effectively solo better than just about any other class.  The potential changes will lower this solo ability's rewards somewhat, but it will remain, and will continue to be better exp than grouping.  (Remember, grouping is what we shamans, among other classes, must do for exp.)<br />
Still, it {KEI} is a problem with the way the class is playing the game<br />
You really can't blame a class for the actions of a few.  It would be like people thinking all shamans suck because they met Lenine.  KEI lasts WAY too long, I've felt this way from day 1, and waited and waited for a duration nerf that never happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't come here for your symapthy just wondering why shamans get wood on news of enchanter nerfs.  <br />
<br />
So you are saying I need to be an exploiter to have an opinion?  I have the command of druzzil spell in my spellbook and use it regularly so doesn't that entitle me to an opinion?  How is using the spell exploiting?  So you say if I got an aa from charming crystal golems in PoV that I am expoilting then?  Or is it that anyone that casts the level 64 enchanter spell CoD is an expoilter?  How can you call casting a spell that we rarely receive from a spectral parchment turn in an exploit.<br />
<br />
So wait no, you are saying that because I 'haven't had a chance to exploit it yet' that there should be a blanket nerf that affects all enchanters of all levels so that those who are expoiting will stop?   All they have done is made my favorite line of spells essentially useless. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what your point is.  If it was just to put me down for having only 12 aa points and being only level 64, then I guess you made your point, feel better now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">My point is, the only reason you are trying to justify charm in it's current form is because you haven't had a real chance to exploit it. Simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">What I think is if you have had CoD and used it, so be it.  If you've used it to farm named I glower at you dubiously.  If you've used it to get massive aa's, I regard you indifferently  If you're whining that this ability, which we all know is overpowered, is being taken away, go fcuk yourself.<br />
<br />
You're also generalizing broadly.  There are some posters here who've said that the nerf is a bad idea, and they are shamans.  Yet you ignore that and say<br />
No just trying to understand why you guys are so happy about our nerfs<br />
and<br />
just wondering why shamans get wood on news of enchanter nerfs<br />
<br />
And IMNSHO this is a fix, and not a strong enough one.  Not a nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Athenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Tappion I'm not trying to justify anything, although I do think the nerf is overkill because it doesn't fix the problems they are trying to address but rather make my favorite spell line useless.  Just because I haven't 'exploited' with charm doesn't mean it doesnt affect me, it affects me in a BIG way.  The changes on test hurt all enchanters from level 16 to level 65, not just exploiting uber enchanters.<br />
<br />
I know exactly how CoD has been used in the past in a few upper tier zones to exploit certain content.  I am not here 'trying to justify charm in its current form', I am OK with them making adjustments to CoD or related content in order to address exploits.  I personally don't like the way they have gone about it.  I don't really want to discuss that here anyway with so many people who have a blind unfounded hatred for enchanters.  I'll save it for my own boards.  It just really hit a nerve seeing many of you celebrating the demise of the class I love.<br />

And lastly Schpleef, you are right I didn't mean to generalize.  To all the shamans out there who think objectively and didn't jump on the 'Hooray enchanters got nerfed' bandwagon my apologies.</div></div><hr />

Cry me a river. I never called you a noob. You just happen to be someone who is mad because they haven't had a chance to use an overpowered ability. Funny thing is, I have and can use a druid to power my shaman through use of charm in PoP, but ya know what, I don't anymore. I have integrity.<br />
<br />
Charm was never ever a defining point of the enchanter class unless it was during a time when it was overpowered. Sure people used it to kill a few drolvargs outside DL when waiting for a group, but not to the extent it is used now.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh and I'm sure the next thing will be &quot;You probably have tons of AA's and are level 65 so you don't need to power with the druid anymore&quot;. No, my shaman is level 55, and has 4 AA's.</div></div><hr />

First, I group with a regular group of friends and I duo a shaman and and enchanter.  I belong to the toughest guild on my server.  The warrior I group with has a willsapper but has not taken it from the bank in probably over 1 year real time ... I manage slow and I have 2 classes that do it so it generally gets done :)  I'll take your word on the slow issue, I do wander by and read this board but not all that often :)  Although I disagree that it is the most powerful duo option, it is one of the most challenging which is why I did it.  My alt was the first alt keyed for VT and at sometimes I was the only enchanter and the only shaman at VT raids ... quite fun.<br />
<br />
I do solo I suppose here and there when I am bored and my friends are not on but generally that soloing involves a shaman and a cleric loaded on 2 other computers :)<br />
<br />
My charming is almost always in group with my duo boxed shaman there to trade debuff/slow and to keep me alive with heals, I have been charming in group with my RL friends group since pretty much when Kunark was released.<br />
<br />
On the KEI issue, I agree but unfortunately I do not have control over everyone and quite frankly it does not affect me, I play both shaman and enchanter in a group of friends ... I never have grouping issues but I can feel for those that do.<br />
<br />
The bazaar KEI bot is here to stay and is a fixture and is used as such.  People can get KEI whenever they want as easily as going for a supply run, pick up 20 food, 20 water and a KEI.  You can deny it as much as you want and you can blame it on enchanters but if focus lasted 4 hours tell my there would not be focus BoTs.<br />
<br />
Personally I never sell KEI but I will give it out to whomever asks so I suppose I am part of the problem.<br />
<br />
As for shaman buffs, we do some extreme things and the additional shaman buffs help me and everyone in the party except our cleric who uses his mana buff.  <br />
<br />
Focus of the Seventh: 544 hp <br />
<br />
My warrior fully buffed has just over 8500 hp and stamina makes a difference to him so that adds around 700hp in shaman buffs all told.   So just a little over 400hp in buffs.  Then you consider that monks and hybrids have less HP and casters have far fewer.  10% is not a bad estimate :)<br />
<br />
The buffs I cast with my shaman:<br />
<br />
Focus<br />
Stamina<br />
Group Regen<br />
Group Acumen<br />
Talisman of Erupidation<br />
Primal Essense<br />

Well shaman heals are interesting, I never have the shaman Complete Heal loaded.  I have Quiescence and Tnarg loaded.  Everytime the issue of healing comes up CH is always tossed out for comparision .. well quite frankly CH is a crappy heal spell.  Why?  Because you can only use complete heal if you can predict the damage and if you can predict the damage you are not in an emergancy.  If you are not in an emergancy then there is nothing to worry about :)  Once you get into the unpredictable emergancy healing spells, shaman can heal just as well if not better than clerics can.<br />
<br />
Shamans can heal themselves which prevents a cleric from having to blow a CH and heal them, shamans can heal others which prevents a Cleric from blowing a CH to heal others.  You take it for granted because you have it and it is not as powerful as as CH but let me tell you a shaman can pound out healing.  You combine a Quiescence with shaman armor, shaman defense and Tnarg and a shaman can hold a mob that a warrior would normally tank.<br />
<br />
I remember tanking wyrms in HoT back when the level cap was 60 and we were doing 5 person armor runs ... until you wear a dress and try to do CC you do not appreciate the shear tanking abilty of a class with armor, hp and healing ability ... you can debuff and live I cannot.<br />
<br />
As for charm, it is quite powerful and I am not disagreeing that it needs to be corrected.  The thing is most people seem to believe that is suddenly sprang into being in POP and it did not.  Most people seem to believe that enchanter have 500+ AA with a bank full of ornate ... most of us do not.<br />
<br />
Charm was just as powerful in previous expansions, I could outdamage entire groups as easily then as I can now.  The difference is that this expansion facilitates it to a much higher degree.  The layout, the ability to pull solo mobs ... in previous expansions it was difficult to find a place to charm solo because you always had to worry about adds and chain aggro and zone out proximity ... POP is much easier.  Then to make things even worse they toss zone outs in the middle of zones, do you think enchanters would charm solo the pit if there was no zone out there? <br />
<br />
All in all it was poorly designed to accomodate charm and unfortunately charm was the only useful thing we received with POP.  So it leaves us in a pickle, our stuns are useless and have been since Kunark, our root is better than mezz at CC and our charms which we invested in abilities to drive are being nerfed again and again and of course VI is not known to stop before the target nerf item becomes useless.  So of course we are upset.  Without charm, trust me shamans are more welcome in a group than we are and we are supposed to be the definition of the ultimate grouping class.<br />
<br />
Either we need to be restored as a good grouping class or we need to keep a charm that works to some degree.<br />
<br />
Then to come here and see a bunch of people dancing in joy blowing the issue out of proportion with comments like 500+ AA and banks full of ornate upsets me.  It is however human nature to relish in the pain of others I suppose I just expected better here.<br />

<br />
Charm is wrong, it involves no risk. Please don't tell me it does, I have access to an enchanter and charm solo in high levels zones sometimes when I am bored. This is with no experience playing a chanter, its not that hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
What charm SHOULD be-<br />
<br />
<br />
When a mob is charmed, it should do approximately mage or necro pet DPS plus 50% due to the fact it can break. But oh you say, mages and necro's get other things that are better to use for damage than enchanter's. Well, they don't get all mob type mez, stun, memblur, rune, crack or other 1337 stuff like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Athenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">&quot;It just really hit a nerve seeing many of you celebrating the demise of the class I love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cry me a river. I never called you a noob. You just happen to be someone who is mad because they haven't had a chance to use an overpowered ability. Funny thing is, I have and can use a druid to power my shaman through use of charm in PoP, but ya know what, I don't anymore. I have integrity.<br />
<br />
Charm was never ever a defining point of the enchanter class unless it was during a time when it was overpowered. Sure people used it to kill a few drolvargs outside DL when waiting for a group, but not to the extent it is used now.<br />
<br />
Speak for yourself Tappion, do you even have an enchanter?  So I don't have integrity now because charm always has been an important part of my spellbook?  Its funny, some enchanters love using charm, some hate it.  I used to charm bloodtribes in scarlet desert all day long with cajoling whispers and had a blast doing it.  I also died many many many times along the way.  You don't know me or how I play my character.  I have been using charm before it ever was considered being remotely overpowered.  Its was always for me much more than simply a tool to killing drolvargs outside of DL (I hate DL).<br />
<br />
To say that I am mad because I never had a chance to use an overpowered ability is absurd.  I have been 64 (almost 65 now) for a while and have been charming in PoP since the day it came out.   I never considered it exploiting like many of you do because I died a lot and exp gains were modest.  <br />
<br />
I also respectfully disagree that charm was never ever a definining aspect of the enchanter class, it has been and always will be for me.  Enchanters have always been geared towards charming.  We have the widest range of pets to choose from (pretty much anything level permitting), innately high charisma, aa skills, and the most charm spells of any class in the game.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh and I'm sure the next thing will be &quot;You probably have tons of AA's and are level 65 so you don't need to power with the druid anymore&quot;. No, my shaman is level 55, and has 4 AA's.<br />
<br />
Not really man, I'm not here to put you down.  Like I said I am part shaman too.  I just think those who blindly rejoice over the nerfing of another class need to think carefully before they speak.</div></div><hr />

The nerf really isn't all that bad, enchanters on test are reporting roughly 3% a kill charm-soloing, as opposed to the pre-nerf 6-7%.  Takes 6 mobs in a PoV group to get me 3%, and without a chanter's pet's DPS, those 6 mobs take longer to kill.  The nerf doesn't affect enchanters farming named what-so-ever.  Its not an exploit, but we all know it was vastly overpowering.  I have nothing against enchanters who used it; I sure would have.  But don't whine about it, just realize that it was too good to be true and still will be pretty damn nice after the 'nerf'.</div></div><hr />

I'll explain this with the aid of a story. Once, I was in FG trying to get my shard. If you go into the corner of the royal room, nothing can hit you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some ****nut wanted my camp so he petitoined me and i got warned. I asked the GM's for a reason in e-mail and I got something along the lines of using exploits to my own benefits. I argued that there was no indication that I was not allowed but he said something about policies on eqlive .com.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm too lazy/tired to look them up, but they basically say you cannot do anything which is cheating the game, and they are trusting you not to. What do you think charming is? You are cheating the game. Charming a mob who hits for 600's is not risky if you know your sh1t about being an enchanter, it just means more xp for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is exploiting-- cheating the game of what you know should not be done.<br />
<br />

Sure, if I was an enc you can be sure as **** I would have ph4rm3d the **** out of BOT but I wouldn't have been surprised when nerfed  :)<br />

LOLOL /em points to the thread created here at the crucible after the affliction focus changes.  I had never witnessed the cumulation of so much whining in my life.  Isn't that the pot calling the kettle black?<br />
- Hey moron, pull your head out of your arse. Without CoD and that necro charm the DPS classes should put out goes like this:<br />
Melee: Rogue - Ranger - Monk - Beastlord - Warrior - Knights - Bard<br />
Priests: Shaman - Druid - Cleric<br />
Casters: Wizard - Mage - Necro - Enchanter<br />
<br />
The current broken DPS output by classes puts rangers WAY ahead of rogues, shamans way behind druids because of DoT issues AND Necros/Enchanters way ahead of every other caster. That is BAD for GAME BALANCE. I know it's a concept hard to understand, game balance.<br />
<br />
Enchanters WERE NEVER meant to do 500+ DPS constantly. Can you get this into your rotten brain? I doubt it. And that Affliction Focus bugfix thread, many shamans clearly pointed out how enchanters got screwed bad also. Now who's calling the kettle black? Dumbass.<br />
<br />
I'm just pissed that you shamans as a community are here celebrating the biggest enchanter nerf ever. <br />
- You have a very weird definition of &quot;nerf&quot;. For you a nerf, is for 10+ other classes a game balancing change that will make the game more balanced. I am sorry but a 700+ DPS pet is not game balance in my book when an elemental geared rogue/monk barely does 190ish DPS.<br />
<br />
I thought you shamans were our friends and yet you stab us in the back.<br />
- Bullpoop. Go read the affliction thread.<br />
<br />
Our two classes have so much in common I find it hard to believe you could be so happy about such a harsh nerf a class defining skill.<br />
- How would you like for shamans to get a nuke that costs 150 mana and deals 5k damage? Neg 50 resists too. One second cast time also.<br />
<br />
Beleive me when I say the combination of all these nerfs really does hurt our class. <br />
- Let's see:<br />
(1) Mez unchanged.<br />
(2) Clarity line unchanged.<br />
(3) Slow line unchanged.<br />
(4) Nukes, DoTs unchanged.<br />
(5) Other debuffs unchanged.<br />
(6) Charm is still ultra powerful (hello RZ encounter!)<br />
<br />
Yah, poor enchanter. Indeed. Head to the Grand Canyon, go cry me a river. Actually fill that up more.<br />
<br />
You guys have very little to be jealous of so I don't see where all the hate is coming from. <br />
- Lay off the crackpipe. There is NO hate. It's called game balance. Simple concept really.<br />
<br />
I don't have 500,0000pp I farmed with charm.  I am level 64 with 12 AA points so far which I'm sure many of you here have WAY more. <br />
- AHHHHHHHH! There is the reason of your refusal to understand the basic concept of game balance. You only got 12 AA and have barely a week or so until it's going to be nerfed. Well .. chop chop! Instead of writing this garbage about how bad this affects enchanters, you should have stopped being a hypocrit liar and told us straight: I didn't have time to get my AA and now the single most broken PooP spell is going to get nerfed.<br />
<br />
So you see this nerf affects all enchanters not just the uber exploiter enchanters  that appearently are running rampant in gross numbers.<br />
- Wrong. It doesn't affect the &quot;uber&quot; enchanters at all. They already have a huge piece of the broken CoD pie (aka crapload of AA).<br />
<br />
If these nerfs go live I will probably retire my enchanter, and probably retire from eq.  I'm tired of this crap, I can't believe they release the expansions with little to no testing, then a year later totally rework the entire mechanics.<br />
- I got an easier solution for you: blame it on shamans!<br />

I find this line strange.  A few months back I was messing around with my chanter and a druid friend.  We found that if the druid snared a mob, then I charmed it, we could get massive exp for absolutely no risk.  There's no doubt in my mind that charm needed adjusting: so why are you going to retire NOW?  Yes it appears that PoP was released with little or no effective testing - but shouldn't you have retired some time ago when you found out that chanters had it given them on a plate.  Why retire only when some attempt at a correction to the original error is made?</div></div><hr />

Regards,<br />
<br />
Heals: Q For heal is supposed to be godly. Unfortunately, I dont have it yet. Sigh. Pre Q the healing options arent as good for shaman. In Pop its Torpor or Tnargs. Torpor is the best choice for personal healinga dn casters, tanks seem to get pissed off.<br />
<br />
This always bothers me. Why the hell do they get so pissed off? So they drop dps in 1/2 or 1/4th for 4-5 ticks. So what. In a group its not gonna matter much anyways. Not only that, I'm only using it when I'm in trouble and need to conserve mana. They still scream for a CH or tnargs. Its better to have a group fully under torpor and outlasting a mob, than getting beat to death, but dealing out hasted damage. They dont get that :P<br />
<br />
Our Healing is still lackluster. An argument can be made that even Q for melee healing isnt all that &quot;great&quot; yea, its super cheap, but it cant heal the damage fast enough. Although you can cast torpor than hit tnarg once or twice, but tnargs sucks SOOO much mana. We do ok as spot/backup healers, but will never be the main healer. I guess thats jsut our lot and I dont worry that much about it.<br />
<br />
Chanters: Its my belief that chanters need to be restored as a good grouping class. Beef up the mezzes and stuns. Tone down teh charms. Mages are supposed to be the king of pets/damage. Thats all they freakn get. They get no armor/root/escpe. no CC, nada. They are supposed to get mean as pets in return (and they do). However its kind of disheartening to see the mage in group getting owned by the chanter that can do so much more.<br />
<br />
This of course goes along with the vision that EQ is a grouping game. If thats NOT the case than a viable form of soloing needs to be added to each and every class. Warriors need to be able to solo, ect.<br />
<br />
Dancing: I'm not dancing, nor did I ever say chanters as a whole have 500+ aa's and a bank full of ornate. I DID say however that chanters can farm ornate with little risk. Ok some risk, but the reward is huge. I'd easily take it if i could. I also stated that it was unfair for a class to be so strong in a group and in solo.</div></div><hr />

1) I completely agree. SOE needs to fix CoD. Thats it. the 1% slow on it easily fixes it. Like usual SOE has thier heads up thier asses. I know they are gonna totally mangle this fix.<br />
<br />
2) Having lived thorugh multuiple nerfs is EXACTLY why we dont care. We have been nerfed, overlooked, nerfed, then overlooked again. Not one other class cared. Let me repeat that. NOT ONE OTHER CLASS CARED. Foci went away. No one said anuything. Our PoP CH went away. No one said anything. Our Dots are broken. No one says anythibng. Torpor/Malo are the msot expensive/hardest spells to get in the game<br />

&lt;&lt;&lt; Feels betrayed as a player yet again  <br />
<br />
/agree with what everyone has said. I find it absolutely ridiculous that after having items with these effects in the game for nearly an ENTIRE YEAR, they decide they are going to change it. I mean come on! Either they work for our spells or not! Why the farting around for a year before deciding to change it!? The best item I have on my otherwise very non-uber enchanter, the Untel Dak claw, is now fecking worthless, thanks a lot. <br />
<br />
Sorry I am in a small guild and I don't have access to all the other spiffy spell haste and mana preservation items out there many of you mentioned. Not really much of an option for me. Looks like yet again the uber just got more uber and the non-uber well....now suck worse.<br />

<br />
How exactly did the charm line get wrecked? Essentially only two things were changed: EXP, and Agro. Resist is a non-issue, god forbid you'd have to tish first.<br />
<br />
Charm exp got nerfed, while it sucks for the charmers and us moochers (good while it lasted, anyone who didn't see this fix coming needs help), it resolves one huge issue everyone had with charms. 3% AA a kill with no downtime and minimal effort isn't horrible--it just means a solo charmer can only get 1 AA per hour, the horror.<br />
<br />
Agro should not be an issue if you remembered what class you are playing. Granted, it'll be harder to deal with while soloing, but things are virtually unchanged in a raid environment.<br />
<br />
Does anyone actually have something remotely resembling a legitimate complaint, other than this one person ranting and raving about never having a chance to abuse CoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">How exactly did the charm line get wrecked? <br />
Unless I'm mistaken (fingers crossed), it's not just going to apply to the PoP charm spells, but the entire charm line for ALL classes that can charm at ALL levels.  You never heard this kind of complaining about charm, an ability that's been in game forever, until PoP came out and people were able to charm huge dps pets and take down nameds that would normally take entire groups to kill.  PoP broke charm, not the other way around, so charm in PoP needs to be nerfed, not the entire pre-PoP charm line.<br />
<br />
2) Having lived thorugh multuiple nerfs is EXACTLY why we dont care. We have been nerfed, overlooked, nerfed, then overlooked again. Not one other class cared. Let me repeat that. NOT ONE OTHER CLASS CARED. Foci went away. No one said anuything. Our PoP CH went away. No one said anything. Our Dots are broken. No one says anythibng. Torpor/Malo are the msot expensive/hardest spells to get in the game <br />
Trust me, I totally understand- I will prolly never see torpor, malo, primal essence, pox, etc... despite the worthless new spell research.  And my affliction foci are in the same boat as my monk: junk.  Still, despite my utter cynicim and contempt for SOE's &quot;balancing&quot;, I find it hard to gloat at another's misfortune. /shrug  Just my 2 pp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">Charm in pop was and still is until the next patch rediculously broken.<br />
<br />
No class should be able to do the kinda of damage that an enchanter was and unfortunately still will be able to do with a charmed pet. They won't be able to ride it for the mass exp anymore but they still will be able to get the rediculous dps that the pets where putting out when the exp doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
I've seen way to many examples of why this needs to be fixed first hand to have any sympathy for anyone complaining about this. Everyone who's playing the game has pretty much been waiting for this to happen and knew it was coming.<br />
<br />
Personally I watch our guilds main tank park his warrior in a corner afk grouped with his enchanter twink while his enchanter charmed soloed because it was the fastest way to get his warrior exp.<br />
<br />
Or one of our enchanters who had half the aa I did when pop came out and now has more than double the aa i have and still plays less than I do.<br />
<br />
Or the previously mentioned lvl 65 frog with 100 aa or so now since LoY came out.<br />
<br />
Charm soloing was getting exp way to fast. No question about it.<br />
<br />
As far as the nurfs goes the resist change is specifically targeted at the the lvl 64/65 and is a change to the spell it's self.<br />
The exp and aggro changes shouldn't effect lower level charmsas much in groups since charmed mobs then don't outdamage everyone else by nearly as much. It will still probably hurt low lvl charm soloing tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">The insanely long winded/arrogant chanter board has spilled over into my safe haven.  NOOOOOOO!!!!!<br />
<br />
Heh, seriously, the nerf was coming and everyone knew it (chanters included.)  The situation was ridiculously overpowered and exploited.  Am I happy for the nerf?  Not really, it's a little extreme, but I can't say it was uncalled for.<br />
<br />
A lot of chanters now claim to have been solo charmers all along, but it's BS.  Basically with PoP enchanters lost a lot of their value.  The mez's became far to mana intensive to be worth it, the AE mez got removed (other then point blank short duration,) the buffs started lasting long enough that groups would opt to pay for KEI instead of wasting a slot on a chanter and their DD's/animations have always been a joke.  BST, BRD or SHM made more sense for groups.  Add in the arcane rune (1500hp self only regentless rune) and the obvious choice became charm solo'ing.  Then a lot of them added in other runes and uproar to give them a 2775 hp cushion to play with.  After a while of farming AA's they could then invest in the PoP freebie rune, that's also up to 1500 hp.  It's just stupid.<br />
<br />
So now, this makes sense to me.  Chanters CAN solo, but they're better off in a group, as it always was.<br />
<br />
And that's all I have to say about that :)<br />
<br />
Good luck chanters, really, now go home ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">I am sorry but this nerf if anything is still way to light.  The only reason I can think is that they tuned the boss encounters in pop to need chanter pets to do the awsome additional damage.  Each charmed pet counts for 1-2 groups of pure dps.  That is how insanly overpowered charm is.  I really hope they add a lot more uncharmable mobs as well and make pets eat 75% of the exp if done under less then 25% of damage and none if group does 25%.  That would get charm back into group situations.<br />
<br />
The sad fact is that they can still go and solo most named they just dont get much exp for it ... boo hoo ... come on ... this still needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
And btw chanters can nuke better then we can.  They have to alternate 2 nukes but their pure nuking dps is better unless we get lucky with rains.</div></div><hr />

Shaman have been nerfed often enough that we should know better than to gloat over another classes' misfortune.  Although we don't know the full effects of the changes yet, I will not be surprised to see that they effect the lower level enchanters much more than it effects the ones they are aimed at.  <br />
<br />
If groups feel that a charmed mob will add much more risk to a group and take experience from the group, they will either refuse to let the enchanter use charmed mobs or they will not invite the enchanter in the first place.  You all know that perception means more than reality in EQ. <br />
<br />
Over the last months, many enchanter skills have been eroded so that charm was their last truly useful skill.  Because some upper-end enchanters found an exploit, all enchanters will be hurt.  This is not something to cheer about.<br />

I personally see the exp, the raid, and the loot thing as killing the games integrity. It's one thing to forgo having a warrior for a mage pet to tank, it's a whole other issue to forgo a warrior for a chanter or druid or mages charmed pet.<br />
<br />
As indicated by myself and some others, charm is not an issue pre-pop, and even with the nerfs indicated will still only hurt soloing charmers (and even that is debateable as mem blurring mobs that hit for 100 instead of 400 500 and 600 is alot different).<br />
<br />
It's not the AA's themselves that are the problem. It's the fact that as I've quoted people used an obviously over powered ability to get them. It's like using a pathing exploit to me.</div></div><hr />

This crap about being able to single pull cause its outdoors and people never get adds is so dumb. There are still times where people pull 2 and more mobs by accident, and with the huge dps having a real crowd control class can keep groups together (pick up groups don't normally stick together after a wipe).<br />
<br />
This is even evident in planes like PoN. If we get multiples and I'm the form of crowd control, get a resist on the first slow, we are normally screwed the cleric will have to heal me fast, grab agro, and we still have two unslowed mob.<br />
<br />
Crowd control is not nearly as dead as people want to make it out to be. I personally find it more necessary then any previous expansion. Seb even though a dungeon was never as able to wipe a group like PoP zones/mobs.</div></div><hr />

Pon is a rediculously easy zone and easily doable anywhere without an enchanter. I dont know your level but lets say your just doing yard trash and aonly level 55 or so you should easily be able to root park minimum 3 mobs, at the least. A good shaman could hit at least 4-5 mobs though with a good bit of danger. <br />
<br />
Crowd control isn't needed as long as your playing with people who have some marginal skill. The only reason  I ever want an enchanter in my groups now a days is so I don't have to cast my haste spell which is just a pain in the ass to me. <br />
<br />
Heck probably one of the hardest spots in tier 1 may be a consorts group and even then you don't need a enchanter if your puller is good though it is preferably to bring a monk puller. <br />
<br />
I think enchanters needed to be nerfed but I'd like to see the nerf to exp be taken away at least if the enchanter is grouping. <br />
<br />
As most enchanters stated it's justm uch easier to root park mobs (even as a ench) since the mezze's have become water downed. <br />
<br />
Fix mez/stun or take away the pet taking exp while in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">I copied Enchanter Charm nerf thread on the enchanter boards ... this is what I posted there and what I will post here.  Perhaps, for those people that are open minded this will give you a clearer understanding of the issues with Charm and POP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, charm has always been borderline overpowering but there was a pretty hefty risk associated with the reward. <br />
<br />
I was out damaging entire groups with my dual wielding, hasted: <br />
<br />
Original: <br />
1. Ratman warrior in the hole baby, favorite pet of all time <br />
<br />
Kunark: <br />
1. Froggie warrior in Seb <br />
2. Morti Golem in Howling Stones &lt;=== very buff, outdamaged 2 groups <br />
3. Sarnak warriors in Chardok <br />
<br />
Velious <br />
1. Kobold Champion in VL <br />
2. Giants in Kael arena &lt;== This one in particular actually did more damage than some arena raid groups <br />
<br />
Luclin <br />
- I did all my exp in this time in the Hole and Cazic Thule so I did not play around with charming Luclin mobs all that much. However enchanters were making massive solo xp in places like the grey and were soloing mini bosses in Maidens Eye for plat loot. <br />
<br />
Then POP came along, unlike other expansions POP was geared for single mob pulls, you have to inept to pull more than 2 at a time. With no requirement to mezz or handle wanderers, suddenly Charming is a whole lot more viable and lots of enchanters start doing it. <br />
<br />
With the addition of Arcane Rune, a -50MR charm and Word of Morell ... charming becomes even easier both for soloing and grouping. <br />
<br />
With zones that you have absolute safe pull spots, mobs with very low aggro range, no chain aggro issues, easy to pull singles suddenly charm soloing becomes easier. Add graveyards for easy corpse retrieval and pretty much no dungeon crawling to get to the equipment dropping mobs and you start to have issues. <br />
<br />
Charm is no more powerful than it has ever been. I have ALWAYS been able to outdamage entire groups and in some rare situations more than one group with my charmed, dual wielding pets ... ALWAYS before POP and now. <br />
<br />
Does that suddenly make charm OK? No, in this expansion it is far far too easy to use for a variety of reasons. <br />
<br />
However, do not think for a second that this is a POP only issue ... it has always been the case but because of additional tools and a different zone layout &quot;vision&quot; charm has become much more trivial in POP than it was in other expansions. <br />
<br />
I mean you put a zone out in the pit in tactics *** do you expect? You allow a solo invis enchanter to walk to a boss mob and he solo's it with charm ... imagine that? <br />
<br />
I can remember soloing the frenzy room in LGuk with charm, I can remember soloing the Froglok king, I can remember soloing the Lord himself and they were the mini bosses of the time. But back then, you screwed up and you died ... there were massive chain aggro effects on boss mobs, there were no graveyards, if charm broke you did not jog to the zone ... you died, then you went back and died 10 more times getting your corpse  <br />
<br />
Charming POP content is trivial in comparision ... actually the single most damning point proving this is the simple fact every enchanter is now charming in groups and solo. If it is still as hard as it was then what, did everyone just wake up one day simulanously with leet skills and take up charming? <br />
<br />
If it is just as hard as it used to be then why the heck were enchanters all not charming through the last 3 expansions like I was? <br />
<br />
Unfortunately charm is all we have left ... our entire expansion skills/line were based around charm. Mezz is not needed in this expansion barring a few places, our stuns are long dead and forgotten, KEI lasts 4 hours and you pick it up when you go for supplies in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
We have no crowds to control which was the purpose of our class, all we have left in our mighty arsenal that sets us apart is charm. If they nerf it too much then we have nothing. We become shamans without the heals, armor and massive mana regen. <br />
<br />
I mean for christ sakes, Greater Fetter has a -30MR ... it is easier to land than mezz, works on more mobs, costs less mana and lasts longer on average. I do CC with root now, just like a shaman. <br />
<br />
Root CC is great for pulls of 3 or less, in Tier 2+ you pull back more than 3 mobs and you can kiss your group goodbye. <br />
<br />
I duo an enchanter/shaman pair in groups and raids, I generally charm in groups over solo but I can and have soloed when my friends were not available to group with. <br />
<br />
These days I find myself spending more and more time on my Shaman and less and less on my Enchanter. My Enchanter is getting closer and closer to a buff bot. Without a viable charm I would probably switch my Enchanter to my off machine in all honesty. <br />
<br />
<br />

CH is overpowered, so I guess every cleric ever is a cheater too. Slow is overpowered (that's why mitigation is here right?).  The old modrods were overpowered, guess we're all cheaters aren't we?  And OMG, every monk for 4 years was an exploiter cause they were overpowered too!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Until it gets changed it's perfectly legit.  I think most of the whining on this thread is you people aren't good enough friends with any chanters to have them group with you and use charm to everyone's advantage, instead they wanna solo their last few points to max innate DR!<br />
