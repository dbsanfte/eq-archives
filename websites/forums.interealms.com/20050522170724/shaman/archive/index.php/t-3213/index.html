<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">They're rather funny, really.  The majority of high end guilds already know all this stuff.  Some of it is just ludicrous, like cheal chains for all the mobs.  Some just don't warrant it.  Has a couple of useful tidbits in it, though.  Take it all with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Setting Rampage: <br />
<br />
Every mob in EQ has an Aggro list, pretty much like a ranger or druid track list. On top of it is the one with highest aggro, the one the mob will pick and attack. <br />
<br />
A mob that rampages has another List, which we can call 'Rampage List'. It is basically a Copy of the Aggro list, when the mob does his first Rampage. <br />
<br />
AGGRO LIST: <br />
<br />
- Tank1 <br />
- Tank2 <br />
<br />
RAMPAGE LIST: <br />
<br />
- <br />
- <br />
(no one is on it because the mob didn't rampage a single time yet) <br />
<br />
Then we will send Tank1 and Tank2 in melee, and right at the moment the mob will rampage for the first time, the rampage list will be created. <br />
It should look like this if everyone pays attention and doesn't enter the aggro list (Bard AE song, random group buffs on Tank1 / Tank2, etc) <br />
<br />
AGGRO LIST: <br />
<br />
- Tank1 <br />
- Tank2 <br />
<br />
Rampage List: <br />
<br />
- Storaz <br />
- Teradok <br />
<br />
Once this is done, whatever you will do after, the two persons on top of rampage list will be Storaz and Teradok, untill the mob is blured again, or wipe the raid completely. <br />
<br />
Of course, as soon as we start fithing, more people will enter the mob aggro list (cleric first mostly when the first CH land), chanter Tashing, paladin curing or using lay hands. <br />
<br />
A common aggro list will look like this after 10 seconds of fight: <br />
<br />
AGGRO LIST: <br />
<br />
- Warrior <br />
- Cleric <br />
- Cleric <br />
- Cleric <br />
- Paladin / druid / shaman (backup heals at the start) <br />
- Other melees <br />
<br />
Each time the mob rampages again, he will add these new persons entering the aggro list, to his rampage list. <br />
<br />
In our exemple, versus Arch Lich, it would typically look like this: <br />
<br />
AGGRO LIST after <br />
10 seconds of fight <br />
with arch lich: <br />
<br />
- *Tank1* <br />
- Cleric1 <br />
- Cleric2 <br />
- Curse Remover1 <br />
- Curse Remover2 <br />
- Curse Remover3 <br />
- *Tank2* <br />
- Other melees <br />
who joined the <br />
fight and pressed <br />
auto-attack <br />
<br />
Rampage list: <br />
<br />
- *Tank1* <br />
- *Tank2* <br />
- Cleric1 <br />
- Cleric2 <br />
- Curse Remover1 <br />
- Curse Remover2 <br />
- Curse Remover3 <br />
- Other melees <br />
<br />
Contrary to the Aggro list, the order in rampage list is NOT modifiable, even if you zone, camp out, die, when you will come back in melee range and attack, you will be back at your spot in the rampage list, and be rampaged again if it's your turn. <br />
<br />
Rampage list is 2 Targets at the same time, getting a round of Attack each time the mob rampages. This means only the MT + 1 Warrior will be rampaged whole fight if we do well. And this is much better than before, cause we were thinking rampage was MT + 2 warriors , and it was monopolizing all clerics. Now it will only take 2 clerics to heal rampage actually. <br />
<br />
<br />
- FAQ: <br />
Q: What happens if Tank2 dies, or gets out of melee range? <br />
A: The mob will pick the next person on his rampage list (Cleric1 in this exemple) <br />
<br />
Q: I am on rampage but not supposed to be, what do I do? <br />
A: Run out of the mob's melee range <br />
<br />
Q: But I am a cleric and I will be out of range for CH if I do that. <br />
A: Run out of range anyway and ask someone to replace you asap. You will die if you don't run out of range. You will still be able to do long range heals, heal other people running to camp for a heal, etc <br />
<br />
Q: Would it be possible to send in 3 or 4 warriors for the first rampage proc so a cleric isnt rampaged if one warr dies ? <br />
A: Yes certainly, let's say you want Tank1, Tank2, Tank3, Tank4, Tank5 on rampage list, in this order. All you have to do is have them all shoot arrows before the first rampage. Make Tank1 shoot 100 arrows, Tank2 50, Tank3 25 , Tank4 10, Tank5 1 arrow. And you will have an aggro list in this order once the first rampage happens, and the rampage list will be the same order. <br />
<br />
Q: Or would that make the mob rampage more than just 2 ppl ? <br />
A: No, it would still be Two targets max. <br />
<br />
Will add more to the FAQ if anyone has more questions. <br />
Hope it helps, that way we will be quicker at setting rampage if everyone is careful with aggro. <br />

CH-lines <br />
CH Line basics: <br />
Type 1: <br />
a bunch of 6 or 8 Clerics, 3(4)main, 3(4)backup <br />
all 6 or 8 Clerics heal down the MT line: MT1, MT2, MT3 etc. <br />
(i.e. Cleric1(Cleric4), Cleric2(Cleric5), Cleric3(Cleric6)) <br />
<br />
Type 2: <br />
a bunch of 6 or 8 Clerics, 3(4)main, 3(4)main <br />
each 3(4) Clerics heal 1 MT. <br />
(i.e. Cleric1, Cleric2, Cleric3 - grouped with MT1 and MT2 <br />
Cleric4, Cleric5, Cleric6 - grouped with MT2 and MT4) <br />
<br />
Type 3: <br />
all Clerics involved except 1/ 2 backups <br />
~7 Clerics form one big CH line and heal down the MT list. <br />
<br />
Make hotkeys like this for pause. <br />
<br />
Hotkey Name - CH-Line <br />
Line1- ## CH INC to - %t ## <br />
Line2- /cast 1 (or whatever your CH spell is) <br />
Line3- /pause ## (use pause for MOB and status below) <br />
Line4- ## NEXT CLERIC - Cleric2 ## <br />
<br />
Cast your hotkey when NEXT CLERIC has your name. This way you retain a rotation of heals on a set pause. <br />

Snare Glands Aggro Trick- <br />
<br />
Snare Glands are available form the Caller Quest in FG. All you need is 2 minimum. <br />
<br />
This is the fastest way to gain quick aggro on an MT switch or such w/o AE Taunt. Burn as many charges as you want untill you get solid aggro. <br />
<br />
once its empty you can RECHARGE it. Goto a vendor with 1 empty gland and 1 full one. Sell the Empty one to vendor (make sure he has space). Then sell him the full one. You can then buy both back with full charges. You should farm 10-20 of them and use for big fights if aggro control on MT switch is a problem. <br />
<br />
___________________________________________ <br />
<br />
Shammy Torpor + Mages chain summoning rods/using them = endless mana for Clerics + Wizards. Sure its known, but just a fact. <br />
<br />
<br />
Few Strategies: <br />
<br />
Arch Lich – <br />
<br />
Get everyone in right side of room behind the pillar. Set CH line for MT, and group the RP (Rampage) tank with 2-3 clerics. Fully buff the tanks, and mem blur AL till he has no target. Set RP with the tactic above; have MT shoot 30-40 arrows, have RP tank shoot 10. Have both run in at once, until AL does a Rampage. Then back up out of range again. If a tank dies doing this, you have to mem blur and set RP again. Let MT shoot more arrows so that he is on top of AL agro list (just “/assist Arch” to check). <br />
<br />
Now where you position your clerics depends on who your better players are. You can keep clerics much safer BEHIND the pillar, out of RP range, and they can CH from there. However, AL knockbacks and CH will be OOR, and the tank will die. Which leads to a bit of chaos. This is best situation if you have good tanks. <br />
<br />
Tanks (MT and RP) should have DMF to help stop the knockbacks effect some. They should line up looking exactly straight at the other wall so their back is facing the alter. Then back into the alter and look almost directly up. This will prevent them from being knockbacked out of range of CH’s from the pillar. If your tanks suck and you can’t get this to work, just move the clerics to the wall next to the ramp. The downside to this is if RP tank dies, Cleric will be in RP range and be killed instantaneously. <br />
<br />
If RP tank dies have EVERYONE back out of range (down the ramp). Drag the RP tank, ress and rebuff him. Send him in and keep him alive a few seconds then send everyone else back in. If you don’t do this, you’ll lose half your melee’s to RP before you wipe. This can be done with 35-40. You shouldn’t have a single death if you follow this exactly. <br />
<br />
High Priest – <br />
<br />
Start at jail room. Pull the next room clear of Golems and Chapel Guards. The HP’s room consists of 4 Bloodpirests, 4 Zels, Bunch of Disciples (number slips my mind, 8 I think). You want to pull the Bloodpriests and Zels INTO the Jail room. The HP fight becomes a 2 part raid now. 2 groups of agro controllers, and everyone else for the HP. <br />
<br />
Aggro Control Groups (2): <br />
<br />
-2 Chanters will keep the 4 Zels MESSED in the Jail room. <br />
-4 Tanks (hybrids work fine) will TANK the Priests in Jail room entire fight <br />
-Keep 2 clerics in Jail room to heal add tankers. <br />
-Keep 1 magi in Jail room to chain summon rods <br />
-Keep 1 Shammy in Jail room to slow snakes, and Torp Magi so they can chain summon rods. <br />
<br />
HP Force: <br />
<br />
-2-3 Necros/Clerics with NO other tasks will Banish Undead the Disciples the moment they pop, during the HP fight. <br />
-You can run your CH line 2 ways. First way involves getting an SK to build major agro on HP from range so he won’t attack anyone who comes in range. Move a magi on TOP of HP house and CoH the CH line clerics up here. AE will not hit them here. Can’t let RP tank die though, or Cleric will die immediately. Your other option is to find the 20 ft range between CH and HP’s AE. You can also run CH line from in the blood pools. AE won’t hit there. <br />
<br />
Shouldn’t be too difficult. Again, should be no deaths. <br />
<br />
<br />
Cursed – <br />
<br />
You’ll want to pull cursed inside the bottom, right level of the Temple. All the way on the right is a space. To the left of it is an Alter, and another space, then another Alter. Park your clerics/casters in the far right corner. Pull Cursed between the 1st and 2nd Alter. Hold him against wall, with MT’s back facing the first alter and beyond that, your Clerics and Casters. Use your normal N ToV positioning here and stick him to wall between the 2 alters. If he gets pushed back to far, his AE will hit your Casters. If pushed to far forward, MT will be OOR or heals and be stuck up on an alter. This whole fight is positioning. Your MT must have a hotkey set up to CALL the AE charm. Its 24 seconds, so have a hotkey saying “AE IN 10 SECONDS” and one saying “AE DOWN.” When the first hotkey is called, have your melee’s (except MT and RP) run behind the 2nd alter (opposite one that casters are behind), and dodge the AE. Once 2nd hotkey down they can come back out. This next part is crucial to your fight. If AE Charm connects on the MT (DR resist) he will lose ALL agro. You can use AE Taunt, or Snare Gland trick (scroll up) to regain agro. Make sure the other melee’s know to back off if this happens to give ample time for MT to regain agro. Cursed is gimp if done right. <br />
<br />
AoW – <br />
<br />
I’m not sure a strat is even needed anymore for this gimp encounter. Set up on either side of arena, pull whatever is needed (Vindi, Statue, Idol eventually; whatever). Make sure your Tanks are shrinked to minimum size b/c you’ll prolly lose at least a few if this is your 1st attempt. There is a crack in the wall on either side of the arena, that is where your MT will back into to fight him. Once AoW is Inc, have MT shoot an arrow or whatever, then puller FD. AoW is inc to your camp now. Once hes there, give 10-15 seconds for the MT to build agro, while slowly backing the AoW up into the corner. Disc should be used immediately obviously. CH line should begin before its even inc. MT should use AE taunt or Snare gland trick (see above) to make sure he doesn’t agro on the clerics. Once 10-15 seconds have past, have ALL melee’s hitting from back and push him into the corner. Make sure your aware when MT’s disc is down so you can adjust your healing pauses (see CH pause list above). If the MT dies, have the next tank get spammed with DL’s, Chloroblasts, Celest Blast, LoH, whatever. Let him use Def disc and get into corner and have ALL other melee’s stop attacking, until next tank has solid agro. Rinse and repeat until hes dead. This encounter is a joke. <br />
<br />
Emp Info – <br />
<br />
Tormentors and Slayers ARE messable. Malignants are pretty much solo’able by a hybrid when slowed. There is a 10 minute timer between when Blood dies and when Emp spawns. Everything is for all intensive purposes insta-respawn. Just keep the 4 messed and the last 4 tanked IN one of the front halls (so not in Emperor LoS when he pops). Emperor is slowable with the SoL Shammy Disease-based slow (25%). Won’t give full spoiler. Just some basic infoz for 1st time. <br />

<br />
Most of that stuff is correct, however, lots is not true also.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling you probably didnt write this yourself. I'm sure you saw it on another site/messageboard and just copied and pasted here.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why you felt you needed to post this. People tend to get upset when other people &quot;spoil&quot; high level content. I'm sure whoever you stole this info from probably won't be too happy. Get ready for the flames.<br />

Flame away, junior.  I'm all for disclosure of spoilers, that's what websites like these are for.<br />
<br />
Trust me, saying you need cheal chains for some of those mobs is, in fact, amusing.<br />

My guild comes from the school of divine light spam, though.</div></div><hr />

Much of that info is just plain ridiculous. i doubt it helps anyone. Not to mention what you posted was from a guilds private board .<br />
very poor form. You should be proud.</div></div><hr />

None of it is &quot;copyrighted.&quot;  It's all information anyone could have gathered just going back through the Safehouse.<br />
<br />
Comically, of course, people get mad about some spoiler information, yet, all of you have asked for spoilers here at least once, if not more times.<br />
<br />
Are you afraid your server's &quot;gimp guild&quot; is going to use this information and start choking you, mob wise?<br />

It's not so much that any of it isn't true.  It's just pointless.  Sure, you COULD use a cheal chain for some of that stuff, but why?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for posting the information, even if it wasn't yours.  It did contain some tidbits I wasn't aware of. <br />
<br />
You said If I had wrote it myself, it'd be more accurate. <br />
<br />
YOU posted the information HERE at the Crucible's boards.<br />
Please rewrite it to be &quot;more accurate&quot;.  <br />
<br />
THAT would be more in line with your statement, &quot;I'm all for disclosure...&quot;  Posting information that you know to be less than accurate isn't disclosure, it is misleading, even if the original cut &amp; pasted information isn't technically wrong.<br />
<br />
Since I'm not at a point where I myself can differentiate between the accurate &amp; inaccurate segments of your post, I'd appreciate you clarifying which information you believe isn't wholly accurate.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Amen, straif.  Heck, I knew just about all of that, and I still say 'Thanks!' to Morbadd for posting it.  You go, boy!  This is supposed to be a good place to help one another.  Personally, I disagree with some of the heal circle times, but a lot of that is based on the tank HP/AC/resists and needs to be tailored for the guilds.  Just offhand, I guess that any guilds actually needing the posted info should increase their heal circles by at least a pause of 10.  Chances are that they don't have the necessary equipment, etc. needed to handle the mobs' damageoutput yet.<br />

Personally, part of my enjoyment on raids is us coming up with plans on how to handle mob X.  I like some pointers (be carefull, he CHs so be prepared) but hand-holding walk-thrus ruin a lot of my fun.  Also, my guild figures out a plan that works for us and then it gets posted in a public forum I would not appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Going as far as admitting after the fact that he knows some of it was inaccurate just shows lazyness and an attempt to troll IMnsHO.<br />

Oh btw, you guys need to lighten up.  First off it doesnt really read like something youd have on a private guild message board.  And secondly non of it is so super secret that anyone should care if it gets posted.  Thirdly its been posted before on other boards so the cat is quite a bit out of the bag any way.  And finally, the info is accurate, just a bit odd in its order and level of detail at times.</div></div><hr />

In my opinion, if you don't wanna hear about high end strats, don't read a post that has those key words in the title.

Anyone getting pis.sy needs to take a chill pill. Just because Young_Guild_01 sees how to  potentially  sucessfully complete an encounter doesn't mean they will be arriving in force to take over your favorite pharming spot.<br />
<br />
Jesus H. Christ, people act like they were born uber and have birthright claim to any spawn they desire.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Progenitor (missing from list), Final Arbiter and Master of the Guard are all slowable, 35 delay CH is a waste of mana.<br />
<br />
We kill named golems in ST with about 14-18 people, 2 clerics. Nowhere near the 6-8 in your list.<br />
<br />
Glyphed covered serpent is slowable easy, 35 delay CH is a waste of mana.<br />
<br />
You need much less than 75 pause for Statue of RZ, especially if it's quadding before it gets slowed, same thing for Grieg. <br />
<br />
Vindicator pause 30 and Tormax 35? We got Vindicator to 50% with 9 people. Tormax is a 30ish raid gig.<br />
<br />
Since when do you need 6-8 clerics for Vindicator or Tormax? We killed Vindicator with 2 clerics, Tormax with 4.<br />
<br />
We killed Glyphed easy with 3 clerics, not 6-8 as it suggests your list. Same thing for Grieg.<br />
<br />
Your &quot;gimp&quot; list is missing a few mobs: THO, Shei, IV, some UP named, Cursed, Rhag 2. Maybe Va'dynn, Acrylla Worm, Rhag 1 and Servitor.<br />
<br />
needed anymore for this gimp encounter<br />
- You should check your &quot;gimp&quot; list for many &quot;gimp&quot; errors. Only 6 gimp clerics for gimp AoW is kinda gimp, you need a few more to ungimp it, of course if you got gimp DPS then 6 clerics might gimp the encounter. But if you lack dedicated gimp mana pumps and a gimp cleric has to pick up a gimp rod and use the gimp rod, it will gimp CH rotation to obliveon and your gimp MT is going to be gimped, followed by the gimping of the gimp DPS crew and some gimp clerics. Then your gimp attempt is gimped and time for a gimp CR!<br />
<br />
But other than that the list is GIMPTASTIC!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hehe thats right zorlac.<br />
<br />
How  far will that spoiler get you against AoW if your main tank only has 3k unbuffed hp and your clerics have mana pools under 3000? Nowhere. You will go oom or Mr Uberwarrior will die very fast.<br />
<br />
Rampage same deal. if your monk has poor HP, how long is he going to last keeping rampage up and dont forget he needs heals too.<br />
<br />
Is that spoiler going to make people log on and form before uber guild#6352  does?<br />
<br />
<br />
Is that spoiler going to clear the yard trash that needs to be cleared on the way to uber loot dropping mob#8853<br />
<br />
<br />
Is that spoiler going to  help anyone in any way that cant already do those encounters already?<br />
<br />
Like i said, what useful information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">A lot of stuff listed there are outdated, there are better ways to manage rampage for example, and the delays listed are amusing as others have pointed out already.<br />
<br />
All in all, it serves as a good reference to up and comming guilds by showing them what's expected when dealing with these mobs. However, if someone follows it word for word... I'd almost pay to watch them on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It is rather funny that he calls the Avatar of War a gimp fight, while at the same time suggests a CH rotation for Master of the Guard, NToV easy dragons (meaning not Vyemm or Zlexak) and other wuss mobs.</div></div><hr />
