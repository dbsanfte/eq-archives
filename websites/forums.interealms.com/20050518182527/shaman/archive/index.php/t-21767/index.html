<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I re-activated my shaman after 6 months out and logged in, lookin for some action.<br />
Where did everybody go?<br />
I went to zones that usually had 50 people and a full room of folks lfg, 2 people in the zone. No squeels of KSing, no nothing.<br />
I checked on guilds I used to play with that used to have 40 odd people online, no one online.<br />
I went to the EP's, no one.<br />
I went to the LDON camps, not a soul.<br />
I went to barrindi (the hanging guardens or whatever it is), Ghost town.<br />
I went to POK, 25 people there.<br />
I went to the bazaar, only 65 traders up.<br />
I saw someone I used to know, they told me it was just a friend borrowing thier friends toons for a CR for thier 35 rogue.<br />
He told me his friend had trouble putting groups together strong enough to take down BOT named. For an EP flagged guild, thats 8-12 people.<br />
Paid one months billing, im thinkin tomorrow I cancel it.<br />
What killed the game that kept me and a number of my friends busy for 4 years?<br />
I dont understand how quickly it could be gutted.<br />
Where did everybody go?<br />

Just about every Asian player on Inny vanished. Not really sure what happened, but they all xfer or quit or whatever else. Both BA and EF pretty much disbanded, and everyone Elemental+ is losing members because of the DX9 patch and GoD trials (forced single group events suck for guilds).<br />

<br />
I understand the concept of burn out etc, and ive seen things wax and wane over the years I have played EQ, but nothing like this before.<br />

Has there been something spring up that has dragged everyone away from the game? Something better than EQ?<br />

To say that it sucked (sucks) is a mild understatement.  They've been doing major retuning in an attempt to slow the flood of people leaving.  I think most everyone is in a holding pattern and waiting to see what, if anything, they do.<br />
<br />
As an indication of the problem, SoE has actually arranged a pre-paid meeting at SoE of some of the various servers big guild leaders and board community leaders.  You know it's bad when they actually start listening to the player base again.<br />

Sonee, I'm retired now but from what I can tell every single time-enabled/GoD raiding guild on T7H is hurting for people.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm logged in on my server today, I think it was still relatively busy. There was only 170 traders but VS has never had that many traders on, maybe only peaking at 300 ish before I left. No friends online, so was empty in that sense. On the good side, I am very impressed with the UI which you log in with and the graphics upgrade( EC looked pretty amazing with the skies and stars), although saw someone half stuck in the ground.  <br />
In response to SoE losing customers, it is very bad for them in that most players continue playing through habit and social ties. When something stops and breaks both of them, I think it is then very hard to regain them back into the game, which is a shame. It will be interesting the steps SoE take now, maybe a nerfing of some boss mobs in certain areas like pop to make smaller guild sizes viable now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Glek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Haagen hit it on the head as far as seventh hammer goes. In kabald we maid yet another run from **** numbers online back to EP. Was one key away from Queen Sl00t in PoAir (not saying we were ready to down her by no means) then with in a month we are back down to 20 online again. and now with in last week we are down to 5. Seems majority of eq dotn want to work towards progression anymore when the upper guilds (not taking cheap shots) are going to hand it to them on a silver platter.</div></div><hr />

City of Heroes.  I read about it on these boards and I truly thank you all who praised it enough to make me want to buy it.  What a game.  First time I've had fun playing in a LOONG time.   Even my husband, whom I could never drag into EQ, loves it and already has his own account so he can play with me!<br />
<br />
One of my friends who's in the top guild on Saryrn is in WoW beta and says it's ten times better than EQ as well.  Up till now, everything else I tried - DAOC, AO, SWG, etc. - just didn't hold my interest.  I believe EQ has some real competition out there now.</div></div><hr />

Well said.  I have some friends who are casual gamers who play EQ and some others who are high end.  That DX9 issue alone is losing Sony a bunch of customers among those who were casual gamers and didn't have great gaming systems, and my friends who were power gamers have all started playing WoW and/or CoH.  Some of them, including me, still play EQ as well, but who knows how long that will last?</div></div><hr />

I re-activated my shaman after 6 months out and logged in, lookin for some action.<br />
Where did everybody go?<br />
I went to zones that usually had 50 people and a full room of folks lfg, 2 people in the zone. No squeels of KSing, no nothing.<br />
I checked on guilds I used to play with that used to have 40 odd people online, no one online.<br />
I went to the EP's, no one.<br />
I went to the LDON camps, not a soul.<br />
I went to barrindi (the hanging guardens or whatever it is), Ghost town.<br />
I went to POK, 25 people there.<br />
I went to the bazaar, only 65 traders up.<br />
<br />
Seems to me this guy came online right after the server crashed.  You aren't trying to say that these populations of Bazaar and POK are representative of the Hammer are you?</div></div><hr />

Now though, Terris Thule is all but empty it seems. Most times in Everfrost I see no more than 10 -15 people tops, usually less. Almost always they are lvl 65+ or there abouts. Virtually NO low levels, and few if any of them wanting to group. Went to Greater faydark, same thing. EC, same thing, Crushbone, same thing, the only place I saw any amount of people online was on the Planes of Knowledge, and then there was only about 50 or so. 98% of those I saw were lvl 65 give or take a bit.<br />
<br />
I have DX9 on my computer, I don't know if thats why I have such huge issues when the graphics get large (like in a town) or while people are casting, or if there are lot's of mobs, but this boat anchor I have for a computer protests badly about it and slows wayyyyyyyyyy down, with jumpy graphics and me running about 5 feet per minute. I have a dsl connection, so internet speed isn't the issue, but geeze, I never had these issues when I played 3 yrs ago, and it's the same dang computer, just a MUCH faster vid card and a bigger HD. Same memory, same processor, same MB. yet... I can't hardly process the graphics. It really sux.<br />
<br />
I just bought the game again because I missed playing, I still enjoy playing, but the graphics issues are not to my likeing, and I don't have the money to upgrade this beast of mine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you think populations are normal, log on an alt under 50 and try to get a group.  Try during prime time.  I bet unless you're a cleric, you will have a devil of a time managing that!  Well, I'm excluding clerics because them plus anyone else = a group mostly.  The low level crowd has dried up and blown away.  Haven't you noticed the enormous pandering SoE has been doing to the lowbies lately?  It's to try to get some of them to come back and play . . . and it won't work because they want other PEOPLE to play with, and with the populations of lowbies as awful as they are, they are forced to solo if they can, or otherwise just sit with LFG up.  It's really sad.  EQ is truly a multiplayer game that needs quite a bit of people online to function.  <br />
<br />
At the high end, I've seen three guilds bite it in the past 2 months due to lack of attendance/people quitting in droves.  And mind you, these were Time enabled guilds.  One was around since almost the very beginning of the server over 4 years ago, and people just threw up their hands in dismay at nobody loggin on anymore and gave up.  <br />
<br />
EQ has been pronounced &quot;dying&quot; or &quot;dead&quot; too many times in the past where it has made a miraculous come-back.  However, it's really going to take 1) a serious effort by developers to balance classes in desirability, 2) new and exciting content (GoD wont cut it, we'll need OoW for this miracle), and 3) several other games to bomb.  WoW needs to bomb, City of Heroes is bombing already, too boring, not enough variety of things you can do.  I have a lvl 20 char (halfway to max lvl of 40 whee) and it's just the same old thing, not even the villians change any in graphics or powers much at all from lvl 1 to lvl 25 (from what I've seen).  /yawn<br />
Lineage needs to bomb . . or miss its target market.  EQ2 needs to bomb (hah, like it won't!).  And a couple other games need to give up the ghost and die.  <br />
<br />
That's a whole lotta things that need to happen for EQ to live on.  Let's see if the patient pulls thru once again, or if he's pushing up daisies this time next year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>sharden_1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As server populations drop I would think it would become massively harder to get LDON groups started at sub-65 levels.  The need for certain classes will further hinder forming a group.  EQ targets those who group and when not enough are on to group... those orignially looking for a group will log.   Its a vicious cycle that ends with no one but soloer's online (and those with friends they can call to login....)<br />
<br />
    I used to enjoy logging in some sub-65 toons on various servers to do a quick LDON or two.   On the 3 servers I've tried the LDON camp area's were empty.......   It will be interesting if it picks back up come Winter.  But in 5 years of playing I have never seen it drop this low.....</div></div><hr />

We won't even discuss Everfrost and mobs looping on themselves till they die from a dot. your 30 feet away and they never reach you, no snare, no slow, no root, they just loop to death.<br />

Terris Thule is dead, virtually nobody but 65+ anywhere. I actually got a group of level 9-10 going last night and went to paduala or whatever caverns, that was cool. but lag was rather bad.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Post Script to my last post above: I jumped to several zones, rarely anymore than 10 players per zone. pok had about 70 and pretty much stays that way. Many zones had 1-2 players, some were empty. EC, Freeport, N. Ro, Oasis, Ogguk, Everfrost, Felwithe, Greater Faydark, lesser faydark, and about 7-8 other zones I visited all ghost towns from what I remember them as. <br />
<br />
This really is an utter shame, I had so much fun way back when before SoL came out, now...... I think that SoE really needs to scramble to fix their screw-ups or eq really will vanish. The only positive to any of this that I have actually seen is the niceness of the players (for the most part), when I first created Artorinia, some 65 shammy gave me a bunch of stuff. I didn't ask or anything, just came up to me with 3 bags of stuff, said here, keep what you want, sell the rest. Totally blew me away.<br />
<br />
I wish there were more low-levels though, hunting by myself while ok, gets lonely, this Shamaness likes the warm flesh of her fellow beings near during a battle.<br />

Player mounts and vehicles make it ALOT better to travel. Especially if you are used to having Spirit of Wolf, Jboots, or Blood of the Wolf potions for all your characters. Travel was what originally killed the game for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Merwenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">good point about being under lvl 50. I can never get a damn group on ANY alts..it literally sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">SWG is a lot more instant fun than EQ by a long ways. The trouble is that once you build a strong combat class there is very little you can not do solo in the game. And while that is fun to be so powerfull it gets boring after awhile once you have killed most everything in the game and been everywhere. I imagine EQ was much the same way before Kunark came out.. Well atleast in that you could see all the content in a relatively short amount of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Granted there are high end guild problems.  Time/God and each of the guilds you listed are the top ones, but I was talking about BoT and LDoN that the original poster was referring to.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't noticed the extremity of tons of people leaving on The Seventh Hammer. Sure you got the occasional person who is quitting or taking a break, but I still see plenty of people lined up at Ldon and I still get tells for BoT when I throw up LFG.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying people aren't quitting in large quantities, but I just haven't noticed it on the server I play.<br />
<br />
Population is definitely down everywhere.  I don't think everyone has necessarily ended billing yet but people a lot of people have and a huge number of people just aren't logging on nearly as much.  Its not just Time/God guilds either on the Seventh anyway.  Two of the three mid end (somewhat new to the EPs) guilds, Phoenix Ascendant and Kabald, completely died in the last couple months and last I knew the third was recruiting very heavily.<br />
<br />
I know in PA we had 120 members and I assume Kabald was probably around there.  So we're looking at over 200 almost perfect candidates for the high end guilds.  If server population wasn't a problem on the Seventh then the high end guilds wouldn't still be recruiting like mad and having difficulties with numbers.<br />
<br />
I also noticed the Seventh Hammer had the 2nd most characters for sale on player auctions about 6 weeks ago.  Now I don't know if thats normal to see the 7th that high on the list since it was the first time I'd noticed but I doubt it.  I was actually there because I had to start checking it every few days to remove people from the guild who had sold their characters if thats any indication on how bad things have gotten.    <br />
<br />
Not to argue with you Somee, just to offer a different perspective.  I haven't noticed G3 heavily recruiting and overall you guys seem to be plugging away just the same but I think you guys are alone in that aspect.  I'll agree that its not quite as bad as Rowf described but there is definitely a huge problem and the Seventh isn't an exception.</div></div><hr />
