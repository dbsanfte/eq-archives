<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this really doesn't have much to do with anything, but what ever happened to the kedge race?  I don't ever remember reading anything about their downfall, yet Phinny is the only 1 left... Anyone else smell another expansion coming?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wycked Bonecallor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">in a nutshell, <br />
Phinny went nuts trying to game more power...ect blew kedge keep to hell in the process, killing all the other Kedge, so he is the last one alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">These are the sites I read for the lore.  I haven't read them all yet, so I can't directly answer your question.<br />

You can't possibly be eluding to the fact that one of the ORIGINAL EQ dungeons is just now (6 additions too late mind you) pointing to a new expansion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">actually, i meant an expansion after LDoN, yet there could be something in LDoN as well... I was thinking more along the lines of kedge being a playable race of some sort?  It is difficult to find anything about them at all, especially their downfall... Also, I don't think Prexus (their creator) would allow the extinction of his creation.  Then again, we still haven't seen his plane...</div></div><hr />

If they are all gone, how can they be playable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gafasiycarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Acctually the Kedge is a playable race, Frogloks we acctually the Kedge, they just had enchanters cast an illusion on them</div></div><hr />

Actually, it's not that extreme of an idea. I seem to remember a good long while ago (just as Kunark was coming out, I think) that a dev (Brad, probably) said that most of Faydwer never go developed. I think it would be a great idea to add on to the Kedge race/dungeon and perhaps even make it playable. I have always been a big fan of underwater fighting; it seems to take much more skill due to dealing with knockbacks and timing spells inbetween swings (granted, this occurs more with soloing). I really was hoping that Veksar would be a higher-level version of Kedge, but perhaps they can make something like that in the post-LDoN expansion(s).</div></div><hr />

That would explain a few things I've seen in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They tend to stay away from underwater zones because of all the issues kedge has with pathing, and clipping. The underwater parts of the EQ engine just suck bad. I doubt they think it is worth the time to make any more underwater content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not so sure about this... they made most of Veksar above water, but Plane of Water is unsurprisingly, mostly wet, and has the attendant problems of fighting underwater: Melee distance problems, getting interrupts a lot, particularly when other people bump into you.</div></div><hr />
