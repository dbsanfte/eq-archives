<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like to see an AA skill that allows you to increase the speed of the type of horse you have by about 5-10%.  Cheapest horses now (~8.3k) have about a 25% speed increase.  At the level people will be buying horses, 25% increases is /yawn.   <br />
With this proposed AA skill, you could potentially increase it to a 30-35% increase (basically the same as JBoots), making players a little more eager to invest in them.  <br />
Same for each rank of horse (stopping at the highest buyable; adding speed increase to the dropped horse might be a tad too much).<br />
Also, maybe limit lower-end horses to only a 5% increase and higher-end to 10%.  That way, you can be rewarded more for buying a more expensive horse (which is VI's whole purpose for putting them in to begin with).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good Idea.<br />
<br />
Other AA skills:<br />
<br />
1) make all the healing skills work with torpor<br />
<br />
2) Dire Charm<br />
<br />
3) Quick Debuff</div></div><hr />
