<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for a nice little soloing place at 44, since i am very close to level.  I don't care about loot as much as I care about exp, but I wouldn't mind camping a few kp. :rolleyes: Anyhow, thats about it.  I am not twinked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say the places you could hunt at 44 vary alot.  Solb aint bad, but the bats are annoying as hell to split and stuff.  I didnt like Echo anymore at 44, but im a troll so you could try it out.  DL got old for me, Karnor's could be nice for groups.  Dulak's is a huge possibility, but you would have to stick with the scouts. other than that im flopped out for ideas, cause im very picky to where i hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if u want some exp and loot, try soloing in nurga.  just buy a aegolism and crack and u should be fine.<br />
<br />
Most mobs are lb so exp wont be awesome,  but for their lvl they have quite high pp dropage.  The occasional emerald and opal drops too, and fair bit of fsteel.<br />
Plus if u have a trader u may want to sell the skins and salts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ridgewall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">id say echo is a good place to go. i went from lvl 45 to lvl 50 in a few days</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Avoid Dulak until 46 or so. You could do pretty well on the beach in Gunthak though. Try that, or kill Ulthorks in Eastern Wastes, good exp and not too bad of drops. Keep the tusks they are worth more than you might realize.</div></div><hr />
