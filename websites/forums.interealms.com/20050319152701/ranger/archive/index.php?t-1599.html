Schools and their zero tolerence policy. Are they enough? Do they go too far? I mean, really, when a HS girl brings pamprin to school with her because its that time of the month, and sshe is expelled  for it, isn't that just a little too far?<br />
<br />
Or when a straight A Honor student, who was working on his car over the weekend, stores his tools in the LOCKED trunk and forgets about them, and is then expelled on  the grounds of having WEAPONS in his car in the parking lot.......<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, what do you think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, there's the ultimate idiocy:<br />
<br />
http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/2001/departments/2001_06_28/upfront_1.html<br />
<br />
Zero tolerance strikes again.<br />
<br />
In his fourth-hour class at Woodbury Middle School the day after April Fool's, Joseph K was doing the work of any 14-year-old Clark County School District student when Principal Joseph Murphy summoned him to the hallway. <br />
<br />
<br />
Joseph K., not his real name, had no idea what was up. Maybe the A/B student was being recognized for his outstanding grades? Maybe he'd received another award for his devotion to the Boy Scouts? <br />
<br />
Before his teen-aged mind had time to process the fact that the principal wasn't alone, three school police officers turned him around and slapped on the handcuffs. <br />
<br />
<br />
It would be three more days before Joseph K. or his grandparents would learn specifically why he'd been arrested, and 10 more days before he'd be allowed to return home. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now, more than two months later, Joseph K. and his grandparents are all in professional counseling--his grandmother broke down in tears during an interview two weeks ago--to deal with the recurring nightmares and sleepless nights. Joseph K. has never been allowed back into school, and was formally expelled recently. <br />
<br />
<br />
But that's not the worst of it, his grandparents say. What's worse is that the school district has forever labeled their grandson. During his expulsion hearing, district officials said Joseph K. fits the &quot;profile&quot; of a potentially violent student: He's well-groomed, gets good grades and is well liked. <br />
<br />
In other words, a menace to society. <br />
  <br />
<br />
WATCH WHAT YOU SAY <br />
<br />
Days after Joseph K. was kicked out of the eighth grade, one of his teachers addressed his former classmates, looking at the empty desk Joseph K. usually occupied. &quot;Be careful what you say, or someone you know might not be here anymore.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
But neither Joseph K. nor his grandparents understand how something he said at home to a couple of flirtatious girls could have led to his arrest, jailing and expulsion from school. <br />
<br />
<br />
It was March 30, about 11:30 p.m., when Joseph K. got the phone call that changed his young life. Two girls from Chaparral High School, one of them an acquaintance, called to ask him out on a date, of sorts: Would he escort them to the 7-Eleven to hang out? It didn't take him long to answer: &quot;I didn't want to hang out,&quot; he recalls, &quot;It was late.&quot; <br />
The girls then put him on hold. He waited patiently. Some 15 minutes later, they got back on the phone, and Joseph K. was a little steamed. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I said, 'It's people like you who get on the Columbine lists,'&quot; he recalls. His reference was to the now-infamous April 1999 killing of 13 at Columbine High School in Colorado by students Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. <br />
<br />
<br />
He had no idea that the school-shooting reference would stir police to action. <br />
  <br />
<br />
NO STONE UNTURNED <br />
<br />
To learn about the type of investigation school police conducted to justify Joseph K.'s arrest, Las Vegas Weekly made an Open Records request for police reports. To protect the identities of juveniles involved, the paper asked that their names be blackened out. Sgt. Ken Young, school police spokesman, said school lawyers had not finished reviewing the reports before the Weekly's deadline. Young offered a synopsis of the police investigation. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The kids started reporting to administration, and we started getting information from administrators at Chaparral and Woodbury,&quot; Young said. &quot;And (Joseph K.) had some other issues he was dealing with.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Those &quot;issues&quot; might have had something to do with the fact that Joseph K. has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a condition treated with prescription drugs. Since being treated, his grandparents say, his grades have skyrocketed from Fs and Ds to As and Bs. And after a court ruling 13 years ago, Joseph K.'s grandparents became his legal guardians. <br />
<br />
<br />
But Joseph K.'s medical condition isn't what sealed his fate with police. Columbine did. Young was very open about the state of mind of the Clark County School District and its police department during the month of April. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;This was leading up to the Columbine time,&quot; Young said, referring to April 20, the two-year anniversary of the Colorado shooting. &quot;So any type of rumor, any kinds of threats of joking, jestering or kidding, we were following up on. This was one of those cases. If the kid makes any type of threat with a weapon, and he has access, whether (it) belongs to the parent in the home or not, they are automatically taken into custody.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
School police also found in Joseph K.'s locker and backpack more &quot;evidence:&quot; a class report he'd been writing about the Holocaust, which included sketches of Nazi symbols. Also taken was an essay he'd written for another class, answering the question: What's the biggest problem facing schools today? Joseph K.'s essay focused on school violence. <br />
<br />
<br />
After questioning the teen--Is he depressed? Did he have a &quot;list?&quot; Did he hate anyone?--police took him to his grandparent's house, grandpa signed a consent form specifically letting them search Joseph K.'s room, according to the grandfather. They not only searched the kid's room, including his computer files and email, they also went through grandpa's closet, where they found his shotgun. They took it and the boy's BB-gun. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We're thinking at the time that he did something real stupid in school, and they're going to punish him somehow,&quot; grandpa says, explaining why he didn't oppose the search <br />
When grandpa asked what the boy was being charged with, police replied: &quot;You'll get a call,&quot; and took the teen away. <br />
  <br />
<br />
KANGAROO COURT <br />
<br />
During a family court hearing the next day, Joseph K. and his grandparents were only told that the teen was being charged with &quot;harassment.&quot; They received no paperwork detailing what prompted the charges: They weren't even allowed to have a copy of the paper that listed &quot;harassment&quot; as the charge. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sgt. Young says the boy was deemed a &quot;habitual disciplinary problem,&quot; a term defined by the state Legislature two years ago to mean anyone who &quot;threatened or extorted, or attempted to threaten or extort, another pupil or (school employee)&quot; in a year's time. By state law, a student who has never had a problem before can be deemed a &quot;habitual&quot; troublemaker with one erroneous act (Las Vegas Weekly, May 17, &quot;Caught in the Crosshairs&quot;). <br />
<br />
<br />
None of that came up in court. Sylvia Beller, the juvenile special hearing master, refused to release Joseph K. to his grandparents until he'd been evaluated by county psychologists. The teen got out a week later. He couldn't return to Woodbury--he first had to wait for the district's Pupil Personnel Services to schedule an expulsion hearing. But in the meantime, Woodbury gave him an award for being a good student: He got a &quot;Smart Card&quot; for his efforts. He appreciated it almost as much as the one he got while taking classes in the juvenile jail. <br />
<br />
<br />
To say Joseph K. got an education during his 10 days in jail would be a grave understatement. He says he saw teens strapped in chairs, as punishment, for what seemed like days on end. And every time his grandparents visited, he was strip-searched--anally and under his scrotum. &quot;I was trying to make the best of it,&quot; he says, sheepishly recalling the searches. <br />
<br />
<br />
His grandparents weren't so calm. &quot;You think it's going to go away, because it's so ridiculous,&quot; says Grandpa, his face turning red. &quot;You expect any day a call from the police saying it was a big mistake. They never did.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Some of it went away June 6, when Beller dismissed all charges. (The teen's grandparents marveled at Beller's decision, especially since Mike Gardner, Joseph K.'s Clark County public defender, told them he wanted Joseph K. to plead to lesser charges.) <br />
<br />
<br />
Despite the court's dismissal, the school district went ahead and formally kicked Joseph K. out of school for one quarter on June 13. It was during his expulsion hearing that Joseph K. and his grandparents were told that his &quot;type&quot;--well-groomed, good students who are well liked--fit the profile of kids who shoot up schools. No one from Pupil Personnel Services returned calls for comment from Las Vegas Weekly. <br />
Last week, Joseph K. enrolled at the so-called Washington Opportunity School, a series of prison-like trailers at Lake Mead Boulevard and White Drive. <br />
  <br />
<br />
OUT OF CONTROL <br />
<br />
Though juvenile crime rates had been falling long before Columbine (the percentage of students reporting that they were victims of crime fell from 10 percent in '95 to 8 percent in '99), school paranoia, here and around the country, is on the rise. During April alone, Young said, there were more than 20 arrests in the school district. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We were chasing down rumors for what seemed like the whole month,&quot; said the sergeant. &quot;It was ridiculous.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
It's all part of what Allen Lichtenstein, attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, calls the district's &quot;zero intelligence,&quot; rather than &quot;zero tolerance,&quot; policy. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We're talking about insanity and it just gets worse and worse,&quot; said Lichtenstein. &quot;What it's really all about is insurance and liability and the school district saying, 'hey, no one can ever accuse us of anything.' So zero tolerance equalling zero intelligence is really the key.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
A block from Woodbury Middle School at Joseph K.'s home, grandpa is still waiting to get his shotgun back, and his grandson is facing new dangers at Opportunity School, which his grandfather describes as situated in a neighborhood infested with gangs. <br />
<br />
<br />
And still, there's disbelief. <br />
<br />
&quot;What have I learned?&quot; grandpa says, looking down, shaking his head, &quot;God, this can happen to anybody's kid. Anybody's. And how many more times is it happening that we never hear about?&quot;</div></div><hr />

All the policies in the world won't stop a homicidal kid. You have all these freaky people blaming video games and music and banning hooded sweatshirts from schools (it's true) but that doesn't solve a single thing. You annoy all of the school kids in the United States to try to reinforce safety with some majorly idiotic policies. I think they are just too prideful to admit 'We don't know what to do about it', so they act like they're doing something useful. I don't know, maybe it's just that annoying common sense thing.. but I think if someone were to really want to kill people, lack of a hooded sweatshirt wouldn't stop them. Nor would a metal detector.<br />
<br />
I think if I were a parent I could tell if my son or daughter had homicidal tendencies though.</div></div><hr />

Not entirely true. In all truth, a zero-tolerance policy would have had Dylan Kliebold and Eric Harris expelled from Columbine High School at least a year or more before they went on their killing spree. It might very well have prevented 15 deaths. No one can be certain of what might have happened, but at least more people would have been aware of their tendencies and would have taken them more seriously.<br />
<br />
However, the fact remains that too many innocent people are being caught and punished. The US legal system is built on the premise on a presumtion of innocence. That is, unless you are under 18, in which case you are guilty and cannot be proven innocent. To me, this is unaceptable. There is no room for people to use their judgement to interpret the situation.<br />
<br />
We had a high school girl in Denver who accidentally took her mother's lunch to school. She opened the bag and found that her mom had enclosed a steak knife. The girl immediately took the knife to a teacher - and was summarily expelled for having a weapon in school. The teacher and principal went to the school board with the girl to explain that she was a 'B' student, and that it was an error, but the school board's no-tolerance policy was very clear. Weapon=expulsion, no appeal.<br />
<br />
It's fine for every instance of a suspected weapon or drug to be investigated, in fact I would encourage it. But zero tolerance means zero good judgement allowed. We supposedly hire school administrators who show good judgement. Why can't we let them use it to keep good kids in school while punishing the ones who are actually a danger?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ven Dragnborn</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's an example from my days in High School.<br />
<br />
There was a group of kids that were what would be considered these days as gangbangers. Always grouped together, smug, can't touch me attitude, with a smattering of violent tendencies. I was a target of the group because of my size and nerdish exterior.<br />
These boys  (all 15) had been expelled from school shortly after the school year started in 11th grade. Just beforee  the Thanksgiving break, all 15 guys calmly walked into my biology class and proceded to beat the living daylights out of me. In front of the teacher.<br />
This was their idea of &quot;kicks&quot;. Now, being the loner that I was, and seeing that  school officials were not capable of protecting me,  I had no choice but to carry a weapon.<br />
How did the expulsion help this situation? IIt didn't. And anyone thinking that the expulsion WOULD have  diverted the Columbine incident is dreaming. It MAY have  prevented it but I somewhat doubt that that, in and of itself would have. Only active intervention and monitoring  would have prevented what happned to me and Columbine. Parental involvement is key to this. You tell me (those of you with children) that if school officials were to come to you about a  disciplinary probelm concerning youir child, you wouldn't get involved.<br />
All the Zero tolerance policies in the world will not replace parental involvement in childrens lives.</div></div><hr />

By demonizing children who are doing nothing wrong, we are desensitizing our society to those who cause actual problems.<br />
<br />
Besindes, having a hard-and-fast rule about actual weapons and drugs is one thing, but penalizing children for holding their fingers as guns, passing mints or keeping a baseball bat in their car does no one any good, and can concievably do a great deal of harm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you accidently brought a weapon to school (steak knife in moms lunch, wrong jacket with your pocket knife in it, gun left in trunk from weekend hunting trip etc) and took it to an admin. saying &quot;i accidently brought this to school please take it&quot; you would be expelled.<br />
<br />
So when people did accidently bring weapons ( read the full page list of weapons in your kids code of behavior) they would keep them on them, or in their car, or locker etc. because if they tried to turn them in like they should they'd be expelled.  So the school's policy helped keep more weapons in the school. <br />
<br />
My friend was sucking on a loli-pop in the hall, so our resident cop decided to search her, becuase sucking on a loli-pop means your rolling (on the drug ecstacy).  Of course she wasnt under the influence at the time, but during the search they found her ciggerettes (she was 18 but still not allowed at school) and was suspended for a week.  <br />
<br />
My friend was speeding down the prince william parkway (if any of you happen to be from VA, you know the road), a 45mph zone. The traffic tends to flow at 60.  I think my friend was going 80+,  our school cop stops him (was after school cop out now) and prepares to right him a ticket  when he notices his varisty baseball jacket in back seat.  <br />

&quot;Are you on the team?&quot;<br />

&quot;Yeah&quot; <br />

<br />
Not possible to enforce.<br />
<br />
ANYTHING can be a weapon.  As I've posted above, I had a black belt in Tae Kwon Do before I was a senior in high school.  I've been doing martial arts (TKD, Judo, Aikido, Iaido, Jujitsu, etc.) since I was 14, and am currently 31.  BELIEVE me, anything can become a weapon if there is a need and you are creative.<br />
<br />
A pencil applied to the right area with sufficient force can kill.<br />
So can a fist, a finger, a foot or a text book.<br />
<br />
Whether something is a weapon or not is entirely about INTENT.<br />
<br />
My hands when typing on the computer or caressing my wife are NOT a weapon.  When they are clenched into a fist and driven by strength and knowledge, they more certainly are.  Similarly, a knife when used to cut a steak is not a weapon, when wielded with intent to do harm it is.</div></div><hr />

What I'd really like to see are the opinions and reasons behind them of the three people who voted that the zero-tolerance policies are fine the way they are. I don't want to attack them, I'd just really like to see the argument of a person who is actually on the other side.</div></div><hr />

On a similar note there was a meeting of pilots and security officials about weapons onboard planes.<br />
<br />
On of the security officials shocked the pilots when he said he could buy a weapon right there at the JFK airport that was as effective as any knife.  A golden plated Statue of Liberty that had a nice sharp point where the torch and crown is.<br />
<br />
For the aritcle read this (http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,232498,00.html)<br />
<br />
Also as someone above pointed out what about hands and feet in the use of a martial artist.<br />
<br />
Or from my own personal experience me in a street brawl (I've easily busted the chops of several &quot;black belts&quot; and their flitsy pansy martial arts with quick kick to the knee and an open palm to the nose. *not intended as a dig to TRUE martial artists as they can be bad asses but too often black belt awards seem to be given to people of lesser stature*).<br />
<br />
Or my soccer cleats I've managed to severely hurt a few people on the fields from slide tackling with a solid pair of cleats and I could easily apply those moves on any fighting surface that involved grass, OR even a soccer ball.  A few of my teammates and I were notorious for &quot;head-hunting&quot; (purposely trying to kick the living hell out of the soccer ball while aiming it at someone's face dead on).  <br />
<br />
In fact one friend (who was able to kick medicice balls into the goal at fairly high speed from 30 meters out and was chased after by the football coach cause he was able to kick 60+ yard field goals without straining) kicked a soccer ball so hard in one game that the guy blacked out before he hit the ground.  Literally he just fell backward didn't flinch or try to break his fall just TIMBER backwards.  When he came to after the paramedics arrived he couldn't even remember his name or where he was.  Later it was heard he had a severe concussion.<br />
<br />
So WHERE?  where do we draw the line on weapons?<br />
<br />
Personally trying to figure out what a weapon is assanine at best.  Instead what we should be tracking down and punishing is BEHAVIOR.  When someone comes forward with a steak knife and says I need to call my mom to pick this up and take it home then that kid should be rewarded for his/her truthfulness.<br />
<br />
When a kid however brings a steakknife to school and makes threats then no holds bar that kid gets suspended and legally pursued for making a threat.<br />
<br />
Moreover this guilty until innocent things needs a financial backer to take this to the supreme court.  Yes children are not full fledge citizens but that doesn't mean that they are totally without rights.  they are STILL citizens even if non-voting ones and as such are protected from Colonial British concepts of &quot;law&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Man that brings back memories.  I played goalie in highschool and during practice one day I took one right flush in the face.  The guy who kicked it played RB on the football team so had thighs as big as my chest.  He goes to kick it and I've got a bead on it but right before it gets to me, a defender gets his leg in the way, just enough for it to deflect the ball sending it into my face instead of my positioned hands.  I was out for a good minute and a half.<br />

Dammit, ven you stole my reply, I was going to say expulsion does nothing to stop murderers, if anything it ticks them off more. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ooppps!!!!! Sorry Vader, didn't mean to steal your post (looking chagrined) But, that also goes to show that something else needs be done with the policies currently in place. I mean really, if someone were really intent on causing  mayhem  at a school, they needn't even  be on the school grounds to accomplish this. Guns have far reaching capabilities. Its not up close and personal like a knife  or a fist..<br />
<br />
Now i would like to address Arroe's comment.<br />
You say everything is fine at your school. Ok. we'll start there. Granted, the kids you used as an example ARE in need of some type of punishment. there's no argument from me there. They screwed up. Personally, I think may be the punishment is a little harsh but that is personal opinion and nothing more. But, lets leave that aside for the moment.<br />
without knowing your gender, I'll propose a couple scenarios for you. <br />
<br />
In scenario A we have a  High School girl_0_1. She has a problem with her cycle and brings Pamprin, midol whatever. With your zero tolerance policy, she is now a candidate for permanent expulsion. Just because she brought a LEGAL off the shelf medicinal product to relieve  pain and discomfort. Not being female myself, I cannot relate to what this feels like. I can imagine though, that it makes  the learning experience a bit difficult. I know when I am in pain/discomfort, I do not tend to deal well with anything. It hinders motivation, thought processes,  and logical thinking. All of these attrbutes are needed when in a learning enviroment. This girl could be a straight A student, class president,  and  Valdictorian. Never had a minutes  trouble in school. Never GAVE any trouble during her &quot;tenure&quot; as a student. Yet her education has just been taken away from her because  she needed the relief of a standard, well accepted form of medicine. Now she will have to go for a GED because she cannot graduate. Or accept a &quot;Certificate of attendance&quot;. And we have already proven what society  thinks of THOSE two options in my other thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
In scenario B  we have Joe Q Public over here that studies hard, gets decent grades and only a few minor discipline problems. The night before he was helping his grandfatherr with  moving some things around and he was given a set of wood carving knives. (anyone not familiar with these, they look similar to chisels) He puts them in his car and forgets to take them out when he gets home. The next day, cops show up and he is called out of class. Once he gets in the hall, he is handcuffed, read his rights and has  his locker, person and vehicle searched. (this also happened in the previous example). Now we have two completely innocent kids being deprived of their RIGHT to an education. Put yourself in their shoes. Its not too much of a strain because this CAN happen to YOU!!!!!!! At any time. Lets take this example  down a different road.<br />
<br />
Lets say you and a bunch of buddies like paint ball. Yesterday, you were out having fun with your paint guns. When you get done, you put the gun in your car and forget about it. Guess what? when you go to school, you can be arrested, jailed, and permanently expelled for that.<br />
<br />
Kids are being expelled for NAIL CLIPPERS for Gods sake!!!! Now you sit there and tell me everything is fine and hunkey dorey. Let me clue you in. It isn't.<br />
You could very well be the next victim of zealotry and that is ALL this is.  Beware of Zealots, because  logic CANNOT rule them. They are ruled by passion and passion blinds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is a real quick reply as Im on business in Chicago and cant take to long to post.<br />
<br />
First off, Zero tolerance as we have been given examples here in this thread, no I do not agree with.  but....<br />
<br />
Zero Tolerance as a policy isnt so bad when it is used with common sense and a good set of rules to follow.<br />
<br />
Let me elaborate.  The no weapon Zero Tolerance is perfectly fine if the school board takes time to determine what a weapon is.  Ie. a knife over so many inches, lock blades ect.  Rules like this have been in place for many many years and there were never problems.  <br />
<br />
The problem is all of a sudden, people are so paranoid of getting blamed for doing something wrong they are slapping the old CYA motto to everything (dont know what that means, you dont need to know).<br />
<br />
Times are a changin.  A school board wants to ensure kids are not bringing weapons to school they need to be more active in other areas, including incouraging more parental involvement.<br />
<br />
well gotta go.<br />

Do you realize, that under most schools' zero tolerance policies, if you had taken the beer from these people and delivered it to a school administrator to dispose of, you would have been expelled too?<br />
<br />
If you were sharing a hotel room with one of these boys and he was caught with beer in your room, you would be expelled.<br />
<br />
This is what zero tolerance means - punishing the innocent along with the guilty.<br />
<br />
Severe punishment for drug, alcohol, weapons or violence violations is a great step to protect our students. Assumption of guilt and punishment without appeal is wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the catch here is that &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; is an absolute.<br />
Almost anything based on absolutes is bad.  However it goes back to common sense.  <br />
<br />
Common sense when the rules and regulations are written, and when they are put into practice. <br />
<br />
Most of the examples here are great to show how a zero tolerance policy can be abused and misused.  Just like anything else can be.<br />
<br />
Im just suprised that all this is being blamed on a guideline or policy, instead of the people who let it happen.<br />

Zero tolerance in theory means.  If you commit the crime you get the punisment, no matter what.<br />

<br />
yes....because severe drug penalties for possession and trafficking, etc narcotics has worked so well with America's War on Drugs. It's a proven winner! <br />
<br />
And I assume you'd be all for suspending and expelling the students who would push the Klebold's of the world to go on a shooting spree as well, right? Well, no, because we all know that the white cap wearing athletic jocks of America are only the innocent victims of these 'random' acts of violence.<br />
<br />
http://www.theonion.com/onion3532/columbine_jocks.html<br />
<br />
I think it's appalling that so many civil rights violations are occuring here. Illegal search and seizure...being illegally detained and not being told what you have been charged with doing. What's even more depressing is the parents and people out there who advocate the lessening of certain fundamental freedoms for the 'betterment' of the classroom. Bullocks.</div></div><hr />

Oh, we're back to the &quot;it wasn't their fault&quot; argument. <br />
<br />
Obviously those two misguided young men were abused by the system, their parents and schoolmates and had every right to go on a shooting rampage. It wasn't THEIR fault.<br />
Thousands of children are ostracized by their peers every day in high school. Only two of them walked into Columbine HS on April 20, 1999 and murdered 13 people. It WAS their fault. It was not society, the jocks or the parents. And citing an article in The Onion to back up your argument does very little to legitimize your opinion in my book.<br />
<br />
Yes, getting the people who use guns, drugs and alcohol out of our schools DOES protect our children. Have you read about the Exile program and what it has done for gun-related violence in cities across the country? A 21% drop in violent crime in the state of Virginia since it was instituted.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, no instant gratification here. This takes alot of work. We vote, we attend PTA mettings, ect.<br />
<br />
Im glad school boards dont change rules on a whim, or at every outcry.  Trust me you would be suprised what some parents complain about to the school boards.  And how much some people expect the &quot;system&quot; to raise their child for them and do all the work.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as Columbine Idiots, They made the choice to commit murder.  They were responsible.  <br />
<br />
Those of you still in highschool, dont forget that we all were there, and if you think things are going to magically get better after you walk across the stage you are sadly mistaken.  <br />
<br />
Life is one big &quot;highschool&quot;, its just that after a while you learn to not become so melodramatic about it.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
That said, I still think these Columbine killers parents are partially responsible in that they didnt see any signs to this coming..........right......<br />
<br />
And whose job is it ultimately to teach morals.  Like: No matter how much someone laughs at you its not worth their life?:rolleyes: <br />

But when the innocent are being punished  to the extent that their education is hampered by STUPID judgements then something HAS to be done. Just like  what was said about Arroe. Had hhe ben rooming with those that were drinking on that trip, chances are, he too would have been expelled just on general principle. Now, tell me this is right. Tell me you are happy about this type of policy. Tell me this is  justice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree in the example you just sited that would be stupid to expel the student who just happend to be there or even worse to expel the student who brought the beer to the teacher.  <br />
<br />
What is stupid about it is not a zero tolerance policy but how any idiot could interpret &quot;No underage drinking&quot; as &quot;any form of contact with alcohol or an alcohol container will result in expulsion&quot;??!! <br />
<br />
Again, Zero Tolerance is supposed to mean- if you commit the crime you receive the punishment.  No exceptions.<br />
<br />
An example might be.  No underage drinking on any school grounds or at any school functions or activities.  A zero tolerance policy applied to this rule would mean that just because Johny has straight A's he is still going to get the exact same punishment as Billy when they both get caught under the bleachers sharing a six pack.<br />
<br />
NOT this:<br />
<br />
Sandy sees a crushed beer can on the ground two feet from the trash can at a football game.  She decides to pick it up and help fight the litter problem.  But as she is stooping to pick it up, Mr. Bonehead sees her and reports her because of a zero tolerance policy.    Sandy has not even commited a crime for a zero tolerance policy to be enforced.  That someone would try is just as bad as an idiot trying to report her with no official zero tolerance policy in place (but still with a no minor drinking rule).  What is the difference?  Its not the freaking policy its how people interpret the rules and the policy.<br />
<br />
This is just idiocy.  Pure and simple.  Zero tolerance is there so that people dont think &quot;no big deal if I smoke in the bathroom, Ive been caught before and all they ever do is take my smokes and give me a day of detention.&quot;  <br />
<br />
It takes the guess work out of how many strikes you have left.  Instead of the above its &quot;No way am I going to smoke on school grounds.  If I even get caught one time Im expelled. That would be  waste of the last 10 years.&quot;<br />

Ummmmm did you miss that part of my post Thorn? I did not say anything about  taking the policy away. i'm saying use GOOD judgement when dealing with a Zero Tolerance policy.<br />
I'm saying take the CLUB away but leave the scalpel. Implemented correctly, Zero Tolerance is great. I mean really,  if this type of policy was used with EVERY aspect of life  you would have the same punishment for witnessing a crime such as murder as you do FOR murder.  Or YOU being pulled over for speeding  because   the person that just passed you going 100 miles an hour was. It's the same principle. Sounds rediculous doen't it.  But in effect, it's the same thing. Only it's applied in schools across this country instead of to us  adults.<br />

Everyone is looking to blame someone else. Why even last night my own little brother tried to blame me for his habitual cheating and video games. He plays consoles and owns every game cheater there is. he tried to claim that I started him cheating and it was my fault he is addicted. He claims that some years ago he was playing warcraft and got stuck and I told him some cheat codes and now he is addicting to cheating. Now I know this scenerio is extremely trivial but it applies to anything. Take responsibility for your own actions. I never MADE him cheat he CHOSE to cheat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Certainly, these were 2 distrurbed kids who did a horrible act, that THEY need to take responsibility for.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, there is ALSO a huge amount of responsibility that needs to be placed on the shoulders of:<br />
<br />
The school administration - For ignoring the signs and information that they had LONG before the shootings happened.<br />
<br />
The parents - For not taking a more involved part of their childrens lives.<br />
<br />
The police - For being complete wusses and incompetent in their jobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And thats the problem with today's society.<br />
<br />
Yes Kullaas society today would view you as partly responsible but this mentality that the victim ALWAYS did at least a little something to provoke an attack is not what we should be promoting. <br />
<br />
Rape is a perfect example.<br />
<br />
Girl wears short but still respectable skirt (say something suitable for the office) and she gets raped.  The media and lawer defenders 90% of time will point that out and make it sounds like SHE WANTED TO BE RAPED.<br />
<br />
*** hell kinda logic is that?  Just because I dress like a sword wielding knight at a renfest doesn't mean I want to be engaged in a hack fest.<br />
<br />
Just because some guy dressed in a pink shirt with tropical flowers on it doesn't mean he wanted to be called gay and get the hell beat out of him.<br />
<br />
It simply amazes me that the people who cry loudest about being allowed to be self-expressive also shout that somehow the victim ASKED to be victimized (liberals are infamous for victimology).<br />
<br />
9/11 is the same thing.  Yes we have international policy that exerts our will and yes there are peaceful ways those countries could resist our will but instead they fly planes into our buildings.  We sure as hell didn't ASK that to happen.<br />
<br />
So Kullaas while I wouldn't feel all that sorry for you if you had been bad mouthing Christianity and Nitefox decked you, I would hold Nitefox COMPLETELY liable for his actions.<br />
<br />
You in no way physically presented harm to him and he lost control and physically retaliated.  And so he is 100% at fault there and you are not.<br />
<br />
People need to learn self-discipline and people need to learn when to and not to apply force.<br />
<br />
All to often though people seem a little too eager in our society to go off half ****ed.<br />
<br />
And Kullaas if you were bad mouthing something dear to me... I would turn around and provoke you into swinging first.. then I'd have full license to pop you one and YOU would be the one accountable for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, here's kinda where that came from...<br />
<br />
If memory serves, there was much more than just verbal abuse towards the 2 kids that shot everyone in CO.  All the the comments against Kullaas' opinion at this point seemed to be saying that they should just take it, because they couldn't do anything about it.  It just came off as, might makes right.  The jocks are the ones in social power in the school, therefore they should be able to harrass anyone they wish.<br />
<br />
Also, Tel's examples don't quite go far enough.  If you're going to use rape as an analogy, it should probably be closer to this...<br />
<br />
Woman dresses up like a cheap prostitue and COMPLETELY comes on to a man with suggestions, innuendos and heavy petting.<br />
<br />
Not that I condone proceeding once she says stop, but I'm pretty sure that current legal precidence has had situations like this come up and the HAVE greatly damaged the case of those claiming rape.<br />
<br />
I guess more than anything what I object to is this notion that environment has nothing to do with anything.  That has been proven to be wrong by social science for a long time.  And while I in NO WAY am suggesting that environment excuses the actions of anyone, to ignore the effects of environment only means that the same problems will happen time and time again.<br />
<br />
Mark my words, if things don't change in the environment at Columbine High, that shooting with not be the last.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly there are times where &quot;might&quot; does make right.<br />
<br />
There are points where simply all other options are exhausted and it comes down to combat to determine which way things will go.<br />
<br />
Its been like that for millions of years in the animal world and for thousands of years in the human world.  I doubt we will ever escape it.<br />
<br />
However in our society it is expected of the citizens to look into other methods of solving problems and not use violence as a quick fix.<br />
<br />
The Columbine shooters didn't even come close to exhausting their options in finding other ways to get around their problem.<br />
<br />
More over if they were being violently attacked by the jocks then they had every right to respond in defense at the time of the attacks but exacting revenge at a later date is completely unacceptable.<br />
<br />
More over if they were incapable of defending themselves then they should've presented the attacks to an authority who could do something about it.<br />
<br />
However from what I gathered most of the hazing those Columbine shooters took was in the form of verbal abuse.  They had SEVERAL options there not including violent retaliation.<br />
<br />
Firstly.. ignore the comments.<br />
Secondly respond with like comments (kindergarten name games are perfectly legal and non-violent)<br />
Thirdly report these hazing incidents to the teachers/admins and if they didn't do anything about it report it to their superiors and on up the chain if need be.<br />
<br />
There are even more options out there which I'm overlooking that didn't need to be violently executed.<br />
<br />
And before anybody says I don't &quot;get&quot; those kids, think again.  In highschool there was a high chance that I would've been dealing with them quite often as one of the crowds I hung out with at the time dressed the same, were into much the same kinds of things (computer games, loud neo-nazi music) and for all purposes could've been one of my closest friends.<br />
<br />
In highschool I was in a clique limbo due to my activities.  On the one hand I dressed in grunge, I was involved on the drug scene, and had connections to small time criminals, but on the other hand I had the jock's respect, the preps thought I was cool (wouldn't be Mr popularity but there was little doubt as to who I was) and the nerds saw me as a mental equal and all because I played soccer(and the one time I played a pick up football game I smashed through the defensive lines biggest guy to score a touchdown and he was out cold on the field), was able to talk about any of the popular topics the preps were discussing from politics(both US and school) to the latest crazes and fads and presented myself in class as very intelligent and blind to race, style, or other &quot;marking&quot; when I helped people with school projects.  In otherwords I was well rounded.<br />
<br />
NOSTALGIA ALERT<br />
Funniest group I lead in chemistry was me in my grunge, a Valley girl preppy, a football jock, a nerd(he was self proclaimed and wore a pocket protector), and Mr trenchcoat Satan worshipper(again self-proclaimed)... by the time we finished we had the best project and everyone got along great.<br />
<br />
That story right there along with probably thousands of other similar to it shows that just because there is a difference in style or life doesn't mean they can't coexist or even possibly cooperate to accomplish stuff.<br />
<br />
At any rate I'm meandering but my point is I'm all for violent action in self-defense and when EVERY other option has been exhausted but the shootings and other crap I've seen in schools doesn't fit either of those catagories and so I've got no sympathy for the attackers like those at Columbine.<br />
<br />
Also Aizle it doesn't matter if the hottest woman on Earth were running nude down the street rubbing up on every man she could find and planting big luvacious kisses on everyone... SHE DIDN&quot;T ASKED TO BE RAPED.  And as soon as she said &quot;NO&quot; to someone who tried then it is ENTIRELY the fault and liability of the rapist.</div></div><hr />

School administrators are typically old coaches or failed teachers, really not too surprising they'd hatch such an idiot policy. <br />
<br />
It's not so much the policy as it is the implimeentation of the policy. It tends to tar everyone with the same brush. This is diffferent than say the laws on stopping for a Blue Light. (Here in SC the cops cars have blue lights.)<br />
<br />
For example, you have a tail light out on your car. Driving along one night a cop turns his light on. You are out in the middle of nowhere. Now, according to the law, you are suipposed to pull over at the earliest opportunity. YET, if you are unsure thisa is actually the police  pulling you over, you can continue driving until you reach a well lighted, populated area.<br />
Now, if you opted for the second option, you cannot be ticketed for failure to stop IF you  are in that situation. but according to the Zero Tolerance policy you can. And with the policy, you have NO recourse. Period. The effect is immediate and for the most part final. Even WITH appeals to school boards, in some cases, its too late to get back into school and finish the year  to graduate because they take their time in getting to those appeals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taolil</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mmm, well, the reason why I posted an article from the Onion was to illustrate part of the problem. I'm not saying that it was the people bullying them that caused them to run off and shoot up their school. That's as silly as saying Marilyn Manson and Quake were what made them do it.<br />
<br />
No, what I was asking was, do you think that this zero tolerance policy should only be applicable to both guilty parties, and not just one. It takes two to tango, in other words.<br />
<br />
You do realize I typed 'as well' on there, meaning, not just the Klebold's of the world, but the A_Stupid_Jocks of the world, as well. Here's a good example of what I'm talking about. In my sophomore year in high school, there was this senior fellow who was all gothic and stuff. He wore a trench coat, had spikes and studs, wore Cure shirts, and so forth. Because he was different, he was a target of abuse for the more 'popular' people at my school. One of these people went as 'him' for Halloween...they got a black trench coat, and wore a monster mask.<br />
<br />
Anywho, near the end of the school year, there are some 'traditions' that occur. Silly things like stealing the condiment cart from the cafeteria or putting road signs around the principal's car. This year, however, they had decided to take this fellow and duct tape him to a bunch....about 30 or so people came up to him during lunch hour and physically hauled him to this bench and taped him down. And you know what? NOTHING happened to the people who did this to this fellow...he was completely blameless in what he did...he didn't provoke them, he didn't instigate anything, he didn't even dare them to try and do it, but they went, as aggressors, and did this thing to him. And not a damn thing happened. And yes, my school has/had a 'zero tolerance' policy. But these 'zero tolerance' policies tend to only go so far.<br />
<br />
But that's okay, because only kids who are 'different' than their peers are the ones who go on shooting rampages, and should be locked up, anyways, right?<br />
<br />
At any rate, I wasn't trying to assign blame to anyone regarding this. I didn't say that the reason why the Columbine kids went out and did what they did was because of the 'stupid jocks'. All I was asking is that if you would be willing to punish all of the guilty parties, not just the ones who look funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you're either missing my point, or just not addressing it Tel.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that anyone should have sympathy for those guys.  Quite frankly I don't have much, however I think that without at least attempting to empathise with their situation some, you can't learn from what happened.<br />
<br />
To be sure, they were unhinged.  Now, whether that was a factor of themselves, parenting, harrassment, whatever, no one really knows.<br />
<br />
BUT, the one thing that I DO know, is that if the powers that be take no action, and decide that this was a freak accident, cause by 2 deranged kids and don't attempt to look at the environment that they were in and the harrassment that they were put through, this will not be the last shooting.<br />
<br />
The reality of the whole Columbine fiasco is that it was a complete and total lack of ANY kind of adult intervention over a LONG period of time.<br />
<br />
One cannot realistically expect that clicks won't form, kids won't torment other kids and that there won't be outcasts.  However, it is the responsibility of those in positions of authority to look out for those situtation to attempt to provide what help they can where they can.<br />
<br />
What that means is:<br />
<br />
The parents need to be involved with their kids lives.  They need to see what they are doing, who they are hanging out with and what actions they are taking.  This goes for the popular kids just as much (if not more) than the outcasts.<br />
<br />
The administrators and teachers need to learn to watch for the warning signs and take seriously information that is brought to their attention.  I seem to recall that someone brought the &quot;hit list&quot; to the attention of the administration at Columbine a FULL YEAR before the shootings.  A little bit of extra work back then, could have avoided the whole mess.<br />
<br />
The police need to do their jobs.  Upon review of what happened there, I am nothing but appalled by the complete lack of leadership on the part of the senior officials of the law enforcement that responded to this event.  This whole mess went on FAR longer than it had to, and there were at least a couple people who died because of the ineptitude of law enforcement personell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then it seems we are in agreement with everything EXCEPT one point.<br />
<br />
Nobody needs to &quot;empathize&quot; with the aggressors to realize what caused the situation.<br />
<br />
They were out of control and it was obvious they were out of control and more over why they were out of control.<br />
<br />
I don't need to &quot;pretend&quot; to feel like them to figure out their mindset.  I know very well what their mindset was from the actions they took both during the killing and up to the killing.<br />
<br />
Yes their lives should be examined for future warning signs but the fact is by STATISTIC this kind of shooting is the exception and not the rule amongst highschool students.<br />
<br />
Firstly there are hundred even thousands of kids JUST like these two and yet they didn't pop a cork and kill people.<br />
<br />
More over if we are broader the types of shootings MOST prevailant in highschool violence IS NOT the wacko kids being picked on its the gang related murders over turf, drugs, and property.<br />
<br />
It just happens to be the media picks up on the wierd shooting cases and IGNORES the daily shootings occuring due to gang activity.<br />
<br />
So lets be straight here.  These are in fact ANOMALIES.  They are NOT the STANDARD form of violent behavior in schools and as such its ALWAYS going to be harder to stop that kind of thing as there doesn't seem to be ANY sort of definitive mold (even if the media would like you to think there is).<br />
<br />
So yes I agree parents need to be involved and aware and teachers and admins more involved and aware and police need to do their job though to be honest perhaps even more involved and aware would help here as stats seem to be showing that those schools with a more active police education program seem to be seeing much less of ALL undesirable elements.<br />
<br />
But to be honest we need to stop &quot;pretending&quot; to know what these types of people thought.  Its going to be near impossible because every situation is a little different and frankly when dealing with Psychopaths their reasoning is sometimes SO alien that we can't even comprehend the whys or hows because quite simply our brains don't operate in the same way theirs do... (actual physical scans of brains can be different for these folks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Albadia Fii</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to give my opinion on this. As background. I am 16, and attend a High School in the Eastern bay Area of california. My school district *does* have ZERO-Tolerance policy in tact.<br />
<br />
I have a few stories about things that have happened at my school.. that *I* personally have close knowledge of.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
My best friend Rick... great kid, 4.0 student from 5th grade till now, not a single problem ever. No disciplinary problems ever, no cuts, no absences, wasnt even tardy ever. Rick and I are chillin at lunch one day, he tells me hell be right back. <br />
<br />
Rick walks into the bathroom and i see smoke come out and smell weed. No big deal right? It happens all the time.  An office administrator comes out as Rick goes in and smells it, runs back in the office and gets the school cop for taht section of school.<br />
<br />
Rick is arrested on the spot, no questions ask. He was Expelled a few weeks later and now lives in Colorado. THAT is the zero tolerance rule.<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
4 weeks ago or so, my mom went to montery and got me a few shirts. These really cool ones. One had a 1/2 naked woman on the back (no nudity, just wearing a bikini), a CARTOONY woman mind you. The other one was black with white letters saying &quot;Thank you for not breeding&quot;.<br />
<br />
I wore the one with the woman on it and was called out of my second class. I was taken to the office and was told, that my shirt was pornographic, someone was offended, and i was being suspended for 3 days! THAT is Zero Tolerance.<br />
<br />
2 weeks ago I wore my other one. 'thank you for not breeding'. Once again, I was called into the office, given a tirade about offensive clothing, and suspended for 3 days.  THAT is Zero Tolerance.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Zero Tolerance is something people hide behind, it makes them feel safe. Its like the untrained half-wits carrying guns in california's airports. An M-16 (standard issue for the guards), is not a 'single target' gun. It puts a lot of lead, in a good bit of space. Youd be as likely to wipe out 15 - 50 people with it, as you would only who you were aiming at.<br />
<br />
Or those people who were scared to fly after 9/11. I wanted to deck every single one of those people. I mean how retarded are you eh? First off, you think there gonna do it again, now that were ehh... i guess you can call it prepared. No! There not stupid but you seem to be! This is the same case... idiots with guns are now something to hide behind. Something that does NO good, but makes people feel safe<br />

<br />
Your example one.  You are way too unclear.  The admin comes out of where as Rick goes in were?  If you mean the the admin came out of the bathroom as Rick went into it then the admin should have known Rick had nothing to do with it.  So Im hoping that is not what you meant.  The admin walks by as Rick came out of the bathroom and smelled the smoke?  Ok the admin SHOULD follow up on this.  You never said weither or not Rick was actually smoking pot.  Or weither pot was found on him.<br />
<br />
If he did not smoke pot and they could not prove it then what they did was illegal.  This is not the zero tolerance policy at fault here this is the school administrators fault for not properly enforcing the rules and the policy.  A good lawyer would easily prove this.  Remember zero tolerance means once a crime has been commited (proven) then equal and same punisment for all that commit it.  It is NOT a catch all addition to rules to incriminate someone.<br />
<br />
IF he WAS smoking pot and it was proven then it was a perfect example of how a zero tolerance policy SHOULD be enforced.  The rule, no pot (minor or otherwise) and he broke it.  So what if he has a 4.0.  You would think if he was that smart he would know better.<br />
<br />
This is the beauty of a zero tolerance policy.  Once people realize there are no second chances for stupid mistakes that should not be made.  They realize the it is in their best intrest NOT to break the rules.   No one should be thinking &quot;No big deal, it happens all the time right&quot; about a rule being broken. <br />
<br />
In your second example, Im willing to bet there is a rule at your school about not wearing clothing with &quot;sexually explicit material&quot;  To me, this includes half naked women and refences to sex (breeding).  You broke it.  You suffer the penalty.  <br />
<br />
Let me say that personally I find nothing wrong with the t-shirts you described.  Not even on a 16 year old.  HOWEVER, I can understand it offending some people and see no problem with a rule in a public school forbidding them.  When you are out of school wear em all you want, but while you are in school, follow the rules.<br />

<br />
Rick walked INTO the bathroom, to do his thing. As he walked out of the bathroom, smelling of smoke, and (Im guessing) having inhaled some of the smoke from the people that WERE smoking, the admin saw him, and 'caught' him.<br />
<br />
Rick was NOT smoking pot, he was not carrying anything illegal or such.<br />
<br />
Basically to me, zero tolerance is as much &quot;One Chance&quot; as &quot;If your in the wrong place, at the wrong time, your busted&quot;</div></div><hr />

While I do not think people who have commited the same crime should be punished differently because of GPA's and such once the person is found guilty, I do believe that character refrence CAN be used in the determination of guilt.<br />

Like rapist, murderers, and such.  Shouldn't the system keep them out of our streets?  If the system is willing to give a 2nd chance to criminals(some), why not give the same to the kids?  Equal rights, no?  Let them go back to the school and &quot;hope&quot; they get better?  I don't know much this kind of stuff.  Someone enlighten me, please?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rape and murder are very serious crimes, and the consequences can put you in jail for the rest of your life, or in some states the loss of your life. So some consideration must be given to those who are innocent as it is a very weighty matter, not like smoking pot in a bathroom.<br />
<br />
Zero tolerance doesn't prevent murders or other serious crimes, it's just to give peace of mind to those who implemented it so they feel as if they did &quot;something&quot;, and also to the public.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AHHHHHHHH!  Im going to pull out my hair! :D J/K<br />
<br />
This is my point all along.  The example that you are refering to IS a perfect example of what EXACTLY zero tolerance is.  The kids who committed the crime where punished equally, and the kids in the room who were smart enough to leave did not.<br />
<br />
AGAIN, zero tolerance is not about determining who committed the crime it is a way to ensure that those punished are all treated equally reguardless of other factors.<br />

No, more like the current MIS-implimentation of zero tolerance is a knee-jerk reaction to school shootings.<br />

Here is a good example of the Zero Tolerance policy at work<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Felony charges dropped against two Pensacola<br />
first-graders<br />
<br />
<br />
The Associated Press <br />
<br />
PENSACOLA, Fla. - Prosecutors have dropped felony charges against two<br />
first-graders arrested at separate schools last week after they were accused of<br />
kicking staff members.<br />
<br />
State Attorney Curtis Golden said the decision Wednesday to dismiss charges<br />
of battery on a school official were based on the students' ages, the lack of<br />
injuries, the children's intent and the fact that no weapons were involved.<br />
<br />
Golden said he could not comment on whether the 8-year-old girl and 7-year-old<br />
boy would face misdemeanor charges because that information is confidential.<br />
<br />
The decision follows outrage among some in the community over the arrests<br />
and worries by city officials that they hurt Pensacola's image.<br />
<br />
Both children were taken away in police cars. The girl was led away in<br />
handcuffs and the boy, although not cuffed, was shown being escorted by an<br />
officer on a television news broadcast.<br />
<br />
Golden said prosecutors planned to meet with police and school officials to<br />
discuss how such cases should be handled in the future.<br />
<br />
&quot;We would like to understand the schools' zero-tolerance against violence<br />
policy, and, secondly, we would like them to understand how we evaluate the<br />
cases when they come to us,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Pensacola Police Chief Jerry Potts said officers have little choice but to arrest<br />
students if school officials want to pursue charges under the 1996 law that<br />
made battery against school officials a felony. Battery against most other<br />
people is a misdemeanor.<br />
<br />
Potts said one alternative may be for officers to file reports without taking<br />
children into custody. He said the decision to use handcuffs depends on<br />
whether an officer believes a child is violent or could cause physical harm.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't like the idea, either,&quot; Potts said.<br />
<br />
Escambia County School Superintendent Jim Paul said it is up to principals to<br />
decide whether to call police but that should be done only as a last resort.<br />
School officials, however, cannot prohibit teachers or other staffers from<br />
pressing charges, he said.<br />

<br />
<br />
MOUNT LEBANON, Pennsylvania (AP) -- A Pennsylvania school suspended an 11-year-old girl for drawing two teachers with arrows through their heads, saying the stick figures were more death threat than doodle. <br />
<br />
Becca Johnson, an honor-roll sixth-grader at Mellon Middle School, drew the picture on the back of a vocabulary test on which she had gotten a D. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's my way of saying I'm angry,&quot; Becca said, adding she meant no harm to the teachers. <br />
<br />
The stick figures, on a crudely drawn gallows with arrows in their heads, had the names of Becca's teacher and a substitute teacher written underneath. Another teacher spotted the doodle in the girl's binder Tuesday and reported it, prompting the three-day suspension. <br />
<br />
Becca's parents, Philip and Barbara Johnson, denied the school's contention the drawings were &quot;terrorist threats.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She had done poorly on a test that was handed back to her. We've always told her that you can't take your feelings out on your teacher, so write about it or draw it, as a catharsis,&quot; Barbara Johnson said. <br />
<br />
She accused the school of applying a zero-tolerance policy that &quot;does away with due process and inflicts a penalty without a hearing or investigation.&quot; <br />
<br />
The district said its zero-tolerance policy applies only to gun or drug possession, and denied that no investigation was done. <br />
<br />
&quot;All I can say is that when we have taken action related to the activities of students in the schools, we have done so after a thorough investigation,&quot; Mount Lebanon School District Superintendent Glenn Smartschan said. <br />

Can you imagine wata would happen in todays Zero Tolerance society if a bunch of 3rd graders  sang this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was looking through my history books, and found a few things. for one, they never read my my rights... wonder if thats bad? hehe.  My parents don't care.  they say the school has all right to do so, even though they might make mixups, it will prevent another episode like colembine.  <br />

Oh Well...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 100% in favor of immediate suspensions and pending expulsions for certain offenses:<br />
<br />
1) Having a gun, or other item which is SOLELY for use as a weapon in school or on school grounds. I don't care if you &quot;accidentally&quot; left it in your pickup after hunting. Guns need to be controlled by their owners, and they have no place on school grounds. Switchblade knives, brass knuckles, swords - these are different from a 2&quot; pocket knife or a box cutter sitting in someone's car.<br />
<br />
2) Using, or threatening to use ANYTHING as a weapon on scool grounds. Having a pocket knife in the glove compartment of your car is NOT the same as having a weapon in school. Threatening to bludgeon a classmate with a baseball bat IS using a weapon in school.<br />
<br />
3) Posessing, using, or being under the influence of drugs on school grounds, or on school sponsored activites. I don't care if it's your first time, if you were &quot;planning to throw it away&quot; or what. Drugs=suspension. However, this includes only legally controlled substances. Passing out mints, lemon drops, or anything else that isn't actually illegal is not grounds for suspension, even if you pass them out saying &quot;It's going to get you high.&quot; It DOES include &quot;huffing&quot; of non-controlled substances, such as spray paint.<br />
<br />
4) Posessing, using, or being under the influence of alcohol on school grounds, or on school sponsored activites. This doesn't include any non-alcoholic beverage masquerading as alcohol. If you give someone grape kool-aid and say it's wine that doesn't make it wine, unless you think you're Christ. Then you have a whole OTHER set of problems to deal with.<br />
<br />
5) Anyone attempting to turn in any of the above items to an administrator or teacher should be given automatic immunity from the item being turned in. Don't tell a child &quot;if you find a knife, give it to a teacher&quot; and then suspend that same child for posessing a knife.<br />
<br />
If zero-tolerance were followed with a little common-sense it would be a fine policy. However, in reality, it's just an excuse to punish anyone and everyone with no due process, and assumption of guilt rather than the assumption of innocence our constitution gurantees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ven Dragnborn</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Therrrrein lis the crux of the matter Myrea. The courts have aready ruled that stidents do NOT have the rights granted by the constitution.<br />
They are not allowed due process. Once these decisions are made, they are final. No reprieve. No suspended sentence. No pardon. And even when &quot;mistakes&quot; are made, the effect is immediate and damning AND detrimental to the affected student. <br />
Due to the fact that  the wheels of &quot;school justice&quot;  grind fast yet the appeals process  grinds exceedingly slow. The child misses the classes/days legislated   to be mandatory,  yet  when the punishment is meted out, they fail the year for being expelled/suspended, even when they are innocent.<br />
<br />
And the little ditty I posted we ALL sang  years ago?????? Can you say &quot;Terrorist threat&quot;????? Felony? Arrest record at 8 years old?</div></div><hr />
