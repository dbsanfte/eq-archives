<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From Rashere on the Guild Summit Boards:<br />
<br />
Later today, we'll be pushing out a patch for Tacvi to all live servers. Although this patch will only affect a small portion of the audience for EverQuest, those that are affected have been waiting eagerly for it so I wanted to run through the changes that you'll notice and talk briefly about what is coming in the near future for that zone.<br />
<br />
First, I believe that I've located and corrected the problem that was sometimes causing a crash in the first event in Tacvi. I've run through the event for many hours now both by myself and with the aid of a testing guild and the zone has remained stable throughout.<br />
<br />
Second, some tuning changes have been made to the bosses of Tacvi, so some things may work slightly differently than before. Although the encounters themselves haven't changed in any major fashion, don't assume that tactics you've ruled out in the past still won't work.<br />
<br />
Finally, I've laid the groundwork for a change to how the zone works. Although this is the least noticeable of the changes, it's also the biggest. Tacvi currently works like other dynamic raid zones. Players gain lockout times based on their accomplishments in the zone. I'm in the process of changing Tacvi so that it will remember which bosses you have killed recently. Then, the next time you start up the dynamic zone, the zone will only spawn those NPCs that would have respawned since you last killed them. This will negate the need for lockout timers in Tacvi. The code to support this change is brand new and doesn't exist on live servers yet, so this change must wait until the next full patch to EverQuest before it can go in. In the meantime, the most noticeable difference you'll see is that all of the bosses in Tacvi are now up as soon as the zone spawns.<br />
<br />
Although I'd normally rather wait until all the changes are all done before pushing the zone out, I'm pushing out these first changes now because I know how eager people are for the changes to the initial encounters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow I like that last change to make it so only bosses that would be respawned would be up instead of completely locking you out. I guess they want a guild to finish this expansion before the next one is rolled out.</div></div><hr />

Well enough guilds are there. Time to remove the roadblock before more quit and go to Wow.<br />
<br />
Yeah the &quot;We care&quot; sign is still out front.<br />
<br />
Maybe they should actually task a few developers to have the last expansion done before Moving everyone to get the new one out. <br />

Does anyone still belive the Summit was anything more that a stopgap delaying measure with copious amounts of Smoke applied to posteriors?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Grizlor, Considering how requested it was at the summit that the instance Potime and that would probably the first major requirement for instancing time I'd be willing to bet money that is what they wrote it for in the first place and there are good odds time will go instanced with the next patch or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hah, can they instance Corniav too while they are at it ? /grumbles ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Though many are clamoring for a similar thing in time, i doubt it was intended for that.  When you think about the time scale sony has for fixing content, it'll go live in a big way around the time oow comes out.  And when you think about it, you'll have all these time guilds who aren't clamoring for time anymore, but they'll all be fighting for the same basic content once oow comes out.  If you're expecting a ****storm, expect it then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I expect there to be more competition for Time by the time OoW is released as more and more guilds progress through the elementals. Currently on my server, we just had two more guilds kill RZ and hit the elementals. <br />
<br />
Since Time is such a candy-land place to equip people quickly, everyone's going to want a nice stretch of farming. I would expect there would be 10+ Time capable guilds on my server fairly soon, instancing would be very welcome.</div></div><hr />

Start thinking now of Time like you think of Vex Thal.  Those guilds you never thought you'd see farming Time will be soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Definitely - new levels, new spells and new AAs will open up content to a broader range of players (as it should).<br />
<br />
Rathe Council still going to suck, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not when you can zerg it with 120+ people if you want.  Not being an instanced zone you can take as many people there as you want.   It becomes pretty trivial when you have 80+ people.</div></div><hr />

Equally, guilds that are now in the elementals or below will be looking at skipping Time just the same as NToV level guilds looked at skipping VT to get to Time.  Most Elemental+ guilds don't list VT key as a recruiting requirement.  I'll give it 6 months after OoW goes live that Elemental Flag is not a requirement to most guilds because they can gear recruits as they pass through GoD and OoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We dont bother with any flagging requirements at this point.  If the player is skilled and meets our play time we flag em.  GoD was actually an improvement for back flagging new members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I agree.  While it could use some tweaks, GoD is much easier on the back flags than PoP was.   I wish they would add the 15% rule to GoD though.  I really hate seeing that new recruit or two sitting out on raids till we get around to backflagging them in Ikkinz/Uqua.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This patch will be welcom. We just killed High Priest in Txevu which drops the key to Zun Muram, and we have tried Zun Muram once. It is nice that they changed this. A couple times we all crashed in Inktu'ta, which if you don't know, gives you a 2 hour lockout timer just for getting the instance. This was put in i think incase you crash from a Tacvi event and cant get back in because of lockout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Equally, guilds that are now in the elementals or below will be looking at skipping Time just the same as NToV level guilds looked at skipping VT to get to Time <br />
<br />
I dont think you will see this.  Time has too much loot, far more than was ever available in VT.  The most annoying thing about VT was the farming key pieces which was not something that could really be done as a guild.  You can not advance in GoD without Time geared characters.  The new expansion may change that with increased levels and more spells but I think it will mainly just make getting to Time all the more easier, bringing even more guilds into it.  Though like VT the top end guilds will stop raiding Time all together leaving more room for those new guilds.  Though I hope we can see instancing in Time like in many GoD raid zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Zone is still crashing as of 1/8/04.  I suggest they go back and try again.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hasn't been crashing for us.</div></div><hr />
