<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can't believe I'm posting this.  I'm actually considering a return to EQ.  DAoC was my game until their last expansion where it became a grind worse than EQ could ever hope to be.  I figure if I'm going to be forced into an annoying PvE grind (I like PvP best), it may as well be in the game that does PvE right.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is what I'm thinking and was hoping you folks could give me some direction based on the following:<br />
<br />
- I MUST be able to solo exp on my own.<br />
- I want to be handy when I group with my friends in singl groups<br />
- I would like to be useful on a raid<br />
- I will likely never be uber so I don't want a heavily gear dependant class (IE, melee classes are pretty much out of the question).<br />
<br />
I know... tall order.  My thoughts were that the two classes most viable for the above would be Enchanter and Shaman.  I've been away from EQ since about a week before the release of PoP (the idea of leveling more just turned my stomach).  I just want to relax and enjoy the ride this time and be somewhat useful at the high end game if I ever find myself there.  I like to solo or group with good friends, but since I don't make many friends online I'll be soloing quite a bit.<br />
<br />
With all of that in mind, what would guys you suggest?  I have no idea what the 'pecking order' of classes are these days in a group or raid setting.  Thanks in advance for your advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>RPZip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well... you probably were expecting this, but here it goes anyway.<br />
<br />
- I MUST be able to solo exp on my own.<br />
Classes that come to mind are Shamans and Necros from here. Both can solo quite well, with Necros coming out on top here.<br />
<br />
- I want to be handy when I group with my friends in singl groups<br />
And this is where Necros start to be more lacking. Shamans are much more useful in groups as a rule.<br />
<br />
- I would like to be useful on a raid<br />
Hello, Slow! Hello, Debuff! Hello, Melee Buffs!<br />
- I will likely never be uber so I don't want a heavily gear dependant class (IE, melee classes are pretty much out of the question).<br />
Shamans can operate quite well without much in the way of twinkage, as can necros.<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly what kind of answer you wanted, posting on a Shammy board, but Shaman fits what you're looking for quite well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman of course!.<br />
Bard fits the bill if you can handle the twisting. <br />
Necro less guild doesnt use them than can be ZZZzzzon raids. <br />
Chanter if your willing to go the whole 9 and use your charms and self rune spells else they can be quite boring. <br />
Druid if you can handle being one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You got away.. do your self a favor and stay away =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok, I just became a shammy, so I wam not as beholden to the class as some might be on these boards, but I really do think they are what you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Druids can solo really well on gear bought in the bazaar for very little plat, and with their heals, they can group well at the high end game.  But I played a druid to the mid 50's and between 34 and 58, druids grouping abilities suck.  They just don't add much to the fray. on raids, they can be added to a c-heal chain, so they can be kinda useful, but certainly not much fun on raids.<br />
<br />
Necros are the obvious solo champs, but don't get invited to groups much.  you could help a bit in groups, but nothing that's going to really bump group dynamics.<br />
<br />
Shamans can solo pretty damn good after 34 when they get their first pet (but soloing to 34 is a little tedious.  still can be done though).  Gear helps, but is not a pivital role like some other classes.  But the main problem with shammys is the spells at the high end start costing a TON of pp.  As far as groupage goes, they have infinate ways to add to the group.<br />
<br />
I don't know too much about bards, but they might be the next closest thing to what you're looking for here.  They absolutely kick ass in pvp, can get insane exp soloing if you get good a swarm kiting, and always have ways to add to a group (especially in group pvp situations).  The obvious problem with bards is that they are a high-twitch class, and carpel tunnel is an common side effect with the class.  That and I believe gear might be a little more important for them as they move on... not too sure though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Druid also fits your criteria.  It all depends on your playstyle, druid is more of a classic caster type, may even be less gear dependant.<br />
<br />
The important thing is to play what you would have most fun with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You got away.. do your self a favor and stay away =p<br />
<br />
amen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You got away.. do your self a favor and stay away =p<br />
<br />
Agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">BST is another choice,they are less dependant on gear than other melees,can solo 1-65 w/o any problem,groups like them and they are useful on raids for SD and MGB paragon mainly.<br />
<br />
Necros aren't as bad as they used to be,in LDoN they make a good addition as a DD/support class in groups.Every guilds need a few necros and they are very good to solo.<br />
<br />
Druids aren't that bad,but they really shine at higher levels only,but that's where the game starts to be fun and where you will end up spending most of your time.<br />
<br />
Bards are great,for everything really.Skills are required and it's alot more &quot;work&quot; than any other classes,still would surely be a class I would like to play the most after shaman.<br />
<br />
And shamans,good all around.I wouldn't know where to start trying to explain why I love that class.Think it's the pride I have for being required on raids,loved in groups and the ability to solo whenever I want.Maybe not as good as other classes (for XP) but I can if I want.<br />
<br />
These chars are all very different,it's up to you to know what you like the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would say Shaman, Druid, or Necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally I would say just stay away and wait for EQ2 instead. You're gonna end up wrapping too much money in to eq just to get back into the game. You're missing 3 expansions and 4th due out I would guess between Feb and May. Starting over you're gonna be so far behind and after a while you're gonna get sick of not having the good high end stuff and not gonna be able to get ti cause you cant get into a guild that can handle these places cause they arent recruiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zooce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bleh - don't listen to any of them. There's no telling how popular EQ2 will be, and one thing's for sure, EQ isn't going anywhere for a long time.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo - If you can't get good gear, you want to solo and be very useful in groups, and basically be pretty Uber as a naked toon, I would go Bard. Just the speed of movement alone is almost enough!!<br />
<br />
If you don't like Bards (I would try them though, don't discount!) then Beastlord, pretty close.<br />
<br />
Shaman would be my third if I understand your wishes....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Beastlord sounds like it fits your criteria.   Incredible soloers (as early as level 15  -   easy to solo up to 15,  but thats when you get your pets' first proc buff)<br />
<br />
Also greatly liked in groups.  DPS,  weaker shaman utility (but still useful enough), and at higher levels, mana and health regen spells that stack with everything.<br />
<br />
Useful in raids as DPS as well as dispensing said mana/health regen buffs.  <br />
<br />
And well, I played one very easily somewhat high level before changing to a Shaman.  They are very easy even without high-quality gear, at least to the point I got mine to.  They are a little more gear dependant then the others, except shaman.<br />
<br />
/<br />
<br />
Necros are great for most of the same reasons, too.   Not as much usefulness in raids or groups,  better at soloing and gear (not as reliant).  The most efficient soloer until you match them with a shaman who has the Canabalize AA (so i hear).<br />
<br />
/<br />
<br />
Druids solo well, but have poor group benefits until the higher levels.  They get the better heals of the big solo classes.  You mostly kite though - not that it isn't powerful.  But a beastlord (and shaman) can beat a monster up in one position without having to resort to kiting or fear tactics.   Fairly good and not reliant on gear - your melee is going to suck and your defense is terrible anyway, you might as well act like the caster you are and stop pretending your a shaman. :)<br />
<br />
/<br />
<br />
Ah, the Shaman.  My favorite,  followed by the beastlord.  Because i dont like to run around like a scared kitten whenever something ugly pops into view.<br />
<br />
Great soloers - even before you get your best helping spells, you have a great offense/defense, and armor choices to help you thug it out in a truely brutal fashion.  I've been keeping piercing and 2h blunt maxxed.  (Hard enough to manage that each level so i dont use 1h blunt often.)<br />
<br />
GREAT group utility.  Buffs galore.  After stat buffs become less wanted, because everyone has the stats capped, there are other buffs to help everyone out that can be used.  And as always, slow!  Which is your best group, and your best solo tool.  <br />
<br />
Great in a raid.  Slow is even more critical in a raid.  Expect to do a lot of buffing, but shaman are considered a very important part of most raids.  Other classes can slow too - but other classes are busy doing what those other classes can do as well.  Why stress out the enchanter?  Hes got a big enough job as it is.<br />
<br />
As for equipment?  Well, thats the downside.  For me, I melee alot when I solo (To keep offense, defense, piercing, 2h blunt, etc maxxed each level), so that means you're going to have to have good armor, and a decent weapon.  Your dots wont do all of the work unless you are really that squemish about fighting.  And our pet?  Well, he tries...  :D<br />
<br />
Not to mention spell costs will take up a fair chunk of platinum, especially higher end spells like Torpor and Malo.  VERY expensive on almost every server people talk about.<br />
<br />
That is at the highest end, though.  Until then things aren't so bad, except equipment.  Buying spells from the store isn't too bad as long as you make a point of getting cash every so often between circles.<br />
<br />
This being a shaman message board, I think my number 1 rank is obvious. :)  I think it's worth the effort.  <br />
<br />
2 would be necromancer, personally.  So much easier to solo during the start - your mad mana regen capabilities begin at a much earlier level.  And lets face it - you may not have group utility, but you do have DPS - and that helps every group.  Vague heals make you a passable patch healer, or dire emergency healer.  <br />
<br />
3.  Beastlord.  Like a shaman, only buttery.  That made no sense, but you must admit, it's oddly compelling.  Having a GREAT pet that rivels a Mages pet (there are so many discussions about whose is better, that it's easy to see that it's close, no matter which way people inevitably tip the coin)    You get heals like a hybrid, which help for downtime.  Your pet-only heal is more efficient then a clerics' for a LONG time.  You can either tank with your pet, or play pet cleric (as long as mana holds up) so there is a little variety there.  Great utility in a group or raid, and at higher levels with some of your specialty buffs , even if theres a shaman in the group/raid already.<br />
<br />
4.  Druids.  I dont know as much about them, except that last I knew, a friend of mine had soloed theirs up to 60.  It is possible, though i dont know exactly how.  Best heals, better then a shamans (our Heal Over Time line not included.  Outside a cleric, they have the best straight up heal.  Very good buffs with hp/ac,  and they can give mana regen at higher levels.  Their group and raid usefulness scales up, basically.<br />
<br />
Now, I know many other classes can solo good.  Maybe even great.  Maybe even better then some that i listed.  Enchanters, wizards, and especially bards I hear alot about.  But i dont know about any of those classes, so i will leave it to someone else.  I do know that if you play a bard, you will be in wrist braces before too long.  Even sooner if you are a male playing a female wood elf for reasons which I will not go into on a public forum.   <br />
<br />
So there ya go.  It's not comprehensive, but if it's wrong, it's at least wildly wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">- I MUST be able to solo exp on my own.<br />
<br />
Well, ALL classes can solo, some are just better at it. Shaman aren't the most efficient soloers, but we have great staying power. Mages and Necros do damn good, and a well-trained Beastlord can grind damn near anything into the ground. Druids, Wizards, and Shadow Knights also have solo ability, with SK's limping last in line (VERY gear-dependant, but on hte bright side, it's rather cheap gear)<br />
<br />
- I want to be handy when I group with my friends in singl groups<br />
<br />
Handy how? Since you're posting on a Shaman board, I assume you want examples of Shaman handiness? Slow, Debuffs, haste, buffs, crowd control (Root - Learn it, love it, live it), and even some off-tanking ability in exp groups.<br />
<br />
For other classes, the most group-friendly is probably a cleric, though rogue comes in there, too. Maximum sustainable DPS, and you can easily get great backstabs with a Slime Coated Harpoon and levels.<br />
<br />
- I would like to be useful on a raid<br />
<br />
Well, that's where the shine of Shaman tarnishes. On a raid, more than three Shaman means that a bear is going to be pretending to be a level 40 wizard or a level 12 monk. Shaman are great on raids, provided you're the highest-leveled one there.<br />
<br />
For other classes, I would say Druids and Clerics for big heals, and Druids, Wizards, Mages, and rogues for raw DPS. There's only going to be one tank, and it's not likely to be you, so might as well do damage with a class focused towards that.<br />
<br />
- I will likely never be uber so I don't want a heavily gear dependant class (IE, melee classes are pretty much out of the question).<br />
<br />
Shaman are without a doubt, the most gear-dependant casters in the game. Just dig through the Equipment forum - Most people couldn't imagine a life of poverty without a Fungi, JBB, and REIF at the VERY least. It's a long, hard struggle to get a Shaman geared up respectfully without funds, particularly because every good Shaman item is severely gouged on all servers. And don't even get me started on spells.<br />
<br />
Int casters are very easy to equip. Most decent robes run arouns 100pp, and +int items are all over the damn place. The tricky thing is with Necros and Enchanters, you want HP, too, so they can get fairly expensive. They're also more popular than Mages and Wizards, so good ench / necro gear is a little scarecer.<br />
<br />
Druids are easy as pie to equip, and so are Clerics. I know clerics who, at 60, are still wearing Bloodtained Tunics. Why? It's +4 wis and they never get hit anyway. For a cleric, just make a high elf, slap on some cheap wisdom crap, and you're set.<br />
<br />
Monks and Beastlords are VERY easy to equip, until you look at weapons. There are no good and cheap h2h weapons aside from Polished Steel Ulaks (Sack Full of Rocks is good for Beastlords, too), and the fast delay weapons are also expensive. But, since their fists are just as good, you can skip a bit.<br />
<br />
Rogues are maybe the easiest melee class to gear up. A set of Ry'Gorr, and a Crystaline Spider Fang, with a few little bits of HP and AC here and there, and you'll be the top of your game until planes.<br />
<br />
Knights are interesting, almost the exact opposie of Monks and Beastlords. Their knight-only weapons and sheilds are simply amazing, and they're cheap as hell, too. However, their armor is pretty expensive, If you wanted, you could make do with bronze or some cheap knock-off armors, though.<br />
<br />
Warriors and Rangers... Don't bother. Just don't.<br />
<br />
Frankly, there's no one class that fully covers what you want, though Enchanter comes close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wouldn't say the shaman is extremely gear dependant at all, just shaman have more options for twinking than most classes.<br />
<br />
Not everyone has the luxury of wearing a jbb, and I never got my fungi until 59 (Which promptly got replaced with a psc once I dinged 60).  Reif is a fun toy but its not exactly class defining gear imho.<br />
<br />
But yeah, enchanters and necros tend to be very gear independant, enchanters can just throw themselves some JC gear together nice and cheap and just upgrade as funds come in.  Necros can pretty much solo 1 to 60 naked no problem.<br />
<br />
Melees these days are very gear dependant although bst and bards are the exception to that really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My suggestions would be bard or shaman. <br />
<br />
Bard has ALWAYS shined massively in 6 person exp groups. You can fill so many roles. You are the best soloist in the game at many levels (but not all, unless you get certain items). One decent FT item makes you the best soloist to 60+ if you learn to swarm kite - and you could be virtually naked otherwise. Raid Value is quite good, especially for smaller raids. The downside is the constant effort required to play a bard. Back when I used to solo my bard sometimes, the only breaks were when I stopped because I wanted to rest in RL, not because my bard needed downtime. The main question with a bard - do you WANT to be frenetically busy whenever you're solo'ing, and not that much less when in an exp group and trying to play at high efficiency? If you want a more relaxed experience  don't play a bard. You are somewhat equipment dependent, but not hugely. I would never want to play a L 55+ bard without his epic, but the bard epic is not all THAT hard any more, like it was back in the day when Trakanon was an uber raid.  Other than that, equipment helps a bard, but doesn't really affect his ability to fill his role all that much. <br />
<br />
My other suggestion would be shaman, if you want to be a caster type. You can do everything pretty well, and are good at solo'ing, good in a group, good on raids. You aren't the BEST class in any of those categories, but you're good at all of them. And gear isn't a very high priority. The primary downside of the shaman vs the bard is that you'll have a lot more downtime with the shaman, especially early on. <br />
<br />
I'd avoid enchanter. They don't solo well at all, IMHO, until very high level. If you want a CC class that can solo at any level, it's shaman or bard, depending on your preferences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gear makes or breaks the character in any somewhat difficult fight.  Try another game.  AC, HP, mana, fizzle rate, max damage, proc rate, and carrying capacity are all determined directly or indirectly by your gear.  Buffs can help, but not overcome deficiencies at 50+.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">- I MUST be able to solo exp on my own.<br />
So I rank solo ability in exp vs time.  Down time needs to be factored in to this as well.  I would rank the classes that really are good a soling in this order: Bard, Necro, Druid / BL, Shaman (ignoring enchanters because they can be hopeless soloers or gods)<br />
- I want to be handy when I group with my friends in singl groups<br />
This goes to need, most groups need a healer, tank, crowd-control, slower then dps.  Usually they only want 3 members to be utility and 3 for dps.  Shaman really fall only into slower category and here is their problem there are 3 other needs of the group that still need to be filled so a shaman takes the slot of a dps in exchange for slow.  All the other slower classes fit into 2 categories (enchanter - slow / cc, bard - slow / cc, bl - slow / dps)  <br />
In this category I would rank the classes list above as follows: Bard, BL, Necro, Shaman, Druid<br />
- I would like to be useful on a raid<br />
Here is where the shaman shine, but not a lot of shaman are needed.  <br />
Ranking: Shaman / Bard, Necro, Bl / Druid<br />
- I will likely never be uber so I don't want a heavily gear dependant class (IE, melee classes are pretty much out of the question).<br />
This one is the tricky one because gear speeds up soloing on all classes, shaman are very gear dependant.  They slow the mob, tank it while their pet and other dots eat it up.  Shaman also need hit points to regain their mana efficiently.<br />
I would rank the classes as being the least gear dependant to solo as:  Bard, Necro / Druid, BL, Shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I knew a bard who soloed Sergeant Slate naked before Luclin was even announced. I'd say that rates as pretty gear-independant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">- I MUST be able to solo exp on my own.<br />

Well, ALL classes can solo, some are just better at it. Shaman aren't the most efficient soloers, but we have great staying power. Mages and Necros do damn good, and a well-trained Beastlord can grind damn near anything into the ground. Druids, Wizards, and Shadow Knights also have solo ability, with SK's limping last in line (VERY gear-dependant, but on hte bright side, it's rather cheap gear)<br />
<br />
<br />
Although they are good soloers, most mages soloing ability ends in the high 50s, and is partially regained in bot elemental charm kiting. Although it can be done, I'm pretty sure that someone wont want to kill light blues/low dbs all day to make it through the high 50s, early 60s. Necros can do it all the way with killing undead.<br />
<br />
classes that can effectively solo to 65= shaman, bard, druid, wizard, enchanter, beastlord and necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Try a bard.  Bards can solo exp better than any other class... there are lots of toys for equipment but they are the least equipment dependant class in the game... great raid and group functionality.<br />
<br />
The downsides - you never get a break from twisting and running around, your chat will be crippled unless you use something like Teamspeak, the class is pretty complex and requires a fair amount of homework if you want to be any good, and you will probably end up with carpal tunnel syndrome or RSI quickly if you're anything like me. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Solo:<br />
<br />
Shaman can do it, but its not super efficient. Necros have better DPS, more mana efficiency, better mana regen and a much better pet. Necro utility abilities own all. Druids rank 2nd for soloing on my list. They dependent on external mana regen, but are excellent root/rotters and quad kiting works well. Beastlords get a great pet and good melee ability. They get limited inate mana regen. All in all, they are great solo classes.<br />
<br />
Group:<br />
<br />
shaman (slow/buff), beast (slow/dps), druid (heal/buff/CC), necro (dps, CC, manaregen). Most of the time groups want slowers so shaman are good here. Druids, excellent primary healers at high levels for an exp group. <br />
<br />
Raid: <br />
<br />
Everyone wants slow for raids, but its semi unstackable. Other shaman skills are pre-raid buffing etc. High level shaman heals are not bad (Quiessence in particular). Druids get the short stick for raiding because there are so many of them, but they heal very well and have sought after buffs. Druids on full burn do respectable dps. Necros are pure dps: dot and FD, dot and FD, chain neurotoxin. Same for beast, mostly DPS with some buffage (paragon AA rocks). <br />
<br />
My experience makes me think a necro is least item dependent. Druids are next in terms of gear dependency, but they do need as much FT as possible. Beast being melee need some nice stuff. Shaman seem very very cost intensive to me. First shaman gear is expensive, second shaman spells seem to be much more expensive than other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Good necros own in groups.  Most people don't know that, however so I imagine it is not as easy to play the pick up group game as a necro as it is as a shamam.  However, since you said you'll be mostly playing with friends, that won't be an issue.  It would help us give you better advice if you told us what your friends are playing.<br />
<br />
Don't underestimate bards.  They *obliterate* everyone else in untwinked soloing and have some nifty tricks that make them very  very useful both for groups and for raids.  It is a lot of clicking though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tetrass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Honestly I think from the original post that a shaman is your best choice.  I know at least one enchanter who solo'd exclusively from 1 - 56 and mainly duo'd until 65 + all AAs, but that's the exception not the rule.  <br />
<br />
I really don't know much about playing a bard other than these two things: they are labor intensive and very dependent on the skill of the player.  Well played bards rock! (lol, I love puns.)  The only thing I'd worry about is that they are a melee and as such are inherently more gear dependent than a caster.<br />
<br />
I hate to get behind supporting the creation of another druid but I think that may be a very good choice.  They solo well, group well and can fill a number of rolls on raids.  Low power in groups between mid 30's until 58 has been mentioned but I don't think it's really that bad.  Whatever though, druids seem to be able to solo well enough to make it past 58 pretty fast anyways.<br />
<br />
Others have mentioned it and I have to get behind them as it's a personal favorite:  Necromancer.  If you expect to spend a lot of time soloing I really believe this is one of the best choices you can make.  Any class will perform better with more and better equipment, but nobody can do without it like a necro.  Everything I'd say in regards to how they fit in a group or raid has already been said so I'll just add this:  the biggest problem that necromancers suffer is that most players really don't understand the variety of things they can do.<br />
<br />
Beastlord also would appear to be a decent choice as they solo well and group well and are desired for raids.  I have very limited experience playing one, however I must admit I generally like having them around.  Just like a bard though, melee inherently are more gear dependent.  There's just no way around that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Beastlord is what you want -- At many levels they can solo TWICE as well as a shaman can.  BLs are also HIGHLY desired in LDON which is likely where your little grouping forays will be.  <br />
<br />
Bard is ok if you can do it well.  It is certainly a different experience than other classes.</div></div><hr />

you can kill stuff naked that others can't kill with their full equip on.<br />
you can mgb dmf your raid :p<br />
groups love you for mind wrack and zevfeer's later on, along with your dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, ALL classes can solo, some are just better at it. Shaman aren't the most efficient soloers, but we have great staying power. Mages and Necros do damn good, and a well-trained Beastlord can grind damn near anything into the ground. Druids, Wizards, and Shadow Knights also have solo ability, with SK's limping last in line (VERY gear-dependant, but on hte bright side, it's rather cheap gear)<br />

- I would like to be useful on a raid<br />
<br />
Well, that's where the shine of Shaman tarnishes. On a raid, more than three Shaman means that a bear is going to be pretending to be a level 40 wizard or a level 12 monk. Shaman are great on raids, provided you're the highest-leveled one there.<br />
<br />
LOL<br />

Warriors and Rangers... Don't bother. Just don't.<br />

Ok, I gotta step in and defend Rangers here just a bit.  They can solo from 1 - 65 if they like and stack fairly well on raids.  There's a lot to be said for doing Rogue-like DPS while having virtually no chance taking DMG, even if it does take 59 levels +45 AAs to do it.<br />
<br />
I'll go along with the don't bother advice though, as there are simply too many rangers running around already.</div></div><hr />
