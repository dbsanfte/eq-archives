<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I noticed with the last patch, the Boots of the Vindicator were changed. They were previously a silver, original non-velious texture, pretty much looking like fine plate. Now, they seem to be a dull gold/brown color. Any chance we could get these changed back? One of the reasons that I wanted these boots was for the plain look they had along with great stats. I miss my old boots! <br />
We changed the look of a few items with the last patch. While your preference obviously would be that this particular item remain as it was, we thought it better that it look a little more unique. A few other items were cosmetically changed as well. <br />
<br />
In the long run, we understand that it's just as likely that people will prefer the old graphic as it is that they will like the new one. I think the old saying goes something like this: I don't know art, but I know what I like. We have to go with our instincts on this sort of thing. <br />

What else changed?  Did the BP that Rizz and Waran change as well?  Can't wait to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes...the vindi BP look changed...looks like dark PoG armor I believe...I know I've seen it on people as a BP from DN (can't remember if it's phase spider or something else) only the vindi is darker...like someone did a black inkwash over it.</div></div><hr />
