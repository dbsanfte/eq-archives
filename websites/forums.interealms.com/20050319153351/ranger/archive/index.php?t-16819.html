<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azen</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should be level 46 before the summer starts, at which time I will want to explore Planes of Power and other Planes. I need a guide on most of the Planes that are EXP - able starting from lowest to highest. I need to know what to fight, where at, what the drop, what sells, what doesn't, etc ... also the guide will need to be for a Ranger. I know I am asking a lot but I am sure someone is willing to help me. thanks a lot in advance =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmace</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Though being 46 would allow you access to PoP combat zones, you will be completely vulnerable and unprepared for the monsters there.  Once you reach level 46, I reccomend you participate in some old-world planar raids, i.e. Hate and Fear.  With strong backing, you could begin to do Tier 1 PoP zones in the low 50's, but it's really hard to be effective there until say 54ish.  For pickup groups, I think it would be difficult to get a group (as a ranger) being less than 56 or so.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to discourage you, it's just that PoP is geared towards higher end stuffs.  Keep levelin, you'll get there soon!</div></div><hr />
