<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks,<br />
<br />
This is a bit of and odd question, but my guild is running a Mountaineering competition, the aim is to climb the highest object in all of Norath, take a /loc and post a screenshot, and the highest Z-axis figure will win.<br />
<br />
The opening entrant is one of the buildings in the Plane of Knowledge, but not the main library, so I will be trying the Library first, but which zone in all of EverQuest has the biggest Z-axis ? Where are the tallest cliff faces ? Which buildings are on top of big hills ?<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest other likely zones/objects to try ?<br />
<br />
Does one have any climbing techniques to shre, other than Levitate and bear form ?</div></div><hr />

I've fallen off before and it takes a LONG time before you hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For climbing techniques gflux may be helpful depending on the wall, if you are allowed casting and working together with other guildies.<br />

Mind to share under SPOILER  ;) , what the result was?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There is a Peak in Frontier Mountains that's pretty darn Tall...    if you get to the top of it.. it's just a 1 foot by 1 foot peak with a ground spawn on top of it...Glob of Slush Water or something like that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">for things that you cannot climb with levitate...<br />
<br />
get 2 shields. <br />
drop one on the ground.<br />
drop the other on the ground in the exact same spot. (they should 'sit' on top of one another. works only with a couple kinds)<br />
climb up onto them.<br />
look straight down and carefully pick up the bottom shield.<br />
drop it. <br />
repeat.<br />
<br />
you will 'climb' and as long as you don't fall off, you can get on top of almost anything. do this process as close as possible to whatever object you want to climb. when you get above it, levi yourself and walk over.<br />
<br />
shields that I know work are from nathan's guards in katta. they're lore, so take a friend to go get a couple.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

If the entrance to Kael is a 0 on the Z axis (I have no idea if it is or not), normal ground level would be pretty high.  Go climb a hill or two and you may have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Try Statue climbing as well! <br />
<br />
That dorf is a fun in ButcherBlock.  There is one in everfrost too next to the icy orcs.  I have dreamed of climbing up the FV statue as well.<br />
<br />
Oh and dont forget to take your group naked cliff jumping while in FV.  Head to the cliffs on your right as you exit town.  Strip nakey.  Take a running sow'd but not levitated run and JUMP OFF!  You should avoid walls and rocks but will land in the water just fine.  Well, you can leave yer clothes on but whats the fun of that?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">not sure where 0 is, but Dagnors Cauldron has a large Z axis range between kedge ent and the top of the Mt on the isle.</div></div><hr />

When I want to climb stuff, I simply take off my pants and shirt, drop them so the horrible physics engine sticks them to a wall and then climb/jump up to them.  I've climbed up some really wacky stuff in that game using this technique.<br />
<br />
Also, in the DAOC beta, you used to be able to climb up walls simply by jumping into them and getting stuck and then just wacking jump over and over again.  I ascended some really high points that were 90 degree surfaces.  They fixed the bug in the last patch before retail, but I had more fun doing that in DAOC than I did playing the boring game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I bet the winning Z-axis is not what we would expect it to be. It's all relative to what the modeler used as his reference 0 point. This is not always at &quot;ground level&quot;. <br />
Would love to see some of the results though.</div></div><hr />

  You might be able to find a deepest canyon as well just in case someone beats you on the highest point ;)</div></div><hr />

Mons Letalis isn't on norrath, which was specified.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The very top of Skyshrine is waaaaay up there. Stonebrunt amd Fronteir mountains have some decent heights. Best bets are definately the spires at the combine ruins in dreadlands - But don't stop there! Do the sheild trick while you're at it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Murgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">try stonebrunt, the very north end of the zone.  not sure where the z axis starts in there, but i know the north end is alot higher than the south end of that zone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The spire in Mons Letalis is pretty damn high for sure if Luclin zones are allowed! I think it's a hard climb though, but can maybe be done with gflux help.</div></div><hr />

though that's alot of work for a z axis competition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Dreadlands Spires is very very far up.  Just standing at the base of them has a high z axis component, since down by Karnor's is the 0 point.</div></div><hr />

The air one with all the platforms forget his name atm but you should check that one out.  There are statues there also so if the z starts low and then you g flux you could prob get some sick numbers.  <br />

I agree, I lev'd and ran up the side.  With clip plane maxed I could not see the ground properly.  Very high.</div></div><hr />

It's been ages since I've been back there so I'm not even sure which compass direction it is anymore when in zone, but heading to perma, off to the right corner, there is a peak there with a tower on top of the peak. It's up there</div></div><hr />
