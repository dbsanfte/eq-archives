<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems to me EQ2 is doing things the right way by setting up arch-types, where the sub classes are differentiated by flavor and style, not basic function: ie. all priests can main heal, all warriors can tank, etc...<br />
<br />
We HAD the vestiges of this in EQ at the beginning, but we've drifted far far away from it, and we're trying to balance classes that share too much stuff between archtypes. Priests need to heal, tanks need to tank, DPS need to DPS. If we could make priests mostly equal and just have clerics heal a LITTLE better, druids dps a LITTLE better, and shaman debuff a LITTLE better, we'd all be able to co-exsist and be equally useful to a group. Instead they made clerics heal a LOT better, druids DPS a LOT better, and shaman debuff a LOT better. Throw in mitigation and slow is busted, cause it was TOO powerful. Break something thats too powerful, pendulum swings a long way, and that class becomes too weak.<br />
<br />
Are we just too far away from this arch-type model to get it back into some semblence of order? Could we get the game back into order by divying up into four archtypes again? Priest, tank, dps and CC? Or are we just too far commited to the mish mash we've become?</div></div><hr />
