<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading through the AA sticky in the cabinet and was wondering...most people suggest getting run speed 3 quickly...but now that we can do spirit of the shrew and pack shrew...do you still think run3 is as high a priority?<br />
<br />
I bought pack shrew and when I cast it my groups pretty much love it.  It was 30-something points and works for your whole group (and gives improved vision, woohoo).  It would seem that the addition of this spell has made run3 less of a priority for those that can cast it?<br />
<br />
Side note:  There's mention in that thread about leveling to 65 before doing AA...and that most of the highest AA holding shaman are 65...I'd just like to note that those statistics in no way indicate that those shaman leveled to 65 before doing AA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Firts, run3 is still that important, what if shrew wears off and you have to bail, even run1 is better than nothing.<br />
<br />
65 isnt really that much of a timesink.  I remember 55 being bad, and 59 being bad, 60 was quick as lightning, and 61 through 65 was quick.<br />
<br />
Reason behind 65 first then aa, well easy:<br />
you have access to mobs that give better aaxps,<br />
if you like LDoN and want to do that path you get more points per adven than below 65 (51 at 65, i think 40 at 60 nor sure) so it takes less time to get that equipment you want.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not arguing against going to 65 quickly...just saying that the comment was a little misleading.  :P<br />
<br />
I also think that death will happen in EQ no matter how perfect you are.  Mistakes and events beyond your control are a part of EQ adventuring.  Therefore I would still question the value of spending to get run3 when you can do indoor speed with a cheap to acquire spell.  If it's that big of a deal you could always time it and recast well befor it drops.  Yes, having run3 could save you IF shrew drops and IF it happens to drop during a disasterous encounter - but I should think the chances of that happening, Murphy's Law aside, aren't that high and could easily be written off to routine EQ dying.<br />
<br />
Getting run3 is such a hardwired part of AA that I wonder if people will logically consider this.  Many (EQ) people are highly resistant to change.<br />
<br />
I look forward to more comments on the topic.<br />
<br />
For some getting to 65th may be trivial - but for me, with no guild and this being my main character (ie, no/few outside resources) I'm not sure that'll be the case.  The path to 50 has been ludicrously faster than it was when I did it back in ancient times...but I suspect that 50+ will slow down a little.<br />
<br />
In my first EQ life years ago I was a bit hardcore...this time around I'm a bit more casual and I've never had any AA exposure before.  It will be difficult to not do some early AA's just for fun, variety, and to try this new (to me) feature.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why bother getting click-boots if you have SoW?<br />
That's essentially the same argument you make.<br />
*hugs click-boots*<br />
<br />
But, if you did your leveling back before LDoN and got your Run 3, you'll never have to worry about it :)  That's 30 points more I have to spend toward GRC or Bane or a piece of armor.  I don't get to play LDoN too much because of time schedule, so my points are valuable. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds like your really trying to justify not doing the AA's. If thats the case, just play on through to 65 and do your AA's then. You still need to do 6 generals and the 12 archetype's required for mental clarity 3 before you can get canni V, and run3 is still the best of the general AA's. Why not do it now? 3 AA's are not hard to get, run3 never goes down, takes no spell slot, costs no mana. I bought pack shrew and never, ever use it. I always think that people in the upper 50's should have run3 by that time, and feel a little annoyed when they can't keep up with the rest of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your going to have to spend points in general abilities to advance to archtype.  General abilities are fairly worthless, run3 just stands out clear above the rest.  Thats why everyone chooses it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its no big deal if you prefer something else for those 3 points, but you have to spend 6 in that category and of the choices you have, Run3 is still the best bang for the buck in my opinion.  Actually bang-for-buck wise, it is probably one of the best AA abilities period.  You won't get that much value out of 3 points again anytime soon.  <br />
<br />
If doing it over I would still do Run3 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to vote for run three as well.  The biggest advantage to me is its one less thing I have to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm not trying to be argumentative...mostly I'm just bored and waiting to get home and be ma shammy...but I imagine some will see my ramblings as argumentative.  So be it! .......<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies.  I still find it odd...but I'm not as experienced as I imagine most of you folks are and I respect your opinions.  I still don't necessarily agree...but I'm hardheaded in general so go figure.<br />
<br />
I would agree that the list of general AAs does look rather simple.  Regen3 obviously looks good.  Many folks here speak highly of +sta gear so I was considering that it might be better to go for more natural +sta rather than duplicate a spell effect.  I'm a big +wis junkie too...and if I could have more inherent base wis and free up room in some slot for something else useful that seems like a good thing.  Yeah, adding +6 base wis or sta isn't a whole lot in the grand scheme of things...but I don't think it's much more trivial than having built-in run speed when you can easily cast better.  Run speed is nifty - but it's not the be-all-end-all ability...it takes me how many seconds to mem and cast SoW?<br />
<br />
I'm not so lazy that I can't cast a spell - or I wouldn't be a caster.  Back in the day, I had jboots (from Najena, that's just how far back in the day it was) on my wizard - but that was mostly because he couldn't cast SoW.  I can't see getting an item that that mimics spells I can easily and cheaply cast - but if such an item fell into my lap I wouldn't discard it either.  And I'll admit that jboots and the like are damn spiffy - I loved the hell out of mine when I played my wizard in my first EQ life.  I admit one minor reason I decided to play a shaman in my 2nd EQ life was to have SoW (although mostly I wanted a highly diverse class that was good for grouping).<br />
<br />
I also don't think you can expect anyone to have run3 just because they're 51+.  In the cabinet's AA thread many advocate waiting until 65 to do AA at all...so it's likely that others besides shaman feel the same way (although I can't imagine too many SoW-less classes going without it all that time).<br />
<br />
And yeah, obviously, tons of people got run3 before there was pack shrew so they don't have to consider this at all.  And because so many people have run3 and it's been the thing to do many more won't consider it - they'll just do as everyone else has done.<br />
<br />
Sounds like your really trying to justify not doing the AA's. If thats the case, just play on through to 65 and do your AA's then.<br />
<br />
Not at all.  AA seems (to me, who's new to AA) to be a big deal and I would prefer to get the most bang for my buck).  Many people apparently advocate this but it doesn't suit my style so much.  I'm also unguilded and seriously doubt my RL schedule will permit raiding so hitting 65 isn't a big deal to me right now.  I'm sure there's more to being 65th than raiding but I can't see racing to get 65 unless you are going to raid.  A lot of the AAs look very desireable and if anything it'll be a task for me to keep to the level grind and not pursue AAs.<br />
<br />
The main reason I might put off AAs is my indecision on the run3 thing.  I can cast run speed anywhere...I can always use more base regen, wis, sta.  Despite the fact that nobody agrees with me I'm still not sure that I couldn't spend my initial general AA's better (and could still always pick up run3 later as a luxury).<br />
<br />
Sadly, in the end I will probably go with run3 myself - not so much because I think it's the best thing to do - but moreso so I don't have to explain my decision constantly and/or be labeled an EQ freak.  They should just GIVE everybody run3 at level 51 so they can indulge in some freedom of choice and creative thinking!  :P  That or add some new general AAs so that people don't say, &quot;well, I got AAs to duplicate things I can cast at a slightly lesser ability for lack of anything else to get.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ultimately, it's all about fun...I think some folks (myself included) often take these things too seriously.  As long as one is having fun then it's all good, right?  So, if I choose to be the only person in all of EQ that doesn't take run3 asap but I have fun, then it's gonna be ok!  8)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I too have not purchased run. I put 3 in regen, 1 in metabolism and 2 in wis. I probably should have just done 3 in metabolism rather than the wis but oh well.<br />
<br />
I put a very low value on run3 for the same reason as you. I have Shrew and if I'm in a dungeon, I always keep it on.<br />
<br />
My clicky SoW boots have saved my ass more times than I can remember but it's really a different issue than run3. Most of the time, running from anything in a dungeon is unlikely to save you anyway.<br />
<br />
I just suppose that noone here wants to admit that there 3 pts in run is rather useless (besides the rare time you run from a mob in a dungeon, and made even more rare by having Shrew drop at that moment).<br />
<br />
I would now easily suggest regen3/metabolism3 rather than regen/run combo. If you like to buy the stat foods, and own a mount, metab3 will ease the cost quite a bit.<br />
<br />
just my opinions,<br />
-Monjay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Zhahz the post you were refering to was made by me.  I linked to EQrankings and asked people to take notice that the top 650 shamans for AA on that site were all level 65.  You are correct that this does not necessarily mean that they did the majority of their AA after they hit 65.  However, if there were a lot of people mucking around and accumulating mass numbers of AA before they ding 65, where are they?  I don't know any.  I see people with their archetype title who aren't 65 on a fairly regular basis, but I almost NEVER see anyone with a class title who isn't 65.  It isn't just coincidence.  If you think I am wrong, I challenge you to find one person with just a third of my AA, who isn't 65 (I have 315AA).  I'm sure you can find a few people like that on eqrankings, but their rarity should tell you something.<br />
<br />
As for your original question, I would advise just doing run3 anyways.  As far as I am concerned, there are only 3 general abilities that are not completely useless:<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Regen3<br />
Metab3<br />
<br />
Some people choose to do stamina or wisdom but that is a poor choice.  You'll reach the soft cap fairly easily and eventually the hard cap.  The bonuses you get from 6 extra points of wis and stamina are pretty trivial.  Regen3, as well, is mediocre now imho.  Before PoP came out, regen was pretty good, but now mobs hit so hard and fights are so fast that it just doesn't matter.  It is nice to have, of course, but it isn't vital at all.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, run3 is something which I still find useful today.  Sure, you can get the same effects by casting pack shrew, but I WILL NEVER HAVE TO CAST THAT SPELL EVER.  To me, that is worth 3aa.  I hate casting bih'li, and I'm pretty sure I would hate casting shrew as well.  Run3 saves a buffslot and saves yourself some hassle.  To get an idea of how nice it is having run3, try this:  Put your epic boots in the bank for a week, and go back to casting sow whenever it fades.  If you say that you don't mind and it doesnt bother you, then by all means skip run3.  I, personally, couldn't stand it.  Also, it DOES wear off, and can wear off at the worst times.  I have had to train out of ldon dungeons before.  I have had to train out of tactics as well.  I've had to kite SRT mobs for several minutes before I got enough room to mem and cast gate.  All these things have happened many times.  In all these situations, if my spirit of shrew had faded, I could have easily died.  With run3, though, I never have to worry about my shrew fading.<br />
<br />
Your last option for general skills is metab3.  I use stat food and I have metab3 trained, but I also have over 300aa.  I wouldn't really suggest something this trivial to someone just starting out on AA.<br />
<br />
Out of all these, run3 is really the only AA I feel strongly about training out of the general abilities.  Once you have that, it is really a tossup for me between regen3 and metab3.  Nothing else is really useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I don't know if people knew shrew was coming with LDoN. &lt;shrug&gt;  It seems like a slap in the face to those who can use shrew and have run3 for shrew to become available after they've made their choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jinheim, I'm not doubting you and not disputing you - I'm certain that  you know a great deal more than about this than I do.  I was simply stating that a list like that doesn't show how people got to their final results.  A list like that does not indicate that all those people leveled to 65 without doing any AAs then went full on AA once at 65.  Maybe they did, maybe they took slightly varying paths, but my point is that that list doesn't not give these details (and my point is nothing more than that).<br />
<br />

Looking forward to deciding on an AA strategy Shaman of Xev</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taiyed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Having had run3 before LDoN and shrew, I'd still train it.  Keeps me from having to swtich to yet another buff, or having to fill up another buff spot, etc.  Makes things much easier.  I personally do enough of casting spells (buffs/dd/heal/canni, etc.) in LDoN, so one less thing I have to worry about makes things easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, I don't know if people knew shrew was coming with LDoN. &lt;shrug&gt;  It seems like a slap in the face to those who can use shrew and have run3 for shrew to become available after they've made their choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd agree with Jinheim, there really aren't any of the first tier AAs that comes close to the usefullness of run3. Shrew is probably a handy spell before you start working on AAs, but it's one more buff to keep up and (more importantly) one more buff slot. As someone else put it, it's the differnce between casting SoW and having your clicky boots, ... and even at 65 I still love my clicky boots! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its been mentioned before, but since I didnt read every word of the previous posts I may have missed it in this thread.  Run III cannot be dispelled, where as all other buffs can.  Seems to be a no brainer to me.  That being said, play the game however you like.  Theres a helluva lot of min/maxers in EQ already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In every possible instance:<br />
<br />
Innate/worn &gt; Clicky &gt; Spell<br />
<br />
when we're talking about the same effect.<br />
<br />
What would you rather have?  Clicky aura of battle or innate regen3/+whatever ATK?  <br />
<br />
An innate/worn haste item or a clicky-haste?  If I didn't have my epic boots I would never cast sow.  Run3 is nice.  There's a good reason why everyone wants it.  Shrew is decent, but it's the same philosophy, for me, as acumen.  It's a nifty little effect, but definitely not essential.  Am I going to pay plat/points for a parlor trick?  Nah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, run3 is better than Shrew.  But not a whole lot better.  I'd spend 1 point on run1 for emergencies, then put the other two into metabolism so my stat food/drink lasts longer, if I had the points to spend over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I spent my first three AA points on run 3 and I would do the same today.  Its just too convenient for me not to.  Anything that makes every day I play EQ more fun is worth three AA points.  As a Vah Shir that east as much as any two halflings and rides a green lizard that eats at least as much, I chose to spend my second three points on innate metabolism.  I still can&#8217;t believe now much difference it made on food consumption.  Again, not having to restock food and drink every day is another convenience I&#8217;m willing to spend 3 AA points on.  But as someone already said, playing EQ is all about fun and we all approach it differently so just spend your points however you&#8217;ll enjoy them most.<br />
<br />
As far as leveling and AAs go, I know several people who have chosen to accumulate large numbers of AAs before reaching 65th level.  The ranger and cleric I group with regularly have over 120 AAs each.  Most of those were earned while they were 61st level and they have just recently leveled to 62 for more AAs.  The warrior and necromancer I have also grouped with frequently are both 63 and chose to do most of their AAs while 61 and 62.  I just bought Cannibalize 5 last night and turned on full regular XP to reach level 62 so our regular group, all 62, will get more LDoN points.  Once there I expect to do nothing but AAs until I get most of the abilities I like that I can purchase at that level.  But again, we should each play the game the way that gives us the most pleasure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, agree, and that's why I said get Run 1.  But once you are faster than the mob chasing you, being MUCH faster doesn't really help that much more.  Most dungeons you're not gonna outrun aggro range even with run 3, so staying one step ahead of his claws is good enough.<br />
<br />
Although it's true that there's not much else in General worth getting.  Like I said, maybe metabolism to save a few plat on stat food.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only good reason I've seen for getting run3 at this point, beyond personal preference and/or fun, is freeing up a buff slot.  I don't necessarily aspire to be like every shaman before me, even though there is little room for originality...and I'm all about having fun.<br />
