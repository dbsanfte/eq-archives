I had been using a DOS based log parser I wrote forever ago, and got tired of having to update it  . . .  so I downloaded EQCompanion.<br />
<br />
For some reason, it doesn't appear to be parsing my spell damage or procs . . . any ideas ?<br />
<br />
oh . . . ph34r my l33t 11 DPS melee sKiLz!   Imma get Rabid Bear so I can break 15! :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">mebbe spell damage is turned off or abbreviated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Are you talking about in EQ or is there a setting in EQ Companion I should look at?<br />
<br />
If it's in EQ, I don't think that's it.  My melee misses are turned off in EQ, but they still show in my log.  My spell damage is turned on in EQ, it shows in my log but it doesn't appear to be parsed in my fights tab.<br />
<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />

Hah!! :p Snap, I'm only 24, and I had no bloody clue what that meant. I had to sit and sound it out phonetically, lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thats the one thing I dont like about EQCompanion.  I like the design and display portions of the program, but the fact that I cant get it to calculate the way I do damage (spells) bugs me.  <br />
<br />
I use Yaulp.  Yaulp has all kinds of neat graphs and such showing percentages, averages and the whole 9 for you and your group.<br />
<br />
Im sure that someone that has played with EQC more than I have could give you an answer, but after messing with it for a few weeks trying various settings I gave up.<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
Heres the link to Yaulp.  http://www.yalp.org/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i really like that yalp.. thanks thor :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">its been a really long time since i parsed with eqcompanion.  but what little i remember is this.... <br />
<br />
you have to add the spells to a table.  you put in what the text looks like for casting and what the text looks like for results (soso and soso was blasted for XXX damage).  then you put in what the max damage of the spell is.<br />
<br />
dots with the new eqcompanion (new for me = 18 months or more old) you could  put in the duration of the dot, initial damage if any, and what the damage per tick was.<br />
<br />
can do the same for procs of weapons.<br />
<br />
eqcompanion has a board where people have asked the same things and the developer has walked them through it.  i recommend visiting their board.  you can access from their webpage (its not very apparent, but its there.  just look for it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gilador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hi, I'm the author of EQ Companion. It really sounds like you are using an old version of EQC. When you download the full installer, it installs version 0.6. Version 0.794 is the latest version and it parses all spell damage, DD's and DoT's. You can download that from the downloads page.<br />
<br />
The only manual stuff you might have to do is if you want to see which spell did the actual non-melee damage. You accomplish this by creating entries in the 'Weapon Procs' list (I really should rename this back to 'non-melee' list...)<br />
<br />
For example creating entry:<br />
<br />
Spell name: Spear of Torment<br />
Phrase: screams in torment.<br />
Title: DD: Spear of Torment<br />
Damage: 900<br />
Comment: Spear of Torment DD<br />
<br />
will look for lines in the log file that have the string 'screams in torment.' in it. It then knows that the past non-melee message up-to 900 damage was caused by spell 'Spear of Torment' and it will be shown under non-melee damage as 'DD: Spear of Torment'. If you get a resist message like 'Your target resisted Spear of Torment', EQ Companion will increase the 'miss' counter for that line.</div></div><hr />
