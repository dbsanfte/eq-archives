It would really clean up the general forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This has been continually brought up, and the reason for not doing it is that as a community, fixing the class should be a front-and-center issue, not only for regulars, but visitors from Sony should see that it has this kind of importance to us as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not to mention that these so-called &quot;whiners&quot; or &quot;complainers&quot; are getting things fixed or changed at least, instead of those &quot;stout-in-mind-and-silent-as-treestumps&quot;. If you wont make yourself heard, Sony will never even ask you if you have problems or no. Sony just opts to &quot;if silent then happy&quot; position and done. You should actually learn from druids, see how they whined and it worked. See where your silence will bring you, or, should I say, leave you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like the thought of a separate forum...not for whiners, but for class suggestions. It will allow us to focus all of our suggestions &amp; ideas into one forum.</div></div><hr />

2 whining about class discussion     6.25%<br />
<br />
Of all of these topics, I would only like to see 2 of them moved.  Maybe we can open a new forum where you can make Board improvement suggestions and you can post your ideas there about how to make this board better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Whining is a great way to turn folks off from your message/issue. <br />
<br />
I agree with Balthag, I'd like to see a class suggestion forum. There is certainly enough being done with the game via patches and conversations between class representatives and SOE to warrant it. Perhaps it may increase the number of times SOE folks stop by, since they know they will have a single forum to check and not have to scroll through a bunch of general threads they're not interested in.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, new forum or no, the whiners and those who write before they think will appear no matter what you do.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DBullneck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whining is a great way to turn folks off from your message/issue.<br />
<br />
Completely disagree with you.  Calm, well thought out discussion has been ignored.  Response to all that has been presented has been, &quot;Nope, working as intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
I feel some people do go a bit over the top on occasion, but silence/patience with this issue is the worst possible avenue at this point IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We cannot stop voicing our class issues over and over again until the most glaring problems have been adressed. So, sorry, if you do not like those posts on the main board, support our plead. The faster something positive happens, the faster the complaining can stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All I will say is over the years this board has been full of well thought out and researched/parsed arguments about the class and improvements that were needed(needed yes not wanted).<br />
What was SoE's reaction to this ? &quot;Working as intended &quot; etc.<br />
<br />
Last few months has seen a lot of strongly worded posts (yes the odd whine) and what has SoE's reaction to this been ? A few upgrades with maybe more to come.<br />
<br />
We know Shaman have a lot of improvements to be made yet and at the moment all thats happened is SoE has thrown us a bone.A bone though is better than a whack round the head and being told to shut up.<br />
<br />
So let the whining continue on the front page i say.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And who would be put in charge or deciding what consistutes a whine, verses what constitutes someone trying to thnk out loud and asking others for input?<br />
<br />
If people want to think through things, and ask for input, So be it. No one is forced to read a single post here. There is no arm twisting involved in making anyone here go through some right of passage by reading through what may seem like drivel to some others.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">But wouldn't an organised method (Like the appointed representatives) be much more effective?<br />
I doubt any representative of soe reads each &quot;suggestion&quot; thread.<br />
Or if not a new forum, juist a single stickied thread, somewhat like:<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19072<br />
You can make your point without making a new thread, clutter isn't neccesary, and it'd stop the same ideas beinf reshashed every 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Some absolutes:<br />
<br />
1) This board rocks<br />
2) Shaman HAVE fallen behind where they were in Kunark<br />
3) I am STILL striking out like a little leaguer facing Roger Clemens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Balthag,<br />
<br />
We did that. Seen the Shaman proposal? A single thread condensing all the issues with &quot;I agree&quot; from damn near every Shaman on the board<br />
<br />
The response was &quot;I'm not convinced&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a disheartening and flabbergasting reply, so please, forgive those Shaman who really don't know WHAT else to do. And hey, whining worked for the Druids.</div></div><hr />
