<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Obadia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok i know ya get 5 skill points per lvl,(thought some were only 3 per lvl)so at say lvl 30 i would be able to have 150 skill in like all my skill spells such as abjure.conj etc...<br />
 is there a spell i can cast like wisdom or a stat i can raise to help accelerate my speed of rasing the skills?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">5 * lvl + 5 is the cap up until 200 (around lvl 40) then post 50 its another 5 per lvl I think, max of 250...<br />
at 35 your max abjure skill would be 180. For non-melee the cap system is different for weapon skills, I think for shamen, weapons are like 4 * lvl + 4 or something along that line. Correct me if im wrong someone :)<br />
<br />
To help raise skills faster, I think that dex helps raise channeling (maybe?) and int/wis (not sure which) help raise the spell skills.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dex for Offense and weapon skills <br />
<br />
Agi for defense, and i think stuff like dodge.<br />
<br />
INT for casting skills i think..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">INT or Wisdom, whichever is highest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've had trouble with abjuration and conj too. Abjuration I just don't cast it enough, once you buff its good for a while so no reason to recast. <br />
<br />
Conjuration is just a pain though. I'm 46 now and have a 196 conjure skill. It just doesn't want to raise. For a while I was summoning all my food and drink and soloing, casting 2+ dots per solo. It still wouldn't go up very fast.<br />
<br />
One thing you could for abjuration is chain cast fleeting fury on yourself. Its like 10 mana and has very low cast time and insta recast. That might help some. No idea what to do with conjuration though. Wish it would raise faster myself.</div></div><hr />
