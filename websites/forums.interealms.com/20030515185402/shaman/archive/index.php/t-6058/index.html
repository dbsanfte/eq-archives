<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snowielder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was thinking about trying to camp the bank area in Kael with myself (57 shaman) and with my brother's ranger (currently level 54).  Is it possible at these levels?<br />
<br />
We both have over 900 AC and 2k HPs when fully buffed.  Currently in the process of upgrading his off-hand weapon to a higher damage weapon (LSoEE, Frostbringer, etc.).  His main hand weapon is now a Toxiferous Axe.  I have JBB (fairly useless in Kael) but do not have epic.  Is this going to be enough damage output, along with having the AC/HPs to take out these guys?<br />
<br />
If not now, what about when I am 58 and have the new heal?<br />
<br />
btw, still looking for a tear on Quellious to finish my epic, in case someone has one lying around and reads this.<br />

<br />
I tandem the bank easily with 60 shm and 54 war.  I slow and epic, while he just attacks with my dogdog.<br />
<br />
They take a bit, but they dont run, and if you pull to the hallway, there is only one roamer that goes that way.<br />
<br />
Might be harder if your slows dont land like mine did due to level.<br />
<br />
Also not sure on your pulling of singles or not, would have to try it.<br />
<br />
I could clear the 2 roamers, the two bank guards out front, the two in pit, and the 2 on the way to arena, with time to spare.  Sometime even pulling from up the Area tunnel to get 2 of those before repops.<br />
<br />
The kills take a while, and I am unsure how a ranger would do there, but once slowed the giants are pretty easy, they just take a while.<br />
<br />
For the record, I fought there over 5 days approx 20 hours total and got Chain Sleeves, Plate sleeves and Plate gloves.  About 1 drop every 4 hours or so.<br />
<br />
At 60 its easy to tell, any mob dark blue can drop armor, but the bank area is around 30% blue the rest are light blue, so the chances are armor dropping isnt real good, but it is there.<br />
<br />
Once special note, is Capt Bellevos (sp), he can whip some serious ass to a tandem, so if you accidently aggro him, just die where you stand, and dont train your buddy.<br />
<br />
Good news is you can leave one thing on body, and get a rez pretty quick if you are playing in primetime, there is always clerics running around.<br />

<br />
I have only seen armor drop from the giants IN dark blue armor :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mobs the drop armour the most:<br />
<br />
Veterans<br />
Legionaires<br />
Adjuntents<br />
<br />
Mobs that drop armour more rarely:<br />
Senior Guards<br />
Troopers<br />
Guards<br />
<br />
Besides those I haven't seen any of the other regular mobs drop quest armour</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jalarm393</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have duoed the bank with my fried in rl he plays a 53 monk im lvl 57 its fairly easy to kill all the guard spawns, but we canot kill the kael militia captain captai bvellos or staff sergeant drioc they are all in the bank and once bvellos is up he will wander through the main area from just past the bank to the entrace to the arena. im pretty sure bvllos' ph is the kael militia captain dont quote me though. The only armor droppers in the bank area are the liutenants they are rare spawns and can spawn in any place where the guards spawn there are 6 guard spawns outside of the bank and i believe and 1 inside the bank. The guards can be singled at 57 but not at 53 so im usually pulling. the liutenants have a high chance of dropping armor in my experience i have killed about 18 and i have seen some plate leather and silk, silk being the most common drop. all in all  i have seen bout about 8 drops total.  We even got leather boots and silk arms off of 1 liutenant. the liutenant spawns are fairly random you can see a few in a set of spawns then none for 3 hours. Good luck in hunting there</div></div><hr />
