<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not playing now but the old fix for this was to delete all your texture cache files in the EQ folder, these have the extension .txc. They will be rebuilt the next time you zone. If you don't feel safe doing this (it is) just move all of them to another folder on your HD until you see if it works or just delete the affected zone .txc files.<br />
<br />
Remember remove only dot txc files no others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Read a couple posts about doggie going all glitchy and neon like a clown and both said same fix about the caching.  My problem is, sometimes all my graphics go crazy like that and I can hardly see a thing.  Is this the same problem? same fix?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
