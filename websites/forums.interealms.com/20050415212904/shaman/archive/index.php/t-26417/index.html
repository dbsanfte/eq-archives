CA is looking to add about 3 shammies to its ranks. <br />
<br />
  Requirements are 70, 150aa, for them, flags/gear dont matter much as we'd be getting you both as long as your interested in growing with us.<br />
<br />
   Were currently working on uqua, should be into qvic real soon as we've gotten to the end of uqua now and just needed to tweak some things to make it go even smoother.  We raid lots of GoD, OoW, and PoP content. We choose quality over quanitity and are not looking for transients, we are looking for loyal people who fit our reqs and have room to grow with us.  We also require people to have above 50% attendance each month. We raid every night from 8:30est/7:30cst til 1am or so, sometimes later, sometimes earlier start and end times.<br />
<br />
website is www.cassault.com<br />
if you have anymore questions or comments ;tell saryrn.froggerx ingame, or use the ingame email system (ctrl+E)<br />
