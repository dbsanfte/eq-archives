<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I've taken a ~3 month (and counting) EQ break,  but I've recently been thinking of returning to the game as a non-raiding, for-fun type of character.<br />
<br />
When I left I was lvl 65 with ~120 AA, but I had not acquired any of the level 65 spells.  Since I do no wish to raid anymore (too much time), what would I expect to pay for the various 65 spells?<br />
<br />
When I left EQ I think I had ~325000 PP in the bank ... will that buy all of them?  Are there some (or most or all) that are rarely/never for sale?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">on Xev: Malos 50 - 60k, Quiescence 45 -50, FA 35, Fo7 45 - 55 and BoS 35.  325k would be plenty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On 7th, the biggest problem is availability.  People snap them up as soon as they go on sale in the bazaar....  I know that BoS sold for 10K twice in the last couple o weeks, and at least one wasn't to a Shammy.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On Xegony prices for shammy rune spells are still high<br />
<br />
Bos 55 k <br />
malos 70 - 89 k<br />
Fo7 55 - 70 k<br />
quiescence ... only saw it once, cheap at 150 k<br />
<br />
Unfortunately not looking  like they're dropping any time soon. Hell, torpor is still 50 - 80 plus k<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On Prexus they seem to have stabalized and slowed of sales (almost always for sale) at the following:<br />
<br />
Q 40k<br />
FA 25k<br />
Fo7 30k<br />
BoS 25k<br />
Malos 20k<br />

You could go now and purchase them all for 140k</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tribunal spell prices for shaman spells have always been WAY lower than most other servers though, due to a long standing gentlemans agreement that we cap SHM spell prices at 5k between shaman.  <br />
<br />
Last I looked, even in the bazaar the highest priced SHM rune spell was 30k for fo7, blood was about 10k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">325 will easily buy them all. I bought all mine and this is what I paid:<br />

Fo7 - 45k<br />
Malos - 30k<br />
Ferine - 20k<br />
Blood of Saryrn - 20k<br />
<br />
For a grand total of 185k.  I bought Q and fo7 way before the other, so they have come down in price since then.</div></div><hr />

Dang wish all servers were like this its sad to see how shm will screw other shm over from plat or items<br />
<br />
on tunare all 61+ spells are cheaper then 60 spells /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">what i have seen on innoruuk so far :<br />
Malos : 50k <br />
Fo7 : 90K <br />
Q : 80K <br />
FA : 25K<br />
haven't seen bos yet .<br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As far as Bristlebane goes.<br />
<br />
Malos - 40k<br />
Fo7 - 50k<br />
Q - 40k<br />
BoS - 15k<br />
FA - 12k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">depend on server,  some are still very expensive because  local ubber guild suck, other cheap because they sell nicely</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It all depends on what server you are on really.  I have been taking a break for the last two weeks but two weeks ago 350k wouldn't have covered it and knowing The Seventh Hammer prices haven't changed.  Here is what I saw on average 2 weeks ago on the seventh.  Though it would be hard to say on average since they are very rarely for sale.  I used to check 4-5 times a day on shaman spells and usually only saw one or two for sale at once, 4 65 spells at once was the most I'd seen.<br />
<br />
Q 90k<br />
FA 80k<br />
Fo7 70k<br />
BoS 50k<br />
Malos 80k<br />
<br />
Though I don't know how much spells are on Morrel-Thule I would assume they are probably 30-40% cheaper than the seventh so I would guess most other servers you could buy them all for around 250k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here's what I've observed lately on The Tribunal (I'm in a diff timezone to Sciek so I've seen a few diff prices).<br />
I noticed prices have plummeted in the last two to three weeks.<br />
A few weeks ago Malos was 70kpp and FoT7 was 100k to 125k!!<br />
Don't ask what my FoT7 cost me.... &lt; mutter &gt;.<br />
<br />
Here is how it's looking at the moment.<br />
<br />
Malos - 30k<br />
Fo7 - 50k to 100k<br />
Q - 45k (only ever seen one and I purchased it).<br />
BoS - 30k<br />
FA - 50k to 75kpp (who are they kidding???)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On Ant Bayle prices have dropped noticably in the last several months. At the time of writing this you would have to pay on a good day.<br />
<br />
Qui 45k<br />
7th 40k<br />
Malos 30k<br />
FA 25k<br />
Saryn 30k<br />
<br />
Give or take 5k either way.<br />
<br />
Simple fact is the raiding guilds outfitted all their mains and twinks with spells some time ago so prices have dropped from the idiotic levels they were.<br />
<br />
In addition since people had it battered into their skulls that unlike Kunark shammy 65th spells are not rare items so they cannot command higher prices than any other classes spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Cheapest prices Ive seen on E'ci<br />
Malos 30k<br />

Q 45k<br />
Blood 12k<br />
FA 10k</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">if you don't raid and are doing tier 3 stuff and have malo I would skip malos.. also f07 is really a luxury..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">it totally depends on your server, and how many guilds are elemental flagged. For instance, Tunare has about 3 guilds that are capable of hunting areas where runes drop. The beauty of these runes is unlike patterns, the uberguild members can heasily get duplicates that they must sell off. Therefore, price is completely dependant on how many runes are introduced into the economy, aka how many uberguilds your server has.<br />
<br />
Tunare has a steady flow of runes coming in. Or maybe nobody buys them, I'm not sure. Our prices are rock bottom.<br />
<br />
Malos - 20k<br />
Q - 30-40k (I bought mine for 15K [!!!])<br />
Fo7 - 30-40k<br />
BoS - 20-30k (I havn't seen too much of this one so this is an estimate from the few I have seen)<br />
FA - 20k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">some average prices i have noticed on Karana.. <br />
<br />
Malos 40-70k<br />
Fo7 90-120k<br />
Q 70-100k<br />
FA 70k<br />
BoS never seen it sold so far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Can't speak for prices on our server Isazo, I have no clue heh.  I just wanted to say, I'd be glad to see you come back.  I miss chatting with ya sometimes and I hope you remember me heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really?  They wiped an account or couldn't recover a deleted character?<br />
<br />
I am reasonably certain that they have NEVER wiped a character over level 1 from their database.  They publicized the naked-level-1 wipe quite a bit when they did do it, too.<br />
<br />
If you actually delete the character then there's a chance they can't get it back (especially if someone else chooses the same name).  But I had all my characters, including my level 5 shaman that is now my main, survive a 9-month unpaid EQ break no problem.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have FIRST HAND experience with an inactive (unpaid but not deleted) character above level 1 being wiped?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I started playing shortly after EQ was released and played for about 7 or 8 months... then took a break for a year or so, then started playing again and took another year + break. My characters have survived that whole time. A buddy of mine went through the same thing and none of his have ever been deleted.</div></div><hr />
