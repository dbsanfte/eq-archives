<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scrav</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The player NDA has been lifted.  Feel free to ask any questions.<br />
<br />
Some general pieces of information on Horizons as a whole:<br />
<br />
There is no duel wield.<br />
<br />
Equippable items do not drop, apart from socket crystals (diabloish).<br />
<br />
A lot of content has been claimed to be held from the beta testers intentionally.<br />
<br />
Many prestige classes have not been &quot;fleshed&quot; out yet properly.<br />
<br />
Initial progression goes &quot;Tutorial Island&quot; --&gt; &quot;Starting Islands&quot; --&gt; &quot;Main World&quot;.<br />
<br />
All adventure classes receive abilities frequently.<br />
<br />
It is possible to quest for abilties.<br />
<br />
Some Classes (Animagus, Mana Knight, Rogue, Champion) don't yet exist but we seem to be seeing teasers similiar to EQ test server style.<br />
<br />
Down time is small compared to EQ and DAOC (Roughly 70 secs to go from 5% to 100% health).<br />
<br />
There is no mana.  Spells and Abilities are all on timers.<br />
<br />
Statistics are balanced but appear fairly useless (as in slightly better than EQ).<br />
<br />
You do not choose stats on character creation, just looks and race.<br />
<br />
Horizons is very solo friendly.<br />
<br />
Beta Testers haven't really seen the Withered Aegis in effect (intentionally held back from beta testers).<br />
<br />
Spellcasters have an auto-cast option, in a similar sense to melee's having auto-attack.<br />
<br />
There will be a roleplay server on release.<br />
<br />
Adventure experience is gained at an Adventure Rating level as opposed to a character class level.  The Adventure rating level is a modifier for multi-classing.<br />
<br />
There are many places to sight see out in the wilderness.<br />
<br />
There is no ammo, Endless Quiver for all!<br />
<br />
Everyone has the ability to gate or recall as Horizons puts it.<br />
<br />
Penalty for death is a death point.  Death points last 8 hours, cumulative.  First one does nothing, second one subtracts 10% stats and continues to build from there.  Death points wear off in real time, not game time.  Food made from crafting or from npc's reduce the timer.<br />
<br />
There is root, but no mez.  Very few ways of dealing with aggro.<br />
<br />
Consigners will sell items for you for a 10% fee, with limitations on the number of unique items that can be sold at one time.<br />
<br />
There will be events and they won't be tied to a specific time of the day.  The beta ones were, but only for testing and performance purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JimmyZJr</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woot!  Thanks!  So, on a whole.... thumbs up or thumbs down?<br />
<br />
Also, is there some sembelance of balance or are there a few schools that are out of whack?<br />
<br />
Will see if any more come to mind later...  Starting to get excited now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn Veryien</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladins were seriously overpowered til two days ago. They solved that very easily though by scaling back their heals and cutting the number. With the extra heals I was soloing mobs several levels above me but it's back to the mobs my level and below for now. Even same level mobs can be a good fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JimmyZJr</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about mages?  The bloodmage in particular sounds appealing... Though there is always the call of the ranger  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scrav</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did like the change from EQ.  I will be buying Horizons, but the first few months will determine how long I will stay.<br />
<br />
One thing I forgot to mention: There is only one dragon adventure and crafter class.  They follow a different way of progression through questing for many abilities.<br />
<br />
Which leads to class balance...<br />
<br />
Many prestige classes have not been tested at high levels.  I have a feeling that several are underpowered.  I mainly played the 3 bow classes (Scout, Ranger and Elemental Archer), so I can't comment too much on others.<br />
<br />
Paladins, Scout and Rangers seemed to be the most overpowered near the end.  Paladins got whacked very hard with the stick in the last few days, a lot harder than most expected.  The ability Pinion which made Rangers and Scouts very powerful in terms of how high level a mob they can solo was broken with one of the last beta patches, so I don't know if this was an attempt to fix it or not.<br />
<br />
I really don't know how the economy will turn out.  I think this is want and see thing, but I wish pawnbrokers were removed from the game.  Pawnbrokers allow you to sell items to them (and buy to a lesser degree), like NPC merchants in EQ.  However I think it would be possible for crafters to abuse them and bring far more cash into the economy than theoritically should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JimmyZJr</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good stuff to hear... I also plan on seeing how the first few months go and leave my options open.  With EQ2 and WoW on the horizon, (no pun intended ;) ) I feel that the competition in MMORPGs will push the genre into new realms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scrav</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another important thing I didn't mention:<br />
<br />
There are no dungeons at release (maybe implemented later on down the track).<br />
<br />
The main focus as I understand it is to drive the Withered Aegis from various lands which will result in additional content created.  For example, the elven city has been taken over and the lands around it have been turned into a rotting landscape.  Taking back the Elven city may result in the Elves moving back and additional content such as quests, etc.  I don't know for sure that this will happen as we were not allowed to test this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tylon</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here are some ramblings on the game in no particular order.  SPOILERS PRESENT BEWARE<br />
<br />
<br />
Monsters look incredible as does most of the player models. Some character models seem a bit cheesy but overall the graphics are incredible. The world is so much more imersive than the EQ world....it's amazing in some locations. Waterfalls, lightning storms, snow storms, foggy landscapes....etc. It's the best part of the HZ experience. Seeing my first waterfall and watching the mist glide above the water was awesome for the first time. Cant stress how much I enjoy looking at what they have created.<br />
<br />
How does the game play?.... I wish the game played as well as it looks. Truth is it still needs a ton of work. <br />
<br />
Classes seem to be way out of wack. Healing hybrids seem to have the edge above all other classes at this stage of beta. Out of the top 10 characters 8 are paladins. The damage casting classes seem to be underpowered atm.<br />
<br />
Combat is ok but I find it lacking in some ways. I only have a perspective of a lvl 15 scout so my view here is somewhat biased. As you lvl you gain abilities...some of which are special attacks and defenses. Scouts get a range attack that is similar to ensnare which enables me to kill mobs several lvls higher than my current lvl.<br />
<br />
Equipment is obtained through a consigner. Crafters make gear and put it up forsale on consigners. Nearly every piece of gear you will own will either be made by yourself or bought from a consigner. I dont agree with this and think it will drive away alot of people. I believe they could have placed rare equipment on creature types in certain areas to draw people out to those spots to experience in hopes of gaining that particular item.<br />
<br />
Grouping right now is unnesessary. You can pretty much solo as most classes. Some classes solo better than others which will mean faster progress but I dont think there is a class that cannot solo at least mobs a couple lvls lower than themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a base skill called speed. you can buy items that are character made that have speed points or you can get speed buffs. Same goes for other skills as well....like strength and Dexterity. Dragons are a bit different though since they have their own make-up which for the most part is seperate from the rest of the races.<br />
<br />
Switching schools seem to the be way to go within the game. In order to become a ranger you have to have 200 bow skill and 150 nature skill. The only way to get both skills is to switch schools at some point.....so on my scout I switched over to druid and lvled upto lvl 9 then switched back. Now once I hit 200 bow from lvling in the scout school I can become a ranger by talking to the Ranger trainer. From reading the beta boards I get the impression that alot of ppl are doing multiple schools upto lvl 15 before picking a primary school to continue on. The only draw back on this is how the game chooses your power lvl. You basically have two different rating. Lvl of school your in and your power lvl. If you lvl up multiple schools your power lvl will be higher than your school lvl. There is a cap on your power lvl so if your school lvl can never reach your power lvl then you will miss out on some skills from the school you choose to take to the higher lvls....if that makes sense.<br />
<br />
Little on the HZ storyline.<br />
<br />
Simplified....basically an evil called the Withered Aegis is slowly conquering the world. The undead, led by liches and other powerful undead, are turning the world into this evil darkness. Very evident by the terrain the evil controls.<br />
<br />
Supposedly on normal servers the WA will never conquer the world but on Roleplay servers it will be able to if the character population cannot keep it at bay....a roleplay server could be alot of fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are a bunch of other features that I have not had a chance to test or see. Making structures is in but there just are not enough testers to build towns and keep them running. This part of the game is very neat but it's very dependent on population.<br />
<br />
I groupped some yesterday. We had 6 people and the lag got horrible. FPS dropped to around 10. We were killing stuff 7-10 lvls above our own though so we were getting decent exp but due to the lag it was slower going than soloing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess the big question is......Is the game worth buying? I am seriously considering it. If I knew some of my old EQ buds were going to buy it I probably would. The game play and style is very different from EQ....almost casual IMO. The lag and other bugs will eventually go away so that is really not that big of a deterent for me. What makes me hesitate is the lack of AWE factor once you get past the graphics. Trade skilling can be fun as can combat but there seems to be a lack of Surprises in the game. Mobs do not drop items that can be equipped immediately but do drop stuff that can be incorporated into the trade skill system. So basically you do not have a choice in HZ....you must tradeskill if you want to advance or have fun. Tradeskills are fun though...especially when you use questing to raise them.<br />
<br />
I'll cover scholar for a tradeskill to give an example. First you visit the trainer(NPC in several cities). You walk up and greet the trainer. She then gives you the option of joining the Scholar tradeskill. You become a scholar and she gives you some basic equipment and formulas needed in the craft. You greet her again and she now has the option for a quest. Click on it and she says she wants you to collect 10 Sandstone spell shards. In order to make spell shards you have to break out your mining pick to collect Sandstone slabs. Fill your inventory by mining Sandstone ore deposits. Take these to a stone cutting building and use your stone chisel to cut them into sandstone bricks(at a ratio of 1 brick per 5 slab to start). Next you take the bricks to table in the same building and turn the bricks into Spell shards(ratio of 1 shard per 5 bricks again). After finished with 10 shards you take them back to the scholar trainer for a bit of copper, some exp in the scholar school, and a new spell formula. <br />
<br />
You can also make the shards for your own use. When you complete a quest from the scholar trainer she will give you spell formulas. Behind the scholar is a workbench used in spell crafting. Each spell costs between 3-5 shards to scribe. Once scibed the spells can be committed to your spell book or you can put them on a consigner to be sold for profit.<br />
<br />
This is basically how HZ is played. For each school in the game there is a trainer. Once you reach a certain lvl in a school you can become more specialized by joining a specialized school. The specialized schools take specific skills....Example: for the Ranger school you have to have two skills... Nature at 150 and Bow at 200(lvl 15 druid and lvl 20 Scout).<br />
<br />
There are several parts of the game I haven't touched yet. <br />
<br />
Techniques in the tradeskill system look very promising. Techniques are basically a way of adding magic to items you create. Such as adding +5 to hit a target with a weapon or bow or adding Str/Dex/Speed to an armor item.<br />
<br />
Socketing items---Various socket gems drop from NPCs that you kill and can be added to armor/weapons/tools that are socketted...ala Diablo 2. This looks to be very interesting and its very similar to what EQ just added with the last expansion.<br />
<br />
Constructing buildings---Small homes or dwelling will be doable by 1-2 individuals but massive structures such as castles and cities will take tons of money and time from dozens if not hundreds of players. The first player built city will be an amazing accomplishment for the players. <br />
<br />
Higher lvl play---I just haven't been playing enough to have a character high enough to experience the higher lvl tradeskills or adventuring schools. I hope to make ranger before beta ends which will help a ton to know the path if I should decide to buy the game. The higher end game still appears to be undergoing development....similar to how EQ was at release.<br />
<br />
Overall, HZ has a ton of potential. The game is way more advanced than EQ was at it's release....as it should be. It still has some dev work to patch up memory leaks and trim down lag though...so in this reguard it is a bit behind where EQ was at release. If I had $50 to blow I'd pick this up as soon as it hit the store shelf. For those casual gamers who want a finished product with very few problems....better wait a few months before picking it up.<br />
<br />

The thing that turned me off of EQ was the blandness of it.  If exp was the byproduct of your actions and not the sole purpose... that would please me very much :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn Veryien</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two other &quot;realms&quot; already known - realm of Blight (from which the power of the undead emanates) and the realm of Twilight (where resides the goddess of the Fiendish race).<br />
<br />
In fact, I think I found the fiends' attempt to open a portal to the realm of twilight. Here's a screenshot of this thing, that I originally thought was a fortress and then realized it was laid out all wrong:<br />

<br />
<br />
And here's a shot of the mage tower:<br />
http://home.houston.rr.com/dlramsey/images/horizons/mage_tower.jpg<br />
<br />
The mage tower is... amusing. With speed buffs roughly equal to SOW on my character it took 7 minutes to run to the top.<br />
<br />
Curiosity got the best of me and I jumped off the top ledge with my watch running... I hit the ground 29 seconds later. The doorway you see in that tower is probably 40 feet tall and in the shot you cannot even see the human guard at the front since she is so small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meinas</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">can someone go into detail on the ranger classes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scrav</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ranger:<br />
<br />
Requires 200 bow skill (level 20 scout equiv)<br />
Requires 150 nature skill (level 15 druid equiv)<br />
<br />
Skill received per level:<br />
<br />
Armor Use - 9 <br />
Bow - 9 <br />
Crossbow - 9 <br />
Evasion - 9 <br />
Magic Defense - 8 <br />
One Hand Crush - 8 <br />
One Hand Pierce - 8 <br />
One Hand Slash - 8 <br />
Shield - 8<br />
Nature - 7<br />
<br />
The Ranger is primarily a bow user.  I never used melee as the skill limits made weapon usage requriements significantly lower than a bow.<br />
<br />
Spell acquisition is a lot slower than a druid or shaman, but as far as I can tell they can use all spells in the Nature school (That were available in beta).  The Nature school line of spells is pretty much a jack-of-all trades line consisting of heals, direct damage (unlikely to be used as a Ranger), some buffs such as armor and nature resistance and root/snare spells.  We can also use spells from the Augmentation line that were gained as a druid.  These spells are all buffs.<br />
<br />
The Ranger abilities gained are really the bread and butter of the class.  We keep most of the skills gained as a Scout with the exception of longshot (extra long range attack) and a few of the druids including Instant Heal 1.  A few unique abilities include a temporary (self) run speed buff, a self haste buff and the claok of thorns series which functions as a damage shield.  I've debated listing the abilities we get to 36, but I think I may just provide a link to the beta boards when they become read only as to not spoil anything forthose that don't want to know.  many of our abilities are derived from the Scout class at a possibly lower rate of aquisition.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunmoon</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Scout is the Base class.. from there you can go into things like crossbowman, elemental archer, or ranger.<br />
<br />
Personally, I LOVED the fletching. I could go out, cut my own trees down, visit the sawmill, then hit the woodworking bench for all of my intricate needs. Some called it tedious, but I thought the reward was well worth the effort.<br />
<br />
You can even specially name every piece you make and as long as the item is in the world, it shows that you made it.<br />
<br />
Graphically, I think the game is stunning in many ways. I would travel for hours just walking around looking at all of the scenery, the rare flora, the gold deposits out far, the huge Elm trees... it's awesome.<br />
<br />
Personally, I will be getting the game and starting a new board for it.. it's that good to me. It doesn't have the depth of EQ yet.. even EQ when it started, but I think it has the potential to keep me entertained, which is the bottom line ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My take on Horizons is that it has definate promise.  But Artifact is going to have to prove that they're going to be able to handle the performance issues that will occur, and are occuring.  During Beta there were many periods where the game was pretty much unplayable due to lag, NPCs not showing up, etc.  This was a problem for me as I hate having to sit and wait on a game to catch up.  Now of course during beta they didn't have everything optimized, and there were periods where the game worked pretty good, but those periods weren't always consistant.  For this reason I probably won't get the game until after the first couple of weeks have past.  I've no interest in buying a game that's unplayable.  I'll wait until they've proven to others that Horizons will perform adequately under load.  <br />
<br />
As for the actual game, I general tested casting classes.  I played a Mage, and a Spiritist.  The mage is the generic nuker that develops into 4 different caster classes for prestige classes, and the Spiritist is kind of equiviliant to a Necromancer without a pet in the types of spells it gets.  I personally enjoyed the spiritist quite a bit as I felt that the life drains gave me a better chance to be able to win a fight.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, initially it was possible to use a bow at melee range and have it be effective.  They changed that during beta to so that bows would have a penalty to hit at close range.  So now you either have to have a way to slow or stop the mob or you have to switch weapons if your using a bow.  <br />
<br />
My biggest problem with Horizons is the lack of a LFG tool, and basically a lack of any reason to group other than to do something different besides soloing.  I'm not sure if they're going to be able to fix this about the game, or if they're even going to try.  <br />
<br />
My main tip for those who might be getting it and starting out:<br />
 - While in the tutorial get 2nd level cleric.  It's super quick (required 1 quest thingy) in the beta, and you'll use those spells that you can scribe as a 2nd level cleric.  They include things like: haste buff, movement speed buff, HP buff, AC buff, Self Heal, short term movement speed buff, etc.  And being a 2nd level cleric won't effect your Adventure rating at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I enjoyed druid/spiritist and was working towards shaman and will likely follow that route in release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkleaf Nightwander</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with Gavving,<br />
<br />
I was in the beta for about three months or so, and I found that the game was unplayable for large stretches of this time. I will admit that it could very well have been something wrong with my client software (Artifact has some funky ways of distributing new versions in the beginning). I was very impressed with the game play when I could get into the beta, but standing around for 15 minutes waiting on the server to give you your noobie starting equipment simply isn't much fun. <br />
<br />
The landscapes and other details of the system are beautiful, but if they can't find and patch the problems that they are having with lag, memory leaks, and resource allocation, then I don't see how the game will be enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents,<br />

December 9th.<br />
<br />
I will be waiting a few weeks with Gavving.  After every wipe in beta, the economy took time to settle down ( prices to stabilize ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tylon</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played right up to the end of beta.   The last couple of patches seemed to clear up most of the NPC loading problems and memory leaks.   The game ran 100 percent better than it did a week ago.  Grouping still seemed to suck up the FPS though.   In a six man group the FPS dropped to around 7 on my system(AMD 2400) and did not clear up until I exited the game and came back.   Stay away from the high population areas if your gonna buy the game at release and you'll do fine.<br />
<br />
Dalimond and the newbie islands will be where most ppl will go to lvl early on so if you can find a spot to lvl at one of the other cities you'll enjoy the game alot more until everyone starts thinning out later on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lonedar</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK...after perusing the info at tazoon.com, I have decided that I do not hate Horizons.  While I really wish the ranger school required 200 skill in ANY weapon (instead of the #!!%@! bow), I could see myself maxing Ranger and then going warrior from then out out and building up 2HS.  That could be a pretty cool character that can kill ya up close or far away.  It would prolly be weak against casters, but we can't have everything.  But since I wasn't in beta, this is just speculation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn Veryien</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's bad to get way out of range levelwise. If you were a level 100 ranger and started as a level 1 warrior, you'd have to be fighting probably level 50 mobs with a level 1 warrior class skill set and that would suck.<br />
<br />
A general recommendation was to keep your multiclasses close in level unless you planned to abandon them. For example, a ranger can cast the lowest rez if he gets 100 skill in life magic. He can't do that via druid (scout/druid are his ranger prereqs) so he'd have to do 10 cleric levels for just that spell (and skill). Then he'd never do any more cleric just leaving it idle having gotten the one thing he wanted from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scrav</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I have never done multi-classing at such a large difference, I still think it will be doable.  I plan to go a similar approach to multiclassing with getting one school up to level 100, effectively maxxing it and will start another school to build up.<br />
<br />
Some things to note when multiclassing:<br />
<br />
You will keep all abilities from other classes up to 50% of their maximum level.<br />
All statistic and skill values remain the same (including hp), they do not decrease or anything.<br />
You are still bound to equipment requirements of your current class.  As a level 1 you will be back in bronze/cedar items again.<br />
<br />
So for example, switching from a Ranger level 100 to a Warrior level 1, the Warrior will have something like:<br />
<br />
Armor Use: 920 (This will be limited by level requirements for armor)<br />
Bow: 920 (Warrior can't use bows)<br />
Crossbow: 920<br />
Evasion: 920<br />
Magic Defense: 800<br />
One Hand Crush: 800<br />
One Hand Pierce: 800<br />
One Hand Slash: 800<br />
Shield: 800<br />
Nature: 710 (Limited to a few Heals as a Warrior)<br />
<br />
This means you could effectively kite with a crossbow if you wanted to using various Ranger abilities that you had up to level 50.</div></div><hr />

Calling it simplification or dumbing down is not intended to be offensive, just different market target is all.   <br />
<br />
I personally don't mind 100% crafter made loot IF it is somewhat incorpated into using items dropped from creatures.  Without that, I felt SWG lacked any real motivation or incentive to play after the initial newness of things wore off (as someone not interested in PvP).<br />
<br />
How are the quests and rewards?  <br />
<br />
Is there any strategy to combat including soloing or group dynamics?  One other problem I had with SWG was the combat system horribly lacked any form of strategy.  It appeared the idea of over simplication to make it so every class could solo to some extent crept into this aspect of the game.  Anything like this, what I call dumbing down in Horizons?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
PS:  I have no intention of leaving FFXI anyway, just curious for future reference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scrav</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Resources required to make items are both acquired from mobs and through gathering.  At the early crafter levels, it looks like most things will be gathering dependant.  At higher levels it looks like it will be increasingly difficult to obtain resources and there *may* be a decent market for high level resources from adventurers.<br />
<br />
Items required for techniques only drop from mobs.  Techniques are abilities used in an item creation to give the item certain powers.  This can be increasing damage or adding new effects onto a spell, weapon or armor piece (as an example, much more can be done).<br />
<br />
There is some strategy to soloing, with planning out how to use abilities.  Many are linked together on same timers.  Many will debate this saying there isn't a lot of strategy, but as far as I'm concerned there never was much strategy in EQ in the early levels from a melee perspective and Horizons has done a lot better melee wise than EQ.  I can't really comment on casters, but I get the idea they are done better in EQ.<br />
<br />
Grouping - Never really did much myself, I'll let someone else answer that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn Veryien</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For groups, we had to have differing strategies based on the mobs. Groups function really well against boss mobs otherwise you can camp for experience  (if you want) or just continually crawl places. Both work equally well.<br />
<br />
But against bosses and named, the problem is different. These mobs all come with an entourage of personal bodyguards. It may be as few as 2 bodyguards and as many as 8 on most mobs. The guards cannot be separated (in my personal experience) from the group or the boss, nor can the boss be separated.<br />
<br />
One strategy would be to use a higher level tank to engage the boss with healing backup. Then additional melees engage and kill guards, or archers can pinion (snare) and kite guards.<br />
<br />
This was the basic strategy we used at end of beta to handle the level 95s and 100s. A high level tank would tank with heal backup while the rest of us cleared his guards, then the rest pile on the boss to kill.<br />
<br />
Differences between levels are much smaller than in EQ. A level 50 in EQ would not be able to tank a 65 named but in Horizons that would be very possible with extra heal support. The growth in power of a character is fairly constant over his career rather than sudden bursts upwards that we saw in EQ. A 55 EQ warrior is a very different beast than a 65 EQ warrior but in Horizons a 60 tank of one class is not so far off from an 80 tank of the same class. The HP difference (before buffs and gear with HP bonuses) is 20 levels times 20 HP per level so just 400 HP total.<br />
<br />
You start with 50 HP at level one so for warriors and warrior derivatives you can calculate base HP as follows:<br />
<br />
((Level - 1) * 20) + 50.<br />
<br />
Other classes and subclasses get different HP modifers per level.<br />
<br />
P.S. Those values are from beta and we'll have to see if the same values apply in release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With EQ, soloing is a friggin nightmare at higher levels, &amp; the imbalances between classes have taken some of the fun out of it for me along the line. <br />
<br />
This whole thing sounds pretty cool though, more in line with what I'm interested in from a 3D ORPG.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atanas</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played in the Beta for about 2 months.<br />
<br />
Towards the end I was getting very bored..  BUT,  it is hard to tell if this was due to the game itself or to the fact that so little was shown to the beta testers (or so they tell us).<br />
<br />
As is,  I consider HZ to have the best &quot;system&quot; on release compared to all the other on-liners I have played (and I have played 95% of them, most of them during the beta).<br />
<br />
Well,  that is no quiet correct..  Hmm,  HZ has the best crafting system I've ever seen. The quest system seems to be on par with DaoC system (journal book and the like) but without the complex EQ epic quests ( Very likely cause they did not want us to see them).<br />
<br />
Game might even develop the big raids of EQ whilst keeping the &quot;casual friendly&quot; nature of it, it depends on how the melee system is developed.<br />
<br />
This brings me to the melee system. I felt it lacking.<br />
<br />
Magic fighting seem to be fun (I did play a Druid to lvl 20), bow system was fun (if you like to kite as a soloist) but,  on the last day of the beta pinion was broken.  Without Pinion bow/arrow becomes more or less a pulling tool only.<br />
<br />
Melee,  hmm,  no idea if this was due to the lag (which was fixed towards the end, or at least reduced a lot) or bad design..  But, imho, it sucks.<br />
<br />
No,  not talking about the stances system.  I actually LIKE them. It is the actual &quot;feel&quot; to it.<br />
<br />
It has an elastic feel to it.  You DO get used to it, but once you attack with melee weapons you can think as if there is an elastic band joining you and the mob..  It can be annoying sometimes, and downright dangerous when there is a bit of lag (as it seems there is when you group up).  If you forget to stop melee attacking u simple can't run away (that invisible elastic band keeps on pushing you towards the mob).  <br />
<br />
It destroyed melee fighting for me.  It just does not feel right.  Hey, I love EQ,  but I will be the first one to say that melee fighting sucks in EQ..  Well,  after melee fighting in HZ for a bit I could go to EQ and actually ENJOY the EQ melee system..  :)<br />
<br />
As it is, it makes MTing (main tanking) a joke.  You CAN do it,  but it is a pain,  that together with the strange agro makes MT tanking EQ style not likely under the current system.  Considering this is a PvE system I feel that melee should have a more realistic and fluid system.  When you compare it to the beuty of the crafting system and the fluidity of the casting/archery fighting system it simply sucks.  <br />
<br />
I still do not know if I will get this game.  I will wait and see I guess.  I did get burn buying SWG to just become a beta tester.<br />
<br />
Problem is, HZ beta had a lot less content than the SWG beta did.  As much as I wish I could believe that they decided NOT to test a lot of content for some strange reason, I will not be parting with my money as easily as I have done in the past.<br />
<br />
What will make or break this game wont be lag and fps.  Both are important,  but, as long as people can see that there is a good game behind these problems they will stick around till they are fixed.<br />
<br />
Nah,  what will determine the future of this game will be how much extra content is on the release version and the continued effort to improved gameplay and content on a monthly basis.<br />
<br />
I get a feeling this game will sell well.  Not as well as DaoC and SWG did on release,  but well enough to have a healthy initial population.  <br />
<br />
They simply need to keep the people interested.  <br />
<br />
I will troll the official boards,  get a feeling of how the game is going, if it seems like it is going in the right direction then I will buy it in January.. If too many are upset by then then this game will be headed the same way as AC2 and SWG.  Only time will tell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn Veryien</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember, Atanas, some content in this game will be highly dynamic and based on the current game map plus the worldmaster's choices of &quot;moves&quot; on his RTS type console.<br />
<br />
If they can keep that type of stuff happening frequently, players could have a blast defending towns, taking back ruined towns, and freeing other races.<br />
<br />
Plus there are at least 3 unexplored &quot;realms&quot; similar to the EQ planes and at least 2 more continents that were on the beta map but are not yet accessible in release.</div></div><hr />
