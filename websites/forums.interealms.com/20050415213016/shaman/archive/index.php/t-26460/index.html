Okay, then what about a FAIR proposal on how to do this.  I'm sure I haven't thought of all of the negative ramifications of this suggestion (and I'm sure you all will be there to tell me) but what about a proposal of the following:<br />
<br />
Keep the 30 second recast time<br />
Double the mana spell cost<br />
Half the proc rate on PC and adjust the proc rate on pets to match<br />
Increase the spell duration to 10 minutes<br />
<br />
This won't be killer burst DPS any more (but it looks like it won't be with the 30 second recast time, anyway), but it will be a meaningful buff that will add something to the group or raid without turning us into bards.<br />
<br />
Feel free to completely dismiss / trash this idea, here:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">30 secs recast --&gt; door for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maybe its just me, but by adding 30 secs to the recast of this spell broke it for me.  When the patch goes live with a 30 sec adjustment the spell goesto the back of the book.<br />
<br />
The great thing about the Panther line was that even though it was a mana hog and it had a short duration I could get all the casting done in 10 seconds in a group.  I didnt have to spend time maintaining the spell.  If a fight lasted longer than a minute it was no trouble to hit players with it again.  Bam bam bam done...back to healing or making mana.  With a 30 second version it becomes FA where I have to worry about timers running on 2 pets and a melee or two; counting seconds while Im trying to have fun is NO fun.<br />
<br />
In its current form (no recast) the Panther line is like a one night stand: its fast, its fun, and once its done (cast wise) its done untill I feel like doing it again and I can do it with alot of people at one time.  With a 30 secind recast, the same spell, with the same effect, becomes like a marrige to a fat, hairy, demanding wife that requires close attention and lots of maintainence.  I might be the only one that feels this way, but thats how I feel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another advantage is you could unmem it and drop another spell in (buff etc) and remem it quickly so it could sit in a non-dedicated spell slot.  But if the recast time goes up and you intend to use it then you have to keep it memed and dedicate a spell slot for it.  This is one of the big reasons I do not use FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wont fight a small recast time to prevent the &quot;Channelburn Panther the WHOLE RAID&quot; scenario, but 30 is RIGHT OUT. <br />
<br />
10 seconds is reasonable. 20 procs a minute on pets is reasonable. I think we will end up with more than 10 re-cast and less than 20 procs though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>zurxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What would be wrong with this being group only for PC's; and Shaman pet only.  How game-breaking would that be?  No other changes to the current form at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The patch message says reduced to match the rate that PC's proc. So they'll be proccing less even with the 150 adjustment on their own spells. Mages and Beastlords will have fun with this one...<br />
<br />
I'm fighting a recast time. In this day and age, every single class had recast timers REMOVED. Why are we getting one added on? Malos, Slow, Bih li, Sow, FA, Canni, Pet, Bane, Rains are just some of the spells we have that have a recast timer. How about. Remove all those recast timers and I'll take this 30 second recast with a smile on my face.<br />
<br />
I'd rather them increase the mana cost or decrease the duration. However, note that I said it's an OR statement. ONE OR THE OTHER.</div></div><hr />
