<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I completed the 8th cudgel quest in Howling Stones, I saw the following text:<br />
<br />
&quot;…The spirit of Rile begins to shudder and shake, the bones fly from your hands to meet their rightful soul. The spirit and bones being to glow and meld into one another, forming a swirling mass of ethereal energy. Abani begins to mouth incantations in an unfamiliar tongue. Their voice rises ever higher as mystic energy surges through the room…&quot;<br />
<br />
Since I was the first to finish this quest (and the 7th) as far as I know, I assumed this was the usual quester-name substitution.  But yesterday someone who just got their 8th cudgel on Tunare told me they had seen the same thing!: &quot;Abani begins to mouth incantations in an unfamiliar tongue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Can anyone else confirm this?  I wonder if someone is pulling my… tail. ;-)<br />
<br />
Also, there’s one more thing I’m curious about.  When I turned in the box to the Iksar apparition, I saw this:<br />
<br />
Vauris Sathir throws the relics….  Vauris Sathir’s insane cackling turns to unholing waiting as his remains are ripped apart and joined with the swirling mass of bone and spirit that swirls over the platform…<br />
<br />
So, Vauris’ remains were joined to turn the swirling-mass into Venril Sathir (which makes for a pretty weird twist on the whole story). Yet some other accounts have suggested that the apparition immediately turns into Venril Sathir after the hand-in.  Can anyone who’s recently finished the quest clarify whether they also saw the apparition turn into Vauris?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Abani</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I didn't notice when I first did it (and failed).  Second time I definitely saw Vauris Sathir appear and walk across the room (rather quickly) to the bone mass.  I didn't wanna get too close, so I missed some of the text.<br />
<br />
Found my logs, took some searching =)<br />

[Mon Mar 25 23:15:56 2002] You say, 'Hail, The spirit of Rile'<br />
[Mon Mar 25 23:15:56 2002] The spirit of Rile thoughts invade your mind.  'You have done well Cakaris, the second terror of Venril Sathir has finally ended.  I request but one last thing of you.  Use your Skyiron cudgel to reunite my spirit with my stolen corpse so that I can find a final resting place. <br />
[Mon Mar 25 23:15:59 2002] Your protection fades.<br />
[Mon Mar 25 23:16:02 2002] The spirit of Rile says 'Use your cudgel to unite my soul with my body CakarisT '<br />
[Mon Mar 25 23:16:02 2002] The spirit of Rile begins to shudder and shake, the bones fly from your hands to meet their rightful soul.  The spirit and bones being to glow and meld into one another, forming a swirling mass of ethereal energy.  Cakaris begins to mouth incantations in an unfamiliar tongue.  Their voice rises ever higher as mystic energy surges through the room.  Then, in a suddenly flash, the spirit and corpse disappear without a trace, leaving only Cakaris holding a Faintly glowing Cudgel in his hand. <br />

I missed logging the first part where I hand in the relis.</div></div><hr />
