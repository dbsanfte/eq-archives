<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frogtor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I bet u have hear this one about 10000 times before. I am a lvl 64 and i am looking for some good Farming spots. items that sell good in the baz, Vendor loot, or just cash in genral. anything would help.<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Droga or the inner section of Acrylia Caverns.  Maybe Harbinger's Spire if you have good HP/Mana and are comfortable with pet pulls.<br />
<br />
Tsuyoi / Kany</div></div><hr />

This isn't a get-rich-quick scheme, but you'll also end up level 70, which is a huge huge bonus.</div></div><hr />

would if i chould but i don't have OoM might be gettng it soon though,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if you absolutely need to farm, there are several places you can get money, farming velium in CC used to be a favorite of a druid friend of mine, he'd train the orcs and let them beat them selves to death on his DS.<br />
<br />
personally, I like instant gratification with money, so if I'm farming at all, its rare drops in old zones. you can get a few thousand plat for the right drop.<br />
<br />
class specific utilities, clickies and such will always go for alot (i.e. BRD ROG tradable illusion clickies) rare and unusual weapons, and some tradeskill stuff (pottery in particular)<br />
<br />
there are literally thousands of items to hunt for, just find one thats easy for you to obtain, and sells for what you'd like.<br />
<br />
but for the most consistant cash, group in higher-end zones. a single rune drop can net you a pretty penny if it is greed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Man, all I was trying to do was trick him into levelling.  Once you get up there and look around, you'll see buyable gear isn't really &quot;where it's at,&quot; anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">seriously....before I was flagged for any higher zones, I could only upgrade 2 of my slots from the bazaar, and none of the rest of my gear was sellable. ALL no drop...but, it comes with the territory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My quickest solo cash spot to this day is the PoJ basement....my suggestion is to go down there during off times and clear the small hall with 4 spawns, run into the big room and set up camp in the corner that is to the right of the door.  There is 1 wraith spawn and then row after row of rocks n alien quarterbacks.  This is a ridiculously easy camp to hold down solo and all the rock and alien dudes drop tons and tons of diamonds and other junk that vendor sells for 50-100pp each.  If I am paying attention and actually killing fast, even pre-65, I could consistantly net 2-3k per hour.  If they are all still dblue to you, you will need to use a root-pull strategy...they are aligned in rows of 2....root one and then immediately put fluffy on the &quot;free&quot; one and get it slowed.  While fluffy bites your slowed one, turn back and slow and dot your rooted one, then return your attention to finishing the 1st one that is beating on you.  They do not hit hard.<br />
<br />
Only downside is that if you gate to go sell stuff, you will need to clear hall to get back down again.<br />
<br />
If you find yourself comfortable straight up tanking them, then buy yourself a set of mage weaps for fluffy, they will die a LOT faster and save you oodles of mana.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hehe, last time I visited that hall, to flag a friend's friend, or twink, or something (don't recall, sue me), I just walked straight down the middle clicking TA on each mob.  Didn't even clear them, just pulled all with Turgur and stood there while guy walked back to Mavuin.  It was funny he's like &quot;/g ADD!&quot; every 5sec till he got what was happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">haha I saw a couple people do that before also but sometimes they got too close to the guardian at the end and invariably someone would die :P<br />
<br />
Muahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frogtor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ty all for the info, close to 65 than i am going to get ooW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But the guardian doesn't assist, how would they get agro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">He's just like the hall guardians, if you are killing things right next to him, he attacks also.  He doesn't socially agro in the sense that if you pull mobs around him he comes too, but does agro if you are killing too near him.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zilaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well... I at level 60 make over 1.5-2k an hour in the Wakening land killing panthers and haze panthers. On my server the black panther hides sell 150-300 each, and the gear sells for a prety penny if you know somone that can make it. The haze panthers are rare, but have a common drop of a haze panther eye which sells for 1.5-2k each.. (also stackable)</div></div><hr />
