A crisp morning breeze swept across the Ocean of Tears and filled the sails of the Runesinger as it journeyed toward its destination with haste and purpose. It was as if Tunare herself sped their journey, for they had covered a great distance and were almost upon Antonica in a very short amount of time. That wasn’t exactly unusual for the Runesinger. She was blessed by the Clerics of Tunare, built by the strong hands of the followers of Brell and was loved fiercely by her captain. Truly, the Runesinger stood out amongst King Tearis Thex’s fleet. It was both the most regaled and feared ship in the Ocean of Tears and was reserved for the King’s use alone. Very rarely did the ship sail without the King himself aboard and when it did it was under his direct orders and done in utmost secrecy. That is why when word of an ancient Elven relic found deep beneath the streets of Freeport reached the King’s ears—and he had many ears in many, many places—he dispatched an envoy and his best guards to retrieve it for study in the great Elven libraries.<br />
<br />
“You’ll be glad to be home, I take it?” Polyhymnia said, leaning her lithe Elven body against the railing and taking in the salt air. Her Helven brother shrugged with disinterest and watched as a single black seagull hovered in the air, swaying to and fro as it flew against the wind. “You’ve been quiet lately. You haven’t come to eat with us and I hear you stay out on the deck all night, watching the sky. Are you looking for something?”<br />
<br />
“I’m thinking,” Kryssniall said. “I don’t like going back to Freeport, and nothing good will come of it.”<br />
<br />
“You came to Felwithe five years ago a well-traveled adventurer. You’ve been to the lost continents and explored ancient ruins; you’ve been to the frozen wastelands and have even spent time in the Castellum upon Luclin. You tell amazing stories of the things you’ve seen and experienced, but never once have you mentioned your life before leaving Freeport to seek adventure. I didn’t even know I had a brother until you showed up in Felwithe looking for mother. What happened that you don’t want to talk about it? I’m your sister, Kryssniall.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, Marr.” Kryssniall aid, rolling his eyes “Every time you use my full name you get into one of your moods and want to chastise me. You’ve told me before that I’m too closed off. I don’t let people near to me.”<br />
<br />
“You certainly make it difficult for them.”<br />
<br />
“It has a lot to do with what happened in Freeport.”<br />
<br />
“So tell me,” she urged. Smiling, she poked at his side and he squirmed. She always liked the fact that her big strong brother was ticklish.<br />
<br />
“Do you know what these mean?” Kryssniall said, turning to face his sister and holding out his wrists to her. They were heavily scarred where deep gouges had been repeatedly cut into them. She turned away and frowned. Seeing them always bothered her.<br />
<br />
“I assume that whatever happened in Freeport was wretched enough that you had tried to kill yourself. Perhaps the love of the wrong woman or some disgrace.”<br />
<br />
Kryssniall guffawed and one of the deck hands turned to look at him. He shot them a menacing glare and covered his wrists. They returned to their quiet duty with the rigging. “Not quite. This is how you’re purged.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t understand.”<br />
<br />
“And you’re not likely to. It’s a long and complicated story and it ends in a bad way.”<br />
<br />
“I’m going to find out one way or another,” Polyhymnia said, tracing her finger over his scars and weaving a little magic over them, but the spell shattered as it touched skin. She drew her hand away and he slipped his gloves back on. “Kryssniall, please.”<br />
<br />
“Then you’ll have to find out from someone else.”<br />
<br />
“Why won’t you let me close? I’m your sister. I try and try, but just as I think I’m getting through to you I get shoved away.”<br />
<br />
“Why won’t you grow up?” Kryssniall said, a tad harsher than he intended. “Do you think my sharing my secrets with you will make us more a family? I am not one of your childhood girlfriends, tittering in the dark over your diaries and crushes. Secrets shared will not solidify our bond. We don’t have to tell one another everything. I am grateful for you, I truly am. You are beyond a doubt the best thing that has ever come into my life in a long time. I would die for you, Polly. Isn’t that enough? Do I have to tell you the one thing I don’t even want to admit to myself? Leave me my waking nightmares, I’ve no desire to share them.”<br />
<br />
Polyhymnia stood silent for a long time, watching as the ocean parted for the Runesinger and carried them closer to the nearing landmass. Despite the cool air, the sun warmed her and felt alive on her skin. She turned to look at her brother, but his gaze had wavered to the horizon, to the silhouetted city waiting for them. She squeezed his hand. “All right,” she said. “I won’t press you. I’m just concerned.”<br />
<br />
“Be concerned for the relic,” Kryssniall said, turning to leave. “That’s why we’re here. I intend to have us out of that forsaken city before nightfall. I’d like to be back in Faydwer in time to attend the Feast of the Rakthokian Betrayal. I’ve heard amazing stories of the celebration the Dwarves have. I don’t imagine I’d like anything more than to see them drunkenly reenact Dagnor’s demise.”<br />
<br />
Polyhymnia watched her brother disappear below deck and frowned. She knew he had his secrets, and she had to respect that, but she couldn’t help but feel concern over how going home again would affect him. Freeport loomed behind her, stretching closer and closer as if growing to swallow them whole.</div></div><hr />
