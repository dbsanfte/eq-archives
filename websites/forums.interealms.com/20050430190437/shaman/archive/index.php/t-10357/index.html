<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First a quick question about Macros. When you do something like a heal, and have a /gsay line, where do you implement it? How sdo you deal with things like interruptions and fizzles? Do you just use the macro first and then if its interrupted or fizzles cast again manually?<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for the real question. How do you cast your spells? Do you use the hotkeys for all of them? Do you use the Alt+# system for casting from cells? Do you click? Do you have a custom setup?<br />
<br />
I personally used the Hotkeys but as I got more and more clicky items I ran out of easily accessible hotkey slots so I started using the Alt+# system, even though I find it somewhat akward after a few weeks of using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I only use hotkeys for torpor (so others dont heal me), and can5 (so others know why I just lost 2000 hp).  I get rather annoyed when grouping with people who have a hotkey for everything (assisting {tank}on %T!) over and over and over.  For fizzles, yer SOL, either cast manually, or just hit the hotkey again.  I've been known to 'Torpor on {wrong target}' 'Torpor on {another wrong target}' 'torpor on cakaris' {fizzle} 'Torpor on Cakaris' before I get one to land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Morrighan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I only have 2 hotkeys set up at the moment; Slow and Healing. If I get a fizzle (or resist), my party gets to read the hotkey message again  :)<br />
<br />
As for casting other spells, I use the alt + # method almost exclusively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I only use a hotkey for canni 5.  I have a hot key for canni, but it doesnt have a message for it.  My messages I fire off seperately once a spell has landed, got them for Slow, Malo, Cripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">im an alt # caster. in fact in almost 2 years on my shaman i just made my first hotkey attatched to a spell this last week for healing during raids.i have a few other hotkeys with slow/not slowed/malo msgs, but this was my first tied to a spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm a huge fan of hotkeys.  Here's a thread I put on my guild board this past week describing my shaman hotkeys:<br />
<br />
http://pub29.ezboard.com/ffacelessvengeancefrm16.showMessage?topicID=1.topic<br />
<br />
<br />
I like to have my slow (turgur's) hotkeyed so I can cast it with the press of one button ( I used to use Alt + spell gem slot number, but this hotkey way is quicker).  In mulitple mob situations, being able to cast slow by hitting a number key saves valuable seconds  :)<br />
<br />
That said, I have a separate hotkey with a message to group/raid that a mob is ACTUALLY slowed.  I do not hit this one until it lands.<br />
<br />
I have heal hotkeyed for casting as well.  Message says &quot;I am HEALING %T!&quot;.  If it fizzles I just press the key again...still quicker that clicking on spell gem or Alt + number.<br />
<br />
Several other hotkey's discussed in that thread I linked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are a few sides to this....<br />
1) Announcing a spell so someone else doesn't waste mana casting it to (e.g. heals)<br />
2) Announcing a spell has landed so others can stop trying, or healers know they can relax (e.g. slow)<br />
3) Announcing something as a warning (e.g. Canni V)<br />
4) Hotkeying for fast access<br />
<br />
<br />
With that in mind, I have a hotkey for torpor and kragg's mending that announces the heal and casts it. In case of fizzle or interrupt I hit it again, or alt-# or mouse click. Can lead to some spam but I find that far better than landing Kragg's just for a cleric CH to hit <br />
1 second later.<br />
<br />
For point 2 - I have a seperate hotkey to announce slow and malosini landing. I hit them after the spell lands successfully. On trash mobs I normally don't bother.<br />
<br />
For point 3 - I have a hotkey for canni V for conveniance and to warn the group why my health is dropping<br />
<br />
For point 4 - I have a hotkey for slow (to cast it) so its in easy reach.<br />
<br />
There's a need to balance spamming the group with inane comments (I'm assisting xx, I'm nuking yy - who cares?) and informing them of important things and preventing wasted heals etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For my cleric to avoid fizzles I use a /pause.<br />
<br />
/g casting complete heal for %t<br />
/cast 5<br />
/pause 6<br />
/cast 5<br />
<br />
If I fizzle, the second cast will go into effect, if I don't, it'll just say I can't do that while casting.  Haven't really found it to be an issue with the shaman, but especially with a multi boxed cleric, I don't want to chance a fizzle while I'm busy slowing etc on my main screen.  I suppose it's theoretically possible to fizzle twice in a row, but fortunately rare enough to not be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hotkey bank #4 is dedicated to casting spells for me.<br />
<br />
1-8 cast the spells.  9 is sit, 10 is canni dance hotkey.  Clicky items are on a different page :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a hotkey for Slow and Malo for raids on particular mobs.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I don't use them.   Too much spam as is with everything else people do.  If a cleric wants to heal me after I canni, so be it.  I dun care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use hotkeys but I dont use pause anymore ... too may wierd things happen with it.  I am turning more and more into an alt-# caster as i dont like switching banks of hot keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My thumb is perma camped right above my ALT key the whole time I'm playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shantan Maverick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I changed my spell hotkey maps to point to the numbers on the numeric pad, with spell book in 9 and sit in 0.  That way I still have all 10 hotkey slots for messages and clickies.</div></div><hr />
