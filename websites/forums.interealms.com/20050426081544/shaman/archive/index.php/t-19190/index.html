My sk has 3325 hps and 1316 ac so he's a twink, my shaman is also a twink, 856 ac and 1459 hps.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sathak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Head to the City of Mist.  I got my shaman from ~41 to 51 and my SK from 55 to 56, spending most of my time in this zone.  The SK leveling was incidental, but I wasn't about to complain.<br />
<br />
Camp near the zone in, have both your pet and the SK's pet up and hasted.  I only bothered to buff the SK aside from that, the pets were just for extra damage.  On the way to the Emerald Jungle, I would usually kill skellies and bandits in the Field of Bone until I had some weapons for our pets.<br />
<br />
Buff the SK with your best HP, stat, regen, and haste.  Keep your best heal and slow loaded.  Sk pulls and tanks, pets beat on the mob.  Most of the time his taps and the regen were sufficient so that I didn't need to heal him for 3 or 4 mobs, even in the event that I didn't slow.  Entrance mobs in CoM have between 1200 and 1600 HP, and a hasted 55 SK with a decent weapon, plus two hasted DW pets, should kill them awfully fast.  Plus, they don't hit particularly hard, and if you slow them they're helpless.  I only bothered to slow mobs that were dark blue to the SK.<br />
<br />
Exp for the SK was poor but considering that most mobs in that area are green, it wasn't as bad as I would have thought.  I could keep a large part of the entrance area clear.  If you go to the left near the stables, occasionally you'll get a dark blue (to 55) Ravenous War Boned Skeleton, which drops a nice bracer and a nice belt, for plate classes though.  Occasionally you'll also get a Mighty Golem, which usually drops the Mace of the Shadowed Soul (once a must-have SK weapon, now you can't give them away).<br />
<br />
Exp for the shaman was amazing right through level 50, at which point I started joining LDoN groups, but I came back long enough to finish off level 50 and ding 51.<br />
<br />
Another benefit- I collected all of the pages I need for that part of the epic quest, and I learned how to quickly clear a path to easily and safely grab the High Scale Icon as well.  I also managed to get a couple of drops of the Strange Ochre Clay, though I have not completed the Canni 2 quest.</div></div><hr />
