<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dont know whats out there that I can buy. My server is still pretty young (FV) so some items you expect to see commonly arent around at all. I already intend to buy a Lodi Shield (run 15-20k on my server), not really interested in a Heiro right now, and besides, they are VERY hard to find on the market on my server. Also gonna hunt up a Death Mask of the Elysians. I will probably also save 9k for a cheap horse, unless somethin else is out there. 9k isnt too hard to hunt up. My preferences are obviously high AC/HP, and gear with saves is nice. I would rather not have to carry around a bunch of resist gear. Also, as far as I know, no barbs on my server making Artificer's yet, but if there are I'm thinking about the skirt and legs. Oh also, Fungi's are pretty much non-existant. I also won't wear coldain skin gloves, I might get shissar scaled or somethin once I get over 1k AC.</div></div><hr />
