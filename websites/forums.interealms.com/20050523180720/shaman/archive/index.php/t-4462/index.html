<br />
When I was getting my tear, I was having a hard time getting a golem that was up (they were all three getting killed as soon as they popped).  I was therefore very happy when a pickup raid of some friends gave me a /tell and told me that they were taking down Terror and come to off the Iksar Brat.<br />
<br />
As I was discussing this with Chandara who's always very snotty with me at the portal for some reason, the scaleybutt kid spawns.  I zone in to an almost empty fear.  I get a tell that the Iksar kid is down, probably due to a bard AoE or a mage pet, nobody knows, so I'm in panic mode now, with only 5 minutes to loot her.  They tell me to follow the left wall and go to some coordinates.  I'm happily whumping my way across the zone to a very different place than I've pulled Terror to in the past.  Passing through a red curtain, I come upon a red building.  I decide to stop and ask directions.<br />
<br />
Picture a big white bear bursting into the building.  The congregation stops chanting and slowly turns around.  The big white bear ****s himself and starts backing out of the building.......  Needless to say, the Armegeddon Priests got themselves a new bearskin altar cloth.<br />
<br />
It turns out that instead of the left wall, they wanted me to go to the wall and turn left and go.  The coordinates were reversed, so I was N when I should be S.  It was an altogather frustrating, funny and humiliating experience!  But later, I got my tear and my epic and they all lived happily ever after  :)<br />
