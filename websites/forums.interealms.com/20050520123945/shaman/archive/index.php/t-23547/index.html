<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">so....no click slow on epic then? beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its a 4000 hp group HoT.. dont complain :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well considering they can now put recast delays on clickies I would imagine it's a long recast and thus far less useful then at first it would appear. This is Sony we are talking about after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can we switch effects with the Wizard epic, please(just remove the Instant Spells only)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
It is basically a mana-free Q that lasts a minute for the whole group PLUS the crit modifiers.  Barring SoE adding a recast delay I'd be pretty happy with that, since 1.5 is supposed to be single groupable according to rumours.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If that is the epic effect and the recast is 1 min it will be nice if not it will not be good . I will probly still use slow stick and only use epic for click buff .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Though we don't know the stats/bonuses on the new epics either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">pfft, sometimes I curse Lucy as I think its better that spells and certain other things are a surprise and have that element of discovery when the expansion comes out. Like maybe say the epic effect only discovered when the first person completes it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">At last, an answer to two of the biggest problems Shaman have, bad healing and lots of aggro!<br />
<br />
Kudos, Sony!<br />
<br />
Oh wait, they put it on an item... A LONG quested item... That will no doubt only be completed by hte top of the top who get into the one keyed zone.<br />
<br />
What do you mean, &quot;Remember when the first epic was reversed&quot;... Oh.. Dead group, I see</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Whats 1.5 about? is this a partially completed Epic 2 with a lesser effect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can't really see this coming without a recast delay. I'm not entirely sure I would want it without a recast delay either. Without one, you could keep a 400hp heal on everyone in your group constantly, plus crit modifiers ? For something that may be one groupable thats a bit much, so of course it would probably have a long casting time. I don't know about you, but I don't want to end up having to click and wait 10 or more seconds every minute just to keep this effect up. I am already running short on time, I barely sit down to regain mana any longer.<br />
<br />
With a recast delay of a few minutes (5-15), a short casting time can be applied, so it can be used when its needed. Wether that need is extra group healing, or the crit mod things if they actually work well.<br />
<br />
What a craptacular focus effect though. Even if wanting less hate was what I really wanted, what is 4-6% going to do ? I can't remember the last time slow aggro got me eaten, or even beat on for a little bit. Of course I guess I could use a poison dot without getting aggro now, o wait its already dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm curious as to what the stacking issues will end up being. 400hp free HoT for 1 min is great, unless it doesnt stack with Trushar's or the OoW HoT. In which case, it will be a short lived buff that either A) gets overwritten as soon as you use your real HoT or B) you stop using your real HoT so the melee dont get bent out of shape for wiping their crit modifiers. I'll have to see it in action to determine what's more beneficial, the actual parsed increase in dps the buff gives or the extra nudge in healing the HoT gives to help me keep people alive. It will be interesting to see which way SOE ends up going on stacking issues for all of the new epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Whats 1.5 about? is this a partially completed Epic 2 with a lesser effect?<br />
<br />
According to Holly (nice dev at the guild summit) there are intermediate rewards for completing epics. The intermediate reward is supposed to be pretty nice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm betting that the 1.5 version is the one most people will be able to complete, and the 2.0 version with full uber stats will be the one thats much much harder to finish that will only be seen by top end guilds for a while.   <br />
<br />
Which I think is a fair compromise to allow both high end players to get a useful item, and the average joe to get an epic as well.    Because if they only made one version it would either be very good and hard to get so that high end guilds had it, or it would be fairly easy to get but wouldn't be worth getting for many high end raiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Meia_Hexendoktor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">anyone have a screenshot of 1.5 or 2.0?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah, after seeing the Magician Epic (http://www.magecompendium.com/images/magician_epic_2_screen.jpg) I'm really curious to see what ours looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The epics may have additional effects as well beyond the proc/focus mentioned in that link. For example, these look like they belong to the shaman epics:<br />
<br />
Prophet's Guide (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6387&amp;source=Test)  (likely on epic 1.5)<br />
Prophet's Channeling (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6403&amp;source=Test)  (likely on epic 2.0)<br />
<br />
There are a total of 15 such paired effects on Lucy, and probably are secondary foci/procs on the epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&quot;Increase Spell Resist Rate by 40%&quot;<br />
<br />
That sounds like a bad thing, unless it's supposed to make YOU more resistable to other PC/NPCs spells. =P<br />
I should really go to bed and stop trying to use my brain when it's tired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Its an increase in resists against spells cast on you, as long as they meet the criteria set out. So, most dots and debuffs, but not dds. Its a an increase to chance to resist, so if you had a 20% chance to resist, the focus would increase your chance to resist to 28%. However, I see that the necro epic 1.5 has been apparently found, and it doesnt have an additional focus, so its possible that these belong some other class specific items in the game.</div></div><hr />
