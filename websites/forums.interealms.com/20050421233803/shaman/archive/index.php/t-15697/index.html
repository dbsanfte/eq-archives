<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We went from 40 to 48 in a few days in Grimling Forest.  The critters are setup so that you can single/duo pull almost all of them from the encampments.  They drop runes which sell for 1 plat to 3 plat a piece, and there is a kitty camp in the zone with a banker/merchant to sell to.  The zone is 99% of the time empty so it's never a problem finding a camp or worrying about trains.<br />
<br />
I highly suggest it.  Just take the shar vahl stone to Shar Vahl, then to Hollowshade, then to Grimling.  Bout a 5 minute trek with sow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">40-48 in a couple of days? what percent exp per kill (or how much blue per kill) on these things? The high MR of mobs in dulaks and gunthak is getting on my nerves and I need a break. thanks for sharing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It was anywhere between 1% to 2%. <br />
<br />
We started off duoing as a shaman/shadowknight (with some soloing when the SHD was offline but its obviously not as fast).  Later on when we had hit 46 (me) / 44 (SHD) we invited a level 32 shaman to group with us just to hang out.  Come to find out he was also getting 1% to 2% per kill with us grouped.<br />
<br />
Now when I say a couple of days I mean weekend days.. so thats 10-15 hour exp sessions.  In reality I supose its more like a week if your playing normal hours and of course more DPS means faster leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I checked it out last night (lv42) and started soloing a bandit/thug camp and 2 pulled a shaman and a thug and had to gate. Man I hate fighting mobs of our own class. Are the regular grimling camps all warrior types?</div></div><hr />

Please give some more info on this camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heck if you move more more zone to the north Temberous Mountians you'll find some more grimmlings to kill in the two caves on the south wall.  Or once you hit about 44-45 you can kill the Aliens/Wolfs/Bats.  The Grimmlings in the caves are set up in pairs but tend to have very low HP except for the Foreman but good exp and cash items.  To break the spawn of the grimlings there is a Ledge to the east of the first cave that you can pull to that should be out of agro range so once root breaks they dont come up to visit till you go back in range.  Just root one and back up to your ledge wait for it to arrive sick puppy and slow.  Repeat till first 3 sets of mobs are killed and then move into the cave next to the NPC there.  You will have one roaming Laborer that will roam into the cave if the other cave is not camped.  Should be 1.5%exp till about 44 then it starts slowing down due to light blues.  At that point start killing the aliens, wolfs, and Bats that roam the zone near the Katta zone if your not Evil race or At the Grimmling forest zone.  The Grimmling Runner will spawn every 90 mins at the grimmling forest zoneline like clockwork.  He drops ore, gems, and Always a pattern used in the relic pack.  Zone is rarely camp except for the castle &amp; caves some times.  The roamers are always out and about though and nice easy exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grimling Forest has a 5% xp bonus.<br />
<br />
Grimling Forest also suffers from extreem graphics lag so its not for the graphicaly challenged.<br />
<br />
That being said, what makes Grimling Forest great is that you can kill tons of mobs. Quantity over Quality.<br />
<br />
My 56 BST can make 1 AA solo every 5 hours killing lt blues in Grimling forest.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, my 55 Shaman can not, too much down time. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I killed in GF for a while.  found it when I was already level 48  8('<br />
<br />
The roaming mobs (bears and wolves, mostly) go up in level as you go from South to North.  At the far North I used to set up camp on the zone wall, just east of the little river (before it does down in to the canyon).  To the south is a little grimling village, with mobs that went LB on me at 49 or 50.  <br />
<br />
Just south of that village are two ridges that run east/west.  in the valley between them are 3 spawns that stayed DB to me to 52.  They were ususall Sonic Warwolves or some kind of owlbear.  they could also be Grimlings roaming in that valley.<br />
<br />
The Grimlings were easy kills and great exp.  The Owlbears were a bit harder, for the same exp.  The Warwolves are a pain - more resistant than the other mob types.  The warwolves also seemed to have more hp's than the others.  I would not recommend soloing the warwolves before 49.<br />
<br />
This camp was free of adds, and I liked it a lot more than killing similar mobs in tenebrous mountains.  loot was poor, especially since I usually wasn't killing grimlings.  <br />
<br />
By the way - any wolf in GF can drop an earring with 3 ac, 3 wis, 3 str, 3 cha.  They are no drop.  I got one off a low level wolf in the south side, and one off a warwolf when exp'ing.   several rotted, as well.  not great, by current standards, but free.</div></div><hr />
