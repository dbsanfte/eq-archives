<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ramanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Nice to meet you all,<br />
<br />
I have been popping around guildless for a while and checking out the different guilds to see which I might click with.  I have grouped with you guys a few times - and done a couple of mini raids as well and the people here seem really nice.  All though you have gained power you do not at all strike me as a power gaming guild - which I want no part of, too much bickering over Phat Lewts and such.  The fact that you have lvl 1 to lvl 60s here is good to see.  Membership based more on the person than the class/lvl.  I read the membership thing and would like to begin it.<br />
<br />
hmm, couple of things about me.<br />
<br />
First of all - my old guild was a RP guild and I RP'd as being crazy.  So if you ever see me boasting about my pet Thumpy &quot;aka - THUMPY THE BATTLE PET&quot; or that my nukes were decisive in a battle - it is all in fun.  <br />
<br />
I do a lot of trade skills - and will have some &quot;treats&quot; on me from time to time.  So if you are a dorf and I give you something labeled &quot;dwarf chops&quot; eat at your own risk.  Serlina has developed a liking for my hot and spicy toelings since I have known her! /wink<br />
<br />
I do a crap load of trade skills if anyone ever needs anything.  Tailoring has been the bane of my existance for the last 15 or so lvls but got it decent now - and am on the 7th part of my shawl (damn time sink hole).<br />
<br />
Tailoring 163<br />
Smithing  178<br />
Brewing   173<br />
Pottery   183<br />
Fletching 182<br />
Baking    142<br />
Fisherman 154<br />
<br />
I am on dorf faction of course but the dragons still hate me something fierce.  Want to repair faction but they kinda resented me killing there citizens and such.  My old guild was on Giant faction and I killed in there with them some.<br />
<br />
I generaly do not &quot;guild hop&quot; like some players do.  I was with my old guild for over a year, I just had a huge issue with a couple of the people there so I left.  Still on good terms with most of the people there.<br />

Great to see you posting here sweetie :)<br />
<br />
Keepers, this guy is such a sweetheart.. the kicker is I found out i know him IRL too!! former co-worker of mine.. talk about a small world!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway, Look forward to seeing you in game very soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hello, get to know as many of KoE members as possible. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice to meet you Ramanon. Look us up in game and we'll get you into some KoE groups. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Serlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BAH !!  he made me eat it and then he told me I was eating family  :(  Good to see you here  Ramanon !  Look us all up would love to see you in /gu someday  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Will do - going with ya to kill the general today!<br />
<br />
He hits like a bastard but not too tough.  I think  2 clerics (or maybe shammy/druid and a cleric) can keep up... As long as you got one mean arse main tank and some good damage dealers :).  Will see if my schedule is going to allow me to do the other stuff you guys posted.<br />
<br />
Pardon my ignorance...  but I know a couple of members in KoE but you guys are pretty large, and not quite sure how I am supposed to seek groups with yas.  Raids are easy - ya sign up for them and go.  But would seem kind of rude of me to randomly give tells to you guys asking if I can join one of your groups.  Kind of ignorant of the procedure - sorry.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Hopefully after tonight I will know some of you a little better.<br />
<br />
(and do not listen to serlina - I know she likes the toelings)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ramanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sorry to be a pain, but I have reconsidered joining KoE.  I have decided to remain guildless for the forseeable future.  All of you seem nice, but I have decided not to commit to any guild.  I will check out your site from time to time and help ya all out if you need it.  Or just give me a tell in game and I would be more than happy to help if I can<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zelfani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">as you wish .. of course..<br />
<br />
i did want to say that last eve was my first encounter with you and was quite impressed.. you took repeated deaths and not a dire word.. it had to be confusing with much of the raid discussion going on in /gu but you seemed to handle it all well.. <br />
<br />
again.. nice to finally meet you</div></div><hr />
