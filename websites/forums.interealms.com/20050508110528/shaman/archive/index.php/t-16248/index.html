<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Had a really bad time with a group last nigh in PoV and set me thinking of all my pet peeves in EQ.<br />
<br />
In no particular order<br />
<br />
Druids.<br />
Having a pet that cant innately dual wield.<br />
Group buffing everyone then as soon as it starts blinking later on someone saying Focus down,sta down etc.Theye group buffs so they wear out the same time on me as everyone else idiots  :o <br />
Clerics who ask for peri or donation for Virtue (in itself not a problem) but who then think they've got loot rights to everything still.<br />
Getting invited to a group then discovering they want you as the healer then finding out they still expect you to do everything else a Shaman is good at (This maybe a bit easier with Q but at 61 its not that easy).<br />
Leet,owned,pwned,gay I dont know why I just cant abide these words and many more words too numerous to mention.<br />
Rangers without AM who are hitting for about 60 per shot with their arrows and will not melee &quot;because rangers arent supposed to melee&quot;.<br />
Clerics who will NEVER heal a Shaman even after theyve been beat on after yet another resisted slow.<br />
Idiots (Fair few of these on EQ now or perhaps im just getting old).<br />
Sony Tech Helpline.<br />
<br />
Pah thats enough even though theres probably lots more.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Yeah really!  That drives me up the wall.  Last night I was in PoD with a guy who would mention any fading buff the second it started blinking.  <br />
<br />
Idiot: &quot;Sta fade.&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;I know, refreshing as we speak.&quot;<br />
Idiot: &quot;Haste fade.&quot;  <br />
Me: &quot;I'm on it, let me cast it on the other 3 people ahead of you in my cycle.&quot;<br />
Idiot: &quot;SoW fade&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;Its a group buff...&quot;<br />
Idiot: &quot;Can mez the adds coming Grim?&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;No.&quot;<br />
Idiot: &quot;Why not?!!&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;Shamans can't mez.&quot;<br />
Idiot: &quot;...oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so on and so forth....</div></div><hr />

*grumbles*  If you can afford to buy KEI and Virtue, you an afford to pay for your shaman buffs too.<br />
<br />
Also, people who not only auction in ooc and shout, but who have a hotkey that spams all three at once.<br />
<br />
And casinos.  <br />
<br />

well sorry to burst your bubble but i know for a fact that group buffs can wear off faster on one peep than the other.  i, 90% of the time, group with my monk both peeps are on different pc's.  somedays the buffs will wear off on me first, sometimes on the monk and sometimes at the sametime on both.  usualy there is a 10 second or so difference but it has been upto a minute.<br />
<br />
i don't know why it happenes and i don't know which one will go first till i've played through a round of buffs.<br />

I've noticed this myself, though I don't really know what causes it.  It used to really irritate me in groups til I started twoboxing and noticed it was really happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I noticed the same thing when duel boxing with my sk.  My shaman is 65 and my sk is 62.  Usually the buffs seem to wear off on him before me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I usually just appoint/ask someone (not the MT or puller) to be my 'buff timer' and they are the only person that needs to tell me when they start to drop.  That way everyone knows that Ranger_01 will keep me informed when buffs drop.  Works out pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As far as I know, the timers for buffs are kept client side. Each client clock is going to be off a small ammount and this causes the differences in buffs wearing off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well darkpaw you could assume if u could somehow slow ur internal clock ur buffs would last longer? i think they had a plm with people abusing stuff like this and run speed a long time ago so they moved certain values server side or changed them so they werent dependent on clock. i remember there being patch messages about people using side programs to mess with clock to speed up run speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Think why some Group buffs tend to wear off at different times is that at the moment the group buff is cast a packet is sent to the server.  Then from the server there is a packet sent to each PC that the buff landed on.  Now by this time there is a VERY good chance a TICK is going to have happened.  Most likely what has happened is some of the PC's get thier Packet during one tick while others get thier Packet during another.  This has now caused those that got thier packet late to get an addittional 6 secs of the buff.  If later they get thier packet telling them thier buff should now start to fad a bit late then guess what?  They get a few more seconds of a given buff.  Well that is how I see it.  Though I'll say it DOES annoy the heck out me when they wear off others faster then me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For whatever reason, I think group buffs tend to wear out slowest on the buffer. It's slightly annoying.<br />
<br />
I don't mind one person reminding me about buffs, I don't always notice them going when I'm busy, but I do object to, &quot;Sta down&quot;, &quot;me too&quot;, &quot;me too&quot;, &quot;mine too&quot;. Grrr.<br />
<br />
My pet peeves: &quot;rouge&quot;, &quot;ur&quot;, &quot;u&quot;.<br />
<br />
Pullers who refuse to pull without agi/FA/haste etc. I can do that just as well when they get back. I don't mind them waiting for HP, but will FA really help them pull?<br />
<br />
Monks/SKs who insist on FD pulling to get 1 mob instead of 2 when it takes 3 times as long when we have a good enchanter in the group. I'm sure the enchanters must hate this more.<br />
<br />
I might be getting impatient in my old age, but I find exp groups more fun with constant mobs coming, and best fun when it's a challenge, not just single pulls all the time. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm so the same way, I can't stand the sitting around staring at everyone wondering why no one has pulled. About this time is when I ask if they'd like me to pull =P<br />
And damn the group buff thing, I used to go NUTS at the people in my guild for telling me the *instant* it started flashing. After playing with me for a while I thought they'd realise I don't need reminding on group buffs, but no =P Eventually I started replying with &quot;Thank you Mr Group Buff reminder!&quot;<br />
BIGGEST hate though, is people that run off when you ask people to gather for buffs, then 5ish minutes later list off all the buffs they need.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OMG you guys would  LOVE my groups, cause I completely understand what you are talking about.  Even when I play my ranger (my main)  it annoys the crap out of me when people mention every buff that is dropping.  As both a chanter AND a shaman I've always timed my buffs or assigned the clock to a single player.<br />
  Sometimes the shamans get annoyed with me cause I'll go without buffs before I ask for one.  Well as a ranger you really don't need anything but haste in a group.<br />
  And I pity you if you start annoying the shamans for every little buff they have when they are my main healer in a group.</div></div><hr />

My problem is the opposite ... frigging happy heal clerics, so bored due to slowed mobs that they heal everything everytime health drops below 100%.  They overwrite my 6 tic Torpor with their 4 tic SE and wonder why I ask them to stop.  Then when it really hits the fan and my health is dropping faster than KEI against a dispelling mob they suddenly forget me.  Granted, it rarely hits the fan much anymore, but there are a few clerics who need to understand that there's no future in going through life dumb and comatose.</div></div><hr />

The agi buff requests.  Nothing worse than having a monk tell the whole raid that he is holding pulls until he gets his AGI buff.<br />
<br />
The acumen requests because they like to see their sta bar anything other than empty.  And this is in bright, not so they can see better.  They have specifically said, it is so their sta bar stays above 0.  Even when told it doesnt matter, when their sta is above 100, they still insist on it.</div></div><hr />

Is it just the fact that im level 61 and dont seem to get many long standing 65 chanters in group but do a lot of chanters now seem to not want to mez ?<br />

<br />
I usually tell the cleric I have Torpor, no need to heal me except <br />
during battle. If they still want to blow mana healing me between<br />

<br />
Playing an enchanter also, if there are going to likely be adds and I can, I prefer to pull after pacifying potential adds. It helps the group pull faster if cleric/druid/shaman are not trying to keep the chanter alive on mezzes (resists) and lets me focus on the incoming to debuff. Not always doable, but when it is the xp flows lots faster without folks having to med up.<br />
<br />
That said, yes, a chanter requiring an FD puller should be shot.</div></div><hr />

Ugh. I am so conflicted here. As a rogue, haste is hands down my favorite spell. But playing Amorae, I absolutely despise it.<br />
<br />
Personal peeves (from the Shaman's perspective)?<br />
<br />
'plz' and PST<br />
<br />
XP groups with Warriors as main tank. (Sorry :()<br />
<br />
Moron says out of character, 'WTB HoS'<br />
Moron tells you, 'Can I get HoS?' (err a second ago you were buying it.)<br />
<br />
Moron tells you, 'Can I get (Boar/Fo7/insert buff I can't cast yet)' (I'm never roleplay or anon so /w all shaman 65 would not bring my name up)<br />
<br />
Something that has happened to me 4 times in the last week. Some Shaman a couple levels higher than me telling me I need to upgrade my gear because my WIS isn't high enough because WIS &gt; HP for any Shaman. They're PRIESTS after all and HP is only good for tanks. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Clerics in Acrylia studded/reinforced armor insisting that they can tank adds better because &quot;I'm a plate class&quot;.<br />
<br />
Getting invited to a group then discovering they want you as the healer then finding out they still expect you to do everything else a Shaman is good at (This maybe a bit easier with Q but at 61 its not that easy).<br />
<br />
heh if you think it's 'not that easy' at 61, imagine how it is at 51 with tanks wearing wet tissue paper (or so it seems) pulling multiples in PoN with no chanter. I had tried to keep track of people I group with but with all the people levelling into the 50s, it's impossible to do so. It's like throwing Gizmo into the Atlantic Ocean :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Some more pet peeves  :D <br />
<br />
Druids casting SoE on the group like every five minutes (i hate hate hate the bouncing and my bihli is wasted).<br />
<br />
Mages casting Malx, when the mob is near 50 percent health (after slowing is done ...).<br />
<br />
Pullers asking 'ready?' 30 secs after a buff or recovery phase (NOOO you %$%$, cleric doesn't recover his mana bar in 30 secs - sigh).<br />
<br />
Everyone asking me for a group buff.<br />
<br />
My invis dropping 2 seconds after i cast it  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Which is why I refuse to buy acumen.<br />
<br />
Remember that &quot;no fatigue&quot; also equals no jumping, which can be slightly painful, mainly for the puller though. And besides it's fast casting and it's cheap. I am in the not-5-minutes-passes-without-acumen. Heck I even got group Acumen and I love it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>SkegBlackwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Amen to the haste peeve, always cast it on the pet so it is timed on him, it always seems to last longer on him hence the endless haste is going from the group.<br />
<br />
Biggest peeve though is slowing in HoT and getting so many resists..grrr at 64. When the next guildie shaman is 59 and just slows stuff easy as pie right after you.. :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
That *HAS* to be the worst ever, my Cann5 hotkey is exactly this &quot;Cann5ing (1924 dmg) dont heal =P&quot; and yet they wait for my Torpor to land, and then put thier crappy heal over time on me overwriting it. Then a couple of pulls later something happens and I'm getting hit, I look around and the cleric is just sitting on their arse watching, I've even had a guild druid tell me that he wasn't going to make a hotkey heal for me (dudes 2boxed) he would only make one for the MT and the Chanter (who wasn't mezzing or slowing). Wow did he get an earful =P</div></div><hr />

Pullers that ask for buff and then go pull before I can.  Either stay still or get me ER IV!<br />
<br />
Folks that don't care that the only reason you're in PoK is because you DIED yet still ask for SoW, HoS, etc.<br />
