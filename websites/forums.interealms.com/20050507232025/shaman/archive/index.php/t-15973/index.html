Please post if there are any other questions that are asked 10x per day that you think should be on here, I'll be happy to do the searching for you just so no one has to see the posts. Forgive me if I sound angry, but I am. It's getting old folks, so I'm trying to help. Here ya go.<br />

Maybe I'm getting bitter in my old age =P<br />

A valiant effort though, I was just thinking the same thing.</div></div><hr />

People who are too lazy or stupid to search, are generally to lazy/stupid to notice sticky posts and read them.<br />

At least we have 1 convenient spot to point them too now.</div></div><hr />

Someone had to have the balls to tell it like it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm have you actually CONVERSED with some of the people in PoP? Seriously. Ask them the following questions:<br />
<br />
a) Is this your first / main toon?<br />
1) Is your direction sense maxed?<br />
2) Is your swimming maxed?<br />
3) How many zones have you been in?<br />
4) How long did it take you to go from 1-x?<br />
5) What was your equipment like at level 20?<br />
<br />
Now you have to be subtle about this, because bombarding them with questions will raise the spectre that you are none-too-confident in their ability / knowledge of the game.<br />
<br />
What is even SCARIER is that while many have taken the fast road to 60+, they STILL sans clue and the proverbial icing on the cake is this game is in no way, shape or form firecracker difficulty, much less bottle rocket or {insert diety of your choice} rocket science.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I never said it wasn't a good idea to have a sticky thread listing common search topics.<br />
<br />
I never said there aren't idiots.  <br />
<br />
I said it's rude to ASSUME that new readers are idiots and berate them as such right off the bat, in a stickied thread.  You have to give them a chance to put their foot in their mouth or it's not sporting.<br />
<br />
Oh, and thanks to Anonymous for the negative reputation feedback &quot;Pull your head out and stop being such a prude.&quot;  What a shining example of why reputation systems don't work.</div></div><hr />
