<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BubbaQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am stuck.  <br />
<br />
I just installed Win XP Home on my newish computer replacing 98SE.  This comp connected to the internet through a Host computer that was using Win ME.   there was a 3rd computer Running 98se that was connected to the network.<br />
<br />
I have run the setup disk that XP creates to setup the connections on all of the other computers and cannot connect to the internet on the other two computers.<br />
<br />
Nothing seems to work to fix this.  There are no conflicts and I can access all of the computers on the network from each computer.<br />
<br />
I am stumped (mind you this is not hard -- I am old).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did you install XP on all the machines, or is it giving you that activation code garbage? If all have XP, it's pretty easy to get them to share the internet connection. It almost does it for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make sure you actually turned on the &quot;Allow other computers to access the internet through this connection&quot; box. Damn checkbox cost me at least 15 minutes. :(<br />
<br />
Other than that check to make sure you're getting IPs and that your gateway is pointing to the right place.<br />
<br />
That's the most basic stuff I can think of right now which is usually what I miss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My #$%# computer was connecting with a different internet connection than I had thought it was.  My Cursed ISDN modem sets up 8 different connection types and I had to simply check the block in the connection thta was ACTUALLY conncting to the internet.<br />
<br />
It is now working as intended(TM)<br />
