<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The hardest thing was to make shaman more efficient in GoD without making them too powerfull in others zones ( PoP / LDoN ).<br />
<br />
Quiescence got a little upgrade, so it is available for all of us in PoP / LDoN, now, if you want a better direct heal, then you have to get it in GoD. The 1k5hp is always a really nice upgrade compared to Tnarg, and there is also the BoT upgrade.<br />
Moreover, with all the AA, the 1k5 direct heal goes up to 2k, which is really nice to my mind. I see the &quot;Not everyone can have 300+ AA&quot; coming, and yes it is true, but keep in mind that GoD is here to keep Time players busy ! It isn't made for the Bastion of Thunder shaman.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to make a post where SoE can see that some shamans are HAPPY with this change.<br />
<br />
So if you disagree, well, just keep posting there (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20323)<br />
I just don't want SoE to give up because of whining shamans. If there are some shamans that are happy about those changes like me, I invite them to post here in order to let it known by SoE. Things must change, and it isn't by complaining all the time that it will be done.<br />
<br />
And please, if you disagree, don't post here, I already read some of your arguments in the previous topic.</div></div><hr />

Now that said, I dont think that GoD was &gt;primarily&lt; released to give Time eliets a place to play. There are several areas that are open to the &quot;average BoT shaman&quot; and their ilk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean. are people worried too much how much better Druids will be able to heal now in Bot? Or clerics? Or how overpowering it will be for the new nukes that will come out of God?<br />
<br />
Why can't we say. &quot;Yes! I can heal now! Stand back world I am taking Big steps now!&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean really. So damn many people are so concerned with stepping on toes that they never realise that our little piggys have been lopped off and fed to the trolls in a butter sause.<br />
<br />
We have are primary ability Mitagated and given away and marginalized. Stat buffs are passe and to keep away from having to refresh buffs every second of gameplay we have to use poorer buffs with longer durations. <br />
<br />
Come on folks be proud of the abilitys shaman have. And Fight to let us shine again rather than stand in the back and be chumps. We have  never been sissies before. why start now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The new heals are nice. I am very suprised they did anything so I to will say way to go Sony. <br />
<br />
The problem I have is with the elitest crap like oh more healing will over power shaman. What a load of crap did it over power druids or clerics how about palis. Please everyone get off of your high horses more healing will not over power shaman. Shaman DPS still sucks, their are more problems with shaman then just healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">True, we're not done yet.  And at this point, I'd just as soon have a beastlord as a shaman for most content where you need slow, and for of course all content where mobs are unslowable or resists are so high that slow doesn't land till the mob is almost dead, or even content where slow is heavily mitigated.  Slow being so crippled, along with the shaman's failure to advance in other areas, makes shamans even pre-GoD much less of a toon than others you can replace them with pretty easily.  I don't believe we can stop worrying about upgrades yet.<br />
<br />
But GoD shamans got at least a little boost with a 1550 heal.  It's not an 1800 heal, which still makes more sense than a 1550 one and is still not big at all, considering how long it takes us to cast our first heal and how fast the damage comes in, in GoD.  <br />
<br />
So we could still use quite a bit of boosting.  But at least the developers are actively listening, which shows more from Sony than I had come to expect after years of their track record.  There's something very positive there that hopefully we can maintain and build on, to hopefully finish the job and keep them aware of future problems even if the present ones get fully settled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh, is there any real harm in trivializing encounters that have long since been made trivial by others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I really do lol at the thought that somone is worried about trivialising old expansion encounters at all. I mean really have they updated the qeynos aquaducts even once since the game went live?<br />
cause its still one of the best exp zones in the game for lowbies but now you can drop 500+hp's on a twink armed with a 15dm 20ishdly weapon and gank your way to 12 in no time flat.<br />
<br />
I can solo lodi...I realise thats no huge feat but when they put him in the game wasnt he at least kinda bad ass?<br />
<br />
with dog dog I can wander lower guk pretty much at will as long as I dont agro more than 10 mobs (hell maybe even 20) I win.<br />
<br />
I havent been to guk for anything but eebags and a de mask for twinks in literal years, its old, its easy, its useless and of course its trivial.<br />
<br />
giving shaman a blast heal = to druids isnt going to trivialise anything thats not already trivial to somone who doesnt go there anymore.<br />
<br />
its a strawman argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am pleased they FINALLY recognized that we needed a healing upgrade, I just don't think they went far enough. However, I fully understand their reasoning. As it is, in content pre-Gates, Clerics do not bring much to a group BUT healing. If Shaman are able to completely replace clerics in ALL situations, there is a balance issue. Just like the Warriors complained that the Knight classes were becoming better day-to-day tanks, so the clerics would have a legit arguement that Shaman and Druids are becoming better day-to-day healers, thus leaving them out in the cold is MUCH of the games current content. <br />
<br />
The balancing point isnt easy to find, and there is NO POSSIBLE WAY SOE is going to please 100% of the people 100% of the time. Its silly to even try. However, I think another 150-200 on the new heal would be more in line. <br />
<br />
As for trivializing content, its perfectly understandable for the games content 2 or 3 TRUE expansions back to be trivialized, but not the last one. SOE doesnt want PoP content to become as trivial as Lodi. They won't let it happen for some time, I bet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which game are you playing, because this isn't EQ. A Shaman is far from replacing a Cleric in all situations in PoP or LDoN. Simply not true. And since when do Clerics not bring anything to the table but healing? Their DPS surpasses mine, their CC ability is better than mine(hello pacify), higher AC buffs, higher HP buffs, Spell haste buff etc.<br />
<br />
Just like the Warriors complained that the Knight classes were becoming better day-to-day tanks, so the clerics would have a legit arguement that Shaman and Druids are becoming better day-to-day healers, thus leaving them out in the cold is MUCH of the games current content.<br />
<br />
Thats a joke. Warriors were complaining that the difference between them and knights was negligeable(mainly because itemization allowed knights to tank the same mobs due to the number of clerics needed for end game encounters). Never was a Shaman or even a Druid within 8% of a Cleric's main ability(healing)<br />
<br />
As for trivializing content, its perfectly understandable for the games content 2 or 3 TRUE expansions back to be trivialized, but not the last one. SOE doesnt want PoP content to become as trivial as Lodi. They won't let it happen for some time, I bet.<br />
<br />
Since when are you playing? Every expansion with the exception of Loy and LDoN(which never aimed at the highend crowd) has made the previous one utterly trivial. PoP made Luclin trivial, Luclin trivialized Velious, Velious turned Kunark bosses into exp mobs and Kunark trivialized the original EQ as well. What are you talking about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am pleased they FINALLY recognized that we needed a healing upgrade, I just don't think they went far enough.

If a shaman is able to completely replace a cleric the group needs to fight harder stuff. Seriously. I can replace a cleric just fine in the Plane of Nightmare. That is not a balance issue.<br />
<br />
Now, if we could come close to cleric healing in anything remotely resembling a challenging encounter, that would be a balance issue. We do not though, and even given druid heals we would not.<br />
<br />
Just like the Warriors complained that the Knight classes were becoming better day-to-day tanks, so the clerics would have a legit arguement that Shaman and Druids are becoming better day-to-day healers, thus leaving them out in the cold is MUCH of the games current content. <br />
Knights tank 80-90% as well as warriors though, barring discs. We do not heal that close to druids and druids do not heal that close to clerics.<br />
<br />
Why is it acceptable anyways for clerics to replace druids and shaman but not the other way around? A cleric will outheal two shaman without a slower of his own in large parts of the content of the last 3 expansions - yet when shaman want to be able to be secondary healers we are leaving clerics out in the cold.<br />
<br />
And even if that point was legit, the solution is incredibly easy. Put the new spells on a vendor in Kod'Taz. If someone who has reached that zone feels the need to go back and play healer in BoT, let him. It is about as unbalancing as me buffing newbies in the Feerrott.<br />
<br />
The balancing point isnt easy to find, and there is NO POSSIBLE WAY SOE is going to please 100% of the people 100% of the time. Its silly to even try. However, I think another 150-200 on the new heal would be more in line. <br />
The general consensus seems to be 1800 and either a one second cast (and a longer recast time) or a supplemental AA. I would not cry about only getting a 1750 heal though.<br />
But merely getting put back in line with cleric and druid increases when we got less then both of these for the last couple of expansions will not do.<br />
<br />
As for trivializing content, its perfectly understandable for the games content 2 or 3 TRUE expansions back to be trivialized, but not the last one. SOE doesnt want PoP content to become as trivial as Lodi. They won't let it happen for some time, I bet.<br />
So PoP did not trivialize Luclin? Luclin did not trivialize Velious? Velious did not trivialize Kunark?<br />
Each expansion brings an increase in power. Each time old content, be it one or five expansions behind, will get easier. There is no harm in this.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, we need more then a slight increase to Tnarg's. A lot more. If SOE is not willing to let shaman trivialize as much old content as everyone else they can easily do so by putting all new spells on a vendor in Kod'Taz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I dont see why they should worry about what would be &quot;overpowering&quot; in old content. i mean orc 1 in sro... my heals are totaly overpowered there ! hell a lvl 65 ranger would be a fine main healer there. does that mean that 65 rangers are stealing someone else group spot? i doubt that:).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We've been able to replace BoT healers with impunity since we got PoP spells.  That zone just isn't that challenging, especially with gear/AA's factored in.  Elemental hunting is a bit more challenging, but still nowhere near the challenge that upper tier GoD zones present.  When you HAVE to bring along TWO clerics per group to get a mission done, and the tank MUST be a warrior, and you need a mezzer, there's not a lot of room left for a shaman.</div></div><hr />

It seems that I haven't been clear enough  :( . I did some feedbacks to SoE for shaman upgrades too. So I whined too, and I am proud of it because we really needed some changes. It is just that SoE made something for us, and so I didn't want to let people, that always want more and more, break everything.<br />
In my sentence, the &quot;whining&quot; was adressed to shamans that still aren't happy about the changes. They may have their reasons, but to my mind, healing changes are just fine, now, SoE must look at Slow mitigations in GoD ( which they already are, according to Ryan ) and our buffs/canni in order to make us wanted again. ( if they don't change anything than Heal, then I will have to be a whiner again ;) )</div></div><hr />

And a lot of us disagree and say we need more. What we got now is adequate on one minute fights with a mix of nonmitigating and &quot;mostly successful&quot; mitigating MOBs.<br />
Unless GoD single group contents gets changed to the above, basically doubling MOB HPs and dropping slow mitigation by more then a full step - we still need better heals.<br />
The buff situation is a completely separate issue.</div></div><hr />

Ok with this analogy, when EQ came out, it was one of the few restaurant’s of its type (Mass Online Roleplaying – etc) in the market place.   <br />
<br />
In real world, restaurant can do the above and get away with it as long as there isn’t competition for its product.  Market place figures out there is pent-up demand and competition creates new restaurants.   Restaurants continue to screw up service and customers move away to competition as long as it is comparable.   <br />
<br />
Today, EQ has competition from both outside and internal (EQII), so Sony and Dev’s have to response on issues.  <br />
<br />
This isn’t about whining.   This is about your consumers providing feedback on product.  Sony has it easy … they can get this feedback from fan based sites for FREE.  No market studies, research, survey’s, etc are required other than a bit of communication and reading skills.   GoD is a new expansion and Sony needs feedback.   Changes in Shaman healing are a direct result of class based feedback.   The sad part was that it didn’t happen during beta.</div></div><hr />

First, maybe I should have stuck the word &quot;a lot&quot; in there, but lets be realistic here. I am talking PRE GATES. Thats LDoN, PoP XP groups, etc etc. A shaman brings WAY WAY more to a group than a Cleric does in these situations. Sheesh, you know something Giac, instead of picking apart every word I say, you COULD open your mind a little and stop viewing this ENTIRE game from your tiny little world. <br />
<br />
Cripes, you think your little 2% of the world of EQ is all there is. Well GUESS WHAT, GENIUS, theres a BIG HUGE GAME OUT THERE. Velious dindt trivialize Kunark until TONS and TONS of farming was done. Same for Luclin vs Velious. Took MONTHS for Kunark content to get trivialized, not a few weeks because of a few spells. <br />
<br />
Veeshen, as for your little snide &quot;fight harder stuff&quot; bull**** comment, I can replace a cleric JUST FINE in PLANE OF EARTH AND FIRE. You have fun in Nightmare though, k?<br />
<br />
Sick of arguing with you. Your 100% right about 100% of the things you talk about. I know nothing about the class I have been playing for 5 years. I am clueless. There. You happy? <br />
<br />
In fact, I am getting quite sick and tired of the totally elitist attitudes I see here overall. Tons of you people seem to thijnk that the shaman class is the only one with issues. Do you even take things like overall game balance and previos content into consideration when you make these &quot;we should be able to replace clerics at all levels&quot; comments? Seriously. Wake up.</div></div><hr />

A shaman brings exactly haste and dogdog to a LDoN group over a cleric. Even factoring in slow the cleric will outheal the shaman by far. The cleric on the other hand brings stun, pacify, better HP buffs, rez and spell haste.<br />
Where is the shaman edge? All that hype about shaman utility is a myth, it does not exist anymore. The last 6 or so expansions have made sure of that. This is not a bad thing. But we simply do not have more utility then other casters anymore.<br />
<br />

<br />
Same for Luclin vs Velious. Took MONTHS for Kunark content to get trivialized, not a few weeks because of a few spells. <br />
That is just false. Luclin brought us AAs. Even run speed 3 by itself trivialized tons of Temple of Veeshan.<br />
<br />
Veeshen, as for your little snide &quot;fight harder stuff&quot; bull**** comment, I can replace a cleric JUST FINE in PLANE OF EARTH AND FIRE. You have fun in Nightmare though, k?<br />
Then find harder stuff to kill. Seriously. Of course you can replace a cleric in spots where said cleric has no difficulty healing in the first place. Up the pace. Kill bigger, harder things and more of them.<br />
<br />
Where exactly is the harm in shaman replacing clerics in easy experience groups? Are we not healers? There is a problem when we can replace clerics on content that is challenging for them. I do not see anything remotely close to that, even with all of our suggestions going live.<br />
<br />

Of course we are not. But why is it surprising for you for shaman to be mainly concerned with shaman issues?<br />
<br />
Do you even take things like overall game balance and previos content into consideration when you make these &quot;we should be able to replace clerics at all levels&quot; comments? Seriously. Wake up.<br />
I never said so. I have not seen anyone saying that. If that is indeed the &quot;overall attitude&quot; you should not have trouble providing me with plenty of quotes.<br />
<br />
I believe we should outheal druids who do not have a slower and be slightly behind a cleric who has no slower. Does that seem unbalanced to you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, when I do LDoN, we never single pull. We pull 4 or 5. Therefore, my DOTs come into BIG play. VP is also a fairly huge factor. I know you would sit here and say that a cleric can heal the entire group just fine without slowing a single mob, but I think you should to ASK them if they want that kind of mana expendature. They certainly wont be doing anywhere NEAR the DPS I am in the exact same situation. <br />
<br />
Why are you so quick to cut down your own class? I can practically SOLO an LDoN run, can a Cleric? Cripes, clerics are getting IGNORED for LDoN on my server, why don't you speak to a few in your own guild about it.</div></div><hr />

If you are pulling 4+ all the time have the cleric AE. By the way, are those LDoN normals or hards?<br />
<br />
I know you would sit here and say that a cleric can heal the entire group just fine without slowing a single mob, but I think you should to ASK them if they want that kind of mana expendature. They certainly wont be doing anywhere NEAR the DPS I am in the exact same situation.<br />
A cleric simply matching shaman heals(including slow) will easily outdamage said shaman. Unless of course you are doing LDoN normals and are offrooting/Doting instead of AEing.<br />

Clerics are ignored but shaman are getting groups? Why not just get a paladin for healing. Beastlords can heal in LDoN normals just fine - does that mean Beastlord are a healer class? No - it means you are fighting trivial content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Blazz, why are you pulling the &quot;We should be able to replace Clerics at all levels&quot; line out of your ass?<br />
<br />
A Shaman should be able to heal as well as a Cleric for mobs that do not mitigate slow at all. That's like the closest I have ever said. Actually, given that we are so inferior the second a mob starts mitigating to basically becoming ranger like for slow immune mobs, we should OUTHEAL clerics under perfect Shaman conditions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Because the impression I keep getting from you, Giac, is that a shaman should be able to be primary healer in all situations. That an 1800 1.0 second cast heal isnt enough to do that, so we need more. Is this not your basic arguement? If not, then I apologize, but its certainly the &quot;feel&quot; I get from your posts, regardless of your exact words. <br />

Off tanking, yes, perhaps a root or 2 if there are too many. Even in this situation, both Bane and BoS will easily run their full course if only 1 tank is on the mob. Clerics AE cant match that damage.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am out of this thread. The guy who started it didnt want this debate brought here. Next time you want to shred one of my posts, guys, quote it back into the other thread, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I have no idea where you getting that idea from. I merely stated the obvious and that's that healing in general needs an overhaul and balance between the 3 priest classes needs to be re-evaluated...at some point. <br />
I stated that this is nothing that will or can happen before the next expansion and that for now the Shaman class would greatly benefit from a 1 second casting 1800 heal with a 5 second recast or preferably a 3.75 second heal + Spirit Shifting AA.</div></div><hr />
