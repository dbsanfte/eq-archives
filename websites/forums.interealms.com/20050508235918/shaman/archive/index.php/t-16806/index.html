<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few days ago, I posted this thread: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16768 .  At the time, I still wasn't sure if VP was a worthwhile AA or not (at 270AA).  No one really answered my question, so I decided to just bite the bullet and train VP to rank 3.  Dinged VP earlier today, but didn't really have a chance to test it until tonight (was grouped the whole time and its considered bad form to randomly root mobs in a kite group :D).<br />
<br />
Here's what I found:  VP owns.  A lot.  I seriously regret not getting it a long, long, time ago.  I have only gotten to play with it for one night, but so far it is looking to be one of the best AA's I have ever bought.  The thing I really wanted to know was how big the knock is.  Well, here it is:<br />

As you can see, that is a pretty big fooking knockback.  Even VP1 was knocking mobs out of melee range, and VP3 knocks them [i]way back.  You might also notice that the mob isn't being knocked straight back away from me.  You can turn your body to face a certain direction, and the mob will be booted in that direction.  Typcially you are looking at the mob when you cast, so it knocks it backwards, but you can manipulate it so that it goes in whatever direction you want.  This is awesome.  Another note on the knockback:  It seems to have some rather... dramatic... effects in pvp.  Note the following screenshot, where a 53 monk jumped me in arena.  This was early today, when all I had was VP1.<br />
<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~misterconservative/knockback.JPG[/img]<br />
<br />
That's [i]insane.  It happened more than once, too.  Typically VP was just doing a small knockback, only slightly out of melee range, but sometimes it would just knock them way back until they hit a wall.  I knocked a 63 wizard through the gate and clear out of the arena.<br />
<br />
In addition to the awesome knockback effect, I found something else.  When soloing in pofire at least, if you pull with malicious decay, VP does not break.  I did an entire AA point there, which means 8 kills and 5 VP's per kill.  In those 40 VP's, not a single one broke before VP refreshed.  I didn't get hit a single time.  After soloing these things using greater immobilize and having it sometimes break a few seconds after applying it (often killing me), this is just simply incredible.  It makes them a total joke for me to solo.  Used to, before I got VP, I wouldn't even try them unless I had virtue and kei.  I needed virtue because I just didn't have the hitpoints to survive a broken root and an interrupt when trying to stick it.  I needed the kei because I would constantly be having to /dismount and run my ass away to get enough distance to safely cast root, and then heal myself from the damage.  I had trouble maintaining mana.  With VP, though, both these concerns are completely taken care of.  I repeat: I didn't get hit a single time.<br />
<br />
So, to sum it up, VP is freaking awesome and if you solo you should get it.</div></div><hr />

Been debating when I would pick VP up, but it looks too hilarious to put off any longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been getting alot of mileage with Virulent Paralysis and LDoN adventures.  Quite useful for crowd control on those two or three pulls or if your group just rushes rooms.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">VP is awesome for ldon CC. right after LR and ID i'd rank this as one of the best pop skills added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know VP1 costs 3 points to train but how much does it cost for rank 2 and 3?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In this case it's only 3 pts per rank, up to 3 ranks. Very inexpensive considering :)</div></div><hr />

VP owns in pvp =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here.  Pre-LDON I didn't like VP much at all, it was resisted 60+% of the time on the mobs I was fighting, the cast time was too long and the duration too short.  <br />
<br />
For LDON though, I think it is worth another look.  In LDON the mobs die fast so VP has a more appropriate duration, the knockback is a useful ability we did not have before and the no-mana cost is nice, since I am much more aware of my efficiency than before.<br />
<br />
I still think it should be faster cast though.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have VP1 and it is resistable and breakable just like any other roots we have in our book except the knockback. I have a few questions for VP3:<br />
<br />
1) is it less resistable?<br />
2) how long does it last?<br />
3) does it hold better than VP1 when I chain nukes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">VP 1 lasts for about 1:20<br />
VP 2 lasts about 1:40<br />
VP 3 lasts for about 2:10.<br />
<br />
And since the recast is 2:00.... =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sekin:<br />
1)  all 3 have the same resist check (disease with 0 resist adjust) so all 3 will be equally resistable<br />
2) VP1= 1:12<br />
    VP2= 1:36<br />
    VP3= 2:00<br />
3) any level will have the same chance to break root on any given tick or when nuking because the resist check is the same for all 3<br />
<br />
for PVP purposes, do note that the number of disease couters increases from 9 to 12 to 16 with each level, making it harder to remove, kinda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well thanks for these posts on VP. Read them yesterday and figured I already had 2 AA banked might as well finish the last one and try VP1 out since 90% of my EQ time is in LDoN.<br />
<br />
I'm liking it! Can't wait to get up to 3 now. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yah I've been working on LR and after reading this yesterday decided to buy VP1 instead of the next level of LR. So far I'm very happy with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Jinheim -<br />
would you please go edit your post in the AA thread on the Medicine Cabinet - or ask Henora to do so, if it is locked.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you have raised your opinion of VP enough to amend your comments there - which get read a lot.  I steer young shaman in my guild to the Medicine Cabinet, at least in part because of your post on the AA thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">VP rocks! Just like most new things though it takes a little getting used to. I find myself using it more and more. At first I would forget to use it many times. Now it is becoming part of my regular routine. It is great in LDoN for parking adds away from the action. It is also excellent in PvP.<br />
<br />
I usually slow the mob I get targeted off our MA, then VP an add, and then slow the add while it's targeted, and so on. Anyways use yer imagination, it's fun to play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I read this yesterday so spent 3 points as soon as I logged on.<br />
<br />
At 10% health tanking 2 unslowed Arctic Widows out of the 6 on our group it saved my life in LDON. Bang pushed one out of the way, halved the DPS being thrown at me, halved the interrupts and got slow off on the remaining one and Q on myself.<br />
<br />
 I can now see how it will be invaluable in LDON....after C5 ... best points spent so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I vaguely remember recommending and strongly encouraging you and others, who were still hesitating, to purchase Virulent a few months ago. Guess i wasn't very persuasive back then. <br />
Anyways, Virulent is the best AA after Canni V. <br />
Canni V is crucial at the point you get it, while Virulent is only crucial for a particular type of player(but still very useful for everyone , who knows the class), yet Canni V will be losing it's relative power with LDoN and future expansions, abilities and items(have been on vacation for months so this might already be the case as i haven't logged on yet as i write this), while Virulent will most likely still be unique in a few years. <br />
And in a game where balance is defined by what your class can bring to the table in different environments created by NPCs, uniqueness is power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">it is fun AA, and useful in few situation, other than that it idn't much better than normal root  because reuse time is too long and you can't use it to reliable root park -- tell me you don't mem root when do lots of CC<br />
<br />
it is really useful when use the push effect from that root; like push mob away from inc, pull/push name to MA during PoEarth mud ring; pull mob off wall/bad position in VT or other zone. that is pretty rare case<br />
<br />
I sometime use it lots, sometime almost forgot this AA exit, I think it just like RC -- useful when it need</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've had VP1 since PoP came out.  I was enthused bout having a knockback spell.  But I never did train it to VP3 until several weeks ago I think it was Jinheim or maybe someone else in serverwide chat that said VP1 and 3 knocked mobs back a lot more.  So I trained up VP3 and i LOVE it.  It's just insane how far back (and out of CAMP most importantly) I can push an add.  <br />
<br />
I rank this skill (based on usefulness per point cost) right after Canni5.  It's a must have for any shaman who either soloes a lot or does CC in groups.  Which is to say, it's a must have for all shamans.  <br />
<br />
If you are a PoValor groupie and mostly grind exp in this boring ass zone, you won't like it too much.  Many of the mobs there are either unrootable or resist disease heavily.  However, even in HoH i found this spell made soloing the basement mobs comparable to a small mushroom.  Just pull one of two with Malicious Decay, then immediately smack him back with VP.  He'll be stuck there for sure for a while.  Usually for duration.  Then it's only one mob i have to control and kill.  This ability is HUGE when soloing high mob density zones like Howling Stones and Droga.  Get a couple adds on a pull?  Don't panic, just VP one of the unslowed ones while your slow refreshes, and then slow the other unslowed mob.  Boom, you got control again of a potentially deadly situation.  <br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>soldieint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Vp 3 dosnt only rock in Pve, but surely allso in pvp. I was PL a friend of mine the other day in VL on the Ledge. Suddently a Ench show`s up. And mezzed me right away. As i stood there, seeing the ench starting to drain my mana. I felt the need to tell here, now that she is stealing me mana i couldnt see any way out. Then sending here out with a flight ticket from the ledge to next landing station, who would be the bottom of Velks. Somehow she thought, i was joking and start laughing at me. Next sec mez broke and i pushed my beloved VP button, and there she went on here last finally trib in VL for the next 1 hour. Sadly for the ench he hadnt been training with the goodly monks. so a 10k damm fall killed here...<br />
VP rock allso in the POP zones. During my dayly pvp tribs in pov. I see often people running to the zone out stone. And start the ooc trash to us poor people for ruin there xp group and stuff, who have to make our dayly living by killing people to get some cashh for water and food. sad but true it think. <br />
As they stand there at the zone out stone and are rdy to click it when ever they should get low on life. I cast my dr debuff and there the VP Buttom is sending them out on a fly trib again, around 10 meter from the zone out stone and suddently now the voice has changed. to I was just leaving the zone or i was just logging. The best class killing this way is melee, You just move close enought so you just barely standing out of there meleee range and at the same time they cant shoot at you. So there you stand Eye to Eye watching them die, We are after all human behind the sceen!!!<br />
