<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there are posts on where to hunt but I am looking for a spot that I can hunt and be able to leave unattended for 15 to 30 min at a time so I can take care of RL stuff. <br />
<br />
I am very well equiped have 3100hp 3500mana and 1100ac self buffed. Horse and JBB, 3 items with Aura Battle for 6hp regen. And FT4 in gear. Would show magelo but work filters it out and I dont know the link off the top of my head. <br />
<br />
Don't care about loot or pp. Just want good XP.<br />
<br />
Also, where can a 54 mage and I camp that would have good xp. This would be dedicated playing time so no worries about not being able to leave characters unattended. This is not a dual box. Would goos in PoD be killed pretty quick teamed together?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say go to Jaggedpine and kill Darkpaw warriors in the caves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no offense, at 53 the xp was kinda crap ( was great at first but somehow levelled out )...I can only imagine at 56 it would be non existant. Just went to Veksar...lots of places for you there - good spot to check out I'd say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well 62 now so pretty much just grouping. But will have to try out Veksar.</div></div><hr />
