<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, after hearing that bloodgills can give half blue and more in LoIO from here and guildies i decided to check it out, they've been nerfed :(. Got 05-1.5% max, no more. A bard also realized this who been hunting them for a while now. I'm guessing its cuz of Veksaar being released soon loads of people will be flooding to LoIO and ther right where Veksaar temple is :( Oh well, back to killing ****e in echo.<br />
<br />
PS level 47 here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i was in burning woods at your level , might wanna check it out. The giant fort will be prime for you in a level or 2 and you will make GREAT cash there. The outside mobs will be perfect for you right now , especialy if you have a jbb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont believe that Bloodgills were nerfed, they were always that way. I remember running to that camp around your level. The exp was actually pretty good, a little over 1 percent each kill on average. The only problem was how mainfully annoying it was to keep casting levi and ebreath on yourself. Bloodgills aren't some kind of miraculous mob that throws you right through the high 40's, they are just better than average exp because of their location, underwater.<br />
<br />
I personally skipped the bloodgills because the bonus was not worth the cons, and went to the plaguebone thief camp in DL. Its a hard camp to get, and even harder to keep without jerks stealing mobs or just harassing you about the camp, but you get a steady 1% per kill, and they are easy.</div></div><hr />

Aye thats what i was killing in BW , plaguebones.  Plus the varying bugs that fly in that one burnt section in the SW i believe. <br />
<br />
Dont forget LoY too if you have it , my SK has made nice Solo XP there so far. He is up to 46 now and camping the recruits by the castle. Nice XP and easy kills so far.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure they were nerfed though mate, this bard friend has been doing them since about level 42, now 46 or 47 and he noticed the exp changed from 2.5% to 1%. Also a necro friend did the bloodgills at 49 and got 2.5% per kill.</div></div><hr />

thats levelling up buddy <br />
 :p <br />
<br />
<br />
upper 40's is about when exp starts to take a dropoff. 42 exp is far different from 47. and after 51 you'll be begging for a mob that gives you 1% per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i was gonna mention it before but i didn't, help noticed the exp drop from 2.5 to 1 in the same level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phleggma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've always found the bloodgill barracudas to be better than the goblins anyways.<br />
<br />
Not really because they give more XP per kill, they don't.  But it's hard to find the goblins not camped, or at least not partially camped.  The barracuda's on the other hand are almost never camped.  <br />
<br />
The great thing about the barracuda's is their 60 second spawn time.  You can keep killing them as fast as you can keep up, no waiting for the next one to spawn for 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />

And later with Snugg 46ish-51. And I can say that even waaaaaaay back when they did not give 2%+ per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did 47 to 51 in DL at the ancient combine pyramid.  Just turn off shout and ooc and pretend you have the whole zone to yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Try Keasora, near Xalgoz.  That is the best exp modifier zone for your level.  Mobs are fairly easy.  Bring a couple friends and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye, Xalgoz's chapel is utterly incredible between 35 and 45 although it tails off sharply beyond that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You're all wrong! WRONG!<br />
<br />
I have 2 words for you my friend, unfortunately it will also require EB on your part:<br />
<br />
KEDGE KEEP.<br />
<br />
You will have the highest prepop exp modifier in game on your side as you fight *old world* level mobs. If you get to feeling frisky, there are even groups at your level in PoJ sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you're high 40's and have some higher-level friends, get them to take you to the Grey and get the Shissar organs for the Amulet of the Grey Wastes.  Real easy EB item, we got enough organs for one amulet per hour with a 59 shm/59 war.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just set up a dog on east shore and pull to there to avoid the lev end breath option.  Only thing is you NEED 200 swimming skill otherwise you will not be able to get away from the goblins.  If there is a prob single pulling them then root one and other will come to shore, slow and get dog on it, then when root wears off other one comes.<br />
  <br />
Another good spot is dl by bw zone.  there are no wanderers by the zone so pull a mob or 2 into the bw valley and kill there til 49 then head to CoM and start working on epic pieces. :)</div></div><hr />
