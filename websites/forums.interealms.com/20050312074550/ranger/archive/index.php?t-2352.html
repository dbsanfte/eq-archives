TV looks nice even with luclin modles turned on (on woodelves at least).  Dark Master's /Dark Assassin's looks nice too, but they look the same as Crystal Chitin.... sooooo if you like that &quot;knight&quot; look then the silver plate is the way to go. :)</div></div><hr />

oh, and just turn on Show velious textures with luclin to get rid of the striped pants, (thats with the new models BTW).  Of course BP,leftbracer,arms, and boots arent finished, its better than striped pants.<br />
<br />
the Newmodel Velious textures look the same as the ones for the old models in case anyone was wondering.. but since they havnt finished the BP, i dunno if they got manboobs .</div></div><hr />

Darkforge is Shadowknight plate armor.. the BP arms and legs are black, the bracer gloves boots and helm are dark red.<br />
<br />
I think that is a cool scheme to follow with lots of different armors.. so I'd imagine I'd like Tolans helm boots bracer gloves + Thorny Vine legs bp and arms (or vis a versa)...<br />

Full plate with Golden Leaf color on the new models, coupled with silver looking plate version of the Bracer of Benevolence. Don't have any screenshots here I'm afraid. Spend some time with a GL/bracer of benevolence ranger in City of Mist or Fear and you're bound to see this :)</div></div><hr />

Few other good ones are Thorny Vined especially on wod elves.<br />

Cobalt is also one of my favorite types of armor. The dark blue looks reall good if someone has a full suit.<br />

How did you get a screenshot of your character at character selection screen? <br />
<br />
Go to the character select screen and select the character you want to take a picture of.<br />
<br />
When the character is in the right position, hit Print Screen.<br />
<br />
Exit EQ and paste the picture into MS Paint or another image editor that supports bitmap images.</div></div><hr />

Blast from the past, no doubt :P  I was doing an ould coolie lookup on old PC that I used to use as a main this spring, and came across this thread. <br />
<br />
My thought would be this:<br />
<br />
Given the newer armors available, who has anyhitng to add to this? I think there's a couple of &quot;set's&quot; that look *sweet*...even if I'm still hooked on the old UI/texture Gold Leaf look myself ;) Post some pics of some newer sets with the new UI and models VS the old, VT/Luclin stuff, etc, for comparisons sake!<br />
<br />
Oh, and I just looked....I chose the surname &quot;Manasponge&quot; for the same reasons you did in the summer of 2000 ;) But don't worry, I don't charge royalties ;) <br />
<br />
I have had the pleasure of a gnome enchanter here on Bertox that got the same surname at *release +11 weeks&quot; and got such a belly laugh from my picking the same name 2plus years later he spit beer on his keyboard and gave me permission to spead it around, so run with it!</div></div><hr />

- Half-Elves - The sharpest lookin HEF I saw had silver plate (well it looks bone tinted on HEF's) on bracers, boots, arms and golden leaf everywhere else.... HOT!<br />
<br />
- Wood Elves - Coolest lookin ELF I've met was in a mixture of Golden Leaf and blue dragon armour stuff from WW.<br />
<br />
I'm workin on either on the knight look or trying to emulate that HEF and grab me some Golden Leaf :)<br />

Worst look is old model male woodelf helm of the tracker....and new model stripped pants.  Oh yeah, and the old model Woody males in untamed...*snicker, skittles~~!<br />

And actually I think the new model humans look great.</div></div><hr />

Finally, someone else has seen the truth!!!  Come on guys, we're rangers... we're gonna die anyhoo, so half the fight is making sure you leave the sessyist corpse behind! ;)<br />
<br />
I've done plenty of mobs where I've managed to snatch life from death or victory from defeat because the mob was confused and was wondering how a warrior could be using lightning swords!!!  We have to use every trick in the book. <br />
