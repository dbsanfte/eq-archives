<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Disclaimer:<br />
<br />
This post was made before Velious came out, I haven't time to edit it for changes since then.  So some info is wrong basically it's good info though.<br />
<br />
Important changes to keep in mind:<br />
<br />
We now have Ally faction, but max faction is still the same number.<br />
<br />
Secondary faction hits now occur even if first one is maxxed (means goodies can get into cabilis)<br />
<br />
Velious and Luclin faction doesn't conform to old world+Kunark general rules ie you get a bigger faction hit for kiling the bigger stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Faction ranges<br />
<br />
-800 and below: Ready to attack<br />
-800 to -500: Threateningly<br />
-500 to -100: Dubiously<br />
-100 to 0: Apprehensivly<br />
0 to 100: Indifferently<br />
100 to 500: Amiably<br />
500 to 800: Kindly<br />
800 and higher: Warmly<br />
<br />
The game adds up your constant initial faction and the earned factions, and the number from that is what is compared to that list.<br />
<br />
Your inital faction is made out of 3 parts. Your Race, Class, and Religion. So at character creation it goes down the list of every faction in the game assigning an initial faction for you. Stuff like if you are a Shaman, then you get a +50 with every other Shaman guild in the game, everyone that is not an Iksar gets -1000 with the Iksar city factions, etc. Illusion spells change the race factor temporarily.<br />
<br />
And there is the earned faction. Do a quest, kill something, this is what changes. <br />
Not all hits are equal, killing a goblin whelp gets you a -1 with their goblin clan faction. Kill a high power named goblin and you end up actually getting -10 or something with that clan. Same with some quests, the first faction gets you a +10, the rest are +1. Usually only the first faction listed is the one that may be a large amount, I think almost every time the 2-4th factions will only be +1 or -1<br />
<br />
There is another oddity with the earned factions, this number is capped at +2001 and similerly capped at -2001. So no matter how many kills or quests you do, if the change would push you past those bounds, the faction does not change at all. Also, if the first faction in a list hits that cap, all other factions from that action will not happen, the game will just ignore them. So if you are doing a quest to raise a faction, it will only work so long as the first faction is not capped. After that, the secondary faction changes that you were trying for will just be ignored.<br />
<br />
Just as a starter do NOT even attempt to faction Cabilis if you have a godd aligned god, it's not possible.<br />
<br />
IF you want to faction it as an agnostic or evil character or are just plain interested then follow the instructions bvelow.<br />
<br />
Cabilis Faction is made up of 6 Factions:<br />
<br />
East Cabilis and Outside<br />
<br />
Legion of Cabilis (Warrior guild and Troopr guards)<br />
Crusaders of Greenmist (SK guild and Crusader guards)<br />
<br />
East Cabilis<br />
<br />
Swifttails (Monk Guild)<br />
Scaled Mystics (Shaman Guild)<br />
Cabalis residents (Merchants, Bankers and some NPC's)<br />
<br />
West Cabilis<br />
<br />
Brood of Kotiz (Necro guild and all West Cabilis Merchants)<br />
<br />
There are 2 factions you can raise by killing things:<br />
<br />
Legion of Cabilis and Brood of Kotiz. The important faction here is Legion of Cabilis (Troopers). If you have read the other thread on faction you will know that positive changes have a maximum of +2001. This is important as the only way to raise faction with the other factions is to do trooper quests. If you do a trooper quest the primary faction you receive back is for Legion of Cabilis. Thus if you Max out Legion of Cabilis you cannot raise any of the other factions by questing.<br />
<br />
You need to get +500 with Legion of Cabilis before they go Dubious (you start at -1000) This means goblins Sarnaks etc. As soon as they go dubious STOP.<br />
<br />
DO NOT kill ANYTHING else that gives trooper faction. Why? I hear you cry, the reason is this: You now have 1500 pt's left worth of trooper increases, the more your trooper faction goes up, the less you have to work with raising other factions.<br />
<br />
There are several Faction quests troopers give out. Most give a +2-+10 trooper faction hits and +1 to the rest, all of these are bad. The Trooper Mozo bonechip quest gives +1 to all factions, this means you can get +1500 with the other factions before troopers max out.<br />
<br />
The trooper Mozo quest gives the following faction hit per 4 Bone Chips.<br />
<br />
+1 Legion of Cabilis<br />
+1 Crusaders of Greenmist<br />
+1 Swifttails<br />
+1 Scaled Mystics<br />
+1 Cabilis residents<br />
<br />
That means to get your 1500 increases in the other factions you need SIX THOUSAND bone chips.<br />
<br />
You need 1500 increases as here are you starting factions with Cabilis:<br />
<br />
Cazic/agnostic<br />
<br />
-1000 to everything<br />
<br />
All other evil gods:<br />
<br />
-1000 Legion<br />
-1750 Crusaders<br />
-1500 Scaled Mystics<br />
-1500 Swifttails<br />
-2000 Cabilis residents<br />
-2000 Brood of Kotiz<br />
<br />
The Bankers, merchants and NPC's are on Cabilis residents faction. Remember that ALL merchants have a false cap of dubious, only the bankers and NPC's will show your true faction with Cabilis residents.<br />
<br />
So if you did the Bone chips quest 1500 times you would be dubious with Cab Res, this is enough that you have reached REAL dubious, you can the do merchant quests till you reach apprehensive and then you will be able to bank and buy/sell.<br />
<br />
The reason you can do merchant quests when Trooper faction is maxxed, is that the primary faction change will be Cab Res so that will go up.<br />
<br />
Then all you have to do is Kill 2000 forsaken Iksar to faction West Cabilis and you can do anything in Cabilis that an iksar could do.<br />
<br />
BTW it is easier than I have described if you are Cazic or Agnostic as you start out -1000 with everyone.<br />
<br />
I hope I have laid that out so that it makes sense.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A few inaccuracies here:<br />
<br />
They fixed the issue where if the main faction a quest raises maxes out, no other factions will raise. You can do the bone chip quest 'til your arms fall off, and you're set. :p<br />
<br />
He mentions good gods and evil gods, but he doesn't mention neutral gods.<br />
<br />
As a follower of the Tribunal, I've factioned my way to 90% safety in Cabilis. I only get guff from the Scaled Mystics.<br />
<br />
I know of followers of Quellious and Brell who have both managed to get non-KoS in Cabilis.<br />
<br />
It's useless, but it's fun. :p<br />
<br />
I want to get my faction with the Scaled Mystics up enough that I can train in Cab. ;(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've turned in 5000chips so far and done various other newbie quests for grins several times.<br />
<br />
The only people that will attack me are the bankers.  They are STIL scowls.  So to bank I have to root the banker and just get smacked while banking.  (they are wimps, but slow if you wish)<br />
<br />
Vendors are still dubious to me so I can't buy or sell yet.  All other factions though including crusaders are dubious or above.<br />
<br />
I'll continue I suppose until I see max on all factions.  As of now though, I don't know if it's possible to ever buy/sell there for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's been a long time since I've worked on this.  I turned in around 2000 chips before I got bored and forgot about it.  IIRC, you can turn in 16 chips at a time, 4 stacked in each trade slot.  I'm pretty sure this still works, and would certainly save a lot of clicking.  Since it's just bonechips you stand to lose, it'd be worthwhile to test it out once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really ?  Hmm..... i'm so close.  Might have to go slaughter in Paineel a few more days and try and push past it.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I play an Iksar and I've turned in over 2500 bone chips and still not ally yet with anyone but Legion of Cabilis. Was working on ally faction to get lower prices on Alchemy items, but after all the bonechips I've spent I've found a few better spots.<br />
<br />
Thurgardin is great if you don't mind killing giants and doing the first few Coldain prayer shawl quests over and over, thats some great faction there.<br />
<br />
Shadow Haven rules too. You can do the letter quest in less than 10mins and it took my from apprehensive to amiable in one shot. I'm ally now after 5 quests. <br />
<br />
Those options are a hell of a lot faster and easier then maxing Cab faction. Not sure about other cities for an Iksar shaman, but those two work well for me. Hope that info helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The alchemy herb vendors, and most other vendors in West Cabilis are on Brood of Kotiz faction.  Bone chips don't help that faction.<br />
<br />
That being said, as a barb with indifferent faction and 105 charisma, I get the same prices in Cabilis as I do in Halas, Shadowhaven and Firiona Vie.</div></div><hr />

Nice guide though, but you should be thoroughly ridiculed if found inside the walls of cabilis, I know I do to all the fleshies that I see wandering there.  =)</div></div><hr />
