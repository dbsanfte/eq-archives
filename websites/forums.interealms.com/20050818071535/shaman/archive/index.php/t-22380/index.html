<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We all know the main reason that GoD spells are No Drop is to get people to buy the expansion.   So here is a solution:<br />
<br />
In Abysmal, create an NPC, preferrably next to the turn in guy for spells, that will remove the No Drop status on the Geo stones.  You hand in the No Drop stone, and receive a similar stone but its droppable.  BUT, its also No Rent,  No rent in the way Sky keys used to be as well as the AE blockers in Uqua:  If you zone, die, camp, etc it vanishes.   You can then hand the now droppable stone to someone, they turn that stone back into the NPC to change it to the No Drop version, and they can then turn it in for a spell.<br />
<br />
It allows spells to be tradeable, but you have to have the expansion they are from to be able to trade them since you have to be able to zone to Abysmal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wouldn't it be simpler to make the stone dropable and the spells nodrop as long as the turn-in guy is in GoD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You identified the problem as spells being NO DROP in order to force folks into purchasing the expansion. Your solution would also require folks to purchase the expansion. I don't see how it's a solution, in that respect. <br />
<br />
The idea itself is a good one, I think, except for the unlucky LD while holding onto the spell stone (I expect that could be fixed somehow). Too many times I am grouped with folks who all have their Yxtta spell (I don't think I spelled that correctly), one drops, and is left to rot because we can't get a guildy there fast enough to loot it. It'd be a blessing to be able to hand them their stone and have them go turn it in. Better than doing two turn-ins (one for the return to a NO DROP stone and the other for the actual spell) they could simply take their non-NO DROP rune and turn it directly into the NPC to get their NO DROP spell.<br />

That would work too.<br />

It wasn't a solution to change that, it was a solution for those that HAVE GoD but can't get their spells because of where they drop.  And while I believe you need to earn your spells, I don't believe you should be required to reach the higher zones as a means of &quot;earning&quot; them.  Buying them or trading for them from someone that has gone to those zones is good enough for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What I hate the most is that we have to farm these spells off xp mobs since they do not drop off raid events.  Makes it difficult for a full time raider to obtain these spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless you mean GOD as a whole being &quot;higher zones,&quot; I'll have to disagree with you there. I think getting GOD spells is relatively easy with a bit of work. <br />
<br />
My Balance of the Nihil dropped in the Sewers of Nihilia: Crematory. That's not a higher zone, to my mind, it seems like it's an entry-level sewer zone. Mobs were hitting for 650-ish IIRC, which is less than a hard LDON. I've been told the rune that turns into Daluda's Mending (Erol? Eril? who the hell named these runes, anyways) drops off the boss mob in one of the sewer trials. No idea what level he is, but as soon as I figure out how to complete the trial and take a crack at him, lol, I'll let you know. I was told it was the Purifying Plant, which does seem to be the hardest of the sewer trials (mobs hitting a bit harder than 1k), but my group had no troubles there. I have yet to hear about the other spellstone drop locations. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well heck, you could always play on FV and pay an arm, a leg, and half of your face for a GoD spell... I did see a few on sale from before the turnin change.<br />
<br />
I tried out a friend's character on Xegony, and man, no drop LDoN's and aug'd equipment is a major PAIN in the booty.  Don't see how you guys put up with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I hate No Drop.   Just put recommended levels on everything and get rid of the stupid tag.<br />
<br />
Even WoW's system of having it only become no drop once its equipped is a step in the right direction.  I'd rather just be able to give/trade/sell whatever old gear I have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have Ancient: Scounge of Nife or Ancient: Feral Avatar?  If so, did you have them 5 months after Luclin was released?  Unless you farm VT (I've done about 15 clearings, no ancient scounge), kill Seru or do Vuluk, you did not get your ancient spells.  Basically, unless you played in the endgame (and I would consider RoV endgame Luclin now), you didnt get the spells.<br />
<br />
The problem I see to many times with casters is they think that because the spell was made for them, they should have easy access to it.  Why should that be?  Especially with content there doing?  Why should a shaman who is in bazaar gear have access to an endgame item?  When this happens on melees, you see the balance off classes get skewd (Elemental Crafted Bows for Rangers as an example).  <br />
<br />
Should runes drop off sewer trash mobs?  Sure, but make them rare.  And by rare I mean getting Torpor or Malo off a guardian wurm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take a journey to Fiornia Vie then.  Having everything droppable (that matters) has literally destroyed the ecnomy there.  Getting to level 65 is easy.  Getting to level 65 in full time gear is not.  <br />
<br />
I have a bunch of old gear I would like to sell but I know that having this gear on the market would kill the market on comparable droppable gear.</div></div><hr />

No, I don't have Ancient: Scourge of Nife.   I would consider being in the top guild on our server and being in Inktu`ta qualifies as &quot;playing in the end game&quot;  So what does that have to do with anything?   Or were you planning on giving me the uber line of &quot;you don't deserve it because you aren't good enough&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That's an interesting idea Jaradis and you deserve credit for trying to come up with a solution. <br />
<br />
After thinking about it, here is what I think would work better:<br />
<br />
The stones are droppable and tradeable but in order to get your spell you have to combine them with a no drop vendor purchased cheap item buyable in Abysmal, inside a no drop combine container also npc vendor purchased in GoD. <br />
<br />
This way you can trade the stones but the person who uses it has to have GoD to do the combine that creates the no drop final spell and it avoids the headaches of the no rent issue (people zoning by accident or forgetfulness etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Or you could just make them no-drop and vendor sold so you need to go to GoD to buy them...</div></div><hr />

uh almost all good gear nowadays is req. level 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As many times as SOE has changed the GoD system for spells, you would think they would get tired of monkeying with it and just make some way to have the spells enter the marketplace and be traded freely.  As Jaradis stated, the GoD design for spells is oriented around generating cash, but I really don't think they are going to gain more sales of the expansion at this point because of it's notoriety.  Basically, SOE has nothing to lose by making GoD spells droppable.<br />
<br />
As a player who enjoys raiding and is sick of camping mobs, I really won't be likely to see many GoD spells until possibly past Uqua.  The possibility of picking some of them up in the bazaar would be a nice addition to the game at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AMEN!  Our prices are SO TOTALLY MESSED UP...  It's sorta funny to see how high prices can get though.  I think I've seen 3 million for an item before... can't pin the name exactly...<br />
<br />
It's sorta funny how people from other servers go &quot;Yeah, I bet you just BOUGHT all your EP armor...&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, like I really have the 10 million pp (literally, minimum estimate on a good day) and months to wait to see them for sale to do that.<br />
<br />
Talk about mudflation... also, this upcoming ripping augments out without damaging them thing is gonna throw everything outta wack, as a lot of prices are inflated due to most stuff being sold with augs in it, and oftentimes good augs mind you.<br />
<br />
I do see a lot of Luclin level Ancient spells for sale for 50-100k, but a lot of them, such as Ancient : Feral Avatar, or the Ancient necro lich spell, have been made obsolete by later spells.</div></div><hr />
