<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lantril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Good day all.<br />
<br />
I plan on making 34 in the next few days and was wondering how best to keep my new best friend happy.<br />
<br />
Aside from buffs and quickness what else should I do for him ?<br />
<br />
Is it worth spending a few PP on weapons or armor and handing them over ?<br />
<br />
I will have a 54 cleric around to buff us now and again.<br />
<br />
I think I have the combat strategies fairly well sussed out but any tips in this regard would also be happily accepted.<br />
<br />
Thanks - Lantril Lv 32 Iksar Shaman - Bristlebane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just keep the weapons that drop normally.  Velium weapons are great, but rusty daggers will work.  Kill skellies when you see them.<br />
<br />
I have never given my pet armor, except the summoned stuff.  I don't even AC buff him.  I do give him HP.  STA and AGI are a waste and DEX is, too, unless you have given him a proccing weapon.  STR has been debated, I used to give him clicky Jaundiced Bone Vambraces STR since it was free, now STR comes with Focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lantril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm interesting, a rusty weapon is better than nothing at all then ?<br />
<br />
Does DPS output improve if the weapon is better than rusty or is it just the fact that he has a weapon at all that makes the difference ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I focus my pet , for HP alone its worth it. Dpending on how tough the fights are ill  AC/AGI buff , i dont knoe if they do nything apart , cause i cast them bolth at the same time. But it does seem to help him last longer. Regen him too if you can , if its too much mana dont sweat it. The really big part is giving him procing weapons. Farm up gnoll hide lariats or farm up velium weapons , they will mage a huge difference untill you can proc mage summoned weapons. I fund that if you  just go to GD or split paw and offer buffs/pp for the weapons you can get them free or at very lil cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the main point to arming him is to get him to dual weild , which causes him to hit more often. Procs are just a bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just the weapon so rusty is just as good as FS weapons or a orc pick. Remember though ours dogs are warriors so they only use warrior weapons and no drop doesnt ork with them. Velium is qite a popular choice also as the proc weapons or gnoll hde lariats as they proc the stun on them. With my first pets though 34/39 i didn't see a huge difference with giving them weapons but i have still to try with my 44 pet. Hope this helps :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For pet buffs, stick to haste and possibly sow and/or regen depending on what you're doing. Some people cast focus on their pets for the added hit points, but my pet never tanked for me that often, so I never bothered. Str, sta, agi etc., won't do anything for your pet.<br />
<br />
Our higher level pets can dual wield (only the level 55 and 61 pets, I believe), but they need to be given two weapons to activate this ability. The type of weapon doesn't matter (a rusty dagger will do the same as a fine steel longsword).<br />
<br />
At 34, the only advantage to giving your pet a weapon would be if the weapon had a proc. A velium weapon, for example, would add the proc damage when it went off. A gnoll hide lariat (procs stun) is another popular choice. But, at 34, you'll probably see more benefit from selling the weapons you come across and saving the cash for equipment upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Str and Haste if the pet doesnt have a procing weapon.  If he has a procing weapon I add focus ... or in your case at 30 add dex.<br />
<br />
To keep pet happy you are going to have to tank for your pet.<br />
<br />
** shameless plug for ogres ** hope you chose ogre to prevent stuns while tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really all you need to know.  This is where wisdom Shaman have problems.  If your (Not you but in general) method has been root n rot, then you are forced to tank IN TEH FACE, it can get frustrating.<br />
<br />
Buffs? (34) Haste and Regen. (Talisman when you get it)<br />
<br />
Weapons? Whips from Paw (ironic) are nice, check the bazaar. Or go get a couple your self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zeal4u</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Our dogdog can use none warrior weapons,  he just needs to be high enough level to prox them if it has one. I like giving my pet  a serrated bone dirk(prox at 27lvl), which is a rogue only weapon when I need a mob snared. There are all sorts of fun toys to give dogdog. I really like the summoned mage stuff alot ;-p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The 34 pet dual wields as well!  I tested it on my first pet summoned for experience camping (as opposed to casting him in nexus just to have him around! :-) ).   I gave him a slashing and a crushing weapon that were both primary/secondary wieldable and turned on others hits and he was both slashing and crushing.  Of course, he wasn't crushing very often.  I assume his dual wield skill is pretty low :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Myth #1:  Our pets can only use weapons with &quot;warrior&quot; or &quot;none&quot; listed as a class.<br />
<br />
Truth #1:  Our pets can use any weapon that is droppable and works in that slot (can't dual-wield two primary-only weapons).<br />
<br />
Myth #2:  Only higher-level pets dual-wield.<br />
<br />
Truth #2:  All of our pets dual wield.<br />
<br />
<br />
Debunked both of these myths myself.  I've noticed that resists are a big issue with proccing weapons, because your pet will likely be much lower level than what you are fighting, unless you're fighting low blues.  The velium proc seems to only stick 10% of the time on the 50ish mobs I fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>lantril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well thanks for the info everyone.<br />
<br />
I am surprised that after 4 years there are still fairly simple things like the dual wielding issues that remain disputed  :) <br />
<br />
Need less to say I am getting impatient to try it for myself.<br />
<br />
One thing I am not sure about is focus. It was mentioned by one of the posters above but I cant find it on my spell list.<br />
<br />
Thanks - Lantril</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">can buy rusty weapons from Tohsan Hallard (Hallard's Resales, E.

 <br />
just PoP port over to freeport and stock up when needed.  much easier to keep dogdog happy that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i saw a couple people mention that sta does nothing for pets?  is this true, i always cast sta on my dog and it seemed he had more hp but i've never done any hard testing.  have people done testing and shown sta adds no hp to pets :confused:</div></div><hr />

Yes, sta doesn't help pets at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I dont know how thouroughly sta buffs on pets has been tested, but the reason most (including me) believe it doesnt add to their hp is that any time a sta buff is cast on a pc you see their current hp drop, when cast on a pet, no visible affects.<br />
<br />
I only use haste on my pet as a buff, if I thought it was going to be an overly diffucult fight, I would Focus it for the extra hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IIRC, it was only recently that pets were given the ability to dual wield (and there is still debate as to whether this is a bug or not). So, it's not too surprising that we're still figuring out all the details.<br />
<br />
One thing I am not sure about is focus. It was mentioned by one of the posters above but I cant find it on my spell list.  <br />
<br />
I was referring to our line of hp buffs (Talisman of Tnarg, Harnessing of Spirit, etc). You could cast one of these on your pet to increase his hit point total, but I wouldn't recommend it under most situations. If your pet is tanking so much that the extra hitpoints are needed, you're probably doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
BTW, /applaud the shaman community for knowing that it's dual wield, instead of the erroneous yet all-to-common duel wield</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">a couple of proccing weapons. i prefer the lariats and haste and regen and he should be set. unless you can get a mage to summon you some pet stuff for free or find it cheap in the bazaar. muzzle/belt/etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As a longtime ranger, I've always paid close attention to dual wield.  Well, here's my understanding:<br />
<br />
1)  Every NPC in the game of the appropriate level will dual wield when given appropriate weapons.  Class doesn't matter.  Obviously, if they are holding something they like more, the weapon will just go into their inventory.<br />
<br />
2)  At one point, certain class pets after a certain level were given innate dual-wield and didn't need to equip their pets with weapons.  This seems to be mage/necro/enchanter/shadowknight pets only.  Haven't checked druid pets.<br />
<br />
3)  Our pets are 'standard mobs,' in that they cannot quad without weapons.  Relatively few mobs in the game are flagged as &quot;quadders&quot; and are able to dual-wield without weapons.  The other pets were flagged as &quot;quadders&quot; but not ours, obviously because we are not a &quot;pet class.&quot;  Enchanter pets always start with a shield in their secondary, so we'll never know if they could dual wield without a second weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Possibility:  Our pets are animals, and as such their innate attack is &quot;bite&quot; and not &quot;hit&quot; like other pets.  It is possible that &quot;animals&quot; can never be &quot;quadders,&quot; at least I have never seen a biter/clawer also quad.</div></div><hr />
