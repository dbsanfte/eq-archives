<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dohrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used a lot my Barb Spiritist Hammer, which procs quite often (2  procs average per fight). But the howling harpoon seems to proc fairly rarely, did any of you notice the same thing ?<br />

I think different weapons have different proc rates in the weapon.  As I started my Ogre Warrior, I am totally convincied that its true.<br />
<br />
My Harpoon, seemed to only proc once every 3-4 fights, and 50% of those would get resisted.<br />
<br />
However, it makes a nice weapon to get your piercing up.  Perhaps try that icewurm fang if you can afford it, see how it does.<br />
<br />
The Hammer is great though, if you happen to have a JBB also.  Hitting between blasts and getting a proc is a great feeling.<br />
<br />
Things like Snare Whip, and the Venomous Axe, they proc all the time.  Frostbringer only about 1-2 a fight, and other weapons seem to never proc.</div></div><hr />
