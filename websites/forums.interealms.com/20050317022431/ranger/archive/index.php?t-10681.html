<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the Timorous Deep there is a room with a dozen firepots.  Each firepot is shaped differently from the others, meant to represent in some way a city on Norrath.  Touching any of these firepots sends you to the city it represents.  Barring the presence of a wizard or druid, and your willingness and ability to swim or levitate and run across the zone, this may be your quickest way to get to where you are going.  All of the cities are of the old world save one.  No Velious or Luclin cities are included.  This guide is intended for those of us that frequent the Timorous Deep on our way to somewhere else, and do not have a wizard or druid as a constant companion.  The only firepot that transports to a city zone with a Luclin spire in it is the one to Kelethin in Greater Faydark.<br />
<br />
First off the location of the firepot room.  In the southwestern part of the zone there is an almost sunken set of Combine Spires, grid location is –12250, +4375.  You can see the top of the spires poking out above the waves.  The room is on the bottom of the ocean floor.  You reach it by swimming through a square hole at the base of the spires.  It is best to be levitating when you go there, with run off.  If you fall without levitation on expect to take around 100 points of damage.  Be careful to stay away from the firepots lest you end up somewhere you do not want to be.  If you leave run on you may touch one of the firepots and be transported to a location not of your choice.  Yes, this has happened to me, luckily it was not an evil city, just not on the right continent.<br />
<br />
A recent addition is a non-aggro skeleton near the central flame, which is indifferent to all and seems to be warning travelers about Faydedar the dragon that is triggered on a nearby island for the druid epic quest.  Because of the non-aggro aspect of the the skeleton, using it to increase your weapons skills is considered an exploit.  I understand the GMs take a very dim view and are likely to ban anyone caught using this skeleton for weapons skills practice<br />
<br />
The firepots are laid out three to a wall. There is also a large flame in the middle of the room, but touching this takes you nowhere and causes no damage.  The walls are set in the cardinal directions. The analogy that works for me is a clock face. When you face north there is a tall wide firepot. This is at 12 o'clock, and touching the fire takes you to Ogguk.  <br />
<br />
If you are porting to a city you are KOS or dubious in I recommend traveling invisible.  If your invisibility does not fail you can definitely make it out of Oggok and Grobb, I used a young neutral alt to confirm Neriak and Cabilis.  The majority of the ports take you relatively near either docks or a zone line, though not right at it.<br />
<br />
If you are having trouble activating a pot, try touching the fire, not the pot.  Here is the list, in civilian clock face order, by hour, direction, destination, and a brief description of the pot. <br />
<br />
1 - NNE - Erudin - Medium height, narrow firepot with Erudin flag emblem.<br />
2 - ENE - Neriak - Short bluish brown firepot with stylized bat emblem.<br />
3 - East - Kelethin - Slanted side wooden box, splayed eagle emblem.<br />
4 - ESE - Felwithe- Medium sized firepot.<br />
5 - SSE - Halas - Decorated brown box with the fire in a bowl on top<br />
6 - South - Freeport - Medium brownish firepot (Freeport written on it very small).<br />
7 - SSW - Cabilis – Bat-winged urn.<br />
8 - WSW - Kaladim - Short squat off-white firepot.<br />
9 - West - Ak'Anon - Lava lamp.<br />
10 - WNW - Rivervale – Wooden Torch.<br />
11 - NNW - Grobb – Campfire.<br />
12 - North - Ogguk - Tall, wide firepot.<br />
<br />
Good traveling folks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newtonio</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice, accurate and informative post............ BUT no ranger in his right mind is ever going to run/lev/swim all the way to the bottom left hand corner of Timorous Deep just for a firepot port; we have SoW!  We have the Nexus!!  <br />
<br />
Not criticising, all info is good info, just saying no use for us rangers.  I only use TD for my mage these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LatemYvaeh</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I used the Firepot alot when I was hunting Raptors which is a good solo spot from 54 to 58 or so starts to really Light Blue out at 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Newtonio, I use it occasionally, especially since the translocators from FV and BB send you to the woodelf island which isn't all that far away from the firepot room.<br />
<br />
I can actually get places a lot faster and cheaper by using the firepots than running across  a bunch of zones, especially the way my machine zones.  Someday you may be in a situation where that information is handy.<br />
<br />
Rangers collect information, never knowing when it will come in useful.</div></div><hr />
