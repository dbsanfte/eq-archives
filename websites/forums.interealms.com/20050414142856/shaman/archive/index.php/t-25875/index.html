<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This appears to be one of the new dragons that can open up a can o whoop arse. He showed up in Lavastorm shortly after the &quot;way was open&quot; to broodlands. I can tell he is going to be a rough one. One of the guilds on our server were having a hard time with him and they are beyond Qvic flagged, he ended up running all over the place killing everything in his path. His AE range was GIANT. Hit me for 1500 2 times and he was on the other side of the zone. It was certainly a sight to be seen LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guild attempted him last night.<br />
<br />
We had approximately 28-32 people setting up when he agroed our raid before we were ready.<br />
<br />
I was able to slow him with Turgur's (after 2 resists -- I realized he might be similar to the old dragons in that you have to be under him to land a spell, so I tried that, not sure if it was a factor).<br />
<br />
He really wasn't that hard and we got him down to 75% relatively fast.  The problem is that once he hits 75% health, he emotes something like, &quot;I shall return!&quot; and he takes off running really fast.<br />
<br />
I ran behind him along with a few other people as he was regaining health.  He then ran and jumped into the lava pit in the middle of the zone and then depopped.<br />
<br />
It was actually really funny to see him running away like that and then jumping in the lava.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I heard about that on Quellious as well...did the same thing.  They got him to 75% and he went into lava and despawned.  Interesting encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What did he look like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why they put a high level mob with a HUGE AE in a lowbie zone, I just don't understand.... =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pic of Tirranun (http://www.elementaldawn.com/)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow, now that is a nifty looking dragon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Obviously not a real encounter.  Just part of the script introducing DoN</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kanudil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Most likely you'll encounter him once again while you're progressing in DoN, as I exped some in lavaspinner's and your faction gets worse with Tarrin....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was able to slow him with Turgur's (after 2 resists -- I realized he might be similar to the old dragons in that you have to be under him to land a spell, so I tried that, not sure if it was a factor).<br />
<br />
<br />
I wasn't standing within melee range of him and landed nihil then turgurs easily enough.<br />
<br />
and yea, he's pretty much a pansy there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tirranun may be a regular spawn now. he wanders a path from the lava lake, around the edges OVER the wayfarer's camp area (I was giving loc's to guildies, I saw him nearly on top of me....)<br />
<br />
but I don't know...the way is open, and he hasn't been taken down.</div></div><hr />
