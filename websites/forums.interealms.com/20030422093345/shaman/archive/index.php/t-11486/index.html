<br />
I should be level 39 soon and will have around 2 -  2.5k to spend after spells are purchased.<br />
<br />
I have a good AC now (around 900) and I am looking for something to aid my soloing.<br />
<br />
What I really want is something clickable that does no mana damage but I am not sure what exactly I should be looking for.<br />
<br />
I am an Iksar so I realise that may limit my choices a little.<br />
<br />
If I had known what I know now I think I would have gone Troll but thats a mute point.<br />
<br />
I dont mind waiting a few levels to save a little more if thats what it takes.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.<br />
