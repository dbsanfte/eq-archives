<br />
Agree - that's all.<br />
<br />
Wt. can anyone do to improve CoM? It is fine as it is for its level.<br />
<br />
Hm, maybe 1 or 2 quests and a bit of nice loot, but other than that - pass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tahlan Trouble'Maker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only change that I ever heard of so far in CoM is that Lord Rak'Ashiir can no longer be tanked by lvl 49 mage fire pets with clerics healing.  I am not sure if that is true or not but you may want to watch out in case it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">CoM needs to be left alone.  It is a wonderful zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would like to see it changed.  After all, thats what our epic is all about, changing the city, lifting the curse.  They could then put in a pocket zone deeper in the city to hunt in and for epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
if that was what they were doing i would agree, but if it follows the pattern of the other revamps, theyw ill just up the level of the mobs and put some nicer drops in to make it more apealing to a higher level crowd to help deal with the PoP overpopulation. If thats the case im very unhappy about it cause i take all my toons through there and enjoy the zone very much as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>txMaddog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">CoM is fine, the problem is it is in EJ.  EJ scares the heck out of me, even at 60.  See invis undead, uber huge aggro, zone is dark and full of trees so you can see anything.<br />
<br />
If they made CoM easier to get too it might be a more popular zone.  Hopefully the re-vamp won't screw up all the Epic stuff there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you're scared of EJ at level 60 you have issues.  :D<br />
<br />
Killing the reavers is tougher than killing Rak these days imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The only thing I would like to see done to CoM is to fix the key quest to access the upper areas without the use of a rogue.  I think the &quot;skeleton captain&quot; or something drops no drop items that were originally supposed to be used for a key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think the only thing CoM needs changed is the poor amount of loot, nothing good but while it is a pretty good exp zone there is nothing else.  Just a minor named or two that are like lvl 45 or so, one is the stables like &quot;An undead stable tender&quot; or something, and for the temple &quot;High priest ________&quot; That's just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree the whole concept of making a zone NEED a rogue is silly, well they are revamping zones that need rogues (CoM, Hole (Not so much), HS)<br />
<br />
Maybe they will just go in and add some key quests. For the love of god don't make em norent through.</div></div><hr />
