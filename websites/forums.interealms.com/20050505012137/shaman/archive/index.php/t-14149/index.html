<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Come on folks - this board has come up with Wish - &quot;I want a Pony&quot; - lists as well.   Don't be the pot calling the kettle black.    Some of these requests are within reason for the Priest classes as a whole.   <br />
<br />
Taken from this post (http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=31221.topic)<br />
<br />
IMHO the following stand out to me ...<br />
<br />
<br />
 Request for Casting Subtlety type skill. - All priest classes should get this AA including Shaman's<br />
<br />
 Request for Healing Adept and Healing Gift to work with all heal spells. - Case could be made for all healers to get this<br />
<br />
 Reduce reuse timer on SotW from 22 to 5-10min. - No - another AA should be created that allows Caster classes in general to reduce timers on AA's in it's tree - you want a faster SoTW - spend 9 AA's for a 10% time reduction<br />
<br />
 Lower the mana cost of Karana's Renewal (500). -  Playing with mana costs directly on heal spells would require adjustments on all heal spells including Shamans along with Clr,Pal,Bst<br />
<br />
New ability ideas:<br />
<br />
 Animal-only slow. -   hmmm is this not a BST type spell first?   Druid second ?<br />
<br />
 NPC damage mitigation spell (limit amount of damage outputted by a creature). Does not stack with slow spells.  -  OK - why not some form of snare with mitigation effect<br />
<br />
 Attack debuff with significant reduction in attack - stacks with slow spells.  -   No idea why attack should be allowed to decrease more than what slow already effects ... This would lead to more slow mitigation which in general would counter balance the whole idea<br />
<br />
 Increase crit melee hits (short duration) - Increase crit spells (short duration) - Damage bonus for melee (short duration).  -   lumped these all together - All priest classes should get something along these lines <br />
<br />
 Extremely short duration mob slow spell.  -  Can you say instant druid dead spell if it's aggro is anything like what our slow causes<br />
<br />
 &quot;Fork&quot; AA skill - % based activation (like crits) - on a successful activation, the spell acts as if two of the same spell were cast with no additional aggro, just double damage.  -  If this was added as AA - would have to be for all casters including Priests<br />
<br />
 90% rez.   -   Ok - When was the last time you got a 90% Rez?  With Clr Epic's so easy to get nowadays - you are seeing level 49 cleric alt's running around with 'clickies' - What difference does it make really if a lvl 65 druid had a 90% rez and Shaman's didn't?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But that kettle is much blacker! It's black hole black!<br />
<br />
And we did get pony's after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids are the pet class right now.<br />
<br />
What class can solo better than a druid?  They can quad, charm, root/dot with their virtually unresistable dots.<br />
<br />
Druids can play a variety of roles in an exp grp.  They do just fine replacing clerics in 99% of all xp grps.  They can add a good deal of DPS through nukes, charm, DS's, Dots.   They can pull in most POP zones, harmony, snare, innate camo make them well equipped for the job.  They heal better than us and they can do far more damage and offer better utility.<br />
<br />
Druids stack well on raids.   MGB spirit of the wood is awesome, they are the second best healer and second best nuker in the game.  Plus they are always around to accidentally evac your grp to the zone in the middle of a big fight!  <br />
<br />
So set it up... Shaman can solo, but realistically the only soloing shamans are doing now is root-dotting.   Shaman can play a variety of roles in an exp grp too.. like the slower.  Or um, the slower.  Yah, when is the last time you were invited to an exp grp as anything but we need a slower  (yes, I know we can do dmg and play gimp healer with tnargs and quies).  Finally, raids.  We don't even need to discuss shaman stacking on raids, been there done that.    <br />
<br />
People on this board like to hammer druids, but all the druids I group with are great.  Their overpowered asses are welcome in my grps and raids anytime.... yeah you bring your 400dps charm pet, oh... and be main healer too... and can you pull?  thx, I'll just sinia your pet and go afk, anyone want some buffs??  ;)<br />
<br />
Sure we have had wish lists on this board before.  But they were a lost cause from the start.  Because the real difference between druids and shamans is that druids stick together, cry about being underpowered and ask for upgrades..and they get them.  Shamans cower under the hand that beats them.  Oh thank you, nerf me some more and I was still love my class, shaman rox0rs and we are in teh face  We can slow, shaman are teh win and I soloed Yeldema!!!!@1.   <br />
<br />
great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can only stand in AWE after reading this. <br />
<br />
I counted 9 cases of class infringement. <br />
<br />
Simple: If they insist on rezzes, take away the porting ability, clerics can't port either. <br />
<br />
If they want slows, damage mitigation spells, and animal slows, then take away their nukes. Shaman can't nuke either. <br />
<br />
If they went mana-reduced spells, then give em to the hybrids too, they have no self-manaregen<br />
<br />
If they want different resist modifiers (i.e. unresistable debuffers) then take away their 3k heal, shaman and chanters don't have em. <br />
<br />
If they want aggro reduction spells and abilities, take away the leather and make em wear a robe. <br />
<br />
Animal only HoT? Obviously for charmed pets. In that case, chanters, mages and necros should get HoT's too, for elementals and undead. <br />
<br />
I could go on, but why bother? Druids get what they want anyhow. It's been a pattern of whinnig and disgusting boo-hoo filled drivel that has allowed them to get what they want since the begining of EQ. If a class has something they want, they cry till they get it. Of course, this is going a bit far this time, but hey...I know how these stories end ;)<br />
<br />
Only reason I care at all is the fact that someone actually demanded slows, in three different forms. <br />
<br />
Being retired is cool, so I won't waste any thought on this matter after I finish the post...but while I AM thinking about this..I can only stand in AWE at these demands...</div></div><hr />

And for some of us, it's complete ass. I'd love mana reduced spells for my Paladin. MP4 isn't so easy to come by, you know.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Once again, my hatred for Druids is reaffirmed. They're one of the most balanced classes and now they want more? Sony should just delete the whole class. Give them the option of a similar-levled Warrior. Put all the whining and bitching directly into one class.</div></div><hr />

Many of you seem to think that a druid is a good addition to a PoP group. But you're saying that people don't want you in groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought Druids were now as good as clerics in xp groups or has something changed recently?</div></div><hr />

/rant on<br />
I can't believe people have tha audacity to ask for these things.  Why can't people just learn to play their class the way they are?  There's all kinds of things I wish I could do as a shaman, but I CAN'T.  It's not part of the class.  I don't want to play any other class really.  If I wanted to rez I would a played a CLERIC.  If I wanted to be a full time tank, you guessed it WARRIOR.  You want to slow you say?  Then start and level a  freaking SHAMAN.  Oh you like your cool ports, you say.  Then here's my advice, learn to PLAY your CLASS instead of asking for more skills you WONT know how to use, that belong to other classes.  I don't want to be able to port or rez, and I can tank just fine thank you very much.  Here's an idea, just make the MEGA class, who can choose any ability, AA, choice of weapons/armor, and spells they want.  Start em off at lvl 65 with full access to every zone in game with all spells and AA abilities maxed.  Then they can port from zone to zone casting kei for noobs, and solo the sleeper or any other mob they want.  Then they'll be happy with their class.<br />
/rant off<br />

On a different note I love being a shaman, don't feel that we need any changes, have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I will try to limit the regular druid bashing and just point out a few points, that stand out for me:<br />
<br />
1. Asking for a 90% rez after getting a druid consensus, that it would be a bad move??<br />
<br />
I am to lazy to look them up again, but in all druid threads i lurked in the past, there was like a 70, 80 percent majority of somehow reasonable druids, which said, that was nonsense or not needed.<br />
<br />
2. Druids are not wanted in group, whine whine whine.<br />
<br />
I am sick and tired of this one for several reasons:<br />
- First and foremost druids are one of the classes, which have a very viable alternative (shaman too, but to a much lesser effectivity) - SOLOING. Even after charm nerf and such it still is, though the xp rate got lowered.<br />
- in my experience when xp grinding we ALWAYS look for a druid, when we can't find a cleric healer (pickup groups tend to holy trinity, sad i know but it's just a fact of life these days). At least on our server we have a great shortage on clerics overall (maybe due to the fact, that their class is as interesting as watching grass grow?) - so druids would be a welcome alternative - but guess what, no druids LFG.<br />
- in addition to above, when you really want to look for a group and it can be a while before you get one, so what?? Go solo, tradeskilling,  bazaar, questing ... with LFG-tag on. Works every single day for me (yes , i am aware that the waiting for a druid will be longer).<br />
<br />
A quick note to the ones calling this a pot vs kettle argument. I really got a laugh of this, you must be kidding?<br />
<br />
Druids have in my opinion two main areas healing and dps, where they can shine (together with the truckload of utility abilities, they get, but no no, that's no argument of course  :rolleyes: ). NONE of these areas has been limited noticeably by SoE in the last months or year - healing got a serious upgrade - where shaman got left out of most of the goodies.<br />
Shamans main areas are for me slowing and buffing. Slowing in high end encounters has got some serious limits due to mitigation. Buffing since PoP has got near to ZERO improvement (whereas both druid areas got improved with PoP) - haste the exception. The game mechanics (stat caps and the questionable use of most stats) alone together with the insane mana costs made any improvement here impossible by itself.<br />
<br />
So which class has any reason to whine again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm suprised that they haven't demanded the ranger's archery ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, not kidding but maybe a review is in order for reading ease.  If you are referring to my quote:<br />
this board has come up with Wish - &quot;I want a Pony&quot; - lists as well. Don't be the pot calling the kettle black <br />
<br />
That reference is to the dozens of wish lists that have popped up on this very board asking for some of the same things.  Shaman's have posted here asking for rez ablity, CH type heals, self port and port ability, curse type dots, better dots, better DD's, More DD's, etc  .... want to go on cause the truth is worse than this simple list.   If you really need more on this ... I'd be happy to do the simple search and post a dozen or so of the last similar posts.<br />
<br />
The Druid board post was a &quot;I want a Pony&quot; list.  But this list of possible changes isn't about getting them ... it's about the fact that classes have to ask for the world in attempt get hand outs.    <br />
<br />
IF I were going to make requests of SoE, there is NO reason why all Priest's can't get Spell Casting Deftness, Expertise, and Subtlety as AA skills.   I for one would be most grateful to anyone much less our fellow Priests in getting SoE's attention in this regard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Profundo Basso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">From my perspective - shaman, druid and BL are variations on a single theme.  There is so much overlap in capabilities that they have to strictly enforce the class defining capabilities.  I'm starting a petition - get rid of druids, give shaman better heals and worse melee.  No one will notice the lack of druids because no need for ports anymore.  I haven't grouped with a druid since LoIO.  2% of my guild are druids.<br />

or to quote Absor <br />
Absor has challenged us: <br />
Many of you seem to think that a druid is a good addition to a PoP group. But you're saying that people don't want you in groups.<br />
<br />
What is the reason that they don't want you?<br />
<br />
What can we possibly do, based on your response, to overcome that? <br />
<br />
Where's our &quot;tell me why you guys are upset with how your class is being changed&quot; request??<br />
<br />
I'm mad at that whole thread (the one I poseted above).  We (as shaman with our very own I Want a Pony lists) have never asked for such assinine things as what I'm seeing over there.<br />
<br />
On top of that, someone had the *nerve* to say<br />
can you imagine the arguments shamans will give that we can 'possibly' replace their class defining ability on raids?<br />
(after someone asked for a damage mitigation buff)<br />
<br />
grr.  Druids need to go home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ok I'm editing this because I've thought a little about it and changed my mind.<br />
<br />
Would a 30-40% slow vs. animals really be so horrible (that's what was proposed, 30-40%)???<br />
<br />
Nah.  Wouldn't replace us or even really impact us except maybe in like Overthere or other selected places with high populations of animals.<br />
<br />
90% rez, yes that is ridiculous and over-the-top.<br />
<br />
Some of them seem feasible. <br />
<br />
But they want nukes like mages etc etc.  If anything I would like to see an increase in their damage shields at a lower level.  That would certainly give them more utility in pop groups if at 51 they get like a 85pt DS that scales upward to 65 every 3-5 levels, from quested scrolls.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, I *DON'T* look for druids in pop groups.  Or in any groups really.  Their power lies in their soloability.  They could use some group/raid tuning.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You know, if they put these changes into effect (doubtful, obviously), nothing is stopping any of us from starting a druid. Unless you don't want to.<br />
<br />
Of course, if they start spamming the chat channels with demands for uber power ups, I may start to get pissed off with it, but as it stands let them petition all they want. It's their game too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Buntuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">One of the basic concepts about EQ is that the game is based around the idea of &quot;more&quot;.<br />
<br />
More levels, more and better gear, more AAs, more skills, more spells, more damage et cetera ad infinitum.<br />
<br />
This naturally attracts players who... want more. Especially message boards do since it's the only real place they can vent on their miniscule soapbox. How many times have you veterans read a fairly clueless post and went 'boy he really doesn't know anything does he'? I'd wager it happens fairly often. It happens to me all the time, and I'm not talking about conflicting opinions either, I'm talking about people that have no idea what kind of impact their 'good ideas' would have.<br />
<br />
Message board crawls with these people.<br />
The Ranger's Glade does. The Crucible has 'em. The Druids' Grove does too. There's nothing wrong with wanting more. Most people want more in life. They're just clueless in the way they go about it and seem unable to filter good ideas from bad (not that I'm some sorta super-judge on the topic but seriously... stacking p9 and virtue? Puff puff pass, don't hog it).<br />
The real problem with that thread as I see it is that the admins are indulging the whinecrew instead of snuffing them out.<br />
<br />
I educate newbies and overzealous do-gooders on sight. I suggest you join me ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I actually see no problem with a class board having a wish list thread for things to improve the class.  Admittedly, druids went a bit far and are asking for some pretty unreasonable things, but the concept is sound.  No class does not have some issues that could not be improved, and Absor activly asking for player input on this is nice.<br />
<br />
My only beef is due to the fact that my main is a warrior.  You know how the warrior class is these days.  There are at least 2 threads in this forum talking about how pallies and SK's are far  more desirable tanks than we are.  Most other class forums have similar threads.  So why is Absor not talking to warriors, asking us how SoE can improve our group desirability?  <br />
<br />
On the plus side, having a warrior main gives me lots of time to play my shaman alt(53 now and rising).  As an added bonus, I can read message boards and complain while I am lfg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I reckon the class with the most gripes towards druids is wizzies, not us....yep these demands are overboard, but I'd love to have seen some wizzies faces on reading them. Most zones I go to, I hear 'Any shammies LFG?', and that's it, with occasional asks for a chanter or a tank. So I don't think we suffer unduly, frankly I have a 51 druid from way back, got bored stiff and switched and have no class issues with them...hey if they were that fantastic I'd level my own one.<br />
<br />
 I don't remember having the choice of options I do with my shammy, I don't remember being quite able to wander around dungeons, and I certainly don't remember druids being as fun (for me) to level. High end game, yep sure dire charm is powerful, but Dim is no question way up there in power, solo or in a group. <br />

So...it's wizzies I'd expect to gasp more, I play one, they too have the (far less useful nowadays) ports, and nukes, and erm, don't ask for the ability to rez/dire charm/buff/heal/snare/SoW etc....<br />
<br />
Anyway, I love my shammy, druids will continue as they always have, if peeps really think druids are that fab, then play one...personally I loved the versatility but Dim is, to me, more versatile and more fun to play....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">That post up there is why i love Hen so much as a mod here &quot; Druids stick together and thats why they get what they want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Please dont take this the wrong way Hen, cause its NOT a rib on you, but another reason exists in a quote form the thread there.<br />
<br />
&quot;- No flaming in this thread, this will be heavily moderated.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think a big problem is that when these topics come up , they turn into flame fests or just something negitive that anyone that matters isnt going to bother sifting through. All im saying is, maybe in the future we should have stricter moderation when these style threads come up?<br />
<br />
Personaly i would like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Talanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">OK take this from a person who knows both sides of this argument, you want to know why druids a peeved right now?<br />

Group experience bonus increasing dramatically. We've been testing this on the Test server for a few weeks, and some final tuning may be needed before it is released. The goal is to dramatically improve the experience gained by groups. The old group experience bonus ranged from 2% to 20% for a 6 person group. The new bonus will range from 20% to 80%. In addition, the 6th person added to a group will not count when experience is divided. This means that in a group of 5 the total experience is divided by 5 then distributed to each member. A group of 6 will also only have the total experience divided by 5 before it is distributed to each member. Due to this large increase in group experience, we will be reducing the experience modifier given in Planes of Power zones. Those zones had a dramatic experience bonus. These zone-specific experience changes are more than offset by the increased group bonus.<br />

Now the druid community was fine, till this reared its ugly head. Yes druids are one of the most powerful soloing classes in EQ right now. We don't want a single thing to improve our soloing ability. (At least I don't) I don't want a 90% rez. I like the idea of an actual SIGNIFICANT Atk reduction that DOES NOT stack with slow. A new spell or take some of the atk debuff from Hand put it on Illum and make hand into this. What we are looking for is a viable grouping option. Shaman are also one of the most powerful soloing classes. Not quite a strong cause of the lack of snare. But still quite a powerful soloer due to slow and LOTS more HP's and AC snare isn't as big of a deal as it is for druids. But you are also one of the classes who groups DO NOT happen without.<br />
The best idea I've seen was the lowering of mobs max dmg. Lets say the 50% mark. Mob hits for 500's now he hits for 250's. Hell make boss mobs immune to this ability I don't care. Now I have not even reduced the amount of dmg done by this mob 50%. (does the mob always hit for full?) When you have decreased 75% of dmg. (He's still able to hit for full, although he doesn't always do it but he now swings 75% slower) Shaman's are still the best choice out there at this point. BUT it does make druids a second class alternative to shaman/chanter/bl's. The max hit reduction would also make our dmg shields more useful to groups. They are still hitting as much as they did, taking our dmg in return, but also not pummeling the tank cause he's quading for 540's.<br />
We are not griping that we are underpowered, we are griping that we have 0 to make us preferable in groups. This was fine with us for the most part, we can get the occasional groups, I do fine on raids, and we could solo our butts off. Well when they nerf our primary way of xp we'd like a little something in return to make this &quot;BIG&quot; change useful to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Why do Druids need to be a 4th class alternative to a shaman/enchanter/beastlord when they're already the 2nd choice for healer, and can fill a DPS spot to boot?<br />
<br />
And frankly, yes, PoP solo experience is just too damn big.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I think a cleric cheal in most xp environments is a waste.  I would take a druid for their ability to increase the groups mana regen, effectively heal as well as a cleric, snare running mobs, nuke if need be, and evac so we dont have to rez.<br />
<br />
When Druids got their big heal they moved from competition with shaman to competition with clerics where I think in xp groups druids come out better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you mean..sorta like the cripple line only not?<br />
<br />
I'm kinda shocked how many are taking this so seriously, I laughed when I saw them asking for slows, better heals, rez, and cripple..in addition to a buff that would part out more of the warrior class abilities by giving all melee critical hits..hell, it would give any class melee critical hits. <br />
<br />
How can you look at that list and not laugh, considering it is the board moderators posting it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Sure ... give Druids the ability to make you crit more ... then watch a Druid and Paladin completely decimate Crypt of Decay when he's laying down slays for 5k a pop two or three times a fight. I wouldn't complain one bit, nosir ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">&quot;one other suggestion.<br />
SHM / CLR both have a kind of melee improvement (Rabid bear / Summoned proc hammers / bash )<br />
something interesting for druid meleeing would be fun.<br />
Maybe an upgrade to our lowbie Firefists spell, something that adds a lot of attack at higher levels, and self only, and perhaps gives haste also. something Comparable to Yaulp  <br />
Ainianu Ashenfyre&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Give them rabid bear, and give me  a usefull aa, if they call that trash a melee improvment, i've lost the last bit of anything resembling respect</div></div><hr />
