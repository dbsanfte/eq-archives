<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have group leader HP3 (100hp to everyone in group) which in my humble opinion is well worth it.  I have now collected 7 more points, and pretty soon will have to decide what to buy next.  I am leaning towards Health of Target's Target since I am often in the MA group in raids, and I think this would be useful for the MA, and any melee and healers in the group , to see when aggro has shifted etc.<br />
<br />
But I have a few questions which I hope you guys can help me with:<br />
<br />
1)  How much extra mana does Mana Enhancement give?  If it's 30/60/100 like Health Enhancement, it seems to me that it's not worth it.<br />
<br />
2)  How much regen does the regen one give you?  Again, if it's 1/2/3 as I suspect, that's a waste of time.<br />
<br />
3)  How much ATK does the ATK one give?<br />
<br />
4)  Any of the whackier ones like Inspect Buffs etc worth getting?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The mana ones are the same as health from what i've seen.<br />
<br />
Targets target is pretty nice IMO. Can tell easily when someone over aggros, what something mezed is aggro on etc.<br />
<br />
inspect buffs is ok on raids at level 1 and really cool at level 2. At level 2 it tells you time remaining on the buff so if it's 5 minutes left you can rebuff before you engage the big boss. Really kinda handy IMO.<br />
<br />
I beleive the attack one is 10 attack per level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Taradarr.  I'll definitely do HoT'sT next then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Health of target's target is great.  Very very good.  The other one that is great is the one that allows you to see what spells others are casting.  I can't recall the name.  However, it shows mobs casting as well as your own party.  It's very nice when the pally can see Mob begins casting annul magic! and stuns the **** out of him.  Or you can see gate spells even more clearly.  You can spot clerics that much faster and plan accordingly, etc.  You can see when your slack-ass afk wizards actually bother to nuke!<br />
<br />
Can't recommend those 2 skills highly enough.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spell Awareness, or Spam Awareness as some guildees call it, has its good points and bad points. <br />
<br />
Good: working on a new encounter? Not sure what you need to cure that ae/dot/etc with? It Helps. We learned a type of God mob was self hasting repeatly during fights and on pulls, so one of the toons that wasnt doing alot at the time, stayed on removing that haste as mobs came into camp while the other shms stayed on debuffs. Result - fewer ppl died. In short, this is going to solve encounters quicker for you, identify what classes mobs are quick, and reduce deaths.<br />
<br />
BAD: The spam. You cant turn this off, its an active aa. Not a passive one like Health of Targets Target. This absolutely needs a toggle switch to turn it off for the group or for the individual. You dont need this ability on 24/7. There are times you need it, when you do, you do (think vp). And when you dont need it, the spam blows hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Target of Target and Inspect Buffs are both awesome.  Get both of those before the other junk.  The ATK one is in line roleplay wise but ..  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We used Spell Awareness once on a Earthb clearing just to see how many people afk for those raids, by parking a bot at the raid with all spells on, and parsed it later.<br />
<br />
Was pretty entertaining actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good info thanks.  I have Delegate Main Assist, very handy but not earth shattering its pretty situational as to how useful it really is. I have 3 more banked and working on a 4th, so now I think I know where I'll be leaning towards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, I got HoTT and then went for ATK level 1 having been nagged by one of our rogues.  Tested it on someone with capped worn haste, and it seems to stack above that cap, and with FA as well.  So potentially ATK5 wil give 50 extra ATK on top of worn cap and FA.  Which is quite nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Get HOTT asap.  It's beautiful.  Absolutely the first Leader AA I recommend anyone get.<br />
-You can target the mob you are killing and see right away who he's aggro on and whether they need the heal or not if you are assist healing on a boss mob or something.<br />
-You can see the health level of mob in camp if you are healing anyone that's targetting the mob.<br />
-You can see who's slacking and who isn't when raiding if you target various people to see how quickly or even IF they are targetting the trash mobs that are being brought to camp.<br />
<br />
I've got /findpc as well.  It's got it's uses.<br />
-You have the same functionality of the golden path to the target as you have in the Bazaar or home town, but the person must be in your group.<br />
-If you have framerate problems travelling and need to cut down your clipping plane, but know the landscape, you can findpc your groupmember and just follow the golden path and adjust it for the places you know you have to move a bit off path.  Running through the trees in PoV is an example of this for me.<br />
-If you raid the plane of time, it makes it incredibly easy to find where your group has run to for prepping for the next trial.<br />
-If you party with people that perpetually get lost, this skill is wonderful.<br />
<br />
I've got delegate main assist as well.  It's ok, but not super amazing like HOTT.  It's still very worthwhile to get though.<br />
-It's the final word on whether you assisted the main tank or not.  Can't argue with a targetting circle as long as the main assist stays on target.<br />
-I've played an enchanter a bunch, and I know the pain of broken mezzes.  For example, 2 mobs inc, you mez one the moment it its camp, broken mez, GREAT!, anger level rising, repeat.  When you see the target ring, you know what NOT to mez to make things easier for yourself and for the group.<br />
<br />
I've seen spell awareness.  I really like it.  It's the next thing I'm getting.<br />
-You know exactly what spells NPCs are casting.  You know can tell the class of an NPC mob right away on many spell casts (ie malo for example).  You can tell what buffs NPCs cast.<br />
-You know exactly what spells group members are casting.  You can tell if someone is slacking by not casting any useful spells or whatever.  You can see what spells someone is using if they are getting too much aggro, and if you know alternatives can possibly suggest something else.<br />
-If you like being knowledgable of what's happening around you at all times, get this.<br />
<br />
Our main raid leader has NPC health too.  It's ok.  It's fairly redundant with HOTT and targetting box, but still has some uses.<br />
-If you have a mob damaged but many that are being CCed and not hurt so much, you can see which mob should be next to be killed.<br />
-You can see the health of the main target mob even if you are off healing other people<br />
-Its only 2 points, so don't expect anything super amazing....<br />
<br />
I've seen mark NPC in use as well.  It's useful for specific circumstances, but not many.<br />
-Best use ever that I've seen is to mark your Charm Pet so when it breaks, it's super easy to retarget because he's got a permanent targetting ring.<br />
-Other uses for it involve CCing multiple mobs on inc, and giving instructions on what to CC ahead of time.<br />
-This will sort of pass for Delegate Main Assist if you like clicking your hotkey a lot.<br />
<br />
I haven't ever seen Inspect Buffs in action.  I can see it being useful knowing how long till certain buffs are dropping.  Best use would be for FA.<br />
Offense enhancement stacks with everything, but is pretty marginal benefit.  It's like 9 attack per level.<br />
Health enhancement is pretty marginal benefit.  It's like 30 health per level.  No big whoop when you have multiple thousand HPs and mobs hit for 400-1200 depending where you hunt.<br />
Mana enhancement is pretty marginal too.  It apparently gives you something like a 50 larger mana pool per level.  *yawn*<br />
<br />
Best order of getting skills IMO:<br />
HOTT<br />
Delegate Main Assist<br />
Spell Awareness<br />
NPC Health<br />
Mark 1<br />
Findpc (move this high up in the list if people you party with really really get lost easy hehe)<br />
Inspect Buffs 1 and 2<br />
Health Enhancement<br />
Attack Enhancement<br />
Mana Enhancement<br />
Regen Enhancement<br />
Delegate Mark<br />
Mark 2 and 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Artebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Spell Awareness doesn't add more lines of output, since it puts the spell name on the same line as the casting message (instead of &quot;so-and-so begins to cast a spell.&quot; you get &quot;so-and-so begins to cast a spell. &amp;lt;Malos&amp;gt;&quot;). I agree it takes some getting used to, seeing all those spell names fly across your screen, but once you're used to it, I think it's the second best leader ability (after health of target's target), and as good as HoTT when you account for the difference in cost.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Offense Enhancement lvl 2 gives 11 attack.  Got it today.  Not sure what lvl 1 gave me.  Going to max out Offense first since in raids I get all the rogues for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Offense Enhancement lvl 2 gives 11 attack.  Not sure what lvl 1 gave me. <br />
Hail,<br />
<br />
Offence Enhancement level 1 gives +9 to attack.<br />
I would personally also recommend Offence enhancement if you want to get to be group leader during many raids, unless your melees are near the attack cap.  The melees I end up getting grouped with will almost always side with more attack over any fancy boxes or rings that don't increase DPS.  DPS is King.  This has let me get group leader during some really tiresome pickup raids over others in my group with more abilities than I, but theirs didn't affect DPS.  Failed pickup Bert raids alone have earned me at least 3 group leadership points.  :D <br />
<br />
My next investment will be HoTT though. ;)   That will really rock, though I'm a little fearful of how apparent my stealing aggro when I'm pushing hard in LDoN adventures will be to the MA struggling to keep it.  :p <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">unless your melees are near the attack cap<br />
The Leader AA stacks with all forms of +attack, so it shouldn't matter if they are near their cap or not.<br />
<br />
As for the benefits of +9 attack per level of leader AA, it's pretty marginal.<br />
Unfortunately I don't recall the exact numbers, but from what I remember reading, +10 attack will give a melee roughly 1% more damage output over their base damage.<br />
This sounds fairly accurate to me considering I remember parsing avatar to do roughly 10% more damage (+100 attack).<br />
I'm not online right now, but I think offense enhancement had 5? levels to it, which caps it out around +45 attack, or about 4-5% more melee output for your melee members in your group.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think spending 4+5+6+7+8=30 leader AA for 4% more damage output of the group melees is worth it compared to the other abilities you can get.<br />
For 30 points, you can get:<br />
HOTT (7)<br />
Delegate main assist (4)<br />
NPC Health (2)<br />
Find PC (4)<br />
Spell Casting Awareness (6)<br />
Mark NPC (3)<br />
Inspect Buffs (4)</div></div><hr />
