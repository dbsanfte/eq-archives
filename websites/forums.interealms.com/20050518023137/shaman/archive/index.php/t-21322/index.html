<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We took a group to the Deep yesterday to get some shards and we were headed across the invis bridge.  The warrior strolled a little to close to the side and off he went.  After getting back up and going again, off he went again.  He ended up falling 2 more times also.  Four times total, AND HE NEVER DIED!!!!  The enchanter and myself were on the cliff and got to close to the edge trying to see the warrior and over we went, SPLAT! returning to bind.  We were so mad that he survived 4 trips down and we died.  We were all laughing about it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did he take damage upon falling or did he come back up unharmed ?<br />
<br />
If I remember right, fall damage is based on one's total weight so the warrior must have had enough hps to survive the fall as well as a low  weight. Either that or he landed on some gelatinous underbulk which broke his fall.<br />
<br />
The Deep's invisible bridge... good times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i used to love freakign people out by just running across and  /quit halfway through the fall.<br />

Log back in and bear up and walk up the side of the canyon ;)</div></div><hr />

He is only level 63 and not in a raiding guild, so not a whole lot of hitpoints, and I'm not sure of his weight.  Buffed I have about 5k and he had probably about 6.5k.  His health bar only went down about 2 blue ticks, almost no damage.  I on the other hand with only about 60 wt. took 20k damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I take like 400 damage jumping from isle 4 to isle 3 in PoAir, a monk in my guild with max safe fall 20k'd o_O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its another example of shoddy programming on SoE's part.<br />
<br />
Falling damage is calculated off the time spent in the air, which is itself a function of machine speed and how much video detail you have turned on.  So, if you have a fast machine, and most of the graphics candy turned off, you will &quot;fall&quot; very fast, have very little air time, and thus incur very little damage.<br />
<br />
This is also why people with slow machines were getting hit for 20k at the spires a while back.  Because the EQ game engine places the character into a zone several seconds before you regain control of the character (again, ****ty programming), if you happened to land on the spire scion's head, you were treated as if you were in the air that several seconds before your screen updated.  On a fast machine, this was being counted a 2-3 second fall, but on a slow machine, it was long enough to produce 20k falls for some people.</div></div><hr />

One step off a rock and you 10Ked, LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If this warrior happened too be named Xaivtox its becase of the Famous &quot;Xaivtox Curse&quot; .. that the only way I can see this happening ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually I have noticed that it isn't really total weight. There is a break point where you take a lot more damage from falling. The point is right at 100 encumberance. Over that you take a fair bit more damage than under it. I kept my SK under 100 for a long time and she took nearly no damage from falls. Now I need to get rid of 25 weight boots to get her under 100 again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's got to have something to do with race.<br />
<br />
Faern (Barbarian) will commit suicide if he runs (SOWED + NUMLOCK) from the tunnel in DL to Karnors (Provided he lasts that long). 117/217 ENCUM<br />
<br />
My Ranger? (Wood Elf with SOW) He also gets beat up, loses maybe 50% health. 91/115 ENCUM<br />
<br />
My Enchanter (Dark Elf with Run 3) Will take near ZERO damage. 71/105 ENCUM<br />
<br />
Now you're trying to tell me, that a big ol rough tough Barbarian who has spent the majority of his life in the not-too-forgiving world of Halas and Everfrost DOESN'T know how to run across mountains....<br />
<br />
But a city born and bred - LIVING INSIDE A CAVE- their whole life Elf does ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Corbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">He may have been using a Hack. Not sure if the no fall damage hack still works but it worked back in the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">One time we were doing deep shards for our recruits and I told the new rogue &quot;hey there is a trap in the middle of that bridge there.  go disarm it for us&quot; and he tried to do it.  I made a lifelong enemy there.  Good times - I love that bridge.</div></div><hr />
