<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lege10</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read through a lot of threads on this board and have come to the conclusion that Seafuries are the best Loot/Exp combo for my level(Dulak would be the other but worried that the MOBs on the boats hit too hard for my gear).  I would like to know what the best way to take them down solo.  <br />
<br />
Also if there is another spot that would be a good loot/exp spot for my level and gear. My Magelo is below.<br />

A few changes though since update server wasn't working this morning and my work comp won't let me update<br />
<br />
Primary - Tarnished drive shaft<br />
Feet - Chokidai Hide Boots<br />
Arms - Giant Scale Male Sleeves</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">find a quiet spot on the beach, make pet, haste it, give it two rusty 1h weapons, /pet guard here<br />
<br />
go pull one single (they're very very easy to get solo)  pull with slow, run back to your dog, with regen and the furby slowed you should barely lose life, if any, toss on a dot or two, profit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You should be able to handle the first boat ok (Lady Druilia I think?).  Just work clockwise from the enterance to the boat and root them before they run.  You will be able to single all but one if memory serves.  There is one near the mast that will bring 2; just root one and back up.  Always clear toward the stern (front) of the boat first, as it makes a pretty good staging area for a bit.<br />
<br />
Make sure to work around the boat as you clear it.  That way you avoid adds and repops on you.  The agro range is pretty small, so you can also med if you need to.  With KEI and a temp or ageo you should be able to do fine, although a horse and a JBB would be really helpfull to you here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I suppose all those other threads mentioned these things, but just in case:<br />
<br />
1) Don't attack named or corrupted, except Gornit. You can beat the named but he will drain all your mana. Corrupteds summon and then you may also have to fight the thing that spawns upon their death. <br />
<br />
2) Always sow yourself and have gate memmed. If you get trained, let the pet stall them while you run to a safe distance and cast gate. Yeah, getting back can be a pain, but getting a rez and getting back can be worse.<br />
<br />
Good luck.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As was recommend previously park your dog someplace safe and pull with slow.  I recommend using your disease dot as it won't pull aggro off your dog like poison will.  The seafury's don't hit very hard - max around 78 I think - but they do have a ton of hps and most likely your disease dot will finish it's cycle.  If you don't do any tanking you could probably drop a poison on when it's at half and be safe.  Keep root up and keep your mana up.  You may get adds and will want to root rot one while dog takes out the other.  If you feel like tanking go ahead, like I said they don't hit hard and when slowed they are borderline pathetic.  The aren't difficult and once you take a couple down it will get much easier.  Nothing to really panic about but at 49 you may want to think about grabbing a dd partner - tank or caster would work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">JBB would help a lot.  Seafuries have laughable damage output, but they do have a decent number of hps for their level, and using dots to kill them can result in a fair amount of downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lege10</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The problem is i have 1.5K in the bank and a JBB goes for 10K or so... I wish i had the cash to own that and a horse, but this is my main character so i have no cash flow from any higher up characters.  Thats why I am camping the Seafurries now to get Exp and good loot.  So that I can afford a JBB or Horse which what I am saving for now... as my equipment is all descent now for my level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>otakuryoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yah seafuries can be a pain with their HP....but they are doable w/o too much danger<br />
<br />
i was doing em just after hitting 52 and had the misfortune to have a wanderer agro on a rooted one dog was eating...root parked that one out of way and killed first one...another popped on top of this fight just as another wanderer came all the way down to camp spot for some reason....dog died with 2 parked and 3rd at 1/2 health...guy started running low hp and aggroed a 4th..JOY!!<br />
<br />
but....no dog was able to finish one and root rot the others....was intense seeing if i could take 4 with no dog....thank god for mount and JBB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For numbers, Seafuries have approx 4k HP. Many Shaman use them to max their defensive skill if it's not maxed already. When I hunted there (And I spent 51-55 and 6AA points) there I would make my camp at the tip of the finger of land just to the right of the abandoned druid rings with the Ogre NPC as you look at Seafury Island from the AC Island. I pulled with slow, never got a resist after a patch that changed how level affected resists. Gave dog 2 weapons and haste sent him in on incoming, then backed to the water's edge and stole agro bombing E-Bolt on it. When strictly meleeing to work piercing skill up with a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang, Dot would wear off at about 25-40% of health left. Root when deathwalk starts and let dog finish while I head out and get next victim. Even faster if you use a JBB. My best was having 5 dead corpses piled at my feet to loot and laughing at the Druid sitting down the beach from me as I went off to get #6 while he was still medding. C3 makes that possible, and a very worthwhile investment for the return you'll see in cash/gems. Grab Gornit and see how heavy you can make yourself, I think I got well over 400 one time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A lot has changed since I was leveling there, alpha doggy, KEI, gear improvements probably make them a good bit easier now, regardless of the toys you have.  Horse and/or JBB and you will go through them like butter.</div></div><hr />

erm, how? I spent 2 hrs doing Gornit + seafuries and the xp was painfully slow. I'd have the rogue pull then I would take aggro with slow, sic dog then poison dot and melee. At 25% health, the rogue would finish it off. At one point, I just grouped the rogue with the shaman and pulled 2-3 seafuries at a time while the shaman + dog killed Gornit and even that didn't speed things up any.<br />
<br />
Just wondering how you managed to stick it out all the way to 55. I wound up going back to Fungus Grove and doing shrooms and mutants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">xp in the 50s was painfully slow anyways, if I remember correctly I went from like 39-51 in DL, moved to furies to 56, KC to 59, and did 59 at 3 hours a blue on sentient suits in WL.<br />
<br />
Before the group/solo xp changes I was actually doing better solo than getting groups any time I ever tried them back then....<br />
<br />
well, of course AE groups were way better, but go figure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Exactly. This was before PoP came out and the general preception of when to do what as far as AA and other things went. I also wanted to get a Baron title at 55 so that's part of the reason I stayed. For the solo Shaman it was Spirocs in TD from 46-50 and then head to OOT. I think I did some grouping around KC between. Yes it was a long boring grind, but at the time I wasn't really into looking for groups either, so it was just easier to grab a C3 and catch the boat and do my own thing. I remember I was playing a lot of odd times, like middle of the night Pacific time so none of rest of guild was on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I spent about 5 hours there the other day trying to get my druid epic mob to spawn, In that period of time I got a few kpp of gems and cash loot as well as 10% or more xp for a 57 druid, 55 shammy and a 57 ranger. Mobs are a joke, I'd pull up to 5 at a time and let them beat on the ranger unslowed and just heal him, only really slowing the ones pulled of him by the shammy and druid.</div></div><hr />
