<br />
I have my main, a semi retired 61 shaman, my pally on a friends old account and I got a free trial account from sony today. everything up to LoY for 30 days. they must be desprate. I was toying with the idea of adding a 3rd to my duo. I'd probably make a DPS class but in some threads I saw some nice things about necros. I really dont know which would be the best class to make.<br />
<br />
or hell, since Im so bored with this game which would be the best trio to start from scratch with?<br />
<br />
any input?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If its going to be playing third to the shaman and the paladin, I strongly recommend something that isnt key intensive.  Like a caster to start.  A class that you can hotkey everything for.<br />
<br />
Im thinking for that group, make a wizard.  All spells can be hotkeyed so it takes less than a second to switch over, start cast, and switch back.  <br />
<br />
Adding a melee DPS class would take too much effort away from the shaman and the paladin, and splitting your attention away from your tank and healer is kind of a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say mage, necro or wizzie. mage brings dps, awesome pet (pet pulls also if ya need to) necro can also pet pull, huge damage potential with high hp mobs, fd pulls, can feed pally or shammy either health or mana, wizzie big nukes and port/evac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I suggest a mage or necro.  A necro would be more intensive since you would be casting a bit more than the mage but you would also have FD to pull with if need be.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, mages and shaman compliment each other very well.  The mages summoned items greatly help out the shaman and his pet while the shamans buffs greatly help the mage pet (and the necro pet though too).<br />
<br />
I 3box a war, mage, and shaman and really appreciate what the mage brings to the combination.  Also, a shaman and plate tank won't be doing a ton of damage so the fights may last longer, depending on what you are killing of course.  In that case, the mage would get great use out of his damage shield.  Of course, in a longer fight and a pally tanking, then a shaman and necro could really put their dots to good use also :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would say either Wizard or Druid.  Both have ports which is something that you will learn to love.  Wizzys can provide raw DPS which your trio is missing.  Druids have similar nukes that mages have but have healing and buffs which will stakc well with your group.  Dont forget snare also.  Mages and Necros are good, but I dont think they would be best for your combo.  Druids or Wiz just bring more to your trio then those do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adler28</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Being a 3 box user myself i have a 65th Shaman, 65th Warrior and a 58th Cleric... I been using 2 for 4 years and decided to go with a 3rd 2 months ago but it all comes down to the combination of your classes and i have to say that the shaman will be casting atleast 3 or more spells at the beginning, since the pally will be doing the pulling and the only melee and now u are gonna need a healer and if not that pally will die quickly cause your shaman will have a hard time healing u in the middle of slowing the mob (in higher lvl's) so i would  create a Druid for healing and dotting purposes cause im telling u that a caster class won't do u no good unless they can heal and buff and slow cause the next thing would be replace the shaman and we don't wanna do that do we ). The less u have to switch char's the better and canning during battle at times really sucks.</div></div><hr />
