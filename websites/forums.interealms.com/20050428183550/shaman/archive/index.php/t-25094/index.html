<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I threw out all my EQ CDs today and uninstalled.  I had cancelled my account a few weeks ago and it runs out of gas the first week of January.  EQ is dead to me!  I'm a level 24 shaman and it's a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't bring myself to uninstall EQ, even now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought about it too, but after about a day or two of thinking, I decided to do it.  I never want to play EverTest, or BrokenQuest, again.  I'm tired of being a beta tester and watching my guild atrophy away when we reach then end of an expansion before it's finished, only to build up again with lesser quality players to continue the cycle.  It's like a fire. Once it burns to embers, you can rekindle it, but it's never as bright as it was before and it just burns out again.  For players in guilds not at the end game or for unguilded players it might not be the same ordeal, but the game doesn't give me what I want anymore.  WoW does, and I'll be playing that for the next several months at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I feel your pain Jin. I didnt uninstall i just zipped the folder and moved it to my back up hard drive. I dont think ill ever throw out my CD's, i dont need to go that extreme and its nice to have memories to look back on.<br />
<br />
That said EQ is dead to me too. The only time i even thinka bout EQ is when i say &quot; Such and such in WoW is better then EQ was&quot;.  Its done, its over im a WoWer. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, what you been uo to Jin. You in WoW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haven't uninstalled EQ yet, though it is officially dead.<br />
<br />
I think I played WoW for about 40 hours in the last 4 days lol.  God bless 4 day holidays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Our three EQ1 accounts expire sometime in January.  I'll uninstall it then.  I am not throwing away my CDs, but I don't INTEND to play again.<br />
<br />
Anybody want to buy an elemental-flagged lvl 68 shaman on EQ1?  Anybody?  Anybody?</div></div><hr />
