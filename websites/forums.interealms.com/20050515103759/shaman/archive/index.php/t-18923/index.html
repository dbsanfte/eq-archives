I really wish that someone who has a bigger voice than mine would have started this, but I don't know how long we can go on, thread after thread, talking about changes and upgrades that this class needs to stay balanced and fun.<br />
<br />
Shabura's idea is the best i've seen that the most of us could agree on, hopefully some of us can help take this small poll to the next level, whatever that might be.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time, Heyokah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To hear a lot of people talk on this forum, you would think that shamans are one of the worst classes in EQ.  You'd think we were gimps who can do nothing except slow, and we are almost eclipsed there by enchanters and beastlords.  This simply is not the case.  Shamans have been and still are a very powerful class who can use that power in just about any situation.<br />
<br />
That being said, I still think we need a little tweaking to make us better.  We need something that makes us more adept at slowing.  Right now, our only advantage over an ench is that our slow casts faster.  The 5% difference does not matter one bit in an exp group (although the marginal difference can be the difference between life and death on a raid).  As of right now, one of our current GoD spells gives us a fast casting 55% slow with a -30MR mod.  I think this spell is an excellent idea and we should have gotten it a long time ago.<br />
<br />
I also think we need an upgraded poison nuke that casts just as fast as spear of torment, but does the damage of velium strike.  The long cast time of velium strike makes it almost unusable in ldon groups, and spear of torment just does crappy damage.<br />
<br />
Dots need to be tweaked so that they land easier (in pvp and pve), and they need to generate less aggro.<br />
<br />
We need some form of group heal.  I'd be very happy with a group quiescence AA that we could cast every 15 minutes or so, and MGB.<br />
<br />
We need more atk buffs.  I feel that shamans should be the master of melee buffing, and enchanters should be the masters of caster buffs.  However, with both the best haste and the best mana regen buffs in the game, enchanter takes the #1 slot of both.  It would be unfair to enchanters to, at this point in the game, switch haste lines with them, so I think we need some form of atk buff that stacks with avatar (bih'li doesn't count).  Also, if endurance regen is as important for melees and voq is for casters, and shamans get the best endurance regen buffs, I'd be happy there.<br />
<br />
Do that, and shamans would be perfect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What we need most is 1 of 2 things. We need:<br />
A) A form of slowing that is superior to what other classes have in such a way that it makes up for the penalties we got (lesser healing, lesser nukes, slower healing) OR<br />
B) we need a substantial upgrade in the Healing and nuking areas.<br />
<br />
What also is wanted is:<br />
c) faster DoT. Seeing that DoTs are considered our major source of damage we need one that is usefull even in situations where mobs die fast. Bane would have been about perfect if the recast time would have been the same as on our poison line.<br />
d) An improved invis. this could be a fixed duration one or a SoS type random duration one.<br />
e) an endurance regen spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would like to see a line of Focus Buffs or a line of Debuffs that improves other players damage.  Of course our buffs already do this indirectly but I am speaking of spells that directly improve a Melee's crit percentage or adds 10% to a Caster's DD.<br />
<br />
I think that we will find that as melees get more used to their Endurance Skills, our buffs will become important again, but I would still like to see a line of spells that act as a force multiplier for folks grouped with Shaman.  It may even be a good idea to make these spells Other Only.  This way they would not be seen as unbalancing the Shaman for solo play.  <br />
<br />
If Shaman are going to be a support class then we need Uber support spells.</div></div><hr />

It also gained a 30 second recast time.  With regular spell haste+BOR, how much is turgurs cast time?  2.1? 2.3? I'm at work but can't check atm.  The new slow is under 3 seconds so wont benefit from spell haste.  So we get a slow that is 20% less than our regular slow, with .8 second faster cast time and a small negative MR check and it only lasts 7 ticks.  I'm sorry Jinheim I really don't see how this is so great.  Recast times suck.  Add to that, the beastlord spell is also 55% (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4875&amp;source=Test), fast casting, but it's 1/2 the mana of the shaman version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering the drastic change it underwent from yesterday, I'm pretty sure both our slow and beastlord slow are not done yet.<br />
<br />
Anyways, as for why I want it.  With an 18% detrimental haste item (not the best, but better than most people have) my turgur's is 2.5.  With BoR it is 2.2.  I'd guess with the best haste item, you could get turgur's down to a 2 second cast time.  Remember, though, you don't always have blessing of reverence.  You usually do, but not always.<br />
<br />
A 1.5 second cast time is much better than a 2.2.  Faster spells channel easier than slower spells, obviously, but a spell this fast is exponentially better because you can cast it in between swings, making it much much easier to get off if you are being hit.<br />
<br />
The resist check is also nice.  It isn't a huge modifier that makes it near unresistable, but -30 is noticeable.  For comparison, it's the same resist check as on greater immobilize, and I know that spell has a better resist rate than turgur's does, although it isn't a huge difference.<br />
<br />
So basically, we have a fast casting slow that lands easier than turgur's.  Unfortunately, we can only use this slow every 30 seconds, and it barely lasts that long.  In addition to that, it is a noticeable inferior slow to turgur's.<br />
<br />
Why would I want this?  Backup.  As we all know, turgur's has a short but annoying recast time.  If you bounce a turgur's, you have to stand there for 6 second while you wait for it to refresh.  During these 6 seconds, chances are pretty good that you are getting smacked by whatever resisted your slow.  Once turgur's finally does refresh, you've got to channel it through these hits.  If your slow bounced once, then the mob probably wasn't malos'd, and malos is fairly difficult to channel through an unslowed mob.  Thus, your chances of landing turgur's on the second try is the same as the first.  So, you've got a reasonable chance of getting resisted again and having to wait another 6 seconds to try again.<br />
<br />
When I get a resisted slow and aggro, I usually hit VP (assuming I got aggro).  This, of course, knocks to mob off of me and roots it, leaving it to be debuffed at my convenience.  I can then go back to slowing other mobs which are currently loose and attacking my group.  Of course, VP has a 2 minute recast time, so I can only realistically use it once per pull.  If I get aggro again while VP is down, or VP gets resisted, I just have to deal with it and try to channel a slow.<br />
<br />
This is where the new GoD slow comes in.  I definately would not be using it as a replacement to turgur's, but rather as a supplement to it.  I'd use Ancient Balance as my backup slow when turgur's bounced.  Turgur's gets resisted, and instead of waiting 6 seconds to try to channel it, I have another slow that is ready to be cast, is much easier to channel, and has a significantly better chance of landing.  It'd look something like this:<br />
<br />
You begin casting Turgur's Insects.<br />
Your target resisted the Turgur's Insects spell.<br />
Ldon_hard_mob_01 hits YOU for 980<br />
Ldon_hard_mob_01 hits YOU for 980<br />
You begin casting Ancient Balance.<br />
Ldon_hard_mob_01 yawns.<br />
You begin casting Turgur's Insects.<br />
Your Ancient Balance spell has worn off.<br />
Ldon_hard_mob_01 yawns.<br />
<br />
The 30 second recast isn't a very big deal, because this would be something you'd use in an emergency to save your own ass, basically like VP.  Like VP, though, it has other uses besides self preservation.  You can use it to slow the mob that is attacking the cleric, or to quickly snag aggro off of someone.  If there's two mobs inc, you can turgur's one, balance the other, then go back and turgur's the second - all with no time spent waiting for turgur's to refresh.<br />
<br />
I don't see anything bad about this spell, except that it will take up an already valuable spellslot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shaman were balanced just fine after Kunark.  Then all the other classes started getting &quot;re-balanced&quot;.  This significantly increased their abilities, for the most part.  Shaman were never revisited, so their relative strength was never adjusted.  Other classes have received significant improvements, which has caused the &quot;balance&quot; to be upset.  In order to balance the Shaman against the other classes, the Shaman needs some enhancements.  This is not to say that &quot;the sky is falling&quot; or that we are &quot;worthless&quot;.  I hate bitching and crying like some other classes do, and I think many Shaman feel the same way.  We only need a few small improvements.  Some increased quick DPS (like nukes) and some increased healing ability would resolve most of the problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yah I've never said we're worthless either, we are still a good class.

 I wish you all the luck in the world in your QUEST  to fix the class that I have highest hopes of playing again.  Myst has been semi-retired here of late because I discovered the Beastlord was more of what I started the Shaman to be (Battle Priest), but I truely miss him.   :( <br />
I find myself contantly looking for the Cann button...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It seems to me that the underlying complaint is that we're an out-of-date support class playing in an era of the game where support classes are unnecessary and unwanted.<br />
<br />
We used to be the ultimate melee buffer/debuffer.  Give me back that role and I'll be happy.  Perhaps take some of the high end gear effects and give them as spells.  Things like strikethrough, combat effects, or accuracy.  Let my spells have a noticable impact on a melee class's dps, mitigation, and avoidance.  Maybe a spell line to increase melee damage by a set % or aids dodge rolls.  There are LOTS of ways to give us buffs that make a difference.  Same thing goes for debuffs.  If I can positively affect an attribute for a player, I should be able to negatively affect that same attribute for a mob.  If I can make a player hit more, for example, I should be able to make a mob miss more.  Maybe something like a reverse Bulwark of Vie--cast it on the mob and every hit from that mob has 10% of the damage taken off.  Currently, the only melee debuffs that do much of anything are slows.  There's a huge range of territory here that we could expand into.<br />
<br />
On a seperate note, a lot of our power has been diminished simply by the speed at which mobs die in a normal xp group.  At this point, we're not lacking in high numbers for total spell damage.  We're lacking a way of dealing signifigant damage in short fights.  Our most damaging spell, Breath of Ultor, has a higher base damage than any wizard nuke, including Strike of Solusek.  Exactly 666 more than SoS, interestingly enough.  The problem is that the fights are too fast for ANY of our powerful dots to be of use.  If an average xp group's fights were lasting 2-4 minutes instead of 30-45 seconds our damage output would be a lot more noticable.  Of course, if we started tossing Ultor, Bane, and maybe Saryrn on a mob, we'd pull agro off even the best tank.  Some way to allow us to use our spells effectively would be necessary.  An on-demand agro debuff would give us a way to do this while still being able to gain agro for root-parking or off-tanking.  A hate modifier for our dot's would accomplish the same thing, whether built into the spell or given as a Spell Casting Subtlety style AA specifically for dots.<br />
<br />
All in all, I think we're all just asking to be given back a concrete role to play in groups and raids.  Something that we can point at and say &quot;this is what I do well&quot;.  If that role is to be support, then make my support actually do something.</div></div><hr />

        Ok but on what spell slot do you put it ?  8 spell slot is a damn limit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There are easier ways to fix us:<br />
<br />
- nerf BST max slow to 50%<br />
- nerf ENC max slow to 60%<br />
- make avatar lasts 15 minutes without any AA<br />
- make stats buff USEFUL<br />
- give us an upgrade to tnarg mending<br />
<br />
This will fix the group desireability of the class.<br />
<br />
Having a -XX MR slow is totally stupid, most people already think our slow is unresistable 1 sec cast time with no recast time. After 4 years!<br />
or so i was lead to think after an idiot whined that i wasnt slowing elementals mobs fast enough on a multiple pull. i was told&quot; you suck shammy, slow them&quot;<br />
<br />
As for raiding, jinheim expressed good ideas. My only concern in raids is that more than 3 shaman = teh suck, that and sta/agi/str buffs becoming totally useless with ele/time gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Arctarus please never ask for a nerf for other classes.  Just not a good thing.</div></div><hr />

I'm not politically correct. Everyone and their brother knows that sharing abilities with other classes or melee weapons is what unbalanced EQ in the first place. Everyone should be unique.</div></div><hr />

Guess Im a minority then :P<br />
Seriously though, group heals would be nice, a faster heal would be nice too but with Second Forte (Hello Conjuration $$), critical affliction and a fast slow with neg modifier(to get messy situations under control) I will be perfectly at ease with my shaman.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt say no to some more atk buffs either, I miss the days when it was more noticable with a shaman in group (statwise) and focus wasnt *only* a hp buff<br />
<br />

I don't think we're unwanted at all.  I am still constantly getting group invites anytime I'm lfg (and lately I get tells without going lfg and while I'm already in a group).  The lines have blurred a lot, and you no longer need a cle/enc/war holy trinity group to do anything (note:  This is good).  Because of that, it's also now easy for groups to not get a shaman.  But I don't think that we are so inferior that everyone is taking a BL or enc over a shaman.<br />
<br />
I'd just like to see a few new upgrades to help efficiency.  Turgurs is a level 51 kunark spell, and I'm still using it on every single mob.  Some kind of upgrade would have been nice (either as is with the neg. resist check, or as is without that damn recast time).  Can4 is a velious spell, and our main source of mana regen.  While it was tops in the day, it has lost a step over 4 expansions and doesn't keep up nearly as well as it used to.  The addition of can5 aa helped out a lot, but we really need a 400hp/200mana range cannibalize, or a way to cut the reuse time on can5 to between 2 and 2.5 minutes.  I think we need focus to give a decent amount of hp as well.  Both clerics and druids can out-hp buff us, plus their side effects are also better (70ac or 8mana regen is better than 65str/dex).  Nukes could use some work as well, poison too little damage, cold far, far too long cast time.<br />
<br />
Fix up those a little bit, I'd be pretty damn happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and that's just it.  I don't have room in my 8 spell slots for a marginal spell such as this.  If it was an AA, like VP, maybe.   You specifically mentioned LDON Hard, what would you unmem to mem this spell?   <br />
<br />
heal, nuke, canni, quies, bane, fa, malos, turgurs<br />
<br />
that's my line up, when I am in my 100+ ldon hard group.  When there are other non regulars with us, sometimes I need to drop bane and add a root there.  Can't afford to drop all my damage spells, as it is, I am outdamaged by the bard and cleric in my group over the long haul.  Especially in undead dungeons, where the cleric averages like 100dps.  I guess I would drop Canni.  However, even with chanter, bard buffs and max FT I still have to work for mana, I can't use just c5 alone if I am debuffing, dropping banes, and keeping FA up on 4 meleers and a pet.<br />
<br />
do you trade your healing ability for this slow?  or your mana-regen ability?  or your damage ability?  I would trade none of them, I can't, they're already marginal and I have to push to get performance out of them as it is.<br />
<br />
I'd try use this slow on a raid as a bridge until turgurs could land, as I use grummus now on resisty mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">do you trade your healing ability for this slow?  or your mana-regen ability?  or your damage ability?  I would trade none of them, I can't, they're already marginal and I have to push to get performance out of them as it is.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would unmem Bane, but I understand that that is not a sacrifice that everyone would make.  In a normal mode mission, I am 90% of the time the puller and I am fully occupied with that.  I don't have the mana or time to spare to be throwing out dots and this spell in its present form would be an excellent addition to our pulling abilities.  In a hard mode, I am very rarely the puller (although I might be more tempted to try with this spell), and there is almost always an ench.  Having an ench present makes dots pretty damn inconvenient to use for two reasons; The first reason is that you cannot dot adds (well I guess you could :D) because they are mezzed, and the second is that with a CoD pet, the damage your dots do is completely inconsequential.  If there is even one add, by the time you have it malos'd and slowed, the first mob is at least half dead and there is no point to using Bane.  For me, the only time I use Bane in a hard mission is when I start casting it on an add as the first mob dies, and it usually lands right as the tank is breaking mezz, thus giving it a chance to run full duration.  <br />
<br />
That being said, I do not find Bane to be useful all the time, and I would swap it for Ancient Balance.  That's just my opinion, though, and I realize that most people don't have the same playstyle that I do.<br />
<br />
One more thing:  A lot of the times I find myself in an ldon group with only one melee (the tank).  imho, it isn't worth keeping FA memmed just to cast on one person, who isn't even a dps class and thus recieves a lesser benefit.  I'd gladly swap in AB there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i dont like these new slow either, but i can see if it was tweaked ie our normal slow but with 1.5 sec cast or less at 65 then that would be better. as it is this slow is useless if you group with abeast who can already do what this spells does. but for 65%.<br />
<br />
what i would like is a poison dd quick cast 1k? possible a new curse type dd 1.2k ish? which has a debuff effect slow mana regen /stam or casting times? for 3 ticks? atleast some creativity.<br />
<br />
A new pet spell so our pet can make use of the new pet aa, so pets can atleast hit mobs and on same line the new spirit call line to have imporved pets so they can hit named things. <br />
<br />
A new slowspell that has faster cast/reuse time but same % for mr and dr slows. and new quin that does 3k for 300 mana be nice:) or a group version or quin.<br />
<br />
a buff with nice attack but last for a good while fa nice but the time it last and need to recast so often is a drain. i would like the attack part of fa but leave the stats out and make it last for 1 to 2 hrs.<br />
<br />
And what ever other nice ideas come up.. quick dots like bane are nice, or new rain spells?<br />
<br />
well my thoughts anyway, i dont like the spell seen so far for shaman<br />
<br />
as for aa i like the idea of the pets aa aslong as our pet is u/g, and the new warder pet is ok but seems underpower compare to other same pets. crit affliciton is about time, and should be count as just what should be there already.<br />
<br />
aa to increase our mellee like rabid bear but last longer:) would be nice. but not be all end all. aslong as increase our dps and usefullness to a group/raid i be happy. which spell wwsie isnt and aa is ok but could be better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mephista D'Monica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Okay, I will try not to rant as I do this seeing as this is one of my first posts on these boards.<br />
I just want more killing power.<br />
Maybe a slow aa that gives negative adjustment to mob's chance to resist.<br />
Maybe an unresistable 50 percent slow.<br />
Oh, and the ability to heal for ele xp groups w/o serious downtime wouldn't hurt.<br />
But above all more killing power.<br />
Our nukes suck, our dots suck.<br />
(Though I'm certain some of you think our poison nuke is great dps).<br />
Anyhow, I don't see any reason why we are not getting the serious upgrades that other classes have gotten.<br />
Maybe we just need to whine more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dannil Farseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ability redundancy among classes is good for the game, particularly for experience groups because it allows more successful group permutations. <br />
<br />
So, beastlords and enchanters got to slow, spreading this crucial ability among THREE classes. Druids got a nice miniCH that lessens dependance on clerics, spreading this crucial ability among TWO classes. If we had gotten a similar miniCH, parity would have been served relative to the way slow was given to other classes. We did not, and I see this as a problem.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying we should necessarily get a miniCH per druids', but some upgrade in healing would be nice. A group heal, a spell that heals like Kragg's but casts like Tnarg's, and a 3-4k CH would certainly balance us in the heals department. Or for those of you (like me) who have no desire to sit in rotations or remain hopelessly devoted to health bars, a few nice group heals would serve the same purpose. Group heals would also further our reputation as Doodie Hits The Fan lifesavers and help keep us differentiated from other healers, IMO.<br />
<br />
I have no real issues with the way my slows behave. I actually feel this is one balancing area they got right. I'm still the primary slower everywhere I go and I've never had a complaint about how fast it gets done.<br />
<br />
Damage on the other hand... I agree with this apparent consensus that the game has outpaced the usefulness of our DOTs. Sure they are killers. But I haven't soloed much past 61, my raiding time has increased significantly and my DOT usage has dropped off the map. That said, I don't think we need new DOTs, I still use them when duoing with kiting necros or other times when playing with less than a full group. What we really need is a new nuke or two. Just one, really. As others have said, a nuke that casts like Spear of Torment (or faster) and hits for 1,000 (ie, Velium Strike, but I don't have it yet) would be boss.<br />
<br />
I have no problems with mana regen. I figure, if I can get through a LDoN adventure without KEI without running OOM, my mana regen is more than adequate in most every situation, carpal tunnel be damned.  ;)  <br />
<br />
SO to sum up, heals and damage. Just the opinions of a long-time lurker. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My thoughts on all this balance crap:<br />
<br />
Shamans have been stagnant since kunark.  The current crew is less imaginative and knows less about the game than the old one.  We will see only decreases to our power relative to other casters.  We will get a few diamonds in the rough, like VP turned out to be, but they will not counter encrapulent upgrades like talisman of the tribunal, malos, or our ENTIRE NUKE AND DOT lines.  Melees, of course, are in a deep pit, and will never climb out.  Unless all expansions after velious are deleted.   :p <br />
<br />
If you want new powers and abilities, start another class.  I'm not saying this as one of those &quot;if you don't like it, play another class!&quot; people....I'm just stating that we won't get anything out of this expansion except a swift kick in the ass.  Like LDoN and PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">But I don't think that we are so inferior that everyone is taking a BL or enc over a shaman. <br />
<br />
Well considering I am usually the puller in all my LDoN groups (back to why in a min)....<br />
Pulling easy is no problem I just bring whatever and however many I want and my group will handle it.<br />
<br />
Pulling hard? Yep I still do it but it is much better for my group for me to play my 64 Enchanter rather than my 65 Shaman.<br />
<br />
Not a flaw with either class but no way is a Shaman perferable in an LDoN hard and most people want to do hards when they can.<br />
<br />
Frankly we have lost ground in every expansion.<br />
Looking like we stand to lose more in GoD.<br />
Hybrids are almost as good, as good, or better at all of our roles and we are a CASTER class.<br />
We are just saying &quot;We are not going to take it anymore&quot;<br />
<br />
We can't afford to.<br />
Basically what keeps us getting groups is people perception of what Shaman used to be. That and a well played Shaman can be versitile (IE back to why I pull).<br />
<br />
The reason I pull in LDoN?<br />
My groups lose the least when I pull.<br />
The mobs come in slowed and my DPS is so much weaker than the rest of my normal group that I am EXPENDABLE to pull.<br />
I can still patch heal when in camp toss off an occasional AE and back out for more mobs I go.<br />
<br />
I do not mind the role. I have a 55 monk and a 57 Warrior and did lots of pulling with them. Its a role I know well as any class now.<br />
<br />
Back to GoD.<br />
We simply can not let Sony let us lose more ground.<br />
They want to give others better stuff I do not care.<br />
All I want is for them not to close the gap on us anymore and if possible us to get some much needed attention.<br />
<br />
We have been pretty silent as a class over nerf after nerf to our class.<br />
We just can't afford to do that with GoD.<br />
<br />
To the original quote. We are not unwanted but are losing so much ground to other classes that it is quickly degrading to that point if we keep letting them screw us on every expansion.<br />
<br />
Not class envy. I love my Shaman as well as all my other characters.<br />
But the truth is if everybody else gains power every expansion and we do not. There has to come a point where we fall behind.<br />
That point is very close.<br />
It is time to draw the line in the sand and say only this far and no farther.</div></div><hr />

<br />
however, that's for the end-game shaman.<br />
<br />
Prior to elemental, shaman are just fine as is.  Once our buffs become worthless (due to melees all capped without buffs) we become a slow/Fo7 bot.  Our DPS is good if we're fighting against MOBs with low poison resists (like VT) but DPS drops into the toilet if you give a MOB even average level 60 resists... try to stick BoS on someone with a 140 poison resist... 1/3 maybe?  Try to stick it to someone with 200... 1/6?  300?  1/30?  Where the shaman becomes less and less useful is toward the end game when we can't do damage other than partially resisted DDs, where our buffs are useless except for 500+ HP from Focus, and where our slow is marginalized by 2 other classes being able to fill the duties.<br />
<br />
The new AA that they're throwing at us with GoD is laughable - it shows a total disregard to what is facing the high end shaman player - we don't rely on our pets for DPS... our DOTs are being resisted... AND you're going to charge me 20 AA for it?  Give me a break.</div></div><hr />

-Upgrade in healing power, preferably in HoT department.<br />
-Upgrade to nuke. I don't mind if we are the bottom of the totem pole for nukes for priests, but at least give us the damage of velium strike on a cast time like spear of torment.<br />

But back on topic, lvl 40, I usually will slow, throw in a heal, ask what buffs who wants, slow more, yatta yatta. It's boring, but its repetitive and easy, which is what I like.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">personally instead of &quot;upgrading&quot; turgurs maybe they should give us an innate -30mr (Heyokah's malise 15-20AA avaliable) to our spells this effecting only spells we cast this would remove the &quot;penality&quot; we get from having the malo line.<br />
<br />
as far as I can figure there are no developers that play a shaman (at least regularly). I say this because not only are we over looked but they have given us the same spell (pureblood anyone, granted they fixed it after the fact) and they seem to be doing it again with the AA wolf pack<br />
<br />
any way time to go home</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">and that's just it.  I don't have room in my 8 spell slots for a marginal spell such as this.  If it was an AA, like VP, maybe.   You specifically mentioned LDON Hard, what would you unmem to mem this spell?   <br />
<br />
heal, nuke, canni, quies, bane, fa, malos, turgurs<br />
<br />
that's my line up, when I am in my 100+ ldon hard group.  When there are other non regulars with us, sometimes I need to drop bane and add a root there.  Can't afford to drop all my damage spells, as it is, I am outdamaged by the bard and cleric in my group over the long haul.  Especially in undead dungeons, where the cleric averages like 100dps.  I guess I would drop Canni.  However, even with chanter, bard buffs and max FT I still have to work for mana, I can't use just c5 alone if I am debuffing, dropping banes, and keeping FA up on 4 meleers and a pet.<br />
<br />
do you trade your healing ability for this slow?  or your mana-regen ability?  or your damage ability?  I would trade none of them, I can't, they're already marginal and I have to push to get performance out of them as it is.<br />
<br />
I'd try use this slow on a raid as a bridge until turgurs could land, as I use grummus now on resisty mobs.<br />

One of the things I'd like to see is a poison resist debuff.  It bugs me that I've got all these nice specialized DR debuffs, but my disease dots are useless in groups since they will only get a few ticks in.  A resistance debuff that I would actually use would be nice. <br />
<br />
Over all I expect the biggest source of DPS I add to a group is through hasting the DPS melee classes.  While I won't whine for a faster haste, how about one that lasts significantly longer, so I'm not continuously hounded for &quot;speed plz&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I'd like to have a new poison DD with at least a close to damage out put and casting time as other nukers (but I expect that is asking for too much), but the least SOE could do is round out some lines of spells we already have into fields that make sense.</div></div><hr />

sure i would love a better heal, better slow, better DD, better DoT...<br />
But hey i can still tank mobs in the planes, i can pull, i can heal (even tho healing a 10K+ tank with gimpo heal kinda sucks).<br />
I dont think i would EVER change main, shaman is the way to go, just learn the mobs better and know your spell book because im sure that there is spells in there that you are not sure of how to use hehe (i still have this problem   :p <br />

<br />
However there are some noticable gaps opening between the shaman class and other casting classes that could use some attention. <br />
<br />
Our DD healing options are limited to one spell Tnargs. Kraggs as we all know is worse than useless.<br />
Our DD damage spells are terribly weak<br />
Our DoT spells are functionally useless in many circumstances (great in soloing though)<br />
Our useful buffs are limited to Focus, Avatar and DR/PR, the rest are irrelevant<br />
Our slowing abilities have effectively no significantly useful advantage over chanters and Beastlords<br />
<br />
While this looks like a long whine list I am not saying that all of the points I raise need huge attention, a tweak here or there would be appreciated. Quiescence for instance is excellent and Malos is superb. Canni while annoying at times is very handy and requires a little thought to use really effectively.

Shamans have been and still are a very powerful class who can use that power in just about any situation.<br />

Agreed.<br />

In my experiences in MMORPGs many people suffer from 'the grass is always greener' thing.<br />

this is true and many (including myself) have loads of fun doing their thing in the game. That said... If you are familiar with dealing with customer service issues in larger corporations and such, you'd know that the client that makes the most noise, does get more attention. Sad as it sounds, the shaman community either doesn't make enough noise to get heard (think last main line slow upgrade and cannibalize upgrade), or SOE has disdain or some opinion of the class that merits that they overlook us.<br />
<br />
Most just want to ensure that reasonable progression of the shaman abilities get proper fixes and balanced upgrades.</div></div><hr />

I actually am posting in spite of myself—and it’s gonna be a LONG post. These threads tend to be excruciatingly painful to read, mostly because the people posting have no clue what they’re talking about. (No doubt some will immediately point fingers at me.)<br />
My bonafides, such as they are—my main is a 65 shaman with 557 AAs. I’m the raid leader of a time enabled guild, and yes, we have cleared time in under 6 hours. What does that mean? Besides the fact that I’ve played a shaman for a good long while and that I’ve had to memorize most of the abilities of other classes, not much. However, it does mean that I have had to play almost every class out there at some point. Those on which I have spent the most time are druids, enchanters, clerics, warriors, monks, rangers and wizards. I’ve spent the least time playing beastlords. (For the class of trolls who can’t refute something so resort to insults—yes, I have a life, a girlfriend who is entirely too good for me, a job, and I do exercise.  )<br />
<br />
First, I’m going to take a moment to be elitist—one of the earlier posters was exactly right. Shaman are comparatively very powerful at level 60 (compared to other classes). HOWEVER, from levels 61-65, especially with the inclusion of AA abilities, the other classes take a major jump in power. Shaman do not. Shaman are very static in power from 61-65. That leaves them noticeably behind the curve on balance. I am going to be talking about end game shaman (level 65). If haven’t played a level 65 shaman, and aren’t correcting something I say about a class other than a shaman, you don’t have any business replying. My response to you is, “talk to me when you’ve experienced it.” Shaman have not had a significant upgrade since Kunark.<br />
<br />
Shaman are not hybrids. We are a priest class. Originally, near as I can tell, our role was to be sort of a battle priest. We trailed slightly in healing, but had higher melee caps. That was useful up until about level 50ish when mobs started to beat the tar out of us.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to today—clerics now out melee shaman at the end game. Out of curiosity, I dueled a cleric (weapons only). I was using a 1hs 23 del, 32 damage with a 450dd proc (-350 resist check on DR). The cleric was using his summoned hammer. Same hp, same haste on both characters, close to the same AC (I was higher!). The cleric won. Clerics get the slam ability too. Only large race shaman get slam—and it caps at a skill of (1)—or maybe (0). I forget. Other shaman have no ability or spells to stun a mob. I think I can safely say the ‘vision’ for shaman no longer is that of a battle priest. What about the rabid bear AA, some may ask. If you spend the AA on it, and the max AA to hasten it, you get 5 minutes of better melee every hour and 20 something minutes.<br />
<br />
Let’s look at nukes a sec. Shaman have 2 types of direct damage (dd) spells. One is a rain which pisses of chanters and gets resists you have to use to believe. After malos, I usually get at leave 1 of the 3 waves resisted. While I’m mentioning it, why is it that it hits FOUR targets once, or 1 target 3 times? However, if we cast it on four targets and stand close, it hits four targets ONCE and will still hit me for all 3 waves? Love those game mechanics. Oh, yeah. Rain spells can’t be used next to your without nuking yourself, and it the mob moves or is pushed out of the rain effect, it won’t get hit.<br />
<br />
The other line is direct single target nukes (cold and poison lines). We have one fire nuke (our first nuke at level 1) and never got another one. Our best nuke is 925 damage (cold) but takes 7.8 seconds to cast! Do the math and you’ll see that RANGERS can out nuke us—they can just cast twice and do 1400 damage before our spell gem has even refreshed from the universal 2.2 second delay between cast times. Our poison line does less damage, though is marginally faster. Our dam/mana ratio is pretty awful too. This problem is exacerbated by the GoD spells currently on test. Somehow Shaman are the only class not getting a larger nuke. Clearly we aren’t nukers.<br />
<br />
Okay, so we aren’t nukers or melee. What about healing? One of the biggest fallacies floating around is that shaman don’t need to heal because we have slow. Wrong. PoP mobs, or LDoN hard mobs hit hard. Rumor has it that GoD mobs hit harder. I don’t care if it’s slowed or not, or if you have a time equipped tank or not—mobs get lucky and can get good hits in on everyone. A single max double hit (1 round) in a hard ldon does more damage than our largest heal—and the cast time on that heal is 10 seconds (and isn’t affected by spell haste). That doesn’t, of course, address the fact that people take damage BEFORE it’s slow. Our heals are significantly worse than a druid—for the same mana.<br />
<br />
I could go into a long analysis of fast and slow heals, but the bottom line is . . . shaman are lacking. I don’t know of any 65 shaman that use our 10 second (in)complete heal of 1950. Everyone uses tnargs—base 1300 heal because we can get AAs and focus items to make it . . . close to the BASE druid fast heal. Our heals barely touch a tank with 10,000+ hp. We have no group heals. Even a druid gets an AA ability to heal the group. Paladins are getting a new nearly 1k single target heal (1 second cast time!) in GoD. Not to mention that they OWN for group heals. Strangely, in GoD, clerics, druids, and paladins are getting new heals. Shaman get a new heal over time that does an extra 60 hit points of healing every six seconds. Hate to break it to ya Sony, but even slowed PoP mobs do more than 300 OR 360/tic. I shudder to think just how effective we’ll be in GoD (the image of bailing a leaky boat with a spoon comes to mind). Okay, so we’re not very good healers (a hybrid WARRIOR class out-heals us!).<br />
<br />
How about pets? That seems to be the vision for us in GoD. We’re getting lots of new pet abilities. The shaman community has done LOTS of tests on pets so far. Base dps on dog dog is 12.7 dps. If we carry around backpacks of rusty weapons and give it two weapons (since shaman have NO items to summon a weapon), it can suddenly dual wield. Fully buffed and weaponed, it can do around 38 dps. (all numbers dependant on AC/level of target, of course—these targets are blue con mobs at 65). Just for reference, our level 56 poison DoT does similar dps.  The only class with a pet worse than ours is the single level 55 druid bear pet (which is so patently bad as to not really even qualify). Shaman pets are just bad. Okay, so we’re not even CLOSE to a pet class. Our pet qualifies as a low level DoT at best. (BTW, thanks Sony, for giving us a ton of new pet AAs in GoD—I’m sure it will get our pet up to maybe 45dps for only 150AA pts. /sarcasm off)<br />
<br />
How about DoTs? All of our DoTs are stackable—we can do major dps if we stack 8 DoTs on a mob! Now . . . uh . . . oh wait. I’d have to unmem slow, cannibalize, heal(s), malos . . . erm, nm. Our top 3 DoTs can do decent dps. Blood, Breath, and Bane—maybe up to 1000/tic. Of course, in a group, you’re tanking if you cast all that. Not to mention it has to be a pretty piss-poor group if the mob lasts long enough for you to cast all those. Well, we can solo—but solo exp was nerfed pretty hard. We have to root/rot too, since we can’t melee mobs (even slow) in PoP effectively—see discussion on our heal over time spell (quiescence) above. On a good note, we’re getting a new DoT in GoD. Currently, it’s yet another of our disease DoTs—whoops. Did I forget to mention that our disease dots take 2.1 minutes to run? Unless you’re soloing, when was the last time you were in a group that took 2.1 minutes to kill a single mob (besides a named or raid level mob). Our entire disease line of DoTs is useless in a competent group. It’s a complete waste of mana—you’re better off nuking with that slow-as-heck nuke. But look at the bright side—we get a NEW useless DoT. /cheer. In GoD we at least get crit DoTs, never mind that it costs a heck of a lot more (30AA last report) to get them. Who cares if it cost casters a lot less to get their crits. Screw the DoT classes.<br />

Well, now, let’s come to the big thing—slows! Shaman are the master of slows! Sort of. Beastlords cast it faster. Enchanters cast it almost as well. Shm-75%, ench-70%, bst—65%. Current parses of mitigated slow (ie everything endgame) seem to indicate that the above percentages are reduced proportionately. Let’s look at mobs ‘slightly’ effected by slows. That means it’s about 25% effective. Multiplying it out yields: Shm-18.75%, ench-17.5%, bst—16.25%. Not too impressive is it? Don’t worry! Shm can heal! (We’ll just ignore the fact that shaman healing was last changed before mitigation was put in!) So what if mobs are doing almost their full unslowed damage! Shaman can slow so they don’t need heals! Right? On a good note, we get a new slow in GoD—it does 60% slow instead of 75%, costs more mana, has a TWELVE second refresh (cause we never get more than 1 mob in camp), lasts 42 seconds instead of 6.5 minutes, and will fizzle more because it’s level 65 instead of 51, but it’s NEW! I’m in a rush to memorize it, let me tell ya!<br />
<br />
What about buffs? Our stat buffs are vital for those end game people who need the additional 2 strength to hit their cap (hint—there aren’t many who aren’t well over the caps). What about avatar? +140 attack and stats? Well, the BL (a true hybrid—the total twit who called shaman a hybrid class needs to be shot to improve the gene pool) can give more attack with their buff. HP buffs? Shaman can only do 430hp unless the target has less than max stamina. BLs can do about as well.<br />
<br />
Mana regen? A lot has been made over this, but it’s getting deflated constantly. Enchanters and (in GoD) clerics get a free bar of mana every once in a while (depends on how many AAs they spend). The FT cap is pretty big. Horses. Paragon, SD, VoQ, Bot9, clicky buffs—thinks ain’t as far spread out as they used to be. Shaman mana regen is good, but not god. Since DoTs are apparently meant to be out primary mode of damage (never mind agro issues), I also invite you to go look at the mana costs on those—it’s obscene. They also get resisted a lot.<br />
<br />
Someone tell me again how overpowered I am because I can solo Lodizal or Yeldema. I hate to break it to you, but so can other classes. Hell, a warrior on our sever solo’d Yeldema before PoP came out!!!<br />
<br />
Does any of this start to make you wonder why some shaman are annoyed? In GoD we get a DoT no one wants, a slow no one will use, and a ton of pet AAs for a pet that sucks rocks. We’re getting a new cannibalize spell that is LESS efficient than the one we have (it’s more damage per cast but gives a lower percent of mana back—nets to about 1 more mana per tic). We can’t keep up on healing in a group because one resisted slow and our tank gets pounded to heck and we’re reduced to chain healing with no time for another slow on hard mobs. We get no group heals, even like the 40+ minute AA for druids. <br />
<br />
So to all you pundits screaming, “overpowered”, I say you’re morons. Hybrids out heal us, melee out nuke us, and we’ve got more pathetic ‘skills’ and spells on the way while everyone else gets upgraded.<br />
<br />
Oh well. At least I can go solo Yeldema if there aren’t any warriors camping him.<br />

I found this on the page 9 of a horrible post &quot;Topic:   Will shaman again be ignored in this expansion??&quot;  on The Newbie Zone.  I think it should be made a sticky at the top of the page until GOD is released.  For all those of us that think we are just fine... :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">A minor addition:<br />
<br />
Acumen.  One of the benefits of this spell was stamina regeneration and this was removed.<br />
<br />
Please add some sort of endurance regeneration for this, otherwise Acumen is a HIGH level see invis/UV :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">actually there a seperate post asking for chutoi   post to be stickied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Kallaill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">This is the first time posting here, I have read a lot of other shaman's ideas and a lot of them are good. I am here to propose a few more ideas on the changes/additions we need to our class. I don't have time to read through every single post so if I am repeating a similar idea then it was either a good one that I am reinforcing or I just havn't seen the post.<br />
<br />
AA's:<br />
<br />
1. Call of the Ancients AA - Good idea but needs to be tuned up. Remove the whole stationary warder idea and make it similar to the beastlord AA Paragon of Spirits. Make this AA Heal HP + Endurance and make it ae'able. By doing this it will not only benefit Melee's but everyone with the hp heal, and by making it ae'able it gives shaman stacking an extra point ( At this point any raid more than 2 shaman makes stacking pretty useless ).<br />
<br />
2. Affliction Subtley AA for DoTs would make a good aa making it 5/10/15% agro reduction per level.<br />
<br />
3. All our pet AA's are USELESS. I don't know any shaman that uses their pets at the high end stage. Keep Necro/Bst/Mage the pet classes, I am fine not being a pet class. Replace these with something useful.<br />
<br />
Heals:<br />
<br />
1. Better Instant Heal - 1950hp / 500mana / 4.2 sec cast time.<br />
<br />
2. Heal over Time spell - 350hp/4ticks / 1200mana / 6.0 sec cast time.<br />
<br />
Nukes:<br />
<br />
1. Possibly a Disease Based Nuke - 1250dmg / 425mana / 5.5sec<br />
<br />
DoTs:<br />
<br />
1. Change Our current DR DoT to something similar to this<br />
- 450dmg/5ticks / 525mana / 5.5 sec cast / 10-15 sec recast<br />
<br />
At the moment any dot that goes beyond 2min is useless, 98% of raids are spent killing trash mobs and trash mobs dont last 2+ minutes last time I checked. Most Boss fights range from 3-5 minutes on average so these long lasting dots really don't benefit in any way even on Bosses.<br />
<br />
Buffs:<br />
<br />
1. And last but not least, adding a new HP buff to our buffline would be nice. Maybe adding something like, 655hp +avoidance/+attack / 675 mana cost. As it has been said before +stat buffs (str/dex/agi) is pretty much capped at the high end and serves us to be useless. The +avoidance, +combat effects, +accuracy type buffs would definatley increase our desireability and put some useful shaman buffs into the game. <br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
All these ideas would increase shaman usefulness and uniqueness. Shaman have been standing quietly for far too long, we have had minor upgrades expansion after expansion and all I can say is it's time to do something about this and now is the time to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">We need a stackable, direct function.  They can't make slows better, they are already too good.  We need more healing ability or more DD ability.  Frankly, I'd be happy if they removed the hard-coded resist on rains and gave us a cold rain line to complement the poison one, and then gave us linear increases elsewhere.<br />
<br />
We do not need more buffs.  During original EQ and Kunark, when we are probably overpowered, we sucked at melee buffs compared to clerics and enchanters.  During Velious and Luclin, when we were generally decently balanced, we sucked at melee buffs compared to clerics and enchanters.  During PoP, when we arguably became a little underpowered, we had great melee buffs for the first time in the history of the class.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: buffs aren't the problem from a power perspective.<br />
<br />
The only buff problem is a convenience problem.  Keeping FA up on people for hours makes me want to quit Everquest, period.  Make FA last 2 hours, make it a passive, group only effect, add a FA proc augment, erase it from the game and give melees innate FA, I don't care, but do something to that POS spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">To hear a lot of people talk on this forum, you would think that shamans are one of the worst classes in EQ.  You'd think we were gimps who can do nothing except slow, and we are almost eclipsed there by enchanters and beastlords.  This simply is not the case.  Shamans have been and still are a very powerful class who can use that power in just about any situation.<br />
The problem is, with out current spell set we are only powerful if fights run long enough for people to run out of mana. Otherwise we bring outdated buffs, an extra 5% slow and crappy DPS and healing to the raid. In groups we fare a little better until other classes get enough FT and focuses to keep chaincasting for half an hour or so. While this may indeed make us &quot;a very powerful class who can use that power in just about any situation&quot; it does not give me much hope for the future.<br />
<br />
I also think we need an upgraded poison nuke that casts just as fast as spear of torment, but does the damage of velium strike.  The long cast time of velium strike makes it almost unusable in ldon groups, and spear of torment just does crappy damage.<br />
For the sake of class variety I would rather get upgraded DoTs. Otherwise agreed.<br />
<br />
Dots need to be tweaked so that they land easier (in pvp and pve), and they need to generate less aggro.<br />
Amen.<br />
<br />
We need some form of group heal.  I'd be very happy with a group quiescence AA that we could cast every 15 minutes or so, and MGB.<br />
Again, for the sake of class variety give us an upgraded Torpor, side effects and all instead of more watered down heals of other classes. It won't make us tank healers in groups, it certainly won't make us melee healers on raids but it might give us a nice niche in healing casters and healers.<br />
<br />
We need more atk buffs.  I feel that shamans should be the master of melee buffing, and enchanters should be the masters of caster buffs.  However, with both the best haste and the best mana regen buffs in the game, enchanter takes the #1 slot of both.  It would be unfair to enchanters to, at this point in the game, switch haste lines with them, so I think we need some form of atk buff that stacks with avatar (bih'li doesn't count).<br />
Agreed - currently we are outbuffed by rangers, beastlords, enchanters, bards, shadowknights, necromancers and partly druids. (ATK/Haste/mana regeneration that is. If you add in HP buffs it becomes a pretty sad picture)<br />
<br />
What we need most is 1 of 2 things. We need:<br />
A) A form of slowing that is superior to what other classes have in such a way that it makes up for the penalties we got (lesser healing, lesser nukes, slower healing) OR<br />
B) we need a substantial upgrade in the Healing and nuking areas.<br />
<br />
Agreed. A situational 'you can use this after your main slow bounces as we know it will' type spell does not cut it. Quiescence is a sad excuse for a heal. Velium Strike would be a decent nuke if it cast twice as fast, giving us the opportunity to cannibalize back the mana it costs more because we have cannibalize (I love circular logic).<br />
<br />
What also is wanted is:<br />
c) faster DoT. Seeing that DoTs are considered our major source of damage we need one that is usefull even in situations where mobs die fast. Bane would have been about perfect if the recast time would have been the same as on our poison line.<br />
d) An improved invis. this could be a fixed duration one or a SoS type random duration one.<br />
e) an endurance regen spell.<br />
Agreed on the bane recast. I still think with the recast time it needs to be unresistable. Invis is not a balance issue to me. If clerics can live without invis I can live without improved invis. Endurance regen I am not sure on. Does any melee actually run out of endurance at the moment?<br />
<br />
So basically, we have a fast casting slow that lands easier than turgur's.  Unfortunately, we can only use this slow every 30 seconds, and it barely lasts that long.  In addition to that, it is a noticeable inferior slow to turgur's.<br />
<br />
Why would I want this?  Backup.  As we all know, turgur's has a short but annoying recast time.  If you bounce a turgur's, you have to stand there for 6 second while you wait for it to refresh.  During these 6 seconds, chances are pretty good that you are getting smacked by whatever resisted your slow.  Once turgur's finally does refresh, you've got to channel it through these hits.  If your slow bounced once, then the mob probably wasn't malos'd, and malos is fairly difficult to channel through an unslowed mob.  Thus, your chances of landing turgur's on the second try is the same as the first.  So, you've got a reasonable chance of getting resisted again and having to wait another 6 seconds to try again.<br />
<br />
When I get a resisted slow and aggro, I usually hit VP (assuming I got aggro).  This, of course, knocks to mob off of me and roots it, leaving it to be debuffed at my convenience.  I can then go back to slowing other mobs which are currently loose and attacking my group.  Of course, VP has a 2 minute recast time, so I can only realistically use it once per pull.  If I get aggro again while VP is down, or VP gets resisted, I just have to deal with it and try to channel a slow.<br />
<br />
This is where the new GoD slow comes in.  I definately would not be using it as a replacement to turgur's, but rather as a supplement to it.  I'd use Ancient Balance as my backup slow when turgur's bounced.  Turgur's gets resisted, and instead of waiting 6 seconds to try to channel it, I have another slow that is ready to be cast, is much easier to channel, and has a significantly better chance of landing.<br />
So you are saying you would use the new GoD slow on pulls where you did not Malos anyways, slow was resisted, VP was resisted and there is noone to stun it for a couple of seconds and it was not a MOB that got mezzed and it also was not the ones currently being killed as that one would be close to dead by now. Yep, that about sums up my feelings for that spell, except that I think it is crap.</div></div><hr />
