<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zasarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was hoping some of you can give advice on how to deal with charming mobs in LDON adventures.  I fight in a group of 4 that consists of me(shaman), 2 monks and a necro.  We are all currently lvl 39.<br />
<br />
Lately we have been having trouble dealing with anything that charms or fears.  One of the monks will be charmed or feared and end up 4 rooms away, usually resulting in at least one death.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if there was an easy solution to this problem...and I have come up with a few although haven't tried them yet.<br />
<br />
1.  Duel/root method:  By this, I would have everyone set up to /d each other, allowing me to root as needed (i.e. someone is charmed/feared).<br />
2.  Drop sow/run:  Make sure tanks do not have sow, and possibly change their run to walk so as to slow down there wandering.  Was hoping that this would only cause them to venture a room away or so when charmed/feared.<br />
3.  Up magical resists through gear/spells:  Not sure if there is a magical number of magical resist you need, but could raise these through gear.<br />
<br />
Would any of these work, or does somebody else have a better solution?<br />
<br />
Appreciate any input :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Deadlover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dude it sounds to me like your not using you nerco to his full potential. With a Nerco in your party even if he might be a few levels below the rest of the party, you should be able to walk through those dungeons. The Necro, and his pet of couse, have the power to keep the lowly monk(eies) from getting feared. So i would suggest being ALOT nicer to him and he might become more receptive to keeping that from happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zasarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lol, I take it you are a necro.  Anyone else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Deuling isn't an option, you can only have one person fighting another at a time and then others can't affect them with spells. <br />
<br />
Its all about magic resists really thats more critical then anything else. Both charm and fear are magic based so just get them up as high as you can, cure tash if you get tash'd and kill kill kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The higher your MR, the shorter the duration of that fear, it seems.  I would also try to get them into the habit of changing from run to walk when there's any possibility of a charming (or fearing) critter - it really makes all the difference.</div></div><hr />

Nerfed years ago. Your walk/run setting no longer matters while feared.</div></div><hr />
