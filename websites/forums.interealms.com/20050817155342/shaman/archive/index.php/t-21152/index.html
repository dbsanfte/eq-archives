<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well the whole point of the change is so you can use it as a main slow and not use malos on quick fights .. to give you more time to nuke .. or cast a dot .. thing is .. the nukes or dots now won't land because you don't have malos in first .. <br />
<br />
but you can always heal i guess .. sorta</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Doesnt seem that bad to me, Ill just have to keep better track mentally of which spell I use on which mobs since I alternate them a lot, and its still better than it was.</div></div><hr />

This is the suckiest upgrade I have ever seen and I really hope they fix it VERY soon.. Nihil was good as preslow.. Now its back in the book~<br />
<br />
<br />
What's to fix?  Nihil is now a 1.5s-cast 75% slow with a -40 adjust.  I don't see any problem with that.  Before the change Nihil was overwritten by at least 3 other slows, now it's overwritten by one.<br />
<br />
Slowing a raid target with Nihil isn't very smart unless the mob is overly resistant to magic.  There aren't very many of those types of mobs in PoP or Luclin.  GoD bosses seem to all be immune to slow, so it doesn't matter there anyway.  They need to give an upgrade to Cripple now to reduce the HUGE damage bonuses that GoD bosses have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You make me sad.  This upgrade really is amazing.  A slow that is the same as Turgur's, but has a negative resistance check.  We couldn't ask for anything better.  If you are unable to keep track of which slow you have on, or are unable to communicate with your fellow shaman on a raid which one is on, I'd strongly suggest rolling a beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">While it would certainly be preferable in my book for it to not overwrite Turgur's, I'm still quite happy with the upgrade, and it'll see lots of use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So before you had to cast it then follow up with Turgurs.  Now you only need to cast Nil...and you don't like it?.....do you just enjoy being less efficent or something?<br />
<br />
I just tested it. Turgur's overwrites Nihil and Nihil overwrites Turgur's. So they overwrite each other. It makes sense because you're mostly using Nihil on trash mobs that die in 20 seconds or for a temporary slow until Turgur's lands.<br />
<br />
Totally agree, and after all as I see it if you really need you can still use it as a preslow then when mobs are particularly resistant.  For all round use though the change makes this a nice upgrade IMO to Turgurs.  Doubt I'll ever see it but nice to know it's not a pointless PoS as it was mostly before the change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There is a problem with the two spells just overwriting each other - raids. If I just landed Turgur's on something that is mezzed I do not want it to be overwritten by a spell that may wear off before the MOB gets killed.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to fix this, by making Nihil last longer, upping Turgur's to 76% or by adding some of those special stacking effects used on Blessing of the Nine. I can certainly work around it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you cant see why I dont like it I dont care the slightest. The spell is still good as preslow, but it should NOT overwrite Turgurs as there is a 5 minute hold difference on those 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Those of you who are overjoyed about this change...  take a moment to think through the scenarios please.<br />
<br />
You are clearing trash -- 10 mobs are pulled.  You have 3 shaman.  You all slow like crazy, everything is slowed, and everyone is happy.  A minute later a mob that you slowed is now suddenly not slowed, as are three others -- but which?  You didn't get any messages (because when a spell is overwritten by an equally powerful spell, you don't).<br />
<br />
There are other scenarios that suck just as much.<br />
<br />
What about a named mob thats not expected to live TOO long; some of your shaman decide to put turgurs, others decide to use nihil.  The one that lands last wins.<br />
<br />
Some of you might say &quot;fine; use Nihil all the time -- problem solved&quot; -- but that wouldnt really solve anything.  If you have to slow the same more 4 times more often, you're looking at alot more agro.  On short fights, that might work fine, but you dont always know whats going to be a short (ie: &lt; 1.5 minutes) fight.<br />
<br />
This is a ill-considered change.  Lower nihil to 74 percent if necessary.  Or add clever stacking logic, or whatever, but this is something that needs to change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just make Turgur's block Nihil from landing. They do it with other spells all the time like Shield of Maelin blocks Focus.<br />

<br />
<br />
Slow them again?  If mobs are standing around for a while or change places, slow them again before they are woken up. Also, if you're regularly pulling 10 trash mobs then either your monks need to be fired, you're in tier 3 zone or below, or your raid is AEing the pulls.  10 trash mobs pulled to camp in GoD doesn't go down so well with the healers in your raid.<br />
<br />
Edit: They'll probably fix the stacking issues on the next patch.  If you don't like it, don't use Nihil then and nag all your other shamans not to use it also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">10 mobs was abit to much maybe :)<br />

I don't have any idea how you could call Nihil 'amazing', that is quite the stretch.<br />

Nihil is a nice spell, but doesn't fix a thing overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  YOU don't get a message that the slow broke, but whoever cast the Nihil DOES get a message that his slow wore out.   And if those mobs are still alive after a minute that means they are mezzed and you are sitting around healing (not useful most likely if your raid is confident enough to pull multiples), so just reslow everything that is mezzed, problem solved.</div></div><hr />

Ok, 4 minute fight, you landed it once, you can land it again, you can time how long until you have to reslow and if your tank can't handle the agro from you re-casting balance once a minute then you'd be ****ed to recast turgurs anyway.<br />

Nihil is Level 65, Turgur's is 51... both are same % slows... I don't see any problem with it overwriting Turgur's.<br />

What if your not fighting in GoD? There is no point for a shorter lasting slow that slows the same as a longer lasting slow to overwrite the longer lasting slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">It's working exactly the way we would want it to.  Let's take the example of the ubermob with high MR we're keeping slowed - take Aaryonar in NToV - traditionally quite hard to slow, but slowable.  Would be easy to slow with Nihil, but harder to slow with Turgurs.  Let's say it has Turgurs on it that is old and getting ready to wear.  You do not want slow off this mob cuz that's dangerous.  In this case, you want to be able to stick that Nihil and overwrite Turgurs.  <br />
<br />
Personally I think this is a very positive change, but in no way &quot;fixes&quot; shamans for GoD.  The actual slowed % after mitigation goes thru is virtually unchanged.  The mobs still won't live to see Nihil wear off.  And of course, we still heal and do DPS like crap and bring no unique skill to the table.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude, do you PLAY Everquest at all?  Have you done exp grinds in the elementals?  Hell, have you done exp grinds in freaking BoT?  Have you done LDoN adventures?  Even on Normal, Nihil would be the better slow to pick cuz of much less resists on the first cast.  <br />
Fact is, mobs usually last less than 1.5 minutes until they are dead.  So what is a longer slow needed for again?  <br />

Nihil straight up should have been an upgrade to Turgur's.  You yokels are too much.  Everyone else gets UPGRADES, in every respect, to what they do; whether they be a melee, hybrid, or spell caster.  We get situational bull****.<br />

Sony doesn't have a ****ing clue about Shamans, and if you don't know that, you don't have a ****ing clue either.<br />

Balance of the Nihil: 75% slow, 1.5s cast time, 3.0s recast time, 5min duration, 75mr resist adjust (yes, 75), 450mana.<br />
<br />
That is an upgrade to a spell from the 2nd damn expansion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay let's get a Shaman, they can slow like nobody's business.  Remember when they got resisted all the time, and ended up doing the least dps anyways, because they wasted time slowing, which did nothing, and couldn't use dots, because of aggro, and mobs die too fast, and their nukes, well, yeah, they're nukes, but my dog does more damage if you give him a slice of cheese.  That's what they should do, feed their spirit pets some cheese.  It's brilliant.&quot;<br />

Dude did you even bother looking at my magelo before asking if I have done exp grinds in elementals or LDoN adventures before? I know that Balance of Nihil is a better slow to start off with casting on a mob, I am not debating that fact. I am just debating the fact that it should be able to overwrite a spell that does the same thing but lasts 4 times longer. Think about it, what if your killing mobs that live for a long time and you want to turgurs them all so that the slow will last the whole fight. Then some other shaman comes up and balance of the nihil's them and your slow wears off way before you expected it. I dont find that absurd.

If you are stressing about 1k of mana with 10 mobs on the raid/group, I agree, you need to get out of there or  head for the hills and go solo or something.<br />

Then you can feel comfortable justifying your use of that godawful large amount of mana on one mob instead of 3-4. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not stressing over 1k mana.  I'm stressing over the fact that you think it's acceptable to blow 1k mana (and time) on something that shouldn't be so.  If a mob is slowed, it should be slowed, no having to have another spell OF THE SAME LINE up to overwrite your first slow spell with.  ESPECIALLY if they both slow the same %, and the longer duration one costs less mana?<br />
<br />
Now I'll make an observation:<br />
<br />
You suck.  (j/k)  :)<br />
<br />
Slowing is an issue.<br />
Healing in an issue.<br />
DPS is an issue.<br />
DoTs are an issue.<br />
DD's are an issue.<br />
Aggro is an issue.<br />

The current form of BotNihil addresses one of those issues, partially, and detriments all the other issues.  Have to cast it more = more aggro.  Having to cast it more = less dps for dots and nukes.  Having to cast it more = less dots because of more aggro = less dps = less nukes too.  Heals are aggro = less healing if you're slowing (what Shaman doesn't slow?).<br />
<br />
There is a fundamental flaw with our class that is now magnified with GoD.  We generate too much aggro for too little benefit, thanks to resists, duration, mana cost and aggro cost of other spells.  AND our ability to DO DAMAGE is restricted.<br />
<br />
If our main ability is to slow, that main ability needs to be enhanced greatly so our secondary abilities are somehow offset from our main ability.  If we prevent dps, we can't do great dps.  The problem is that we can't reliably prevent dps, and we can't reliably do dps.  So we're screwed on both ends.  And you say just use another 1k mana.  Good idea?  No.  Our mana regen is already stetched enough, our time is already overstretched...it's not fun to be clicking the same keys all night long, constantly, night after night.<br />
<br />
Let me put it this way.  If a Beastlord slow gets resisted, he at least has slightly inferior dd's, inferior dots, superior MELEE dps/procs, superior pet dps/procs, and if it gets bad, A DAMAGE REDUCTION DICSIPLINE.  And if a Beastlord slow doesn't get resisted, welcome to the gravy train.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that 5 other people get an additional 9/mana a tick, or 400mana more per minute total for the group.  Whereas we burn 300mana pretty fast (or 225 if you're like most Shamans and won't see this spell for a while, so um, yeah?), perhaps 600mana because we get resisted, and we only prevent what, 30% more dps?

I have used it on PoP nameds who resist tugur's alot and they slow easily now then another shaman comes back and slows with turgur's. All it takes is communication on raids between your shaman to ensure it doesnt overwrite tugur's. This bone I will certainly enjoy having!!</div></div><hr />

I'd be interested in how it can be used to grief in GoD.<br />

I'm sure people are aware of who is around them on raids, and messing with someone by casting Nihil on an already slowed mob? What's the point? I wouldn't see it as real griefing, just an annoyance if anything. The mob is still slowed with Nihil or Turgur's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it doesn't, because I am pretty sure somebody else overwrote your Nihil a few seconds after it landed with Turgur's. Turgur's would have probably landed just like Nihil had you cast that instead.<br />
<br />
If you ever play in Kod Taz, try to cast Turgur's on inc instead of Nihil, then switch. I can tell you that you will just as many resists, because the -40 from Nihil is so minor you still have to &quot;roll&quot; within 5 or so % of Turgur's on a random /1-1000 regardless of what the min number you have to roll to land Turgur's is(the number is related to a mob's mr obviously).<br />
<br />
So if a mob required you to roll a 500+ on a /random 1000, you'd still need a 475+ to land Nihil and how many times do you roll higher than 475, but not over 500 on a random 1000?<br />
<br />
That's only speaking from my experience, however.</div></div><hr />

Lando, if you want to reslow a &quot;reistant mob&quot; like Ary, just start casting that turgurs 1+minute before it wears off, you'll get it in. At least you have plenty of time to try.

About the only mobs there I noticed that didn't require my usual routine (malos+slow) were the crocs and some trees. And getting a pounding due to Nihil being resited is quite entertaining while your waiting for a ranger to get agro back. Then channeling malos and clicky slow.

...except that you don't know WHICH are the ones that need to be reslowed -- unless you happen to be watching it beat someone into the ground.  Now, you COULD just reslow every mob before mez is broken (or every 60 seconds, if split tanks are being employed) but thats not really a smart solution.  Lets work twice as hard to do what we could do before.  Woot!  I may be crazy, but I prefer that a mob that has a 6.5 minute slow stay slowed for 6.5 minutes.  <br />
<br />
Is this the end of the world?  No.  Is it a smart design decision?  NO.<br />
<br />
I agree that Nihil is the superior slow in almost every way -- except one.  To say that I'm lazy. or a newbie, or just plain stupid for not just reslowing every mob every 60 seconds is ludicrous.  Thats a large waste of mana for no apparent gain.  Then again, thats what I'm giong to HAVE TO DO regardless now, because I can no longer be sure that any slow will last more than 1.5 minutes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">I keep both slows up and alternate them, and do my best to remember what I hit with which spell so I know if I need to reslow something (gasp! imagine that! there is some minute amount of thinking added to my job now).  I see less situations where the issues everyone is bringing up are going to happen and a lot more where Nihil &gt; Turgurs.<br />
<br />
As was pointed out, in most groups on hard to land slow spells, you can Malos on inc, then Nihil, faster and with less chance of resist.  IF it still resists Nihil, then you have Turgurs you can cast with NO recast time between alternating the two spells.  The 0 recast time between the two spells is enough to sell me, I can slow an entire camp almost twice as fast as I used to.  I can see this alone saving more lives, how many times have you sat there, waiting for the refresh while the enchanter or cleric gets the beatdown?<br />
<br />
How much easier is a 1.5 second spell to cast while getting beat on by one or two mobs than a 2.25 or whatever Turgurs is modified?  Seems pretty big to me.  I pull in Ldon, so I often find myself getting beaten to a pulp by two+ mobs, cast Nihil, slow first one, cast turgurs, interrupted, cast Nihil, slow second one.<br />
<br />
I would still like to see a higher resist put to it but I think its pretty balanced as is (I too would be willing to give up some % of slow for a higher resist rate).  There are still a lot more benefits to this spell than negatives.<br />
<br />
Personally, I look at it a lot like a chanters duty, do their mobs have a timer floating above their head so they know when it needs to be remezzed?  Doesnt this get sticky if they are all casting the same mez on multiple mobs and no one knows who is mezzing what?  How the heck do they keep track!  Or are they all wasting a lot of mana??<br />
<br />
As was also already pointed out, in a raid, work with the other shaman so everyone knows what everyone else is doing, pay attention to the channels and it shouldnt be that big an issue.  With a big raid, I hate to think 6 or 7 mobs cant be handled in a couple of minutes, which means you might have to reslow the last couple.  And you do get a message that your Nihil has worn off, thus telling you it was overwritten by another Nihil or Turgurs.  How many times do you really use the full 6 minutes of Turgurs anyway?<br />
<br />
You guys actually think your job has suddenly become exponentially harder or the griefers are going to get you?  :rolleyes:  No matter what they do, they cant please all the people all the time.  Which of the two spells would you choose if you could only have one?  I would choose Nihil without much thought which I think proves its a clear upgrade over Turgurs Insects.</div></div><hr />

While your assumption about just raising the stat caps awards the proper lack of credit to the SoE devs, I feel it doesn't properly address their need to annoy the shaman class.  I consider the huge debuff much more annoying, so I'm guessing it's going to become a lot more prevelant.<br />

<br />
You should also consider that trash mobs in pretty much every zone except GoD zones put out insignificant damage in their short lives when the power of a raid is focused on them.  In short, you really don't even need to reslow the mobs after they're mezzed or controlled.  Once they are woken up they last 10 seconds.  You're better off nuking them or healing the tank than trying to land another slow.  You slow them on pull so they don't kill your enchanters and healers. <br />

These &quot;nerve wracking&quot; scenarios being presented are all quite insignificant and you're arguing over nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">And HOW exactly does a person tell if the mob is slowed with turgurs or Nihil? Oh wait you CAN'T!<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
...how about this scenario.....boss mob in camp.....<br />
Shaman 1: %T Nihil'd<br />
.1 sec later<br />
Shaman 2: %t Turgured<br />
Shaman 1: Did you overwrite my Nihil?<br />
Shaman 2: Shrug, we both landed spells at same time.<br />
<br />
  You do realize that you get a &quot;Your Blance of Nihil Spell has worn off&quot; message right?   I am going to assume for the rest of this post that you do not, otherwise everything I say is a moot point.<br />
<br />
  Turgur is a completely different spell line than Balance.  They even have a different emote on the mob when they land (Yawns, and body slows down).  When a shaman casts Turgur on a mob that you ALREADY cast turgur on, you get no message because it is a REFRESH, not an overwrite.  In the case of Nihil and Turgur, it is an OVERWRITE, and the original caster will get a message announcing that their spell has worn off.<br />
<br />
  That means in a situation like your small convo at the end of your post, the shaman who had cast Nihil DOES know if his spell was overwrote, and so there is even LESS overwriting of slows on a double pull (you both cast slow, you both call it, neither of you got a &quot;wear off&quot; message... congrats both mobs are slowed).<br />
<br />
  And for the refreshing on targets mezzed more than 1 minute, you can refresh with Turgur, and as soon as you have seen enough overwrite messages to match up 1:1 to the times you cast Nihil.. gratz they are all on Turgur timer now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">...except that you don't know WHICH are the ones that need to be reslowed -- unless you happen to be watching it beat someone into the ground.  Now, you COULD just reslow every mob before mez is broken (or every 60 seconds, if split tanks are being employed) but thats not really a smart solution.  Lets work twice as hard to do what we could do before.  Woot!  I may be crazy, but I prefer that a mob that has a 6.5 minute slow stay slowed for 6.5 minutes.  <br />
<br />
Is this the end of the world?  No.  Is it a smart design decision?  NO.<br />
<br />
I agree that Nihil is the superior slow in almost every way -- except one.  To say that I'm lazy. or a newbie, or just plain stupid for not just reslowing every mob every 60 seconds is ludicrous.  Thats a large waste of mana for no apparent gain.  Then again, thats what I'm giong to HAVE TO DO regardless now, because I can no longer be sure that any slow will last more than 1.5 minutes.<br />

<br />
Caanus makes a very good point that people seem to be missing. You will get wear off msgs when one overwrites the other. I personally can't confirm it since I still don't have balance but just for giggles I tested tagar's and tigirs.<br />
<br />
Tagars - http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=506&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Tigir's - http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1589&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
You'll note that they are both 50% slows. I went out and slowed some low level mobs and sure enough they would overwrite each other just like balance and turgurs do. They would also give a wear off msg each time that one overwrote the other. So no people can't sneak in and balance your mob to overwrite turgurs with out you knowing it. You'll also know who landed the slow last because the other will get a wear off msg.<br />
<br />
Those of you who want to get something changed do the rest of us a favor and get balance's duration extended instead of changing an arguably useful feature of the way the spells interact.</div></div><hr />

They slowed on first try with balance and then the slow shaman came back and slowed with Tugur's where in turn I recieved a message saying my slow had worn off.

Having said that, I really dislike seeing the message &quot;Your Turgur's Insects spell has worn off&quot;. It bugs me. It used to only happen when the spell wore off, (or occasionally if mobs reset) and was a sign that I'd forgotten to reslow. Even on short fights, where I know why it wore off, and Nihil will last all fight, this message still bugs me.<br />
<br />
At any rate, Nihil is a good and useable slow, but I'm still using Turgur's also. I found that if I malos on inc, then Turgur's, slow usually sticks, and I am less likely to get agro and more likely to land a slow than if I simply Nihil on inc. I have a TA though, so my Turgur's is manaless and refreshless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saying &quot;thanks SOE for taking a step in the right direction...  and while your at it could you possibly look into fixing this one stacking issue with the spell&quot; honestly wouldn't kill us.  In fact, as many folks have pointed out, fixing that issue isn't necissarily a 100% needed improvement.  If you get a lucky roll of the rng on a very magic resistant boss and land turgurs, you might not be able to get the dang boss slowed again if balance couldn't overwrite it.<br />
<br />
As it stands it takes comminication and a wee bit of foresight to handle the current stacking issues... something we are all capable of adjusting.  If we go with the argued change, you would need a lucky roll of the rng to get a Boss mob slowed again...  a problem that we have no control over fixing.<br />

I honestly worry about some people.  Please, for the sake of cooler heads emerging, have some pudding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The change to Nihil is a preliminary response to the concerns that shaman have voiced over high end gates related content.  This changes should give shaman a clear edge in their ability to quickly slow an NPC.  In the immediately future, there are some tuning changes planned for gates that I expect to have a measurable effect on shaman's abilities to fulfill their roles of slower, and secondary healer.  After these changes are applied, tested, and reviewed we will reevaluate shaman concerns, as well as class balance as a whole. <br />

I couldn't care less about Nihil overwriting Turgur's, honestly. <br />
But for god's sake reduce Nihil's effectiveness if you have to and slap a -75 resist mod on it to ensure that resists are really low without &quot;trivializing&quot; older content where mobs were actually hard to slow, if that's your concern as a developer.<br />

<br />
Solution: 1) Up the resist mod 2) Possibly lower the cast time to 1 second 3) Possibly attach a -hate component to the spell<br />

Trust me, in EQ, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, period. If you don't whine, even about &quot;upgrades&quot;, they think your just fine. We are not just fine, and I, for one, am more than moderately annoyed that they are just wasting time throwing us bones. The BoN problem was HARDLY anywhere near the top of the &quot;LIST&quot; of our issues. Yet, its the one they worked on FIRST. Why? Cause it was as easy as:<br />
<br />
/change slow=50 to slow=75<br />
/change mana=250 to mana=300<br />
<br />
I know nothing about code, thats my guess at how easy it was to make this adjustmet, though. <br />
<br />
Am I happy they modified the spell? Of course, its a clear upgrade, and quite adequate the way it is. Am I happy they replaced the new DOT with a bigger heal? Absolutely, but we REALLY needed something more substantial there to make a clear difference in the Gates Healing Hierarchy. <br />
<br />
Its true enough to say &quot;an upgrade is an upgrade, dont look a gift horse in the mouth, don't complain about getting fixed&quot;. But take a moment to step back and look at the WHOLE picture please. Neither this spell or the new shaman heal addresses the most GLARING problems with our class, and thats a pretty darn indesputible fact.</div></div><hr />

I understand what you're saying, but I would argue that this spell has gone some way to achieve the stated objective of giving shamans an edge in quick slowing.<br />
<br />
Before, Nihil was a quick slow, moreover it was the only slow with a resist mod, and shamans bitched about not using it because it was too low a slow and got overwritten by beastlords.<br />
<br />
Now, it's quick, and it still has a resist modifier, and is the same % slow as turgur's. Whether or not you think -40 is enough, it's still 40 more than any other slow. This gives shamans the edge in slowing quickly over any other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Treasure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">This makes 90% of encounters with tough-to-slow mobs trivial now. First off you no longer *need* an enchanter for tash to land a slow, 2nd off your almost guaranteed to slow any exp mob, even high MR mobs that require Malos in zones like BoT, PoF, PoE, exp zones on the first try. Farmable old world mobs like AoW / Zlandicar are made incredibly trivial now, even more so than before. There is also the possibility that on mobs that arent flagged with the &quot;This mob cannot be slowed&quot; flag, that with Tash / Sinia / Malos you could possibly land a slow, which should be attempted. (This last part brought up because the majority of old world mobs before said flags were implemented relied upon a resist max base to render a mob unslowable. <br />

Sorry, but if any Shaman didn't use this spell before the upgrade to 75% the Shaman either didn't have it or just isn't very bright.<br />
<br />
Saying this gives the Shaman an edge over any other slowing class is only true if you assume that -40 will allow you to land it always on the first try. <br />
What I am saying is that with -40 this either means Turgur's would have most likely landed as well, in which case a Shaman will slow a mob 0.2 seconds before a Beastlord(Beastlord Slow casts in 1.7) or you need to cast Malos regardless, in which case a Shaman with a TA is better off using Turgur's and an Enchanter with a Serpent still slows the mob faster than me(tash + serpent is 4 seconds).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still respectfully disagree. -40 is enough to make a difference. Maybe not as large a difference as we'd like, but any more and it'd be gimping boss mobs. It won't allow it to land all the time, but it's going to be better than Turgur's however you look at it.<br />
<br />
Balance of the Nihil is faster than Turgur's Insects, faster than Sha's Revenge, faster than Forlorn Deeds, and a bigger slow than these too (well, same as Turgur's).<br />
<br />
I did trial 5 again today, about the 7th time. I used Nihil throughout, only Turgur'd when spell gems weren't up, and rarely used Malos. I don't know if the trial mobs have been lowered slightly in MR, because I found that I didn't get nearly as many resists as I remembered from the same place the first time I got Nihil. I was slowing on inc, before the mob reached the group.<br />
<br />
At any rate, the more I use Nihil, the more I like it. The fact that it's 75% slow now means it's much less &quot;situational&quot; than it was.</div></div><hr />

For me it was never situational. Nihil has been my main slow for as long as I have it. I can't count the times I have been resisted using Nihil just to click my TA and landing it, though. <br />

I can only agree here. I have soloed Zlandicar a ton of times even before Nihil and Nihil isn't landing realiably or anything if anyone believes that. <br />
On top of that, the fight takes quite some time and you won't be able to rely on Nihil, trust me. You will slow him with Turgur's.<br />
<br />
Edit: People need to realize that we are in GoD and Nihil is a GoD spell. *If* Nihil trivialized any Velious or Luclin encounters(which it does not for god's sake), it wouldn't matter, because there are tons of other spells from other classes that trivialized those encounters already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those situations where the duration of Turgur's is needed then NOTHING WILL REPLACE IT ONCE IT LANDS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">What boss mobs are slowable?<br />
<br />
I'm not talking just gates here, just anything which involves slowing any kind of boss. Gimping PoP and previous encounters is why it'll never be better than -40, whether or not that's enough for gates.<br />
<br />
The reason I have been using Balance since the first week of GoD is because it is faster than Turgur's. I didn't care about it being 15% less effective, because I'd click my TA and overwrite it before any other of my spell gems popped up.<br />
<br />
So now, you don't need to overwrite with the TA, and can use the time to cast other stuff. Improvement.<br />
<br />
The problem is that when you don't need an MR buff, Sha's will be 0.2 seconds slower and when Nihil isn't enough and you need an MR buff Turgur's will be faster and Enchanter will beat me.<br />

And all the time, Nihil will land more often than Turgur's. When a mob has low resist, Nihil will be faster, when it's borderline, this can make a huge difference, for more resisty mobs, both will need malos, but then a beastlord will struggle to land slow at all, and an enchanter will still need tash. Don't forget, tash is higher agro than malos too.<br />
<br />
Using Turgur's you will see close to no difference resist wise.<br />
<br />
I noticed a difference. Maybe it wasn't a huge one, but it was there. <br />
-40 isn't to be sniffed at. Even if it didn't have the neg resist, the speed alone would make it worth using, but the -40 on top really can help.<br />
<br />
<br />
For me it was never situational. Nihil has been my main slow for as long as I have it. I can't count the times I have been resisted using Nihil just to click my TA and landing it, though. <br />
Everytime this happens, I know the -40 isn't enough.<br />
<br />
But, even if it didn't have the -40 resist modifier, it would *still* be better than Turgur's because it's faster cast. The -40 can't help but improve it. Maybe not enough to make a huge difference, but surely it's enough to make *some* difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">I'm not talking just gates here, just anything which involves slowing any kind of boss. Gimping PoP and previous encounters is why it'll never be better than -40, whether or not that's enough for gates.<br />
<br />
Even if it was -100 there'd be no Boss mob in PoP that would become slowable that currently isn't. It would not gimp any PoP boss any more than it already is.<br />
<br />
So now, you don't need to overwrite with the TA, and can use the time to cast other stuff. Improvement.<br />
<br />
I used to cast TA right after Nihil, while the spell gems refreshed and I could not do anything anyway.<br />

Never have I said that Nihil isn't superior to Turgur's, if you compare them to each other. However, this change has done nothing in regards to how fast I can slow a mob. <br />
They didn't lower its cast time, they didn't make it more reliable, all they did is make it slow as much as Turgur's, which even according to Rytan doesn't adress the issue.<br />
<br />
See, even on those resisty mobs the Shaman with Nihil will not reliably slow the mob first over any other slower. The -40 resist mod is so low that the RNG will dictate who lands it first.<br />
<br />
If we account for aggro, we need to account for tankability and so many other aspects of handling aggro. Shamans will not come out on top if we include these things, so let's ignore that to not diverge.<br />

<br />
Yes, the speed alone is the winning aspect. I am agreeing with you on all this, but that doesn't change the fact that this change didn't do *anything* for me.<br />
<br />
The -40 is better than *nothing*, but it's nowhere near enough and if Nihil had a cast time of 5 seconds, no one would ever cast it in GoD. That alone should give the Devs a clue.</div></div><hr />

-40 resist is like having a built in Mala, and as you can see its 72% as good as malos. Neg 40 is nothing to be scoffed at.</div></div><hr />
