<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cledian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off I would like to say that Vox is DEAD&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
This is my 3rd time to stand toe to claw with the great beast, and the 2nd time she died at our feet. I would like to thank the Uber Generation..Vhela, Wulf, Zelf and all the rest for the buffage and support, for without there help we would have never made it.<br />
<br />
I would like at sometime to adventure to one of the planes, for I have yet to see any of them..Just food for thought&lt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zelfani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thru the use of Roxburry.. thank you Cshae.. i too was able to experience not only the killing of Lady Vox but the actual kill!!  Woot!! got to love finger wigglers!! <br />
<br />

<br />
Roxburry.. the kinder and gentler dorf<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Planes ARE on the agenda Clee... just wanted to get this Vox/Naggy revenge out of the way first :) The officers told me &quot;know that there are too many Keepers who are not experienced in the Planes&quot; and they through me in a closet with Hammer and said &quot;fix this&quot;... can you imagine the trama of being in a closet with Hammer???<br />
<br />
This weekend looks to be bad, but fear not: I intend to go to Hate and Fear... often...</div></div><hr />

I anticipate the raids to planes as well....  <br />
<br />
My pointy things are at your disposal KoE.<br />
<br />

NAGAFEN NEXT FOR RAGE FOR KNARLZ<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congratz you all! Woot!!! I wish I was there :( <br />
<br />
So when is Naggy planned? I want to be there if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whew!<br />
<br />
<br />
This was my first shot assembling groups on this scale, and I want to say something about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rizz, you are absolutely insane for volunteering to do this all the time.   :) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, a few Advil and a very late dinner later, the beast was dead.  All those who attended did an exceptional job of following the instructions given.  My only complaint was the individual tells going to the buffing crew asking for additional buffs.  Other than that, everyone did a superb job of working together.<br />
<br />
<br />
Naggy next?  Let's see, patch is next Tuesday.  8 PM EST sound good to everyone?  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tempeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The bag I was awarded is 100% weight reduction, 10 giant slots, and 0.4 weight. In other words the same as the tink bag I paid 5K for but at &lt;1/2 the weight. wooooot! I hope I didn't bore too many people afterwards showing it off.<br />
Was a lot of fun to boot, I just wish I could be more graceful splitting the lair, very messy again on my second attempt at it.<br />
<br />
Tempeus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>XunilTlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This was my third attempt on this particular Vox.  We had two failures last week, and seeing her go down with such ease this time was very sweet. <br />
<br />
Congratulations to all those that got Dragon loot.  The officers did a great job dividing it among the force, and it was all well deserved.<br />
<br />
Gratz again to the petitioner Fazzar, for getting the killing nuke!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Coatlicue Tlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Everyone did an absolutely exceptional job!  this was my 3rd attempt in a week, and as Xunil said, seeing her go down with such ease this time was GREAT!<br />
<br />
Fal, Grizz, and Mexl --- GREAT job with the leadership.  Without the 3 of you, things would not have gone on so smoothly.  It's because of exceptional leadership that we did things so smoothly.  <br />
<br />
Temp you did a GREAT job.  Without you, we would have been faced with MORE difficulty in breaking the lair.  IMHO you did just GREAT on all the times you helped!<br />
<br />
Thanks to Wulf and the &quot;Big Kids&quot; for all your help with buffing, and saving our butts right before and after the Vox Slaying...  Boy did it help having you guys along to save our dead from the pits!!<br />
<br />
To comment on Fal's statement about individual tells to the buff crew....<br />
<br />
Being as I was the only shaman on the last 2 attempts before last night, it is VERY difficult to buff the WHOLE melee crowd without being bombarded with personal tells for buffs... I must have went LD about 10 times that night.  Please folks, remember that we try to do our best to buff everyone.. and give it time :)  Everyone cannot have every single shaman buff, especially if there is only 1 shaman doing the work of 4 :) lol.. and, if it's Buff Time, please be patient.  Do NOT send personal requests for buffs WHILE the buff crew is buffing... we'll eventually get to you...  That is why we have people form lines, that way we can easily get everyone done in a fast pace.<br />
<br />
ok, enough rambling.  Thanks for the GREAT time guys, can't wait for Naggy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well done and gratz to KoE and friends.<br />
<br />
1- buffage from a 56 cleric view:<br />
<br />
on prior attemps latly we had either 2 56/57 clerics buffing or a 58+ (group nalt symb) . this time as cleric buffer I wasn't quite able to keep up buffing 40 ppl with hero and symbs, I think i got to about 90% heroed and 70% symbols befor the first wave of buffing started to drop and the call to go was made.<br />
<br />
Even that is only possable by mana-stoning and necro pumps, so I'm sorry I didnt get everyone but was the best I could do and no one got an AC buff ( big mana hog) . I may have missed instructions to myself in my own mana spam so if the plan was to add me to groups I may have missed that but only got 2 requests to be added.<br />
<br />
Tip #1 if you could see my mana stone spam you need to /serverfilter on and perhaps its also see hits on others. ( I can't really turn the spam off from myself but you should be able to)<br />
<br />
2- dragon status: <br />
<br />
standing in the hall wondering isn't quite as bad as being at your bind point wondering but please make sure those who cant see /gu know whats going on.<br />
<br />
<br />
3- loots:<br />
<br />
If a KoE raid, officers present decide by need / service after the fight. Only once has an item been pre assigned ( a white scale last piece for a bard epic) and was anounced in advance.<br />
<br />
If a joint raid like the Corps/KoE on not long ago the guild leaders do something like cyber each other.<br />
<br />
I was some what supprised to be asked if I would wear the eyepatch that dropped. My answer was **** yes!  (15 int/wis face item effect see invis)<br />
<br />
Tip #2 never create a human cleric. <br />
Tip #3 create your cleric with max base wis. ( the creation guides were so wrong 2.5 years ago)<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again gratz to you all on the kill, gratz to those who got and item, and /bow to you all</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, ok this gives a whole new meaning to cooperation between guilds. I am not sure that is the best way to decide loot but it certainly is a good way to get to know them well. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You substandard cleric...<br />

HUMIE WASTE!<br />
<br />
<br />
I SAY RETIRE THE OLD FART! and START OVER!!!<br />
<br />
AS AN INKIE CLERIC!!!<br />
<br />
hehehe<br />
<br />
Knarlzey my friend...  Your awesome and yet.. the guides were so wrong when the game came out.  Thus the creation of Helek... to replace Utee...  I guess If Id have stuck with the Old Man i would be in the upper 50s by now... but who knows.. i was miserable when i played him.<br />
<br />
For those of you who dont know.. Knarlz is one of the most gracious and giveing individuals i have ever known ... we go back almost 4 years in the online worlds.<br />
<br />
YOU DESERVE THE EYEPATCH ...<br />
<br />
Dont open the basement door....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This was my first ever attempt at Vox, I had never fought her with Waran before and was very lucky to be able to use Boladorn on the raid.  All of G1 survived too!<br />
<br />
Grats to everyone, thank you for making one of my long held dreams come true :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Last night was great!!  Nothing gets the adrenaline running quite like a dragon raid :)<br />
One note--the last time i did Vox, i had almost no resist gear and got feared every time and nuked down bad.  This time I had good resist gear on (149mr, 179cr after buffage) and resisted every fear and really didnt get nuked too badly.  So, I was able to stay in the fight and help nuke her to death!!!  This really beat the message home to me that resist gear really is essential.<br />
BRING ON NAGGY!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mydain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am amazed that I lived through that :)<br />
<br />
My resistances were not very high... I think my cold was at 103 or so :)<br />
<br />
She died... I got EXP!  and all in my group survived... it was awesome.<br />
<br />
One of the things I have always wanted to do is now done.<br />
<br />
I have helped to slay a dragon with my guildmates!<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kniftar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hail, and Vendui, Keepers of the Elements.<br />
<br />
I am Kniftar Encumbered of the house Delharen D'oloth. I am a slave to Delharen, a warrior of my 52nd season.<br />
<br />
I main-tanked this Lady Vox for KoE and we killed her. Afterwards there was talk of killing Lord Nagafen this Tuesday. Soon I shall pass into my 53rd season, but before I allow that to happen I would like to main-tank and kill this red beast. I ask now the privilege to do this Tuesday if it is still on. I would be honored to slay him one last time.<br />
<br />
Please, if you plan on doing this and could use me, someone send me a tell. I shall seek out and ask a member of your house about this that day as well.</div></div><hr />
