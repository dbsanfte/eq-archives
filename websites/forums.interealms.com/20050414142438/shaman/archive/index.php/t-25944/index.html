<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Game related... not so much I suppose.  Chalk this one up to boredom at work and too many whines about whining.<br />
<br />
<br />
  My personal view is this:   If you aren't complaining, you aren't thinking.<br />
<br />
 It takes absolutely no effort to agree with something.  To say that it works for what it works for and to take it at face value is trivial.  That is why being a &quot;yes-man&quot; or a suck-up is quite common and rather looked down upon.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Why do you see so much complaining and bellyaching here?  Simple, because shaman have become as powerful as we are/were by thinking.  We like to look at things from all angles and every perspective.<br />
<br />
  Tell me, what is the use of lauding the success of an action already taken or an item already existing?  Not much.  If that is all we ever did, then we would be very content cave dwellers or some such extreme example.<br />
<br />
  When people are complaining about the faults of something, that means they are attempting to advance and improve.  You cannot improve upon anything unless you first find the faults in that which exists.  When you realize the flaws of an object, you find it's limitations.  The more well defined those limits are, the closer to them you can push safely and consistently.<br />
<br />
  Whining is nothing new.   Back with Torpor we pointed out that the slow and snare was a nuisance.  When clerics also started to get HoT's we began talking about needing one that didn't have the downsides as well.   Did we at the same time refuse the use of Torpor?  No, we just looked at it and realized it was meant for someone tanking a mob, but not really doing melee damage... ie, us.  So while we were bickering about needing a HoT that we could use on tanks, we went out and solo'd some WW dragons.<br />
<br />
  Tell me, what are the chances that we would have used a normal HoT for the same effect?   Personally, I believe they would have been relatively marginal.  It would have taken quite a while longer to finally see someone solo the dragons since the mentality would have been that the spell was for use on tanks and people would have been doing duo jobs instead.<br />
<br />
  It is through complaint and analysis that we can see what to improve and what to use.  We don't completely shun that which we are given, we embrace it and push to the limits, then we talk about what can come next.<br />
<br />
<br />
  So, to all those who are tired of hearing people complain, look past it to what we aren't saying.  Nobody wants to take the time to post the obvious (wow, this spell like... restores health or something... huh).  Such posts are pointless and spark no discussion.  Lively debate and interaction come through seeing the faults and possibilities of what is there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always thought of the snare and slow parts as a benefit of the spell. I liked being able to bully my tanks. &quot;Be nice or you will stay torpored for an hour.&quot; or &quot;if you ever pull 5 at once again you will stay snared for the rest of your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Err, back on topic ...<br />
I don't think legitimate complaints are &quot;whining&quot;. We have quite a bit of what a lot of people like to call &quot;whining&quot; on these boards. And most of that was about big glaring issues that needed to be fixed. That is not whining, it is helping SOE to fix the game.<br />
<br />
And I don't think that complaints (or whining) are necessary for discussion either. They do make discussions more heated though. Also a lot of people are content to play the game and not post as long as there is nothing ruining their fun. So you get a new expansion, get a new class issue and all of a sudden you have a heated discussion between the board regulars and at the same time you get a ton of lurkers speaking up.<br />
<br />
That does not mean there was no discussion before the new issue though and neither does it mean that complaints are necessary for discussion. They do make for nice 20 page threads though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I also used Torpor for slowing the attack of people who were getting too much aggro.<br />
<br />
Rogue being a mana sponge? Torpor inc...<br />
<br />
I'd agree with what Murtak said about the complaint issues also.<br />
<br />
Some are obvious whining, while others are real concerns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">rofl.<br />
Extended range + torpor for punishing pullers!<br />
<br />
Is there any shaman who has never used the stoicism/torpor to, in effect, *coughs* tease someone?<br />
<br />
As a side note, useing torpor for a controlled charm break when duoing with an enchanter is teh win!<br />
<br />
On a serperate note, very interesting theory/philosophy, Caanus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've always suspected that shaman were fun purely by accident.  We were supposed to be great buffers (stats don't matter, shhhhhh), lousy healers, and not much else.  A happy collision of mana regen + slow + cheap healing allowed us to do interesting things despite chronic neglect from the developers.  On paper, we were probably the dullest class in the game. <br />
<br />
I can't tell you how many expansions came and went leaving the distinct impression that the 'new stuff' for shaman was worked on for about 22 minutes by a bored guy in between surfing for pr0n.<br />
<br />
Cut.<br />
Paste.<br />
New Spell = Old Spell * 1.15.<br />
Bork something in process.<br />
<br />
That happy collision of mana regen + slow + cheap healing has erroded to a pair of broken stone feet in the sand.  Ozyshamanis the Great.  All tremble whilst I solo a 52 dragon with no AE.  <br />
<br />
So now we're begging to be great buffers with crappy healing.  I missed life as the Accidental Soloer.  But then again, I quit so it's probably bad form to vent frustrations over a class left to rot in game centered around killing warriors with 15,000 hitpoints and a chorus line of clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree.(don't know what I am agreeing to, but its the least effort)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Me, too. You go, boy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also Torpor was the very best spell when you had to leg it to zone. Torpor a random group member, preferably someone who does not know that you can click it off. Then run. Remember, you do not have to outrun the MOBs, you only have to outrun your group members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Remember, you do not have to outrun the MOBs, you only have to outrun your group members.<br />
<br />
One group member!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One group member!<br />
At least if that member stays alive long enough - hey, even Torpor's healing is useful! And as long as he does not damage any MOB enough to make it summon - go, go, slow component! And if the summoning range does happen you can still hope on the low aggro of Torpor.<br />
<br />
Face it, Torpor was designed to ensure your safe escape. That is the only situation where all of it's components are useful. It's only flaw is that you can click it off and I bet that is only because none of the designers play a shaman.</div></div><hr />
