<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've certainly never been anywhere near as disappointed with an expansion as POP.  It has changed what I want out of the game and expect out of it, and probably done more than anything I imagined could to make my EQ experience seem to have clear limits; and even to make me not regret reaching those limits anymore as I've seen the product degrade.<br />
<br />
A big part of that is not the fault of PoP directly, but the effect of the game design on human nature; yet I think that effect was probably pretty predictable even without the godlike benefit of hindsight.<br />
<br />
The first thing PoP did is confuse my guild and start tearing it up.  A number of solid players found themselves facing the same situation I did, and, like I did, left the guild at least partially because of it.<br />
<br />
We were a guild that was the second from the top guild on my server; the top guild is nothing compared to an Afterlife or FOH, but at least they were in Vex Thal for months and months before PoP came out, and they were well above us.  (Yes, we are an unusually gimp server.)  Yet their top shamans looked nothing like the top shamans of the real top guilds.  Of course, our shamans looked far lesser still, including yours truly.<br />
<br />
We never seemed to push to get ready for the Emperor by farming bane weapons intensively, or by camping shards much.  We did a lot of Ssra, but it seemed we were mostly at a dead end if we just did it for odd bits of boss loot that might eventually float into the guild year by year.  We did a good amount of NTOV.  Once in a while we did the Burrower in The Deep or a rare Thought Horror Overfiend.  But I held out hope that things were building to a point at which people would get serious about what the top goal of the game at the time was, Vex Thal.<br />
<br />
PoP made clear how splintered and undirected we were.  Some people got flagged, some didn't.  Some people did the trials over and over and over again(after winning) and chortled and bragged about it, while many of the rest of us struggled to find a space in a trials group -- and some waited long, long hours -- when POP was still new.  That had the effect of locking out a lot of people.  Same thing happened with the Hedge Maze, only it was almost worse, because getting six people through an event is a lot easier to do than getting 18 people together at a time.  It seemed the guild was clearly splitting into two tiers--those who were getting all the loot and all the flags and generally ignoring everyone else, and those who were getting neither and feeling more or less like laborers funding the drearily predictable bonuses awarded management.<br />
<br />
So we seemed stymied as far as getting into POP content, but weren't really doing a thing to pursue what you really need to be ready for PoP content either -- Vex Thal, and flags for everything for as many people as possible, so everyone can get their levels, their AA, scraps of loot, what have you.  And we were separating into tiers of those who belonged and those who were the accessories and tools of those who belonged.<br />
<br />
People started drifting off; I found a guild that was trying to advance neither in PoP nor non-PoP a complete waste of time.  Many of our members joined the server's uberguild, some quietly, some getting called names in the process.  I was interested in neither situation really, so deguilded and have since been on my own.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, PoP kind of encourages this.  It's structured to pull people apart -- by virtue of flags and levels, not just the ordinary ugly greed rampaging through the game world, as it does through any world.  The difficulty of getting everyone flagged for everything by funneling access to content through the bottleneck of flags (or broken and ridiculously time consuming quests, on the other hand) encourages guilds to break apart as some get flagged and some don't, and some people are deemed &quot;worthy&quot; of going back to get flagged and some aren't.  It's programmed to make those sick of how the average guild handles these problems either opt out of their guild and go on their own or jump to an uber guild where they aren't wasting their time, or, if they are wasting their time, at least they have a much better chance at much better loot while doing it.<br />
<br />
Worse still, the ability of outsiders to a guild to block a guild's progression by killing off key NPC's necessary for other guilds to kill takes natural internal difficulties and supplements them with a vulture attack to destroy from without what might not be destroyed from within.  Add on SOE nerfing alternate quests by mitigating slows so that the early people can sail in while latecomers have more of a struggle, and you have an expansion that seems to bring out the worst of the game in every aspect:  guilds are strained to stay together as they splinter into factions of who is flagged and who isn't; one guild can hold another down; guild members become harder and harder to usefully replace, because the prospect of flagging new people is a nightmare.<br />
<br />
I separate this kind of thing from what I would think of as mere &quot;features&quot; -- the ports in POK, or the extra bank slots in the new downloadable expansion.  These features are often really nice, and do a great deal to improve the game, at least by erasing its limitations, if nothing more, to make the gaming experience less tedious and aggravating.<br />
<br />
Yet the basic design of PoP does indeed seem to be very flawed.<br />
<br />
People have rushed to 65 without torpor or canni 5 or good gear or AA and found themselves less capable than they think of handling it -- although other people notice it just fine.  And most of them find themselves trapped in PoV or PoS -- but mostly PoV.<br />
<br />
All the &quot;opportunity&quot; to get AA (in one zone) doesn't make up for that for the majority of players.<br />
<br />
I do not hesitate to state that the majority of people are foolish.  Very few people will stay 60 and find whole guilds worth of people who want to stay 60 so they can beef up their abilities and experience and gear to take on the post-60 game.  That will not be the nature of their friends, their guilds or any guilds they could possibly find, or likely their own nature.  Instead, the majority will level themselves up and find themselves in guilds that are still not prepared enough or dedicated enough to really progress in the game, leaving them with nothing really besides PoV, changing guilds, or quitting outright(never to buy another Sony MMORPG)  -- none of which is tenable to the game's continuing popularity or profitability.  Partly because, frankly, the leap in time spent per day that is necessary for many guilds to make the leap from TOV or NTOV to Vex Thal and tier 3 and above would require too much divorce and unemployment.  How are you going to pay child support without a job?<br />
<br />
SOE is trying to cram a square peg into a round hole.  If you take the average person and tell him he can level but once he gets there he can't do anything, he'll wonder why he's paying money to do nothing.<br />
<br />
And, he might even stop doing it.  I've seen an awful lot of people stop playing lately, or stop playing as much.<br />
<br />
It used to be that the limitations in progressing in EQ were more self-imposed or a matter of the luck of not being in the right guild or on a server with guilds that have your kind of play style.  There weren't such heavy stumbling blocks put into the path of the customer by design.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to do ToV, what did you?  You went and did it.  Kael? Same.  NTOV? Go for it.  You win or lose, but you have access to the content.<br />
<br />
PoP gave most of us content that could not be accessed, and worse yet, encouraged the average Joe to sprint ahead as if he could somehow magically access it with levels and AA, when of course there was always a bottleneck of flags to stymie him.  And a bottleneck of flags to stymie whoever happened to go linkdead during a fight, die during a fight, get bugged during a fight, or simply not be around online during a fight for one reason or another.  <br />
<br />
The whole flagging phenomenon wasn't necessary during EQ's early times, and it isn't necessary now.  In fact, it is driving and absolutely inevitably will drive people from the game.  They won't come back to future Sony products -- once the magic is broken, it's broken.  And it will continue to do so, as long as the game designers believe that locking content out is a good idea, or that tedious quests or events(some that can even be easily sabotaged) to get flags or keys can function adequately as some sort of a quick and dirty substitute for providing real creative content.  <br />
<br />
You know, the real RPG stuff rather than hack and slash, or hack and slash progression that naturally follows from your ability to hack and slash, not the ability to be in just the right guild at just the right time that manages to get the critical numbers necessary through one bottleneck after another and that somehow doesn't get c*ckblocked by some other guilds from progressing.<br />
<br />
Personally, I believe that Sony might think there will be a natural progression of the less hardcore nutcases from EQ to SWG no matter how good EQ is, and that the only people who stay with EQ will be the real hardcore nutcases.  After all, SWG will have a strong pull even on the hardcore nutcases, and many of them will go too, and even more so on everyone else.  Certainly more so on anyone new to online gaming.  Who wants to join EQ and see endless numbers of level 65's KS'ing you and calling you a noob and lording it over you when you can go to SWG and be part of something new and fun, something you have an even chance in, and, for almost everyone these days, vastly more interesting than a fantasy universe -- the Star Wars sorta schlocky sci-fi fantasy universe?<br />
<br />
So does Sony really have to care or cater to anyone but the highest end people or the people who will mosey around in EQ no matter what, playing their 3 hours a week and considering a dollar an hour for fun a heck of a good bargain?<br />
<br />
I don't know that they have to.<br />
<br />
But this is the first expansion that seems to me to put inherent limits on things -- for the ambitious, the less ambitious, and the indifferent alike.<br />
<br />
Need torpor and old world level advancement? Bottleneck to VP and trying to get unclaimed old world dragons, plus Sontalak and a few others far less likely to help you out.  Need Luclin advancement?  Hope you have torpor and old world level power.  If so, bottleneck through Emperor and AA to another bottleneck in Vex Thal.  Need PoP advancement?  Hope you beat the old world and Luclin bottlenecks so you can bottleneck it through trials and flags one after the other, but ones you almost always need raid level forces of high level characters to beat -- and each and every bottleneck serves to funnel you into yet another bottleneck.  PoP is the first expansion ever that is almost completely about bottlenecks.  Success in it is like watching mirrors reflected in each other, ever receding. <br />
<br />
The game has become a nearly infinite number of bottlenecks reaching out into infinity(and beyond! ;) ).  PoP might have been Sony's effort to make the unbeatable expansion, so difficult and unlikely that they would never need to make another.  Kind of a perfect design, except for one thing.<br />
<br />
The human factor.  <br />
<br />
I remember a Gary Larson cartoon from the Far Side strip he used to do.   One cow looks up at another one with a sort of stunned realization.  &quot;Wait a minute.  This is grass!  We've been eating grass!&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, most of my friends seem to feel the same way, as they don't play much anymore, if at all.  This has never happened at this pace before.  And I found it hard to imagine I would play as little as I do lately myself.<br />
<br />
Sure, I suck, whatever.  Love it or leave it, yadda yadda.  Half-baked wiseacre comebacks are expected and the norm, and I expected.<br />
<br />
However, potential flames aside, I do think Sony has made a mistake by deciding that bottlenecks are the answer to every problem, and that people will either: a) put up with them forever, or b) leave EQ BUT...be quite willing to invest the hundreds of dollars they might have wound up spending on EQ on another Sony online product in the future if they find the first product falling short.  Remember, there's a difference between people leaving while liking a game and leaving while thinking it has insurmountable problems, at least for them in particular.  I'm sure that if EQ doesn't make a customer happy, his demand for a supply of Sony online games, present and future, is far less resolute and inflexible than Sony might like to suppose.  And I'm absolutely sure that one bad or mediocre recommendation or review passed between friends is worth more than all the advertisements in the world.<br />
<br />
Sony really needs to stop mistaking bottlenecks for challenges and timesinks for content.  Customer demand is not inelastic.</div></div><hr />

wake up laddy and smell the wenslydale! People are full of flaws, go watch The Beach, if u need a Pop psychology reminder.  I know its sad, but none of us should delude ourselves that the religion of EQ is gonna  keep us living hapliy ever after.

Since the release of PoP I  have gotten guildies flagged for CoD, HoH, PoV, PoS, BoT, Factory, and PoNB.   OMG the last three months have been a living hell in this game for me.  Who the hell wants to spend all thier online time farming crap to move to the next tier to farm more.  Seriously I haven't left yet, but I have left my guild.   It was to insane and people bitching about not being helped and being left behind was to much.  The drama day in and day out was about all one could take . I seriously thought I was on an episode of Gilligan's Island tryign to get off day after day.  I really do hope to see VT one day, but with people bitching about getitng runes, spectrals, and flags I realy don't care to see much anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

I really dont understand your post at all. Many times you stated your guild never went out to do all the boring tedious time sinks during Luclin yet you expected somehting in return?  You get what you give. <br />
<br />
***It seemed the guild was clearly splitting into two tiers--those who were getting all the loot and all the flags and generally ignoring everyone else, and those who were getting neither and feeling more or less like laborers funding the drearily predictable bonuses awarded management. <br />
***<br />
You had half the guild bust their ass to progress by obtaining flags while the other half jacked off and missed everything. how can you feel like a laborer if you didnt put in the labor? Your guildmates who actually logged in to get those flags to progress to keep the guild alive are the ones who  deserved any and all loot. <br />
<br />
***Unfortunately, PoP kind of encourages this. It's structured to pull people apart -- by virtue of flags and levels, not just the ordinary ugly greed rampaging through the game world, as it does through any world. ***<br />
<br />
Just the opposite, the flag system was supposed to pull people together and work together as a team for the advancement of the guild. the people who were torn apart were the leeches, vultures, dead weight Once a week Bob that log in once every week to raid for 2 hours then post on the board about how they are pissed they got passed over on shiny lootz from plane of candy becuase Johhnny Ironman plays 6 hours a day 7 days a week.<br />
<br />
Im sorry man i dont know you and its out of line to flame you, but  how can you take an awesome expansion like PoP (i admit Luclin sucked in just about every way) and say it destroyed your guild? Your members who deguilded when times got tight  helped destroy your guild. I dunno how you cant see that.</div></div><hr />

Well, you might be in the exclusive position to either have a big guild and you can kick out folks if they stay behind because of RL issues or playing times and still go on with content OR you had a guild which consist of people with no real life at all. Which is not what I (or BlargX) seem to have.<br />
<br />
I can say for my guild that I am very happy with the people in their, but we are too far behind ... we can do NtoV and some Luclin content, but thats it. What now? Progress in PoP or put time into farming Ssra (which most of us know, so it gets boring).<br />
<br />
And loot isn't the reason for this mess.<br />
<br />
You sound like someone who doesn't care at all that there are real people behind this pixels, sad sad.<br />

<br />
First of all, as to your reliable friend and slow mitigation, the POS giants have had slow mitigated more than they used to, regardless of the messages.  The early comers did have it easier.  Being someone who has fought the giants both pre- and post-nerf, I can see the difference very clearly.  Even though I may not know your reliable friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;You had half the guild bust their ass to progress by obtaining flags while the other half jacked off and missed everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
You're constructing a fantasy here.  I said no such thing.  However, in keeping with the comment you made above that I addressed, clearly you're leaping to conclusions that are the most negative and far-fetched.  What is your agenda?  Don't like me or something?  Okay.  But that has nothing to do with what I was talking about.  Don't go making up stories just for fun, especially if they're offensive flames.<br />
<br />
I never said anything about EITHER &quot;half&quot; the guild &quot;bust their ass&quot; OR &quot;half the guild&quot; &quot;jacked off and missed everything.&quot;  <br />
<br />
What the heck part of your anatomy are you pulling any of this out of?  Never mind.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering what any of this could have to do with loot, by the way.  I'm talking about people passing trials and the hedge maze in this section.  I was addressing something a little more important than some silly hedge maze and trials loot.  I got flagged from hedge maze outside of my guild because I couldn't get a maze run inside my guild, and when Veterans Chain Leggings dropped, I told the guild officer from the other guild leading the hedge maze raid who asked me repeatedly if I wanted them that I did not want them.  I don't see what's not apparent about things as I laid them out before or why I should even have to venture to explain any of this.  I don't get where you're coming from, but I know I've been clear on my part.<br />
<br />
&quot;leeches, vultures, dead weight&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmm; people who are in guilds, whether they are &quot;leeches, vultures, dead weight&quot; or not, who can easily get flagged are automatically exempt from being &quot;leeches, vultures, dead weight,&quot; while those who are not, or who work late one day, or who go linkdead during a fight, or who die during a fight and don't get rezzed AND do damage in time to get flagged, are &quot;leeches, vultures, dead weight&quot;?  Or, probably are?  Or ... maybe are?<br />
<br />
Basically, you're reading too many things into what I said that have nothing to do with it.  You're creating some kind of back story that doesn't exist.  It's not fair to expect me to respond to something you made up when it has nothing to do with what I said.<br />
<br />
My guild was not destroyed.  It was just not in a shape acceptable to me at a certain point in time, and it seemed to go on for a longer time than I felt comfortable with.  At this point, in fact, it seems to have gotten itself somewhat together finally and at least be progressing through the tiers.  But it did have a lot of problems for a while that I have seen repeated in other guilds; some busted up and did not get back together.  Mine never busted up at all, but turned into a disorganized and ultimately disappointing place to be for some of us for too long a time -- but only some.  <br />
<br />
I agree with you that PoP was SUPPOSED to do certain things, like bring guilds together, but I am addressing in part what PoP did to NOT live up to expectations, regardless of what it was supposed to do.  And you forget one thing -- not all guilds are of the same level or orientation.  EQ is not all about the highest level guilds.  Not all can regularly field the power to get people flagged, at least not for every zone.  <br />
<br />
And even on your own basis, your argument fails as to PoP's success.  Even the uberest of guilds finds themselves hamstrung sometimes by PoP's flagging requirements.  FOH's leader, Furor, noted in a post that PoP killed bots and alternate characters and people who missed a day or went linkdead alike, as flagging and re-flagging was such a pain.  If it was such a pain for his guild, it's probably more than fair to say that it's a pain for other guilds to get their alts and bots flagged too -- maybe even yours.<br />
<br />
I don't think that it's a big leap at all to see that if FOH et al. have any difficulty at all flagging people of ANY kind -- or my own lower level guild did as well -- that it's a problem in game design.  Not about cartoonish human vultures, leeches, whatever.<br />
<br />
It remains true that if you go linkdead at the wrong time, or die during the raid, or take a day off, whatever, you can be in serious trouble that can be almost unrecoverable.  Not just &quot;Once a week Bob that log in once every week to raid for 2 hours then post on the board,&quot; but any old person who lives, works, eats, breathes, you name the vice...anyone can get stuck in a situation that makes the game difficult for him just by LIVING.  <br />
<br />
And that doesn't even take into account all the c*ckblocking that goes on on some servers where people purposely try to ruin things for others trying to progress.  We have a long history of that on my server; maybe yours is all boy scouts, but mine isn't.  Mine's got plenty of jerks, and plenty who figure being a jerk pays and pays big.<br />
<br />
Great, Chuk, if you're in a guild on a server where everything's happy go lucky.  But don't assume weird things about other people because their situation is different from yours or make up stories about them or their motivations.  I understand that I am not you.  But you must also understand that you are not me.  <br />
<br />
I think you've dropped the ball on that one.<br />
<br />
PoP is not quite as awesome for some as others.  I really don't think you're stepping outside your situation at all -- even a little -- to see that.  You haven't at all refuted a single thing I said.<br />
<br />
And PoP never destroyed my guild; far from it.  But, it did have more than its share of faults, and has been the only expansion I've seen actively drive so many people out of the game so quickly.  It is truly unique in this, and I've tried to talk about some of the reasons why.  I don't think I've been mysterious or that the subject is either off limits or too hard to understand.<br />
<br />
PoP has taken further than ever before the idea of bottlenecks being good game design.  If Luclin proved that timesinks equal real content, then PoP proved that multiple, layered, interdependent bottlenecks are challenges.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slow mitigation has been in game since PoP went live This was wintnessed by ME. There were several mobs which were bugged by varying slows and were not giving the correct mitigation due to this. This was fixed within the first few weeks but the mobs still stayed mitigated.<br />
Yes i believe my friend's observation about Beta 10 million times more than i believe yours.<br />
<br />
<br />
***The first thing PoP did is confuse my guild and start tearing it up. A number of solid players found themselves facing the same situation I did, and, like I did, left the guild at least partially because of it. ***<br />
<br />
Melodrama says what? What other conclusion can i deduct than you and your flakey pals (the people rubbing one out while the real members did all the work) not being able to stand strong with your guild through the flagging progress, especially something like hedgemaze which respawns every 2 hours and flags 18 people at a time. <br />
<br />

<br />
There is no trial in game presently that does this. There used to be a few that in the first few weeks of PoP were not tuned. like Storms event, HoH trials those were fixed as was Bertox event which is a reset of 6 hours. Boy scout or not spanky, the event repops hours after its blown. Please a little more facts.<br />
<br />
***People started drifting off; I found a guild that was trying to advance neither in PoP nor non-PoP a complete waste of time. Many of our members joined the server's uberguild, some quietly, some getting called names in the process. I was interested in neither situation really, so deguilded and have since been on my own. ***<br />
<br />
Did verant make you deguild? Did Planes of Power expansion call you in your sleep and say &quot;boy hedge maze is really tough (resets every 2 hours and flags 18 people at a time) to flag people for so you must deguild and live an easier life&quot;?<br />
<br />
***And even on your own basis, your argument fails as to PoP's success. Even the uberest of guilds finds themselves hamstrung sometimes by PoP's flagging requirements.

<br />
In case you didnt know, people like to exaggerate sometimes to make a point. We did a full expansion of reflaggings in the last 2 days with time left over to kill elemental  named . 2 days, yep a real pain, all our bots , alts and invites in the elemental planes agree with the above statement.<br />

First of all, Chuk, you sure bring new meaning to arrogance and ignorance. You put those two terms to a completely new level.<br />
<br />
Melodrama says what? What other conclusion can i deduct than you and your flakey pals (the people rubbing one out while the real members did all the work) not being able to stand strong with your guild through the flagging progress, especially something like hedgemaze which respawns every 2 hours and flags 18 people at a time. <br />
- RZ, Behemoth, MM, Agnarr, Saryrn, Zek Bros, Bertox are all 2 hour respawn? That's new to me. You preach for people not seeing the other side yet you complete ignore it. Hypocrit no? Facts are, that even in big guilds (FoH is prime example), people miss flags. They commit the ultimate sin: do something in RL and miss a crucial flag. In my guild alone there are at least 5+ ... as you put it ... Johny Ironman who missed the last Rydda'Dar flag. Yet myself who plays much less was lucky and didn't.<br />
<br />
There is no trial in game presently that does this. There used to be a few that in the first few weeks of PoP were not tuned. like Storms event, HoH trials those were fixed as was Bertox event which is a reset of 6 hours. Boy scout or not spanky, the event repops hours after its blown. Please a little more facts.<br />
- You should maybe take your own advice and get more facts. On some servers there are already guilds c0ckblocking RZ and Bertoxxulous. Just because the (insert random HoH trial) was fixed doesn't mean a guild can't c0ckblock RZ like they c0ckblocked Emperor or like they c0ckblocked ST or hell NToV. Again, you preach of seeing the &quot;other side&quot; yet you completely ignore it and are misinformed about it.<br />
<br />
Did verant make you deguild? Did Planes of Power expansion call you in your sleep and say &quot;boy hedge maze is really tough (resets every 2 hours and flags 18 people at a time) to flag people for so you must deguild and live an easier life&quot;?<br />
- You increased your skill in Ignorance (252)!<br />
- You increased your skill in Arrogance (252)!<br />
<br />
I know you were looking for some highfives and &quot;you go girl&quot; s from the flakey flakes on this board, but not all of us see your side of things. <br />

Perma killing Rallos Zek c*cblocks access to Elemental Planes for other guilds to allow farming. Im sure this is happening on most servers as it did with killing the Emporer for blocking entrance to VT.<br />
<br />
I have to say your being a bit harsh on BlargX, Chuk. I have seen both sides of the coin in respect to PoP in the last few months. If your not in an uber guild your pretty much stuck in a few selected zones and there is this vacuum for players that become 65 where these zones are the only ones that are worth being in unless you want to farm old world for your twinks.<br />
<br />
Level 65 has done no favours for the game, you either have to stay 60 so you can viably do AAXP solo if you need to or if your 65 your stuck in the planes with everyone else and you really need to group for that. They need to revamp some of the old zones that fill this EXP/AAXP void that exsists between 60 and 65. Even mobs in CT now con light blue. Maybe Legacy of Ykesha will go some way to fixing this.</div></div><hr />

PoS giant bosses were once slowable (migration or not), and a patch made them immune to changes in attack speed.<br />
I witnessed this myself, while slowing (or trying to slow) the same mob before and after the patch. Those Minibosses were rendered unslowable. And from the damage our maintank took on both occasions, there was a difference in actual speed as well as message!<br />

Shows how little you know, the original Storms  bosses were all slowable but mitgated incorrectly as in Grummus slowing better than Turgurs. Since you are playing total ignoramous ill even tell you they had AE rampage til they were tuned down for the masses.  If you mean those gimpatastic baby named they added later on which were for a half day ridiculously easy and gained 12 people entrance into bot every 2 hours.. there was a reason why they were flagged IMMUNE to slow.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We also recently did a complete reflagging of new invites and some bots/stragglers and it took about 2 days.  Not a single flag spawn was dead in that time.  You are partially correct on your observations of PoP so far.  There is one glaring error though.<br />
<br />
They are not currently on my server bottlenecks (and I would guess all except the absolute most competitive server).  They are challenges, challenges waiting to be defeated.  The starting spawns will simply always be up (grummus and aeryn specifically).  They are simply waiting for a leader to step up to the challenge.  I've been hearing recently of large gatherings to kill grummus and aeryn (maybe a bit too large but I applaud whoever organized the events).  Why can't you be the leader that your server apparently needs?  They screwed PoP up bad for the current raiding groups except for the very high end but that does not mean things can't change.<br />
<br />
I played my early days on E'ci, reknown for the large amount of public raids early on in the servers lifespan.  If I recall, Nagafen, Vox, Hate/Inny, Fear/Cazic, and Sky were all defeated originally by publicly lead and run raids.  They werent serverwide firsts or anything but they were beaten in a reasonable amount of time.  They were subsequently riduculed by none other than Furor if my history serves me.  Eventually one guild came to the forefront and dominated the high end until the server split but I doubt anyone who was around on E'ci forgets what it was like early on.<br />
<br />
I had assumed that these type of events would begin to happen across most servers.  There are a lot of level 60-65's who don't have the current access to decay, honor, tactics and so many other zones that they could easily have access to (with some prep time and a handful of people willing to make it happen).<br />
<br />
To expedite this post, these megaraids are probably the start of this across a few servers. All it really takes is the right core of people to start it (maybe even offer to help people through justice trials if they're over 60 and attended a grummus raid).  Find 2-3 clerics, 2-3 monks, 2-3 warriors, 2-3 enchanters and 1-2 of each buffing class willing to put one night a week into making this happen.  Get a map and learn as much of the pulls to grummus as you can one week and then set it up for the next week.  Post it and they will come.  They might be 27 druids 14 rangers and 10 paladins but you could still handle it with some practice.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Slow mitigation was most definetely in at the beginning of PoP but it was horribly broken and bugged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In Chuk's defense (or maybe not) it has to be said that he has probably been in his servers top guild for several years. So he should be enjoying the game because the focus from Verant/SOE has been 95 percent on his kind of people. Yeah yeah so they also encounter the bugs first...but not all bugs are bad so I think that more than evens out.<br />
<br />
It looks like most of the topguilds are enjoying PoP but even some of the more notable members of those guilds (Kreugen from FoH for one) seems to have valid points of critique (http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=5151). And if people like him are starting to get fed up with the game then SOE are starting to fail on both the ubber part and the normal part (which they have not really done much for ever).<br />
<br />
Im actually kinda enjoying the game for now but Im the ultimate slacker (just got 61 and the new pet :)). And its not because of any big effort from SOEs part that I am enjoying it because I still think the game could be much better.<br />
<br />
I think I agree with you BlargX but I just havent experienced much of it yet myself...mostly because it seemed obvious to me how bad it could be for someone like me. But I guess if even the thought of trying some of the new content is enough to make people put if of then SOE really has a problem on their hands.</div></div><hr />

Wow, thats the first comeback I saw on these boards where somebody tries to counter me by admitting I was right. <br />
<br />
If you like, you can counter me more often. It gives my arguments credibility :)<br />
<br />
Those giants that were flagged immune to slow were migrating slow before that. As gimpatastic they are to Raidguilds, the slow made quite a difference to normal groups (and therefore to less focused small guilds as well). As in being killable by single groups before. And it got changed weeks after PoP, not half a day. As to question why they would be single group killable - big SURPRISE. They were meant as the single group approach to Tier 3 flags, just like the CoD and PoT quests.<br />
<br />
Please try not to get into arguments about things that concern mostly non-Uber guilds. You are about as knowledgeable there as I would be talking about Loot distribution in Vex Thal, buddy.<br />
<br />
Common sense would tell you that bottlenecks are seldom there for the premier guilds on their respective servers - doh.</div></div><hr />

Those people (yes people not toons) may have helped at some crucial point. I doubt Magister has a whole lot of time for the folks that are never around and don't help. But to call people who have helped you day in and out for years dead weight because they just can't seem to be on 24 /7 a vulture is sad.<br />
<br />
PoP does one thing. I seperates people into teirs. Teirs in the planes. teirs in playtime and style. Teirs in uberness.  But for the people who this is a game and not a lifestyle choice, all there is for those people are Tears. <br />
<br />
As a smaller guild leader all I am seeing is that people who are flagged seem to get tired of waiting for others. And sadly when they are split off from guildies and meeting all sorts of new and more uber people and getting much better xp. Why should they stay with the vultures and dead weight that helped them get epics. With the loosers and hanger ons who time and again try to provide fun for every in the guild..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I feel the same way Blarg.  Been playing much and much and much less lately.  However, fortunately, i've managed to find a few friends, and a few friends of friends and scrapped together a fledgling guild that will not be screwing around with POP bull****. People in POP that haven't been to ToV yet aren't going with the progression.  Since none of my friends have been anywhere, we'll start with that, and we'll stay 60 until we get the AA done, and IF we're around long enough, we'll worry abut dumbass flags.  There's no reason right now for 90% of the people in EQ to be worrying about PoP, but for some reason everything thinks they have to.  They all level to 65 and then the majority of them realize they don't have the gear or the AA to be useful, and they can only XP in one zone if you're not in a high end guild.  yay.<br />
<br />
Not for me.  Time to make this game fun again.  If that means using PooP just for ports, then that's what it means.  Fortunately for us, the more retards fighting over PoP content, the less i have to contend with in my spots geared for my level 60 toons.</div></div><hr />

You had half the guild bust their ass to progress by obtaining flags while the other half jacked off and missed everything. how can you feel like a laborer if you didnt put in the labor? Your guildmates who actually logged in to get those flags to progress to keep the guild alive are the ones who  deserved any and all loot. <br />
<br />
and...<br />
<br />
Just the opposite, the flag system was supposed to pull people together and work together as a team for the advancement of the guild. the people who were torn apart were the leeches, vultures, dead weight Once a week Bob that log in once every week to raid for 2 hours then post on the board about how they are pissed they got passed over on shiny lootz from plane of candy becuase Johhnny Ironman plays 6 hours a day 7 days a week.<br />
<br />
Man, Chuk, you seem pretty narrow minded about the scope of things. <br />
<br />
You might be right that the flag system was to encourage pulling people together to advance.  But, it's not quite working out like that for many.  We've had some that play 5-6 days a week miss out on flags because RL comes up (RL is important, ya know) on the day we happen to have to kill X-Mob to advance, or some other guild will.   That's the problem.<br />
<br />
If a guild is tearing apart that normally wouldn't have pre-PoP because of flag issues, then there's something serious to be looked at.   If you say &quot;tough sh*t&quot; to those in your guild that has missed a flag, but has helped the guild previously in any way, then you're contradicting your &quot;the flag system was supposed to pull people together and work together as a team...&quot; theory.<br />
<br />
On my server, I'm in a small guild that alliances with two other like-minded and intelligent guilds (some are friends or been in previous larger guilds) to tackle these boss mobs for flag advancement.   So far, we're flagged for all tier3 zones, but Tactics.  Unfortunately, we have some people that have missed one down the road.   We're going to make sure we get them flagged, and not leave them in the hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">PoP has crippled some guilds on my server too.  From that sound of Blargx's story the reasons sound similar.  This is the problem of poor leadership amongst the officers in the guild.  The officers have to be forcefull enough to set the goals for the guild and motivate the guild for the common goal.  Dont get me wrong I agree with him on alot of the problems of PoP but I think more blame goes to the leadership of these guilds.<br />
<br />
I should disclaimer this before I go on, I am in a large guild now, we just got into Elemental Planes last night, first ones on our server.  We worked hard on it, PoP has been the guild focus since the expansion came out - even when a good portion of the guild wanted to be doing Vex Thal instead.  It was our leadership that held us to a single purpose and it has paid off :)<br />
<br />
There are pros and cons in regards to Planes of Power.  I dont think SoE misrepresented what it would be.  It was advertised as a challenging expansion and I think everyone had to know that a good percentage of it was goign to be limited to a very few for some time.  Ive been an EQ player now for almsot 3 years and I really only play to raid now.  Because of my guilds sucess in PoP yes I am having fun with the expansion.  I certainly understand why others are not though.<br />
<br />
Good Things in PoP:<br />
<br />
Lvl cap 65: I think this helps smaller guilds more than larger guilds personally.  Guilds without huge membership and lesser equipment can take on mobs that were out of reach before.<br />
<br />
Interesting mobs: The bosses my guild has fought so far have all been fun, they require different tactics<br />
<br />
Lots of high end content: If your guild is strong enough there is ALOT of stuff to do, especially once your into elementals.  In return this has openned up alot of the high end zones on luclin/velious that were being camped by these same guilds freeing them up for other guilds to advance.<br />
<br />
Bad things in PoP:<br />
<br />
Lvl cap 65: unfortunately because of the raised cap it has also trivialized 95% of the existing world.  Because 61+ exp. sucks in the previous high level zones from the old world and because of the &quot;newness&quot; of PoP everyone wants to be there.  <br />
<br />
Flags: Ugh.  The worst idea in PoP.  You have to pretty much be on everynight raiding if you want to make sure you dont miss anything.  Especially the case in my guild i noticed, if you missed a key flag they could potentionally lock you out of most of what yoru guild was doing.  I think I like flags more than having to farm a key for every zone though.  Maybe some kind of Guild flag wouldve worked better, everyone in guild has access to the flags the guild has earned /shrug<br />
<br />
Runes/Parchments:  2nd worst idea ever.  I think if I get Talismen of the Diaku or Petrifying earth agian im going to vomit.  I ended up buying most of my 61-64 spells in the bazaar just to avoid this headache.  Runes, sigh they are hard to get been lucky and have most of my 65 spells but agian there is nothing more frustrating to turn in a rune and get Ferine Avatar, agian.  I think id rather just see the spells drop like before - as frustrating as that can be (i.e torpor, malo, bla)<br />
<br />
<br />
I could put in lack of single group content but honestly thats not what PoP was about.  Maybe LoY will add some of this I dont know.  EQ has always been fileld with bottlenecks and timesinks.  The whole game is a big timesink :)  I think some people take it personally though like SoE is out to purposely cause us pain.  The game design has not changed, most of the problems being complained about have been here since I started playing.  All I hear though is complaining how exactly do you make something challenging?  Anything that prevents your from moving along at a steady pace is a bottleneck. <br />
<br />
I think EQ provides plenty of challenge and content, however the very nature of an online game can throw it all off and become even more frustrating.  That is your playing with other people , some of whom are not nice.  So you get people training each other, acting like children (many are anyway), c*ckblocking or dominating choke points for the sole purpose of preventing others from advancing.  It only takes a few to make alot frustrated, and SoE hasnt covered itself with glory in dealing with the people who are constantly doing this.  That is the fundemental flaw of all MMORPG and certainly not something new with PoP.  Some people like that kind of conflict, I think alot more dont (i dont for sure).  Until someone finds a way to remove that &quot;bottleneck&quot; its going to be a problem regardless what game your playing.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's fascinating to me that Chukzombi can't seem to comprehend that there might be individuals in EQ who don't want to play the game the way he does or don't want to belong to guilds like his.  Yet, their playstyles are just as valid and meaningful as his.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, my playstyle falls closer to Chuk's in the spectrum of high level raiding guilds than some of the other examples listed in this thread, but that doesn't mean I can't sympathize or understand their concerns.<br />
<br />
I think PoP flagging is divisive and overly time consuming and a serious blow to the more casual gamers.   The step from PoV/PoS to the next level is enormous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I agree, PoP is a difficult choice.<br />
<br />
It turned us from being a growing guild - we just took on dragons, we did Inny, we attempted cazic but the zone crashed.... we're getting our VP keys....<br />
<br />
to being a more fractured one. We had to spend weeks to get everyone flagged for PoV/PoS, and with only 8 level 60+ members, all of whom are now flagged after weeks of failures and trying and tears and hard work and people feeling they were useless, we will never kill the glass dragon. We may get BoT or HoH alternate keys. But further? not likely.<br />
<br />
Our main focus is still VP so we can get everyone the spells they need. But I can't help thinking we are falling further and further behind on the bottlenecks... already we had issues when some people got through with friends on various pop flags while the rest of us struggled and failed and failed and failed to get others through. So some of us raced to 65, others were stuck at 60 and discouraged. My enchanter friend did 40, yes 40 trials before he won.<br />
<br />
The thing about VP and VT... VP there is one bit that requires a guild effort - trak. And you get 4 teeth and the chance of a nice bp or spell drop, or maybe some undead sinew. Not too bad. Then the rest is all solo legwork. VT - there's the emp, and a few camps that require a group of people to get for the emp key. Not horrible. Someone can do their key off and on and not be too far behind.<br />
<br />
But PoP? Well first you need a good group - not just any group - to get PoV/PoS flagged. Then you need factory flagged. Then you need hedge flagged - 18 people. Then you need BoT flagged, and HoH flagged (guild effort) and codecay flagged (possible alternate quest but ruins you for future areas)..... it's not missing 1 fight that you can catch up on later. It's missing 1 fight and being forced to sit out the next four because you didn't get in on the grummus kill. Suddenly, not having everyone on at one particular fight becomes a Big Stinking Deal. <br />
<br />
Add to the fact that most of these bosses drop crap, and therefore, farming them isn't as fun as farming Trak is... I still  hope for a JB BP from Trak for the bramblecoat effect, and as the other shaman has one, it would probably be mine if it dropped. Or undead sinew. Or spells for others. Or the bard epic piece.<br />
<br />
I'm also bored silly with PoV.... I basically go there, and am all buisness... get an aa, then go do something fun. <br />
<br />
Not sure where I am going in this game, other than perhaps burning out. I love my guild, but I do feel the restrictions of being in a lower tier guild... heck, we're waiting to try our first vindi kill, and I'm 65. If he's ever up on our 3 raid nights :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hell, the step to PoV/S was almost enough to wreck my guild.<br />
<br />
High DPS classes all breezed through Execution, and then vanished into Valor to PL themselves to 65, leaving everyone else to try and beg their way into a pickup group (And about a 2% chance of beating the trial), while guildchat was filled with &quot;OMG YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD THE XP IS IN HERE!&quot;. I took almost a month to get Valor/Storms flagged, because the gimps I was forced to try them with in my 28 attempts before I beat it were...gimps. The situation caused more than just a little bit of resentment.<br />
<br />
The flagging system has huge glaring flaws, which Blarg hit right on the head. You can play 12 hours a day 7 days a week, but all it takes is a tiny amount of bad luck, and suddenly everyone else in the guild is in a zone you can't reach. I guess from your greek god perch, Chuk, that this has never happened to you, and you've demonstrated clearly in the past that you are incapable of empathy, so forgive me if I don't give two squirts of stale urine about anything you say on the subject.<br />
<br />
What I would like to fix flagging, is to make it so that if 85% of a raid is flagged for a zone, the 15% of people who aren't will be able to zone in. Then, if they succeed in getting the flag given by that zone, they retroactively are granted flag for the first zone.<br />
<br />
Example: Bob is not flagged for PoNightmareB. His raid of 50 people has 45 flagged, 90%, and so all 50 of them can zone in. If they fail, nothing happens for Bob. If they kill Terris Thule, not only does Bob get the Torment flag, but he gets flagged for NightmareB as well. It would mean that if a handful of people miss a flag for some reason, they don't have to log off because the rest of the guild is going somewhere they can't. It means the guild has to do a LOT less re-flagging (something which is becoming like voluntary root canal), and the requirement of needing to beat the NEXT flag to get THIS flag also prevents the system from being abused by making a &quot;raid&quot; of 6, having 5 flagged, and insta-flagging the 6th person simply by going to the new zone and then zoning right back out.</div></div><hr />

  Since PoP came out we've seen Behemoth once.  Failed it but we'll get it next time.  It has been successfully done once by a Japanese guild, probably 3 times by a French guild on our server.<br />
 <br />
  I could go on and on with Agnarr, Ulthor, Rydda'Dar (we really need a second Aerin'Dar kill first anyway) and all the other bosses and it's the same thing.  WE HAVE TOO MANY ****ING GUILDS AFTER THEM, and the ****ing respawn is too long.  It's not like we're not TRYING to kill them, but we can't kill something that is never up during our play time!  It's ludicrous.  PoP can kiss my ass.</div></div><hr />

As to events being blocked, hedge maze was blocked a few times on my server, among others.  Anything that requires killing a mob that can be killed by another to prevent you from progressing can bring out bitter politics between guilds on servers.  Killing stuff to bottleneck people is not limited to PoP, either, but is an important tactic used by some guilds, including ones on my server who have admitted to both doing it and attempting it openly, time and again.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">PoP has been very much a love-hate expansion for me. It seems like everything they did has something I really like about it but at the same time I really hate about it.<br />
<br />
EXP- I like alot of what they did with exp post 60. I liked the fact that it didn't take a rediculous amount of time to get the new levels. I like being able to get an aa point in a more reasonable amount of time, especially with the amount of aa you seem to need. I like the fact that your fighting tough mobs that I don't feel like I should be soloing while half a sleep. I don't like the fact that there is so little places to reasonably exp in at 65. I'm flagged for all zones before elemental planes and there just aren't many spots for people to reasonably exp. I don't like PoV becoming as bad as Dreadlands. Why is Plane of torrment such a bad exp zone? Why is PoS filled with nasty mobs that hit for twice what stuff does, has really nasy procs/abilities, is filled with casters and yet still gives less exp than most mobs PoV? Why are the giantsin BoT easier to hunt than the giants in PoS? Did they send all the weaker giants to hide inside? Why is it almost impossible to single pull anything in HoH and has nothing in the way of drops when PoV is almost all single pullable and has some nice random drops and even named with drops? They have soo much potential to make alot more zones usable as exp zone especially for people who gotten access to more zones.<br />
<br />
Flags- I like the idea of flags. The storyline they have implimented with the flags is great. Flags definitely beat having a bag or 2 full of all sorts of different keys to be able to get into anywhere. On the other hand flags have been a royal pain in the rear. Having to go back and redo the same thing 3 or 4 more times just to get people flagged so they can join us is a pain especially when they loot isn't worth killing the mob. They have done alot to improve things with fixing blowable spawns, respawn times of fails and out of order flagging is definitely alot better than things where originally. There is still room for improvement tho. There are holes in the system and we ended up with a number of people who got stuck in thier flagging because they didn't follow the approriate story line to get a flag from an npc after killing mob xyz and the only way to resolve some of those has been to go back and kill xyz again.<br />
<br />
Slow mitigation- Yes even this has it's good side of things. The way I look at it with out slow mitigation these things would either be immune to slow, immune to magic or have higher dps unslowed so they ended up with the dps they want. None of the other ones seem better to me than a mitigating mob. On the other hand like most new things they impliment they seem to have gone crazy with it. Just like hand to hand weapons that they threw on every mob.<br />
<br />
Boss- I like alot of the boss. The Boss mobs are very inventive and alot of them require different strategies in order to kill them. It's no longer just do we have enough clerics to keep the tank up long enough for everyone to beat the mob into the group. Things like Behemouth, talon and valon zek, Agnar are some very interesting fights. Problem is that also usually equates to a failed run or 2 before you can successfully kill said mob. With 3 different guilds all nearing the elemental planes and one not far behind it can be hard to get those shots at said mobs.<br />
<br />
Almost anything you can name about PoP has the same type of good and bad about it. Alot of interesting ideas that just seem to be poorly implimented seems to be the name of the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">but not all of us see your side of things. <br />
<br />
Someone has a mouse in their pocket or a split personality.  You may not see his side of things ... but it's a stretch to think you somehow represent groups on this board esp. with the lack of support on follow up posts by others.<br />
<br />
<br />
BlargX <br />
<br />
There are a number of people posting similar thoughts/questions about PoP and it's impact on guilds off on other boards.   PoP is not a panacea.  And just as a aside but don't expect that LoY is going to help lvl 61-65 congestion if it's design is limited to lvl 35-60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Good post Blarg, I feel the same way sometimes.  But there are a lot of benefits to it.  Getting to 65 makes things a lot easier on old content, especially if you can get some new gear and spells.  The rate of exp in PoV+ is great, I gained 3 aa's yesterday, and still had time to mess around some and die a half dozen times.  The portals are a godsend, I don't think I could live without those anymore.<br />
<br />
But the guild situation can be pretty bad.  I'm in a casual raid guild (read:  raiding not required).  We've still got a number of people not in PoV/PoS.  Still working on BoT keys.  Eventually we'll get a number of people into higher up tiers, but it's going to be a long, long time, because people don't raid every night, nor are they asked to.  We're sticking to velious/luclin content still, because it doesn't require that all our members are on at the same time.<br />
<br />
If you're in a top end guild, on the leading edge of what's being killed, PoP is probably an awesome expansion.  However, the majority of us are not in that situation.  People are not dead weight because they don't show up to every raid.  The ones that do get further ahead, but they wouldn't have gotten there without enough of those people that show up occasionally to help out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I agree that the new expansion won't help much, if we can judge by Sony's advertising for it.  I kind of feel like we're being sold a really, really big patch.<br />
<br />
I actually like lots of things about PoP, including some of the things Taraddar and Jaruden mentioned, like how easy AA become there(I got 9 AA in a single day in POS once), and that it's making some of the higher level people who get successfully flagged clear out of zones that up-and-comers need, like Ssra and Vex Thal.  And I dislike some things too, of course.  The storyline part I'm afraid I can't relate to much, as probably most people who play EQ have no idea what the storyline is and have no need to know it.  Story doesn't seem at all an integral or necessary part of EQ.  If I want to read a story, I've already got lots of books, and it's a virtual guarantee they have much better stories than I'm going to read on a static screen in an online game.  Plus, it's easier on the eyes.<br />
<br />
But I definitely think there's something flawed in Sony not being able to have predicted that if you make a game with five more levels, people will NOT think about whether they want to or should level or not -- they'll just do it and pay the consequences later, whatever they might be.  I think the number of 60's who didn't level further is probably very small.<br />
<br />
Those consequences could be a lot of people becoming dissatisfied with flagging problems and pretty predicable problems occurring in guilds because of it.  It's as if Sony didn't think out the implications very well.  If you get people to 65, you have to be very sure they have something to do when they get there.  It was not a good assumption that everyone, or even the majority of people, who come anywhere near that level will be able to progress past the beginning levels of PoP.  The image of 1500 people in PoV continues to come to mind.  Maybe they shouldn't have all rushed to 65, but once it's done, it's done.  Then, you have to take care of their needs, despite their own possible misjudgments.  Human nature has to be accounted for in the design of the game, not something that makes you go, &quot;Oops!&quot;<br />
<br />
PoP could well be a kind of panacea for people in very strong guilds who manage to always be around at the right time and never go linkdead during a flagging fight, or always get rezzed in time if they die during one.  But...that doesn't mean it's a panacea for everyone, of course.  Even people in those very strong guilds.  Unique to this expansion in my opinion is its great potential for actually driving people away from the game at an unprecedented rate by making them feel &quot;stuck,&quot; and stuck further and further away from their friends and guildmates.<br />
<br />
And it definitely is a whole new level of bottlenecking.  I don't think bottlenecking is a good design idea in general.  And it seems to be the principal design idea in PoP.</div></div><hr />

Well that's not surprising Chuk, since you haven't understood a goddam word anyone has posted since day 1!  You need classes in reading comprehension . . . seriously.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the gratuitous flame, but anyone who posts **** like that deserves it.  Blarg's post eloquently (as usual) summed up the Mother of all Frustrations that is the PoP expansion for a good 80% of all high level people that play EQ.  <br />
And since about 70% of all people that play now have at least one high level character, that's a good bit. <br />
<br />
If Chuk can't understand the experiences of a good 60% of about 400,000 people, even when they are painstakingly laid out before him in clear Queen's English, one has to wonder if he's qualified to do more than sit there in front of his keyboard and mash the &quot;I'm uber!&quot; hotkey.</div></div><hr />

Labor?  I don't want to be a laborer!  I play the GAME to have fun.  IMHO - EQ should be more like an interactive novel than a job.  I can't say I've ever read a book where the heroes spent months or years killing random skeletons for a 'rare drop'.  The premise is just too stupid.<br />
<br />
Problem is - this game has been more about time spent than actual skill.  It's been more about what you are wearing than the abilities you've built into your character.<br />
<br />
I can't wait for someone to come up with a formula that rewards something other than just the amount of your valuable 'spare' time you throw at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Haha, one guy fuelling so much ranting; unreal.<br />
<br />
I can see both sides of the argument. It's frustrating to have to keep going back and scrapping with weaker guilds for encounters you've already aced twice because people keep missing the raids to get themselves flagged.<br />
<br />
The difference is this is not their fault. They've got lives. Strange concept, but bear with me. See, they live in the &quot;real world&quot; sometimes... some might have &quot;jobs&quot; or maybe even &quot;children&quot; that will come before anything in EQ will, no matter how much it stinks for them.<br />
<br />
Personally, I love the flags. On our server we've got a couple extremely zergish and unskilled guilds that like to insist on a turn at high end encounters they know they can't do. They of course blow the fights (Aerin, AoW, etc) and the peeps who are there for business get to sit on their thumbs until the mobs repop and then deal with the same stupidity again. Flagging is an IMMENSE blessing in that regard. The trash guilds can't bother you once you're beyond Behemoth-ish bosses.<br />
<br />
On the other hand (as someone else already mentioned) it's really divisive for guilds to have members chomping at the bit to advance while others are strolling along in PoN wondering why no one wants to help them get flagged for Valor/Storms.<br />
<br />
As a whole, I loved PoP. Gorgeous-looking bosses, zones, exp (!), stories, tactics, fight styles, etc etc. It's a great raiding expansion and for that I love it to death. It's really nice to be able to sit down and grind out 4 AAs in a matter of hours instead of taking 2-4 days to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">If you want to get flagged for the tier 2 and 3 zones, you have to work for it.  It's that plain and simple.  At this point here, if I really wanted to, I could probably get my 55 monk flagged for all the tier 3 zones in about a month or less.  Why would this be possible?  Because my guild works together.  We actually care about helping each other out.  We spend a lot of time getting everyone flagged so most of us can all be in the same place at once, or hunt where we want to.<br />
<br />
For example, one of the officers in our guild has probably gone through about about 20 successful PoJ trials getting new people flagged.  I've personally done about 6 trials more than I needed to get about 12 people I knew flagged.  Passing execution is incredibly easy with proper preperation and classes used for the trial.  We know how to pass the trail very quickly, and if we had someone that needed to get through, we'd end up getting about 10-15 people showing up to PoJ just to help that ONE person through the trial.  That's the kind of mentality you need in a guild that's going to succeed in POP.  Getting YOUR flag means nothing.  Getting your GUILD flagged is what really matters.<br />
<br />
Another example is getting flagged for CoD.  We had some problems with Grummus at first and deciding where to pull him to without getting adds.  We've found the &quot;right&quot; spot to pull him, and planted a coh mage there.  Since then, our guild has killed Grummus about 3 or 4 times to get about 99% of our guild members flagged.  We didn't just stop at the first flagging.  We are on an ongoing flagging mission to get every guild member wanting flagging to get flagged.<br />
<br />
Similar things can be said for getting flagged for BoT.  For a solid 2 weeks I'd log in and see 2-3 groups together in PoS collecting medallions.  Anyone logging in would volunteer to come to PoS to kill giants if needed, and go looking for XP secondary.<br />
<br />
If a guild doesn't want to work together to get flagged or get items guildmembers want or get spells or whatever, that guild will fail in POP.  It's not a flaw of POP.  It's a flaw of the guild mentality.  My guild operates as a close knit family.  It takes months of being a recruit for the guild getting to know the person before they can join.  I care about helping out my guildmembers, and will almost always volunteer to help a guildy out on something that gives me no benefit at all.  I do this because I know that they truly appreciate the help, and if I need help at some point in the future with something, they will be there to back me up.  This goes for getting tanks and other guild members 10th rings, getting 8th shawls for casters, helping guildies camp shards and key quest pieces, doing BoT named runs for spells, doing epic quest fights, etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
The main problem you seem to have, Blarg, is that your guild barely had enough unity to keep going in Luclin.  The moment EVERYONE in the guild had to start working towards the betterment of the GUILD and not themselves, it started falling apart.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And as for being unable to explore most of the zones of this new expansion, that's really an unrealistic statement.  You have the starting hunting zones of poj, pod, pon, poi.  The trial of execution is trivial to pass, giving everyone pov and pos very EASILY.  Once in pos, I see pickup groups of whatever random people are in zone getting together and killing the named giants to get flagged for bot.  This is another super easy zone to get flagged for.  Hedge trials are not difficult to pass.  They seem to have made the quest giver smarter now, because I've had zero problems getting the entire raid into the same hedge in the past 3 hedge trials.  Getting flagged for ponb is another incredibly easy zone to get access to.<br />
<br />
That's poj, pod, pon, poi, pos, pov, bot, and ponb zones that require you to have only 17 friends/guildmates to be able to enter.<br />
<br />
Once in ponb, Terris Thule is not hard to kill either.  Our guild tried her, got her to 25% or so on first try, but got very valuable info on what to do for the next fight.  Second time through we rocked her world.  If you have people that know how to raid, and can follow instructions, then anyone can kill TT.  Any guild capable of doing NTOV dragons should have no problems doing TT.  Getting flagged for Factory in poi is not at all hard.  The hardest part of the whole process is keeping the gnome from eating rage at the end.  Doing behemoth is about as hard as doing TT.  If you prep for the fight properly, and deal with the whole encounter with some planning, getting into potactics isn't hard either.  Our guild just did it today on the second try.  Same thing can be said for Grummus and Aerin'Dar.  These fights are over in a matter of minutes.  If you prep for all of these encounters and deal with the CCs in each of these fights as appropriate, then cod, potorment, potactics, and hoho flags are all readily available to pretty much anyone that really works towards getting them.<br />
<br />
So the list is now poj, pod, pon, poi, pos, pov, bot, ponb, hoho, potactics, potorment, and cod zones that most everyone who can reach level 65 can obtain.  <br />
<br />
I've read threads about guilds *gasp* working together with each other towards a common goal of getting flagged for the same zone.  Take Aerin'Dar for example.  If you have 2 or 3 guilds capable of downing Vindy/Stachoo/Tmax without any difficulties, they shouldn't really have problems killing Aerin'dar if they combine forces for a common goal.  Sure, it may take a few more tries since the guildmembers aren't that used to working with each other or in such a large force, but if it gets the goal accomplished, why not do that?  I just read another thread today where someone was leading a raid on Grummus and got around 200 people flagged for CoD by inviting them all into the raid that got the kill so they could get the flag too.  Ya, it's a hell of a zerg, but the guy was working to get as many other people flagged as he could.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
POP is about working TOGETHER.  POP isn't about splitting up guilds.  Guilds that are ready to fall apart will do so on their own.  Guilds with strong cohesion will stay healthy in POP.</div></div><hr />

If I remember correctly, I have read threads on this board that state that many shaman are having problems passing the trials or even getting into trials groups.<br />

So ... is the use of the word 'everyone' incorrect, or are some people classed as non-persons?<br />

<br />
You are right that advancement is possible, and obviously PoP has a lot of good things going for it.<br />
<br />
But hasn't the point been clearly made?  For some PoP is wonderful; for many, PoP is not.  The folks who think PoP is wonderful need to stop calling all the people who have problems with PoP &quot;losers, whiners, vultures, dead weight, teh suck, lazy&quot; or whatever term flying about.  <br />
<br />
I'm very tired of this BS handed down by folks who get stuff constantly spoon-fed to them - and then /feedback to remove the drops they've had the benefit of getting!  <br />
<br />
There are problems with PoP's implementation for too many people.  Eventually, even the successful guilds in PoP will need new people, and they'll start bitching more and more about it too.  <br />
<br />
Those whines, of course, will have more merit then.  Why I'm not exactly sure, but I imagine it will be a wholly different ballgame then for some strange reason.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Blarg came her to bitch about POP.  There are many people that agree with what he said.  It's nothing what I've seen POP to be for me and the guild I'm in.  It just felt like there was too much &quot;I can't get flagged.  I can't do this.  I can't go there&quot;.  Few people express any problems with getting them and their friends/guild flagged for things.  Funny that.<br />
<br />
As for the trial of execution, put together this group of level 60+ characters, and you should succeed on next try:<br />
spot 1:  Main healer.  Should be cleric or druid<br />
spot 2:  Backup healer/nuker.  I play a shaman and fill this spot.  Could be druid or cleric.<br />
spot 3:  Main tank.  I've had a monk in this spot, but you want a class that can taunt.<br />
spot 4:  Magician or druid or necromancer or wizard.  This is your high DPS group slot.  Magicians are best since they can banish.  Druids can also banish.  Necro can't banish, but have high DPS regardless.  You also want to be able to nuke down a mob really fast if executioner is about to kill prisoner.<br />
spot 5:  See spot 4<br />
spot 6:  Whoever you want in the group.  If you have a magician in slot 4 and 5, you can probably do the poj execution trial with only 5 group members.  If you are having a problem flagging someone, stick them in this slot to act as a 3rd main damage dealer.<br />
<br />
Don't do poj trial pickup groups.  Bring your own handpicked group out of the friends you have, go in there, and pass it the first time.  That's what I've done for friends needing flagging the last 5 or 6 times I've gone through it.</div></div><hr />

Sure, it brings people together, but it sures drives them apart too (flagged people telling in /gu how great XP PoV is while other cobnstantly whine about not being flagged and want help again and again). Did you ever think about new recruits for the non-high end guilds? I can tell you that 75% of our new recruits isnt flagged for anything in PoP .. so you have to do it again for each one of those. Or you wait till you have more .. but then many people cannot raid those new places with us.<br />

4.   &quot;We now have it in PoP with the flags.&quot;    Ahem, this takes everything learned by the Dev team above and multiple it by a factor of 10.  Time sinks, Flags, and new and improved Bottlenecks (and c0ckblocking) ... the Dev team is just expanding along the lines of previous expansions.  Call it whatever ... but they are increasing difficulty along linear lines.  It is hard by design ... and intended audience is the power guilds ... PoP content are not intended for the causal or solo player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Styg, the VP analogy might work if you needed a VP key to get to any Kunark zone with 45+ mobs in it and at the same time they changed the xp progression so that old world mobs were worthless xp for 55+ characters.<br />
<br />
VP was one zone.  VT was one zone.  In PoP, the majority of the expansion is practically un-enterable for a non-raiding player.<br />
<br />
PoP is great for me and for my guild.  It is horrible for the (many) lvl 65 players that I know who haven't been and aren't interested in becoming full-time raiders.  Those people are for the most part trapped in Dreadlands of Valor and a couple other horrifically boring zones, and I see them logging in less and less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Thanks for a well written post, Blarg. <br />
<br />
About the only thing I disagree with is the people implying that SoE did this on purpose in the hopes of getting people to move on to EQ2 or SWG. No company is stupid enough to piss of customers on purpose in the hopes that they'll get their money again when they sell a new product to those same pissed off customers. <br />
<br />
I think the developers just screwed up, and from what I've read of the new expansion they don't see it. <br />
<br />
I'm looking at it from the perspective of someone who's relatively high level but doesn't like to raid. I find anything that take more than 2 or 3 groups extremely boring and the potential for phat loot doesn't appeal enough to me to make it worthwhile. I'm lvl 61 (not leveling atm) and in a casual guild so I might raid once or twice a week. <br />
<br />
My problem in grouping atm is that I have to decide who I'm gonna group with on any given night. Either my friends who are 63+ and playing in the higher tier zones or those that are still in their high 50s, maybe unguilded, or just don't have the time due to RL to commit to getting flagged. Being a shaman, I can't exactly help people out a lot with even PoV/S flaggs other than 'I'll buff you before you go in'. <br />
<br />
The people I know that leveled to 65 and aren't in uber guilds are bored, or as one put it &quot;the only fun thing in EQ right now is going back to the old world and playing in God Mode&quot;. <br />
<br />
The people who aren't 60 yet are feeling left out and pressured into leveling so they can catch up with their friends. <br />
<br />
The ones that are around 60th lvl are debating whether it's even worthwhile to level any higher. Not exactly a choice that people should be debating in an RPG. <br />
<br />
About the only ones I know that are happy with the expansion are friends that are in serious uber-guilds. <br />
<br />
It's too bad really, there's a lot of things to like about PoP. Just to name two things, I like the pacing of the combat and the fact that 2-boxing has become pretty much a thing of the past because people actually have to pay attention to what's going. <br />
<br />
On the flip side, I honestly think that the only way they could fix PoP for the casual players is if they opened tier 1-3 planes to everyone. Yeah, I know that isn't gonna happen. <br />
<br />
I'm not even saying that I'd have a lot of trouble getting flagged for all those zones, it more along the lines of 'why in the hell should I bother when I know that most of the people that I group with won't have those flags within the next few months'. And from where I'm sitting right now, I won't be in EQ in 6 months. Even now, I'm operating too much on inertia and I just don't see them changing things to actually make me sit up and get interested again. We'll see, I'll give SoE till this summer and the next expansion but atm my gaming time is getting used up more and more by games that _aren't_ EQ. <br />
<br />
Shrug, maybe it's just time to move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I think that for once BlargX made an excellent post, however, there is an underlining problem that many have touched but not yet fully explored.<br />
<br />
Every expansion before PoP was geared towards the individual, or a collection of individuals under the loose organization of a guild tag. PoP is an expasion unlike any other because it is an expasion for well organized guild--guilds that has a strong leadership able to set goals and motivate it's members as well as members who are willing to sacrafice their time online to help each other.<br />
<br />
As Chuk mentioned, it is easy to see that PoP was designed to pull people together, to make them work as a team more closely than ever. I think it's safe to say that this design is flawed. This design has ultimately failed to achieve it's goal for many EQ players, not because they are selfish freeloaders, but simply because their play style does not fit the design.<br />
<br />
As Blarg's posts suggested, although he may not have intended it that way, he was in a guild without a focus and where the membership as a whole did not seem to have realized that the only way for a guild to progress in PoP and not be pulled apart is by helping EVERY single member, not just a select few.<br />
<br />
PoP has presented my guild with these issues in early release, and we were confused for a while also, until we realized what we needed to do. It wasn't easy for us as a large guild full of players from many time zones, both hard core and casual. We'd kill Emp one week, and the next week we might have a completely different raid force when we kill him again. PoP is pain stakingly slow for us to get everyone flagged, but you know what? Everyone WILL be flagged. <br />
<br />
There is a commitment one makes when one joins a guild, and one has a responsibility as well as personal interest to carry out that commitment to see all of your fellow members flagged. When a guild lose sight of that, then the biggest problem for that guild comes from within. PoP is just a catalyst.<br />
<br />
PoP is a guild effort--the days of a core group of raider carrying a guild is gone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is a pity. That's how my guild is, really, there's a hard core group of us who are always on during raid nights, and together, we can do just about anything we want.... then we get about 5-20 others, who may or may not be there.<br />
<br />
I can't make those 20 others become hard core raids. I can't kick them out of the guild for failure. So where does that leave our guild? Nowhere... if I want to go further in PoP, I'll have to leave my decent guild to join one of the 3 uberguilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I didn't read all the threads, that's my first disclaimer.<br />
<br />
What I've noticed about POP.  PoP has destroyed several guilds.  Basically you have a situation where people think that level alone entitles them to reach end game content.  Therefore they get to skip all the other content because of their level.  <br />
<br />
Here's what I think.  Hence the term endgame.  Means the last of the content.  Means you have to do all the other content as well.  POP has made this obvious whereas it wasn't so in previous expansions.  Easy-to-access pop content doesn't hold loot.  In fact, as my guild just now enters elemental planes we've yet to find much loot that is better than ssra and vexthall.  (of course only about half of us have elemental planes access and we've yet to field a fullscale raid there, we are hoping the loot will be &gt; Vex Thall)<br />
<br />
Pop was an expansion unlike any other expansion.  In other expansions gear was easily attaintable.  In pop the only thing easy to get is experience.  In Pop experience is just not enough to progress. <br />
<br />
So how does the midteir guild progess in the game and ulitmately in pop?  By getting levels and aa's and  etheral and a few spectural spells and tackling and farming older content and a much quicker rate and gearing themselves up for it.  <br />
<br />
The inherant flaw in this design is that no one wants to work towards the goals anymore.  They want it all and they want it all now.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I like that  someone can't start playing today, powerlevel themselves to 65 because xp is so much easier to come  by and have access to the end game, skipping 90% of the content out there.<br />
<br />
Pop forces you to experience old content by not handing out uber loot easily.  Pop gives you the tools to make this older content much easier than it was in older expansions.  <br />
<br />
Pop is essentially raid content for uber guilds, its end game.  That's the way I think it should be.  But pop also makes it easier to gear up with older content and reach the goals.  Pop doesn't hold much for the casual player, but the casual player has 4 other expansions to dink around in, without the uberguilds getting in their way.<br />
<br />
SOE had to make a way to keep people using old content rather than all concentrating and fighting over a few new zones, to spread out the population.  Pop has acheived that.<br />
<br />
While timesinks and bottlenecks suck totally.  The game has far better rewards when you've actually worked towards a goal rather than having it handed to you on a silver platter.  Which is exactly what mudflation caused with older expansions in the past.<br />
<br />
Now, a few more inherant problems with the system, basically deals with the revolving doors alot of guilds have, and this situation has increased with pop.  <br />
<br />
I was in a guild before my previous one, that most of the players had been around in the same guild since the server started.  We could progress at a quick rate because we didn't have to concentrate on gearing up new recruits, we didn't have them, we didn't change our roster much.  We all progressed togethor and didn't have to do much back farming.  Then after a couple years, people started to retire and content got harder requiring more bodies.  We had to recruit to make up for lost people and to beef up our small roster in order to progress at all.  This was the beginnning of the downfall of the guild.  Now we have to spend more time farming content, we had to go back and get epics and kunark spells, we had to farm quest armor and primal again.  Those of us who already did it umpteen times hated it.  Older players who'd been there and done that were bored, got restless didn't want to farm, they wanted to move on.  Now pop gets released, the guild still hasnt' done ssra.  The guild gets split thinking it can tackle pop without the timesink of luclin.  But its a rude awakaning when nothing much gets accomplished at all, and for the first time, the guild has alot of people leave for other guilds.<br />
<br />
So the inherant flaw in pop for the midteir guilds is that it means those who have stuck around farming old content for eons and have yet to tackle and farm luclin, still have to stick around and farm and tackle luclin, if they wish to progress their guild in any form in POP.  Punishes the few who wish to build their guild rather than all migrating and riding on the coattails of the uberguilds, yet aren't new to the game,  by sentencing them to repeat old content ad naseum.  While at the same time, dealing with the lure of the shiny new content in POP and plugging away at building on content they've experienced for years.  The only consolation is that with mudflation of levels and spells, this farming process can progress much quicker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I'm putting money on the fact that Plane of Time isnt properly itemized and even if it is, they are all 250+ tradeskill drops for stuff barely better than Vex loot.  Vex wasn't even properly itemized when PoP came out.  They were constantly creating or recreating items that were the dreaded cloth cap.  The &quot;hope&quot; for good loot is what keeps the child playing but I doubt that it will be any better for them in the end or until its &quot;retuned&quot;.  I dont see the VP key as a timesink.  It really wasn't bad at all.  <br />
<br />
I think timesinks became a viable option for the developers to put into the game so that they can release a product and finish it later.  I think the Sleeper incident started this, and Luclin proves it.  The Sleeper was awakened way before the devs were ready and because of it, they had to completely revamp the zone.  Waste of time and money for a good idea that may have worked.  They somewhat prevented this from happening again in such a dramatic way with the Vex key timesink.  It gave the devs time to see a deadline on when players would be entering the content.<br />
<br />
I think the keys in PoP are a good way to keep track of your players in the new content and how far they have gotten.  This way they can prioritize what zones have to be finished and itemized correctly within an alotted timeframe.  The unfinished boss mobs and their loot tables suggest that they did indeed provide a very unfinished product in PoP.  Its like a programming yarnball that keeps getting bigger.<br />
<br />
Read the top guilds message boards and you'll see posts about how bad the loot sucks or how the zones are crashing when scripts run.  They of course get somewhat fixed but only when the guild gets there.  Then after the fix, they have to error trap the scripts so that &quot;cockblocking&quot; is lessened.<br />
<br />
It keeps going and going and going.  Everquest.</div></div><hr />

I have talked with him/her several times via server tells, and our guilds are virtually the same. We have 5-10 people online consistently between guild and friends. Those people are always there.

There is a constant feeling of someone being left behind, or worse yet, catching someone up. I may be the only one, but i do not find the trials fun. They suck. They are tedious, and boring. And to have to wait 30 mins when someone ahead of you wins, arg. <br />
<br />
I agree with alot of what BlargX says. I can see how it can tear guilds apart little by little. I am fortunate, the guild i belong to are all very close real life friends in one way or another. It makes things much easier to deal with. However, i do agree that the bottlenecks are getting silly. I am disappointed that there are zones i probably will never see because of the nature of how PoP progression works, but i am happy with what i have thus far. It doesnt mean i wont stop trying to move forward.</div></div><hr />

Realize a few things.... <br />

1) They do not care about your opinion.<br />
<br />
2) They manipulate all players by nerfing content and then using your previous enjoyment to sell it back to you in a &quot;new expansion&quot;<br />
<br />
3)They manipulate the player base by playing one off on the other. This way they can avoid most criticism. <br />

Lastly) If you can accept these 3 things, then keep playing and have a nice day. If you don't accept these things and keep playing, then your are fighting a loosing cause, and are truely hopeless. <br />

<br />
Being Chuk's guildmate I thought it only fair that I comment on the post in general and try to help Landoragon understand his and my point of view. Looking at your profile I would guess your guild is working ToV at this time. It's a great zone that you can walk right into. Who wouldn't do just that over keying for a uber boss mobs that require time and orginization to kill. It's a free zone that anyone can walk into. Chuk and I have served our time there when guilds wouldn't dare step out of the halls of testing.<br />

Sorry for the gratuitous flame, but anyone who posts **** like that deserves it. Blarg's post eloquently (as usual) summed up the Mother of all Frustrations that is the PoP expansion for a good 80% of all high level people that play EQ. <br />
<br />
If Blarg posted eloquently that you are whining about content you are not ready for I imagine you would flame him in the same manner as you did Chuk. You have a choice on passing go and collecting 200 bucks. Do it or don't. <br />
<br />
If Chuk can't understand the experiences of a good 60% of about 400,000 people, even when they are painstakingly laid out before him in clear Queen's English, one has to wonder if he's qualified to do more than sit there in front of his keyboard and mash the &quot;I'm uber!&quot; hotkey <br />
<br />
I would like to know where you get your 60% of 400,000 people and how one post represents the general population's point of view. It cracks me up when random %s are thrown out. Something like &quot;the majority of people are upset with content and progression&quot; would make you sound more intelligent. And that would probably be a true statement as far as PoP is concerned. You might be a master of Queen's English but you lack in grammer, punctuation and basic sentence structure. Sorry, couldn't resist the cheap on that one. :)<br />

My post count may not indicate uber status on the board but I have been reading it since it's inception. Everyone is entitled to there opinion but to discount our views on the highest of the end game is hypocrisy.

It seems like both are treated with little to no respect. <br />

PoP killed the game for my guild.  Around 30 accounts, so that's 300 bucks a month less that they get.  A drop in the bucket, but a lot of people feel this way.<br />
<br />
PoP comes down to one simple problem:  The content is artifically slow.  It isn't a matter of having the right classes/knowledge to get to a place in the zone to fight.  It is a matter of sitting around until you smell worse than catass camping whatever item it is that is needed to complete the key quest.<br />
<br />
Right up until you finish the PoJ trials PoP is kind of fun, after that it is a pile of bull****.<br />

Just don't listen to what Stumbly says, he's always drunk. Or high. Or both!<br />
<br />
The trials.... there's a waitlist for them. Six or seven groups long. Then group after group wins... and the list grows longer.... 30 minutes wait each time....<br />
<br />
This is why people don't want to do the trials again. It's not like the HS key where I swoop people in, kill xalgoz, and we walk out. It's a - hey, would you mind waiting all day for me in a zone where you can't even xp cause you'd loose our place in line? - request.<br />
<br />
And it's a lot to ask of someone over and over.<br />
<br />
And then there's gem costs for banishes. Some druids in my guild have spent over 4k on star rubies just for trials. Do they get paid back? No.  I bought the star rubies for my trial group. I feel that's fair.<br />
<br />
I'm dreading the hedge fight. 2 hour respawn wait, 18 people at a time... but which 18 get to go? who sits out? how do you get 10 people to do it a second time for the other 8? What about when there aren't 18 people on? Sigh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm also sure this stuff has been rehashed time and time again, so I'll try to keep it short.<br />
<br />
I took a semester's break from EQ last year, and even now I hardly play anymore. Can't really say it's because of PoP that I lost most interest since I had temporarily quit 2 months prior to its release.<br />
<br />
But if there's something you gotta understand, EQ has had its glory days. I had fun while it lasted, and even now every once in a while to fill in the gaps of intense boredom.<br />
<br />
Also finally obtained my PoM boots last week, so in a ways, I feel really accomplished. Was a goal I had set out for myself in summer, and objective achieved.  <br />
<br />
Now time to take a cheesy example: Life. I'd like to go to all the hotspots in the world, meet fine honeys of all blends and spices, but hey not like that's gunna happen right?<br />
<br />
Different strokes for diff peeps, and a select few will have the opportunity to explore it all, but it don't mean you're gimped if you don't.<br />
<br />
And from what I gather on Solusek, all the &quot;ubers&quot; are rushing to the planes whilst other challenging non-PoP zones are often open house. Even the medium tier guilds are opting for the mini-PoP bosses nowadays, but what I don't understand is the mentality of some to constantly strive for the best, the unobtainable which can only be rendered obtainable if they sacrifice RL time and tons of it to achieve their goal.<br />
<br />
Like in any game, competition should always be present, but to a healthy degree. To this day, still find myself drooling over new godly loot, but at the same time, I find myself spitting on peeps who think they're Veeshan's gift on Norrath simply because they can afford to fry their neurons at a faster pace than me.<br />
<br />
Always nice to have a dream, that's what you keeps you playing, but keep it realistic.<br />
<br />
As for the actual levelling, I've managed to get 50% into 61 pretty easily, but don't think I wanna rush it considering I have yet quite a few AA to amass. Sure, to see your name on /w all 65 shaman list feels all tingly inside since people notice it from any given zone (as opposed to a mere title someone has to be right in front of you to see), but I've found too many people have fallen victim to eye candy and delluding themselves they've reached a visual high.<br />
<br />
I'm extremly glad that upon my return I finally managed to obtain quickbuff 3, can't imagine life without now. Spirit Call also comes in pretty useful at times.<br />
<br />
And since I spend most of what little time I have on EQ these days soloing in Mischief, I've found it wise to stay at my current level, else the level 56-60 mobs are gunna net me much less exp.<br />
<br />
As for the flags and the level of difficulty in obtaining them, guilty of gross ignorance in that respect, so can't really talk. But I'll repeat what I mentionned above: Different strokes for diff peeps. Some guilds are so closely knit/uber they can easily supply all their members. More power to you, but even in EQ life is most often not a bed a of roses, and conflicts will arise. Conflict in schedule, conflict in numbers, conflict in playtimes, conflict in personalities, you name it, but it's not because a guild is incapable of flagging everyone that it is necessarily a bad guild.<br />
<br />
Time is a scarce commodity, and for the hardcore gamers, maybe not as much so, but is it so hard to understand the fact that the flagging process can often be out of your hands no matter how much effort you pour in to helping others out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Celestin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Sure the trials are tough, but frankly there's alot of undergeared and experienced folks trying to go through them.  Rather than bash their head against the wall (like they have been, 10-20 times in a row and getting mad about it) they would have been MUCH better served doing two things.<br />
<br />
First, going and getting a level or two (think 62 or 63 - not 55 or 56 - which makes a HUGE difference assuming you can get a key spell or two.)  Second, go get a few items (silly stuff like the 8.3k horse are enough to make the difference because folks are coming within a spell cast or two of succeeding, yet failing 20 times in a row instead.)<br />
<br />
Yet for some reason people continue to crash themselves onto the rocks because they hear the siren's call of PoV/PoS (etc.).  My guild has done this both ways, ad hoc groups (partially guild and/or pickup) and guild organized things.  Both have been successful, so pick your posion both can work provided both you and your friends have also done what's needed for all y'all to suceed.<br />
<br />
Fundamentally, the biggest problem with PoP for my guild and EQ for that matter - IMO - is the fact that we can't control the schedule of when we do something.  We're mid-tier guild with a core of hard core and casual gamer capable of doing stuff, but we just can't get to the stuff fast enough to do it.  With the levels and AXP from PoP, it's just a matter of time before single digit numbers of folks start taking down things like Tormax and NToV dragons - and don't think that they won't, because they still drop good loot.<br />
<br />
I'm sure my guild will eventually sort through this stuff and get our shot at stuff, but DAMN IT I really wish that every damn last PoP Trial/Flag/Whatever was on a timer similar to the PoJ Trials.  I I have NO idea how the hell we're going to get a shot at Terris Thule, just for example, given the backlog of ubers and other mid-tier guilds on my server.<br />
<br />
The thing that I wish SOE would do more than anything else for my (and IMO my guild's) personal enjoyment of EQ would be to do the following:<br />
<br />
1. Put every damn last mob of significance (Lord Bob on up) in RoK, SoV, LoK, Old World, etc etc, on a MAX 6 hour respawn timer.<br />
<br />
2. Put every damn last key/flag mob on a MAX 3 hour respawn timer.<br />
<br />
3. Give guilds some way to trigger ANY damn mob in the game AT WILL whenever we want - proportial to the activities of the guild.<br />
<br />
Who gives a damn if ST keys go into the world at 2-3x their normal rate?  It's a damn sight better than people leaving because there's STILL intense competition for the easier ST key dropping mobs.  Pick any damn item in the game - same logic applies.  Throw us a fricking bone here - there's so much content that even my relatively advanced mid-tier guild hasn't experienced, through no fault of our own!<br />
<br />
Who gives a damn if folks get flagged without having to wait for days and weeks and months for exactly the right mix of folks to be on, for the darn trigger/flag mob to be up, and for the divine intervention to occur that a mid-tier guild manages to actually win a PoP flag event the first time through.  Look at the Hedge Row trial for an example of a good, fits in the game fiction, way to do this and replicate it everywhere.<br />
<br />
Giving control to guilds WHEN any given thing - of the guild's choosing - happens would be an enourmous boon.  It's a damn trivial system to implement - for every mob you get exp for your guild gets X points (based on level, zone, whatever.)  To trigger a given mob, it would take Y points (e.g. 150k points to make King Tormax show the hell up at 3:45PM Saturday Afternoon 1/25/03) so we could greet them with a full guild force.  We could plan it ahead of time and arrange our lives so that we could have some fun based on when WE wanted to have fun not when some fricking RNG in a box someplace decided it would be possible.<br />
<br />
Blargx,<br />
<br />
Frankly I think the fate of your guild would have been alot different had access to this stuff seemed alot more reasonable and less absolutely contrived.  I agree wholeheartedly with that.  I see this happening ALOT as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Hate doing this, but I want to still post a couple things on the thread, which apparently is busted tonight.  So I created a Part II.<br />
_________________________________________<br />
<br />
Er, Juujuu --<br />
<br />
1) I came here to &quot;bitch&quot;?<br />
<br />
Pretty thoughtless.  I came here to express my opinion that the game design in the last expansion was flawed, and that bottlenecks, especially consecutive, interdependent ones, will naturally and predictably cause problems -- problems that Sony should have been able to foresee a little better.   And even defections from the game at a much more rapid pace than I think they're prepared for.  <br />
<br />
That's stating an idea.  Not bitching.  <br />
<br />
You are entitled to disagree with any idea, just like I am.  Which has nothing to do with either of us &quot;bitching.&quot;  Pretty thoughtless.<br />
<br />
2)  &quot;Few people express any problems&quot;?  Uh, I think you have a short memory.  In this very thread there are people acknowledging and expressing problems.  As there are in many threads.  What's your problem on that one?  I think maybe you are suffering from wearing blinders.  Your note that &quot;It's nothing what I've seen POP to be for me and the guild I'm in&quot; must somehow be related to your selective memory.  If you have a desire to negate anyone's experiences outside your own EVEN WHILE THEY ARE EXPRESSING THEM IN THIS VERY THREAD, you can hardly call yourself perceptive.  Or even present.<br />
<br />
3)  As to &quot;&quot;I can't get flagged. I can't do this. I can't go there,&quot; don't try to dodge the issues by making ad hominem guesses and being an amateur psychologist.  There's nothing I expressed about the problems I see that doesn't stand up perfectly well to criticism ON ITS MERITS, not on sneaking sideways around them and taking potshots at the person who holds ideas you don't like rather than the ideas themselves.  If my quote directly above from you is what you gained from the posting I and others have done, you are walking into the arguments too clouded with prejudice to deal with them properly.  Just try to address them, or don't.  The diversion into speculations about motivations is pointless and uninteresting; and it's a dead end.<br />
<br />
I will note that as far as trials go, many have noted what I have seen too -- shamans are one of the last classes picked for trials.  I've been flagged for quite a while myself, but feel kind of lucky.  Mostly what people want from shamans in the trials area are free buffs, not another super-low DPS guy with crappy heals against mobs that are pointless to slow.  Did it bug me when I found it hard to get flagged at first?  Sure.  Who wouldn't it bug?  A little empathy is always possible, and almost never painful.  It can even have a lot to do with actually understanding things.<br />
_________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Stygiana -- your reading was sloppy and lazy, and therefore your response was misguided.  My original post was not unclear.<br />
<br />
My post was quite clearly about BOTH the limitations of PoP by virtue of its design AND the limitations people likely encounter in it just by virtue of human nature.  These two ideas are quite comprehensible.  By the way, who but people exactly are you expecting to encounter these limitations?  The family poodle?  <br />
<br />
I don't blame the expansion entirely for the problems with the expansion, but as I have noted, not for the first time in this thread, the natural human tendencies resulting from the design of PoP were very predictable.  And I find the lack of foresight in the design of this expansion to be a serious mistake by the designers.  <br />
<br />
I was the first person I know predicting it, but more and more people are probably going to regret racing to 65.  Not my problem, by the way, so not my limitation.  Neither is getting a lot of these flags -- it's quite possible to make an argument that isn't entirely in lockstep with one's individual situation.  And guild problems because of all the bottlenecks were entirely predictable.  <br />
<br />
Making a whole expansion based on bottlenecks was very predictably going to magnify the problems the problems encountered by people getting keys to VP or Emperor or Vex Thal.  Your saying it's the same is an astounding lack of insight.  Getting keys to those places is trivial compared to getting flagged for many, many people.  I think it's fair to say most.  Don't you?  If you don't, I think you're vastly mistaken.  I don't need 30 or 50 or whatever number people to camp for a Vex Thal key.  Nor do I need particularly good equipment.  I DO need that many to get flagged for PoP content.  And not just once, but over and over and over and over and over...and god forbid I go linkdead in the middle of anything!<br />
___________________________________<br />
<br />
I wish when people were argumentative they would actually stick to the issues a little more.  It's not fair to pretend to argue when you're really just skipping around and bringing up tangents or slinging insults or showing off your semester of psychology.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">&quot;...the casual player has 4 other expansions to dink around in, without the uberguilds getting in their way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not really.  The casual player is probably a numbnuts who rocketed to 65 ASAP without considering if he could ever do anything outside of POV/POS again.  And then found himself stymied.  He probably DID think he would magically gain access to...uh, heck if I know.<br />
<br />
The thing is, I think the boredom and dead end PoP has made the game for those people isn't impossible to fix, but it needs to be fixed VERY soon indeed.<br />
<br />
And contrary to a lot of the amateur Dr. Freud's around this board, I don't think the fix necessarily lies in making it any easier for people to get flagged.<br />
<br />
Sony's nerfing of experience so that a much smaller range of mobs could give 61 and up players experience was a big mistake, too, but things could go on profitably the way they are now if all the people haunting PoV/Pos and then logging off were simply given some new zones.  Heck, even lower level PoP zones are crap for 65's.<br />
<br />
The new expansion won't help, and I have no problem with mid-level players having more zones to mess around in, or being charged for the glorified patch it all seems to me to really be.<br />
<br />
But I think Sony banging out a new half-arsed, untested beta full of buggy zones that 65's can at least get some variety in and selling it to us in a real box will go a long way toward making the game worthwhile for average players, casual players, people in small or not-quite-there-yet guilds, etc.<br />
<br />
I've been thinking it's inevitable they do so, or the game will be in trouble.  That's one of my reasons for my original post.  I think the numbers of people playing EQ is probably dropping away much faster than most people think, and with SWG and other games coming out, those people will NOT be coming back.  How do we keep the trickle from becoming a hemorrhage?<br />
<br />
I worry that if future expansions are built along the lines of PoP, they will be a complete waste of time, and basically seal EQ's fate, leaving it in the hands of the hard core nutcases, much as happened in Diablo I, when there was so much cheating and PK'ing going on that only the real mental cases stayed on after a while.  Sure, the ubers will be here, because they by and large are extremely dedicated players with a lot of time, and don't face the limitations I'm talking about, and rarely have faced anything like them -- though they will have to take pains to get stragglers flagged, too, and eventually find people ever harder to replace.  A lot of ubers seem incredibly unable to see past the noses on their own faces though, and are probably assuming and will continue to assume that everything regarding the game is more or less perfect, always has been, and always will be.<br />
<br />
But for the regular joes, including the ubers who actually have two feet planted on the ground, the future of the game may well lie in the next expansion(after our upcoming downloadable one).  It is the only thing that will keep a lot of us paying our money and/or enjoying the game.<br />
<br />
If it doesn't come quickly, the game is going to be in trouble for many people -- maybe most.  This cannot be good for Sony or for anyone in the game.<br />
<br />
If it repeats the design decision of turning everything into bottlenecks and at the same time giving people who can't pass through the eye of the needle no place to hang around but one or two bland zones, that will take a game that has a chance to come through a serious design flaw and still wind up more or less sorta whole and turn it into a fairly lost cause for all but an ever dwindling minority of ubers and the most very casual of players.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the flagging business, or never seeing however many zones PoP has.  If it had 200 more, I wouldn't mind not seeing those either, or any of the loot that goes with them.  I've always believed that you should expect to and have to go through Vex Thal before you get into PoP -- though quite a few people haven't and don't.  But, like most people, I do want to see SOMETHING more.  And I'm not even in a bad state yet; I'm not 65.  I leveled to 61 to get a dog to help me PL my twink faster; I'm two deaths away from 60, and will hop back down there again when my twink hits 60 too.  I'm in no hurry, and don't feel the game owes me flags.<br />
<br />
However, I see a LOT of people LFG in POV/POS.  It's only going to get worse.  Worse than that, a lot of the people who are not LFG are people who either logged off after trying or aren't bothering to log in nearly as much as they used to.  I can certainly see that with a number of people I know.  They need somewhere to go.  I pity a 65 class, unable to solo, with nowhere to go, trying to stay entertained somehow in PoV/POS for years.  Not gonna happen -- it will be a lost account, and for some people, a lost friend.  Which tends to cause a chain reaction, and anyway contributes nothing to the game's fun or durability.<br />
<br />
If the designers don't realize that the next &quot;real&quot; expansion must come quickly and must NOT be a repeated attempt to create interlocking bottlenecks, it will be bad news for the game, and, perhaps sooner rather than later, everyone in it.  <br />
<br />
Even, eventually, those so snug and high in the game's hierarchy that they find it difficult to conceive that any possible problems could ever exist for anyone except contemptible and/or deluded people who at any rate deserve any difficulties they encounter, and shouldn't ever dare venture the outrage of mentioning them -- just continue to shell out the bucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Ahh eloquence, thy name is Blargx by any other.<br />
<br />
I do wish to respectfully disagree with a couple of points:<br />
<br />
 How do we keep the trickle from becoming a hemorrhage? <br />
<br />
It's not your responsibility. Much the way the VI &quot;monkey coders&quot; (to use Zorlac's PC term) used to whine that &quot;the players are missing out on a great story&quot; I feel it is SOE's responsiblity to: a) tell that story that 375,000 (this was pre-Velious iirc) are missing and b) keep the game interesting for all.<br />
<br />
Harken back to your D &amp; D days - if the campaign was boring - people found other things to do.<br />
<br />
If the game doesn't have a hold - people will not log on.<br />
<br />
 dwindling minority of ubers and the most very casual of players <br />
<br />
Zorlac said it best - 95% of the player base (ie the casual to slightly non-casual) pay the way for the 5% who play all the time.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
One day the servers will be turned off. Maybe not all at once, but the first inkling of BIG time trouble is the meshing of two servers into one.  If SoE / VI has proven anything - they are about the bottom line.  The day that Xev and say Venril Sathir are combined into one server, EQ's days are numbered.<br />
<br />
I like the trials - I think they're challenging in a way, very frustrating. I kinda wish that once you passed and entered PoV / POS you were STUCK there. :)  And couldn't come back. :)<br />
<br />
Oh and Blargx - your observations so many weeks ago re 60 + AA's v 65 were right on the money. For me as a frustrated powergamer, was an enlightening read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Hmm.  Can't reply to that other thread for some reason.  Keeps timing out....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lots of people are complaining about not seeing certain mobs up, or not being able to take down the targets they want to.  There's competition out there.  You can't expect to get everything you want all the time.  Here's some of the things you might want to try doing to further advance yourselves:<br />
<br />
1.  Keep track of when raid targets die that you are interested in doing.  Their spawn times are predictable enough that if you know what day something died, you can plan to raid it in a few days when it repops.  The velious royalty is 3 days.  ToV named are weekly spawns.  I'm not sure the spawn time of PoP named but I think they are 3-5 days.  Etc.<br />
<br />
2.  Based off #1, put together a weekly raid plan for the guild.  For example, my guild might have something like:<br />
monday grummus/TT flags<br />
tuesday xp day<br />
wednesday-friday VT<br />
Saturday xp day<br />
Sunday Ssra farming/burrower/whatever else is up<br />
We know what targets we are shooting for on certain days.  If you can make it, great.  If you can't, we'll still be raiding them again in the future.  As it is, you have a fair amount of advance notice of when certain key targets are going to be hit like VT and POP flagging, and when lesser targets like Ssra farming etc are being hit.  In the past our schedule was similar, but lower difficulty stuff as we were gearing up.  We knew roughly when the Velious Royalty would spawn, when the Arch Lich and XTC were up in Ssra, and when we could go to NToV.   Apply this to your guild as appropriate for raid targets.<br />
<br />
3.  Put forth a real effort in getting advancement for everyone in the guild, and express that it should be a priority for everyone in the guild.  Guilds that succeed are collections of people that work well together and watch out for each other.  If someone is having problems getting flagged for pov/s, then gather up the &quot;ideal group&quot; for the trial of execution and blow through that flag in 1 try.  If someone is needing help in doing the 8th shawl protection walkalong, then get out of doing xp and go help that person.  You can go get xp any time.  You can't always get the people to raid with you or do flags or quests at all hours of the day, so when the people are available then go do the important stuff.<br />
<br />
4.  Consider who your friends are out of guild.  Currently we have a small rivalry with another guild on Brell for hitting basicly all the same raid targets.  We both entered VT at roughly the same time.  They killed AHR about 2 or 3 weeks before we did for the first time.  I think they have access to hohob while we lack it.  But other than that, we are basicly on par.  Although we do have a rivalry, we do cooperate at times when we are doing flagging mobs or doing emperor (concerning powersources) etc.  If we have space on a flagging raid, and one of their guildies needs that flag, we won't refuse them access, since we know that they will reciprocate on their raids.<br />
Another thing you might want to do depending on the size of your guild, is to set up a temporary alliance to be able to hit raid targets above and beyond your solo means.  Suppose you have the people to take down Vindy, but Tmax is beyond your capabilities.  See if you know of some other guilds that are in a similar situation, and try working out a deal that you guys help each other take down tmax or other similar difficulty targets and split the loots.  Doing something like this will help you advance yourselves while still staying a small guild if that's what you want.<br />
<br />
5.  Consider recruiting more people.  My guild used to have an alliance for a good number of months, and many great things were done during that time, ranging from Velious Royal and NToV raids, all the way up to Burrower and VT raids.  When the alliance broke up, we lacked all the people we needed to continue with the same raids, so we started recruiting people moreso than we were before.  While we used to have about 30 people on for some raids, we now have about 50-70 people online for our raids, and are slowing down on recruiting.  We can raid whatever we want with the forces we now have.  If you don't have enough people to raid your targets of interest, you may need to start getting more people into your guild, or reevaluate your targets.<br />
<br />
POP is an expansion that's aimed for the high level EQ crowd.  I'm quite happy about this.  Luclin had a large diversity of target levels for it's zones.  It's nice that everyone can get enjoyment out of it, but for a lot of us, about half the expansion is a waste of zones.  For me, I only used the UP, VT, Ssra, FG, and Deep zones for hunting.  Besides Shadowhaven and Shar Vahl and the Nexus, the rest of the zones in the entire expansion are pretty much a waste of time for me.  They are just filler zones that are in the way of the place I'm bound, and the place I want to be hunting.  So ya, while I CAN access every zone in the expansion, I only functionally use about 25% of all the zones in the whole expansion.  Funny that.  That's about the same number of zones everyone STARTS with being able to access in POP, with the ability to vastly increase the number of usable zones.<br />
<br />
Kunark was designed for mostly single group hunting with a fair number of raid targets worth pursuing.<br />
Velious was designed for some single group hunting with large numbers of raid targets worth pursuing.<br />
Luclin was designed with roughly and even split between raid targets and single group targets.<br />
POP was designed with lots of single group hunting but also with large numbers of raid targets.<br />
Every zone I've been to in POP can have a single group hunting for xp in about 90% of it's content.  But, every zone also has it's own raid target(s) worth pursuing.  Pod has grummus, cod has bertox, torment has saryn, pon has hedge trial and other trials and named, pos has giant bosses, pov has aerin'dar, hoho has trials, poi has dragon and behemoth, bot has tower bosses, and aagnar, etc etc etc.  I personally find that wonderful, in that there are so many more raid targets now, that one can always be busy raiding if that's what they want to do.<br />
<br />
Bigger effort --&gt; bigger rewards.  Getting to level 65 is not effort, it's drudgery.  Getting your guild motivated to do all the flagging trials you need to be able to access the zones you want is effort.  The payoff is you get to go where you want and do what you want.  The payoff is access to better gear.  The payoff is better xp rates.  The payoff is being able to explore more places in game.  If you put in the effort, you get the payoff.  POP is not place for a slacker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">I didn't think that was a bitch.. people that think it is are just trying to make everyone think they're cooler than you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">1) I came here to &quot;bitch&quot;? <br />
<br />
Pretty thoughtless. I came here to express my opinion that the game design in the last expansion was flawed, and that bottlenecks, especially consecutive, interdependent ones, will naturally and predictably cause problems<br />
I saw an entire thread filled with people complaining that POP had some hurdles that need to be dealt with to get much more out of the expansion.  People are complaining about bottlenecks everywhere, which I don't see.  People are complaining about other guilds blowing spawns, which is something I do not see happening.  People are yelling that the sky is falling, when really it's just raining outside.  That's bitching to me.  Bitching is complaining without trying to find solutions to a problem.  People complain about not being able to pass the trials with random pickup groups, but nowhere do I see anyone suggest that you bring your own group of people that know how to pass the trial.   People complain that the lineup for the execution trial is hours long, but they are sheep and don't dare experiment with any of the other trials to see if they can pass the other ones with more ease.  I see people complain that they have to wait a full 2!!! hours to retry the hedge trial if they fail it, without even gathering the people together in the first place to try it the first time.  That's bitching, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
2) &quot;Few people express any problems&quot;? Uh, I think you have a short memory. <br />
HOLY MISQUOTING, BATMAN!  The FULL sentance is ...there was too much &quot;I can't get flagged. I can't do this. I can't go there&quot;. Few people express any problems with getting THEM and THEIR FRIENDS/GUILD flagged for things.  (emphasis added)<br />
I saw people complaining about their individual misfortune in getting trying to flagged.  I saw them complaining about not getting the stuff they THEMSELVES needed to get flagged.  I saw people complaing that their friends/guildmates got themselves flagged, and then left them for greener pastures.  Nowhere did I see anyone complaining about how their GUILD and FRIENDS were working TOGETHER to get flags, and how they were having problems.  POP isn't not about personal advancement.  POP is about advancement as a whole, whether that's your friends, or your guild.<br />
<br />
I will note that as far as trials go, many have noted what I have seen too -- shamans are one of the last classes picked for trials. <br />
I've had a good number of random tells from people asking if I can join their trial group to help them get flagged.  Shaman are incredibly important to a trial group, in the right group position.  Trial groups should have 2 healers, the main and backup.  Taking a shaman as the backup healer, since we can slow the boss, only makes too much sense.  Each person has their role in a group.  I've already posted what kind of group will rock the execution trial.  Reread my post in the other thread for more details.<br />
<br />
Did it bug me when I found it hard to get flagged at first? Sure. Who wouldn't it bug? A little empathy is always possible, and almost never painful. It can even have a lot to do with actually understanding things. <br />
I was unhappy I didn't get flagged in the few hours I spent with a pickup group at the time.  Instead of getting all worried about it, I talked to people that had passed the trial, and found what kind of group members they had, and evaluated what was keeping the attempts I was in from succeeding.  The next time I went, I brought my own group of people that I hand picked needing flagging, or willing to help out, and flew through the trial without any problems at all.  I didn't come to the boards bitching that the trials are too hard or anything like that.  I took a rational approach and evaluated the situation logicly, and took corrective measures.<br />
<br />
<br />
POP is about working together.  It's about helping out your friends and guildmembers to advance as a whole.  Your guild wasn't about that.  You had people that were just along for the ride.  You had people that got what they wanted and moved on without looking back at the &quot;friends&quot; that were left in the dust.  Of course your guild is going to break apart.  If POP didn't do that, actually working together to get Emp Keys, or VT keys would have done that, or jealousy over getting sleepers keys.<br />
We never seemed to push to get ready for the Emperor by farming bane weapons intensively, or by camping shards muchI held out hope that things were building to a point at which people would get seriousPoP made clear how splintered and undirected we wereSome people did the trials over and over and over again(after winning) and chortled and bragged about itthose who were getting all the loot and all the flags and generally ignoring everyone else, You look like you are trying to lay blame for your guild's breakup on POP being badly designed.  I'd lay blame on your guild's lack of unity.</div></div><hr />

Said guild decides to make some cash - so they offer temporary guild memberships for, I dunno, 10k a pop. The benefit of this membership is you get guild flagged to PoV and PoS.<br />

Unless you are the top guild on the foodchain on your server, you have many problems. You can't plan anything ahead, period. So all this plan your guild activity bullcrap is just doesn't hold. <br />
<br />
People in guilds number 2, 3 ... down to 10 ish play fairly often. BUT, the sum of many small frustrations eventually pisses them off to no end.<br />
- Mentally retarded lame races to content. Racing for content in PvP games is no problem. However, EQ is PvE. How would you like to turn on your TV at 7:05 and realize you can't watch you favorite show because your neighbour is already watching it? Sounds extremely retarded no? It does sound very stupid but ... welcome to the mid/endgame of Everquest.<br />
- Griefers. Again, has 0 effect or almost 0 effect on the top guild of the server. How many times was the Cursed cycle delayed on your server just so that a guild can get enough people there? How many times where HoH trials blown? How many mobs are c0ckblocked? How many times another guild trained yours? Another great source of frustration. Again, affects very marginally the top guild of the server.<br />
- Pop flags. The other day we had to turn down people for a raid. No HoHB flags. For the players who have jobs, families and /gasp don't spend ages in a video game and treat it what it should be: a hobby, this is another great source of frustration. Like poison DoTs, flags look great on paper. Unfortunately not in practice. Add to it the 2 points above, and you can't really plan anything ahead, you have to make sure that your family, job, RL is not a priority because you need this crucial flag. Again, the top guild of the server has no problem with this, for them there is almost 0 or negligable competition.<br />
- Left behind with flagging. People take breaks, people need breaks from EQ. When they come back, they are insanely held back. At least the Luclin method of flagging allowed them much more control in their own advancement. They didn't rely on guild to advance, they could advance in much smaller group but most importantly, they could catch up (minus Emperor rift) to the guild without having the guild kill mobs that yield no upgrades, are contested and are nothing more than a bad flagging system design.<br />
- Frustration with the class this person plays. The neverending AA treadmill, utter crap CS (if VI has a CS at all).<br />
<br />
Of course all of the above &quot;whines&quot; and &quot;bitchings&quot; don't affect people who are in the top guild or affect them very little at least. When the people who play semi casually get fed up, this game is over. Your local uberguild uses them as recruiting pool and your casual John Doe uses it as aspiration as one day being part of a raiding guild, a guild with semi casual players, not a guild that you have to be online 24h a day.<br />
<br />
PoP IS badly designed. You still have to race for content, you still get griefers, you still can c0ckblock and there are many spawns contested. If PoP or EQ for that matter would have been designed properly, VI wouldn't have allowed competition for content in a non PvP game. Also, if there was no competition for entertainment content, guilds could plan ahead their progression at their own pace and bottlenecks and timesinks won't be a source of frustration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Mastiquilas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">The bad thing about PoP (period) is many of the time sinks require large raid enounters.

POP is an expansion that's aimed for the high level EQ crowd.<br />
<br />
If that statement were true, we wouldn't be having these discussions. Pop is an expansion aimed at a certain subsection of the high level EQ crowd, but certainly not a majority of them. Pop is a nice expansion if you're in a dedicated (not necessarily uber) guild or if you don't mind tedious time-sicks to advance. At a guess, that's maybe 25% of the high end EQ players? <br />
<br />
Given how long EQ has been around, there's a lot of casual high level players these days. Before PoP, you could basically avoid time sinks if you felt like it and it didn't really affect how well your character advanced. At worst you lost out on most of the Phat loot (epics, shawl quest, ToV loot etc.) and one or two zones per expansion if you avoided the time-sinks but that was about it. <br />
<br />
Now PoP comes out and tedious timesinks have suddenly become required to advance your character. Not only that, the people you group with have to be just as dedicated. <br />
<br />
Your post on how to advance in PoP did a pretty good job of showing why I dislike the system so much; the fact that people have to jump through those kinds of hoops to advance. <br />
<br />
Juujuu wrote: <br />
Luclin had a large diversity of target levels for it's zones. It's nice that everyone can get enjoyment out of it, but for a lot of us, about half the expansion is a waste of zones. For me, I only used the UP, VT, Ssra, FG, and Deep zones for hunting. [snippage] So ya, while I CAN access every zone in the expansion, I only functionally use about 25% of all the zones in the whole expansion. <br />
<br />
So I take it you would have preferred that UP, VT, Ssra, FG, and Deep each required a guild raid or a 10 hour camp just to get access to the zone? <br />
<br />
I just don't see the logic in it and I think it's a mistake that you have to jump through those kinds of hoops just to get into exp zones. What exactly was the problem with the previous system where the toughness of the mobs determined where you could hunt? <br />
<br />
Somewhere in the whole flag process, it crosses the line from fun to tedious for me. Obviously the PoP designers agree with you and not me in this discussion, but that doesn't mean I won't call 'em misguided and out of touch with most of their player base for doing it.  ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">The flag system is really horrible. Having to redo all those raids just to bring a couple people up to being able to raid with the guild is terrible. It might be the worst timesink yet. <br />
<br />
You're also right about PoP being a disaster for the less than super-uber high levels. They shoot to 65 because it's not very hard, and then what? They're stuck in PoS/PoV, and MAYBE BoT for the rest of their EQ careers. There are only a handful of exp zones they can go to for the rest of the time they play EQ. So many of them won't play very much longer. <br />
<br />
Alternately, people can sit at L 60, but with as conditioned as people are to think that higher level = better, many of the people who do it will constantly be bothered by the fact that they are &quot;low level&quot; and won't enjoy game as much. They'll know they're not progressing nearly as fast as they could, and that'll take a lot of the fun out of what they are doing. <br />
<br />
Finally, there's all the people who leveled up from 60 BEFORE people knew that there would be almost nothing to do at L 65 unless you raid constantly. What do they do now? Sit in PoS and PoV as they get endlessly more crowded. <br />
<br />
They've jammed far too many people into far too small a number of zones, and it's only going to get worse if there aren't more L 65 exp zones, and quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Why would you feel they should be stay in PoV/PoS.<br />

These 2 examples show that with some dedication, planning and friends access to the tier 2/3 zones is within anyones reach.<br />

You have no idea the effort involved in those sorts of attempts - or the time.  50pp says you aren't an officer, that you haven't ever lead big raids and that you have no clue what you are talking about.  Even on those threads you couldn't resist dropping a little sneer.<br />
<br />
You get spoonfed the content of this expansion because it suits your playstyle perfectly.  Well, it doesn't suit a lot of folks, and that's a problem.  If you aren't capable of recognizing that, and why, then you are remarkably dense.  <br />
<br />
Ultimately it will become clear whether PoP was &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;.  If people quit, it was a bad idea for Sony.  If they don't, then it wasn't.  <br />
<br />
I know most folks in my guild, and others like us, are disgusted.  But then, yes, we are lazy, losers, whiners, dead weight, sucky players, we don't care about each other.....  That's all total horsesh*t of course, much like most of the crap sprewed by some folks here.<br />
<br />
I can't resist the irony that some are now calling for &quot;guild flags&quot; either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Dear Gart, Can you deliver those 50pp to the bank in PoK please.<br />
<br />
Once upon a time I was in a humble guild, so humble we needed an alliance to raid places like Hate and Fear.<br />
Once upon a time I saw that alliance break apart and since I liked the raiding game I decided to get people together and organize a few raids.<br />
Once upon a time I had 100+ people all wanting to go to Hate, sure this was before AA skills and before lvl 65.<br />
<br />
So yes I know the crap a raid leader gets, I know the loot whining, I know the bitching.<br />
<br />
So yes I know what it took them and as far as that sneer goes. Doing a mass raid with so many players makes DS a must as every raid leader who did pick up raids can tell you, the only thing that is sure is that people wont listen to you.<br />
<br />
And about my play style:<br />
<br />
I work 60+ hours a week and I race home daily to be able to be on time to join my guilds raids.<br />
The whole thing about people in decent guilds all have to be the ones with no job and plenty of free time is so wrong.<br />
<br />
Keep whining here and never go beyond PoV/PoS or start making things happen and then the sky is the limit. Choice is to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I played for 2 years solid, having a dandy time... was 60 and enjoyed it for months before PoP came out.  Never was interested in farming ssra, never wanted my VT key - these things didn't hamper the game for me.  I didn't need those things to play with the people I'd grown to know.<br />
<br />
But PoP didn't just block off a few raiding zones.  PoP locked players like me out of the exp zones that my friends (a lot of whom are powergamers) spend time in.  Sure, they can, and have, gone slumming in the ghetto planes to play with me.  I don't really get off on feeling like their charity case, though.  Now I'm leveling up some alts, because it's more fun than playing my lvl 61 shaman with 30-some AA.  <br />
<br />
Timesinks aren't fun for me.  This is a game.  I'm not interested in more work.  I get PAID for work, I don't pay to do it.<br />
<br />
So, the big difference in PoP?  Locking away exp zones, from what I can see.  Every once in a while I log on my shaman, try to find a group, try to find a group with good DPS so I can suggest we attempt a trial.  But the problem is... those 1st tier planes are like the Island of Misfit Toys these days.  The unguilded, the clueless, the under-leveled, and the casual player are all mashed into these 4 zones.  Trusting my fun to a pickup group of these is one helluva crap shoot.<br />
<br />
It's a brick wall.  It's not impossible, but for a player like me, the time and luck required will probably be more than I've got to spend.  I enjoyed this game, but seeing my prized shaman brought to a complete stop like this, with no way to progress that's acceptable to me, it's disappointing.  It would be one thing if EQ had used this tactic the whole time.  I would never have played this long.  <br />
<br />
Just one more perspective from someone who will most likely cancel soon because I'm not willing to buy into the timesinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>moosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Trials:<br />
Make your own group to win them.  I did, and so can you.  People are saying they don't enjoy feeling like a charity case by making their uber friends come to the first teir zones with them?  How about you ask them to come to PoJ WITH YOU for an evening and then you can exp with them in the second teir.<br />
<br />
Flags:<br />
Yes, it is a pain in the ass to get 70 people flagged.  Yes it is annoying sometimes.  Yes it weeds out the leeches and people who play once a week and expect to be as well-equipped as the others.  I am a casual player that plays a couple of hours on weeknights and longer times on weekends (when I don't go out).  I work a full time job and live an adult life, but I am still flagged up to and inculding a Fennin Ro kill.   If you are at least partially intelligent about picking your play times, there is no reason you should be missing a flag from a mob your guild has killed 3 or more times.  No excuse what so ever.  If I hear one more person bitching because they are missing a Terris Thule flag because they still need the hedge I will kick them directly in the nuts.  I did the hedge with a pick up group.  I zoned into PoN, made a group, asked two other groups to join us and did it with 18 people.  It can be done, and not doing the footwork that is required of you as an individual to advance with your guild is just poor and selfish.  You don't have to play 8 hours a day.  You dont even have to play 4 hours a day to get flagged.<br />
<br />
PoP in general:<br />
Planes of Power has added a new form of excitement to a totally stagnant game.  The fights are fun again.  There are varied strategies and role changes.   Some fights allow specific classes to really shine (I won't get into this too much for fear of tossing around spoilers).  There is no more slamming a monster into a corner and turning on auto attack for 30 minutes.  The game now requires an actual team effort with everyone paying attention and everyone doing their job.  Not since Kunark and VP/Trak/VS have we had this mucg variety in the type of fights we are tossed into, and not since then have I more looked forward to the call to &quot;CHARGE!&quot;.  Wether it be the multi-mob encounters like Rallos Zek, or the pure destructive goodness of a AE rampaging (for 3k) Ominfiend, the game gives you something to look forward to again.  You go into new content NOT knowing what to expect, rather then expecting more of the same.  I can't say enough good things.<br />

<br />
Actully, it was a woman that organized those raids.  :)  My first one I organized on my own and delegated like mad.  We did Aerin'Dar with 96 people in a pick-up raid.  Didn't turn away anyone that was 60+.  Worked well, with some small problems... ok, some not so small problems too.  But I learned and was really happy to get so many people flagged and &quot;unstuck&quot; from PoP.<br />
<br />
Was it difficult to do?  Not for me.  I have a lot of friends on Drinal, connections with various guilds, lots of people I could trust to delegate tasks to.   I love researching strategies and encounters and the planning associated with them.  I think you need to be a social animal to coordinate and do this sort of thing.  And you need to have a lot of patience.  <br />
<br />
Second raid we did was on Grummus.  We didn't want to turn anyone away, and the word of the raid had spread like mad so we ended up with an utterly enormous raid.  If I were to do it again I'd limit the size and CoH everyone there to get tagged.  This time we had three people involved in the planning and organizing, plus people we delegated tasks to during the raid.<br />
<br />
Now we're planning Behemoth.  Definitely going to limit the size of this one.  Lag would make us lose I'm sure.  One of my cohorts wants to get to the elemental planes like this.  I think he's quite insane :)<br />
<br />
The way I see it, we're making a lot of people happier with the game they play so they aren't stuck in a few zones.  <br />
<br />
This game has always been about levels and improving your character.  People enjoy going up levels and getting AA's and going to new zones.  Frankly,  I was pretty tired of the old world content and wanted to explore a lot more of PoP.  I wanted my level 63/64/65 spells and AA's.  I'm not presently guilded so my options were very limited.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, is this hard to do?  Yes and no.  You'll find you have an incredible resource.  There's TONS of level 61+ players out there with lots of AA's that want to get to teir 3 planes.  Lots of small guilds that can't do it on their own.  Market your idea to them.  Learn the strategies, ask questions because people love to help.  Delegate like mad.  Learn how to moderate a raid channel (very important).  Figure out what to do with loot (i.e. petition when someone ninja's, not &quot;if&quot;... &quot;when&quot;). <br />
<br />
I'd be happy to write up something and share what I've learned having done this 2x now.  Everytime we learn more.<br />
<br />
BTW:  I've never been a guild officer.  I've led small raids before, but it wasn't something I did a ton of.  However, I am pretty good at organizing stuff and even better at delegating.   ;)<br />
<br />
As far as time involved... not that bad really.  Did some research offline on strategies, questioned people who had done it.  Had someone show me where/how to pull, talked to clerics on their message forum about healing strats (but I also play a cleric).  I'm a message forum groupie anyway so it wasn't a lot of extra time for me.  Then the day of the actual raid I spent about an hour before the raid talking to people.  My first raid lasted 5 hours I think, we had some problems.  Second one was 2.5-3.   Not bad really.  Very exhausting though.  Really wipes me out and I have to decompress afterwards.</div></div><hr />

The is the exact same stuff that was posted for the ST, VT and VP key quests, that it was too much work or too hard, and that people were being left behind.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I feel for Sony, truly. They have to try to cater to high end power players like Furor as well as someone who, gasp, just started the game RIGHT NOW. The game has to be interesting to those 12 hour a day types, as well as the 12 hour a week types -- BUT, the benefits cannot be the same or it wouldn't be fair to those who dedicate their life to the game. I play 35+ hours a week, and there should be something to differenitate those to log that much time in 3 days.<br />
<br />
Do flags work? Yeah sorta, tho it's a shame shaman are the least diserable class for exe outside maybe a non-ae taunt/under equipped warrior. I'm just glad I was flagged in the first week. I'm flagged pov-pos, poi inner factory and bot. Frankly, I fall into the I must get a group in pov-bot trap too much, when there's good exp in pon, poi etc. It's just not as good. :)  I'm also sympathetic to someone missing a flag because they miss a raid, tho I don't see a solution that's viable. If your guild did it once, they can do it again. <br />
<br />
The only single thing I hate about PoP is how it destroyed the old cotent. Pre PoP, I would hunt in UP, new CT, SSRA, some OS, Chardok, FG and AR. Those zones are now crap exp. I totally don't mind working to see PoP zones thru tough quests and big mobs, but ****, at least let me exp when I'm not doing that. In my mind, ssra, Chardok and CT 2.0 should be upgraded to viable post-60 exp zones -- even if you just raise mob levels across the board and do nothing else.<br />
<br />
That's all that's wrong with PoP, imo. <br />
<br />
The other complaints to me fall on deaf ears, sorry. If you don't like racing for mobs why are you still playing? Since Kunark was released it's been a guild-to-guild struggle based on organization, timing and mobilizing for those rare spawns. What hole have you been in for the last 2.5 years? PoP hasn't changed ANY of this. Just like SoL and VT, PoP only accentuated the haves from the have-nots, something that's been ongoing for years.</div></div><hr />

I've also understood that doing things would be harder for me, because I can't fall into those easy raiding grooves that are so amply rewarded.  <br />
<br />
I've been with the same crew of folks essentially the whole time, along with newer ones who've come along.  In our own way, we've been successful, though pitiful to the standards of some.  <br />

I'm not ok with the extent to which these disparities have been taken.  It's the degree of the disparity that's the problem.  Certainly what's a reasonable degree of disparity is subjective and therefore impossible to really assess globally.  Whatever or wherever that line is, it's been crossed for me.  <br />

I love many aspects of this game, hence the &quot;heat&quot; of my posts.  It's deep, it's cool, it's got a fun gameplay.  Yet I am clearly frustrated by other aspects.  I am not a game designer for Sony, so I can only voice my views in these limited forums.  <br />
<br />
At some point, if these trends continue, or remain unaltered.  I will simply quit.  I think there's other folks like me.  <br />

I really don't think Sony wanted to design PoP so it would lead the widespread discontent that I see among those with whom I play.  They need to get that message, imho.

This kind of thinking aggravates me.  My guild has many long standing members who have proven their loyalty and committment.  If, due to real life reasons such as jobs, family, time zone, school, WHATEVER, their playtime is lower than others, I do NOT consider them leeches.  <br />

I do think lemmings get disporportionately rewarded (in my view) solely by virtue of playing consistently, that's for sure.  There are ways to balance that in this game, and the designers have sloshed too far away from it.<br />

I put my &quot;time&quot; in, I just am not able to be consistent about when I do it.  So, I'm a frustrated powergamer in that sense.  I accepted that, for the most part, a long time ago.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>fenwyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">I moved a few months ago, and have been without a cable modem, so I've been taking a much deserved EQ break.  Here's my take on this whole PoP debate, from a completely unbiased viewpoint.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I am chomping at the bit to start playing again.  With all of the uberguilds working through PoP, that means all of the old world content will be that much easier to enjoy.<br />
<br />
If you have people in your guild that are not going all out to get flags, then you have to reconsider the makeup of your guild.  PoP obviously has polarized those that dont mind the bottlenecks, and those that cannot stand them.<br />
<br />
If you cannot stand them, use PoP for what its worth.  Superior AA exp and portals.  I plan on milking PoP for all its worth AA wise, while staying level 60.  There is plenty of encounters I have not seen in the old world, and there is a new expansion for the 35-60 crowd.<br />
<br />
I applaud SOE for getting the uber guilds out of the old world, opening up boss encounters for the lesser guilds to try.<br />
<br />
If I had already bought PoP and raced to 65, I'd probably be annoyed, but there is a solution...<br />
<br />
A one time offer from Verant that allows people to turn their post 60 level exp into AA points.  Sure, you would have some post 60 AA skills and spells that you couldnt use for the time being, but you would be able to utilize the entire game again.<br />
<br />
If your guild has not completed the ultimate encounters in the previous 4 worlds: Cazic and Inny, VP, ST,  and VT, then perhaps you should hold off on PoP.  As it stands, now that the uber guilds are out ofthe way somewhat, those have become my primary 4 goals.<br />
<br />
Everyone relax.  I think some of you might need a break from the game as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Juujuu, your post was insulting and thoughtless; your defending the attitude that insulting people or trying some screwy psychoanalysis with them when you don't agree with them makes you move solidly from merely degrading others to degrading yourself.<br />
<br />
Your bit about misquoting is completely meaningless.  What is conveyed is identical with and without the full quote.  Tsk tsk.  Making things worse, your locution is as as poor as your circumlocutions.<br />
<br />
As to whether I lay all blame for any difficulties I've seen myself or others encounter fully and squarely PoP's design -- I never did.  What's the gag?<br />
<br />
I admitted in my very first post that PoP's problems don't affect everyone and aren't all by design, but noted that the design tends to ENCOURAGE these problems and make them quite predictable.  I've repeatedly had to reaffirm this even though it was never unclear in the first place because people such as you have tried to assert that I've said things I haven't or for some baffling reason the blindingly obvious has never occurred to me.  I'm particularly fascinated by the stunning &quot;insights&quot; I've seen that run along the lines of, &quot;Go get some folks together!&quot; or &quot;time the spawns!&quot;  Brilliant.  Thanks!<br />
<br />
By the way, I too would blame my guild's problems on its lack of unity.  I thought when I wrote about it in the first place that that too was blindingly obvious.  My guild's problems were put there as a personal anecdote to illustrate concretely and in somewhat of a story form, to make it more tangible, what I felt could well be a tendency in PoP.  Apparently for some people you can never be quite tangible enough, as using my own situation for a tangible example has made some people even surmise that I didn't know that, uh, my example of guild weaknesses being brought to the fore could well be a case of, well..guild weaknesses being brought to the fore.  (sigh) <br />
<br />
PoP does indeed tend to encourage this sort of thing.  PoP's design is not entirely responsible for problems that have come around for some people -- but were those problems really so entirely unpredictable?  My assertion was and remains that there was nothing at all unpredictable about it.  I wasn't surprised that things unfolded this way for me and some other people I know, and it won't surprise me when it continues for others.<br />
<br />
I do, however, miss seeing a bunch of my friends.  And I'm pretty sure so many of them didn't either start playing far less frequently or change guilds just by coincidence.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone else believe they did?<br />
<br />
I think it was because human nature is what it is.  PoP made some predictable gaffes that will make the game lose some customers.  I hope the corrective measure of getting some new UNFLAGGED zones for the level 65's (of which I am not one, by the way) out for us is taken VERY quickly, because certain things cannot be taken back.  Lots of people who leave don't return; with SWG and other games coming around, and let's face it, EQ being a very old game by now, I think EQ could be facing a rougher road ahead than it has ever faced.  (SWG will be MUCH more of a draw than DAOC could ever possibly be.)  I'd like to stay in for a while, in a game that gives my 65 friends more room to run around in profitably without them or me having to join uber guilds or give up our jobs to do it.  I can't foresee the game retaining near the customer base it has today if Sony doesn't bring out a lot of higher level zones very quickly.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to argue that, fine.  But please don't do it by calling names or that kind of thing; there's been enough of that already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">I don't want to sound like I am bagging on Moosha or Valon because I am not, it's a great guild and has some of the nicest players I have had the good fortune to meet in it.  But...<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't have to play 8 hours a day. You dont even have to play 4 hours a day to get flagged. <br />
<br />
<br />
That pretty much says it all.  Moosha considers this &quot;casual.&quot;    Everyone wants to call themselves &quot;casual&quot; (just like everyone wants to call themselves &quot;middle class&quot;).  I do this as well.<br />
<br />
Grab 100 people off the street, tell them you play the same video game 30 hours a week for years and ask them if they think you are a &quot;casual&quot; player.<br />
<br />
PoP has been great for me and for my guild.  But I can see that it is horribly flawed.  It completely destroys the game for the high level casual gamer.  **Even the 40+ hour a week player who doesn't want to raid is screwed**.    <br />
<br />
Pre-PoP, you could be a level 60 and do a ton of different things in a ton of different zones to gain AAs and treasure for your character.   Now, most level 65's in small or casual guilds, or no guild at all, are crammed into a couple of the most boring zones ever created, with no realistic hope of ever leaving them.  I see them, they are my friends, and they log in less and less.<br />
<br />
Pre-PoP EQ was always raiding-optional.  Now it isn't.  That is a radical change.  Those of us who have always enjoyed raiding don't even notice this change.    <br />
<br />
As for the quests, L O L.  My friend doesn't like big raids.  So, she is in a small guild known for pulling off impressive things with small numbers.  She put in 50 mind-numbing hours of farming components for HoH and then the NPC fails the combine.  That is a quality gameplay experience.  She can't even retry it, because the Agony Mephit always spawns under the world and CS won't do **** about it.  I, on the other hand, could  /afk my way to a HoH flag, because I am in a raiding guild.  That is balanced.  Or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Dam Gloriana, why do we agree on so many things?<br />
I just got my VT key today.  I guess that means I'm ready to start being uber.  But honestly, it was either get it or quit EQ.  I HAD to move forward to even be able to raid with my guild on a good percentage of the week.  They did their first VT raids last week and I felt very left out.  It was depressing.  I'd be grouping in HoH or something and people from other guilds would be like &quot;why aren't you in VT with your guild?&quot;<br />
<br />
I have friends across the scope of power in EQ.  Or should I say . . &quot;had&quot; friends.  There aren't many of the non-ubers left now that PoP has made their lives too difficult to progress.  Basically it weeded out the casuals who wanted to have fun with the ubers.  <br />
<br />
It placed a firm dividing line between people who are considered &quot;uber&quot; and those who are not.  It's a lot like school segregation.  The ubers have their own school to go and learn jam packed with the latest textbooks and computers and scientific things and the best teachers/GMs.  The non-ubers get a new school too . . . from Fisher Price with textbooks on how to be puppetshow artists.  <br />
<br />
I just don't like the fact that there's very little common ground here.  There's nowhere i can go and exp that one of my non uber friends can come and we can both gain in our progression.  <br />
<br />
The biggest block so far for me has been spells.  I want my spells!  But as I get flags, they keep moving the spells!  I get PoV flag, drops nerfed the next day.   I get BoT flag, drops nerfed the next week!  I get HoH flag, drops have been nerfed already at this point for quite a while.  <br />
I get Tactics flag . . . Chukzombie has already been here and whined so much that they perma-killed the mobs that used to drop runes once in a while.   <br />
 <br />
If I want spells now, I have to exp in BoT or HoH.  And cross my fingers.  My non-uber friends aren't flagged for these zones.  So I'd have to make a choice.  Spells or exping with friends?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lando -- &quot;So I'd have to make a choice. Spells or exping with friends?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sad thing is, either choice can seem so wrong!  You have to wonder -- which opportunity will evaporate first?<br />
<br />
If I go exp with friends, will the nerf boot stomp my spell drop opportunities before I get a chance to get my goodies?  If I go after my goodies(and we KNOW this kind of thing could very easily take longer than one initially thinks it might -- bad luck is REAL), what are my friends going to think?  Are they going to understand the importance to me of getting my spell drops before I lose my chance, and realize I'm not merely ignoring them -- day after day after day maybe -- as if they didn't matter?<br />
<br />
If they know it intellectually, will that suffice?  Will knowing it intellectually have any real impact on their emotions at all when they just feel bored and alone in the game?  Will realistic, honest explanations to them that spell drops will inevitably be nerfed and you need to take advantage of a small window of time before they ARE nerfed seem like just a cop-out, or worse, like you're being too cowardly to admit to them that you're too uber for them now or can't be bothered with their friendship or don't want their company because you've become a snob or just think loot is way more important than they could ever be?<br />

<br />
What I think that is wrong is the attitude some people display here. Everquest ain't a hard game, Everquest ain't a complicated game all it asks from you is to invest time in it.<br />
<br />
On my server I dailly see the masses sit in PoV/PoS, When I pass there to buff some friends I hear the public channels filled with whining about not being able to get a group, Yet at the same time 10+ players have a LFG up and you can form a good group out of them. But those players prefer to wait till someone hands them a group instead of starting one (and doing the work involved to get the 6 players together etc).<br />
<br />
Now the same goes for a pick up raid to get flagged, Sure it is work to organise it, Sure it is not as easy as walking with the lemmings(as you put it) but in the end it is not that much more difficult then organising a dragon raid in the Kunark age.<br />
<br />
That is what I do not understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">PoP changed the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have nots&quot; of EQ.<br />
<br />
For the first time, having 8 hours a day to play, having the best gear, and being in a capable guild is no longer enough for a player to progress. Unlike the previous expasions, PoP requires a much higher level of comraderie, or at least a need fueled by personal interest, among players who work together to accomplish a goal. Only caring about your character development is no longer enough--players are required to invest far more of their time to help those around them.<br />
<br />
Guilds who failed when confronted by the daunting task of flagging all of it's members deserved to fail because they never reached the level of understanding that makes their members see past personal gain and value the accomplishments of the guild as a whole.<br />
<br />
The Vision (TM) has changed many times since EQ's orginal release, and it's current form is displayed in PoP for all to admire or curse. It requires players to be highly organized to the point of being mechinized in order to get anywhere. There isn't a subtle way of saying this, so here it goes--it was not designed so everyone will have a chance to see every zone. Only the most organized of the capable guilds will have a prayer to see the end of PoP.<br />
<br />
Is the design for PoP flawed? From the perspective of attracting customers, absolutely. From the perspective of bringing freshness into the game for the majority of the player base, most definately. However, if you see it as finishing off a legacy, the final stroke of the brush on a masterpiece, then the design is quite fitting. <br />
<br />
I'm going to go on a limb and suggest that PoP was designed as the End of EQ. It is the expasion where mortals challenge the Gods for control of their destiny. It gives players a chance to reach heights that were formerly unimaginable in the EQ world, and the road to the top is nothing but a breeze.<br />
<br />
Where does this leave casual players, the anti-social loner powergamers, and the frustrated power gamers who are friends with casual gamers? <br />
<br />
In a word, you are screwed.<br />
<br />
PoP forces you to change your play style, or quit the game, but there is a third option. SoE hopes that you'd linger in EQ regardless of your current misgivings about PoP, and maybe one day you'd suddenly want to see the higher tier zones of PoP, or maybe even PoTime itself. Or at least these thoughs will keep you occupide just enough so you'd pay your monthly dues until SWG comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">POP flagging requires more effort than previous expansions.<br />
If you want to get more out of this expansion, you have to work harder.<br />
I've seen many testimonies of random people working together to get themselves flagged for new zones.<br />
I've seen small guilds unite with other small guilds to flag themselves for new zones.<br />
I've seen guilds work to get everyone in their guild flagged for something, and keep doing the flagging mob until all their members are flagged.<br />
I've seen people make it through an easy trial like PoJ or Hedge trial, and continue to keep going through it time after time to make sure that their friends make it through.<br />
<br />
I've also seen people bitching that they will never see any tier 2 zone besides pos/v.<br />
I've seen people blaming POP for their scattered guild breaking up, when it was truly the lack of unity that killed the guild.<br />
I've seen people complain that POP divides guilds, when they have some people getting flagged, and not helping their own guildmates get flagged.<br />
I've seen people complaining that they can't get flagged for the simplest of trials when they don't even put in the effort of finding a good group to tackle the trial.<br />
<br />
You can bitch and complain about things not going your way and sulk.<br />
Another option is to objectively look at what your goals are and try to figure out a way to get there.<br />
Lots of people that are not in uber guilds are realizing that with a little effort and cooperation, they too can go where they want and do what they want in POP.<br />
I related what my experiences are with POP.<br />
I've offered suggestions as to things that can be done to alleviate the problems that are being presented.<br />
Whether you wish to heed such suggestions, or ignore them is your business.<br />
It's truly annoying seeing people complaining about POP features, but totally ignoring criticism on what they can do to get around their problems with POP.<br />
It's your choice if you want to adapt to the situation, or stagnate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Boinshar -- <br />
<br />
Finally you made a good post.<br />
<br />
I don't think PoP will hold anybody till SWG that it wouldn't hold without SWG.   You give this as the third option.<br />
<br />
I have been meaning to suggest in this thread the fourth option; the only option that will hold a great many people.  Create some new zones in a new expansion (and FAST) so that you aren't either &quot;uber&quot; or &quot;loser&quot; on the one hand, or just super casual to the point of being completely oblivious on the other.<br />
<br />
Pretty simple to do, really.  <br />
<br />
Get us some more zones that do NOT require keys/flags.  <br />
<br />
Will Sony do it?  I think a lot of paychecks are riding on whether or not they will.  More so than many of the isolated ubers imagine.<br />
<br />
I think flagging/keying has been a low-cost(quite literally) way to avoid spending company money on creating real usable content, and plenty of it.  Grimling forest worthless?  Hmm...we spent money on that.  Nobody experiences in Twilight?  Hmm....  COM empty?  Sheesh.  Okay, we spent a lot of money making zones nobody wants and it's not paying off because we didn't make compelling content.  We're not losing subscribers any slower or gaining them any faster.  We don't know what we did wrong, but after wasting all that money, we sure as heck don't want to spend even MORE money on it.  Where's our best bang for the buck?<br />
<br />
How about we just swallow up hundreds of hours of player time with timesinks and bottlenecks?  It costs virtually nothing and requires virtually no testing to just make a quest from a few bits of dreary text and some random drops.  People will be too busy wasting time pursuing some silly goal we give them to complain about all the pieces of the expansion that just don't make sense or provide any value at all; if they ever actually complete them, they'll sing our praises and of course their own simultaneously and be first in line to tell everyone else to quit bitching and being such losers/noobs.  Player backbiting will be all the cover story we need for 90% of our errors.<br />
<br />
It beats the hell out of really making a whole broad world stuffed to the gills with opportunities, potential, story that really matters and affects the game world, and real content of every description.  All of that work and imagination can be rendered unnecessary with a few simple timesinks and bottlenecks to divert everyone's attention!<br />
<br />
Much cheaper than designing new zones and populating them with the right level mobs.  Easier to figure out by far than loot problems, pathing problems, etc.<br />
<br />
Well...I think PoP is a an enormous, tremendous labor-saving device that potentially frees up a great amount of company personnel resources to move over and plop onto SWG.  If bottlenecks are the perfect solution to the provision of near infinite content and control over it, manpower needs and expenses plunge.  Let's use our manpower where we need it, on SWG and EQ2, our upcoming projects!  Regular EQ customers won't even be in a position to notice.<br />
<br />
Except...that we are.<br />
<br />
Those people Sony didn't anticipate are probably going to leave very quickly if Sony doesn't realize that bottlenecks are not the answer to the game and the final solution to having to provide content.  It was a nice try, but it only suffices for some people, not all.  Unfortunately, it will not satisfy most people.<br />
<br />
We're human, after all.  Some have lives and responsibilities, some just play the game as a lark, not as a job.  Try to funnel the future of EQ through interlocking bottlenecks and a lot of people just won't be able to crammed into your design like square pegs into round holes.<br />
<br />
Before all the staff gets bled off into future company products, Sony had better address the problems at hand with the product that made them buy out the game.<br />
<br />
A new expansion is necessary.  New expansions in general are probably not needed at the pace they were needed before, because after all PoP higher tiers DO exist now as an endgame.  There IS someplace to go, eventually.  But since the last step to the endgame has been compressed down to just a handful or less of zones to many customers, the relevance of the endgame is non-existent to too many of the people it was supposed to handle and keep forever satisfied.  Those whom it does not keep satisfied will simply burn out and by and large be uninterested in future Sony products.  If one buys a pack of peanuts and doesn't like them, it's a 50 cent loss.  If one puts a year or two or three of playing into something, the pay-off must be real and unambiguous.  Consumer demand is NOT inelastic on this kind of product.  <br />
<br />
For those who feel either trapped in or burn-out on PoV/POS and lower level tiers, a bridge has to be built to the endgame or a sustainable middle ground, and to the continuation of monthly subscription fees.  Not in terms of zones that will equip one for the end game, as Vex Thal already exists.  But in terms of zones that will let players build, without much guild support, a sufficient amount of AA's to satisfy the need for feelings of accomplishment and confidence which will make the end game seem both attractive and possible, and which will make possible at least some small loot or platinum reward while or after AA's are built.  There is no benefit to having level 65's without any money running around crushing Sebilis or Rathe Mountains hill giants for cash.<br />
<br />
If one cannot march players forcibly through the funnel of bottlenecks to the relatively maintenance-free tiers of PoP, one must make them happy where they are, or simply lose them.  That's all there is to that.<br />
<br />
More expansions will be necessary.  And soon, or else a dramatic and probably steady, continuing decline in subscriptions is all but inevitable.  <br />
<br />
How many expansions?  (After the latest downloadable mid-level expansion.)  If well done, one may well suffice for the duration of EQ's remaining significant profitability.  If not properly designed, another might be necessary. By the time the Luclin expansion was well underway, most people experienced in very few zones as it was, leaving even most of the Luclin content completely empty.  A single well done expansion to meet the needs of level 65's and others who cannot get flagged or even perhaps WILL not get flagged and find the game pointless without access to higher level content -- perhaps half a dozen good zones -- should be enough to provide adequate content to people to balance their characters, achieve some level of satisfaction with them, and build either their AA or their desire to the point at which they would be content to jump through the hoops of PoP for an infinity of time and monthly subscription revenues, until the whole deal finally burns out and goes dark.<br />
<br />
But the critical thing is time.<br />
<br />
The money on EQ is already spent.  SWG and EQ2 are coming out.  The return on investment in EQ is going to be limited.  However, I think the ROI in EQ was counted on as being much higher than it might be at this stage, and their real financial results compared to their projected ones will show an unexpected loss.  <br />
<br />
Not knowing Sony's profit targets, and not knowing their development costs, I don't know how much money it's worth spending on a game that will surely begin dying as soon as SWG comes out.  But I do think it's undeniable that their expected income from EQ will fall short of what they had hoped if they either cut off spending on the game before an expansion comes out that stabilizes their player loss from PoP or if they realize their mistake, but realize it after the customers have already gone, never to return.  In short, I think they are expecting a bleed-off of customers, and at some point a rapid decline -- but I don't think they are expecting the bottom to drop out.  <br />
<br />
To avoid that, I think they're going to have to readjust a corporate strategy that took account of everything possible except human nature.</div></div><hr />

Been there, done that - and Vox and Naggy too.  Jebus, I understand what I need to do for me to advance.  I don't need &quot;advice&quot;.

POP flagging requires more effort than previous expansions.<br />
If you want to get more out of this expansion, you have to work harder.<br />
- First you need a one hour gnome walk event. Then a 30 min move to spot, 30 min prep for fight, 20 min for script to activate and 45 second fight will get you into Tactics. Hmmm, how does that compare with let's say getting one single Emperor bane weapon? Oh my ME shard camp took 70+ hours. This is ... MUCH shorter. Or how about doing 3 1.5 hour long simultaneous Hedge walk events, do it 2 times and you have 108 ppl flagged. Then a 40 min walk up to Terris and a 5 minute fight. Short. Very short. Feel free to replace TT by any flag mob. Getting to them is not hard nor long (except RZ). BUT. Since you have competition for content, guilds can't afford to plan ahead so all their members are online. Do what you can now, or lose mob. This alone makes flaggin a POS system. You have to hassle left and right just to get a shot at the mob not because it's &quot;harder&quot;, hell it's 1000 x &quot;easier&quot; to get 2-3 mob kills and get 95% of the guild flagged then doing POS bane/key quests individually.<br />
<br />
I've seen many testimonies of random people working together to get themselves flagged for new zones.<br />
- I've seen many testimonies of guilds already c0ckblocking RZ, Aerin'Dar or Bertoxxulous. I've seen many testimonies of HoH trials being blown. And your point was?<br />
<br />
I've seen guilds work to get everyone in their guild flagged for something, and keep doing the flagging mob until all their members are flagged.<br />
- Works great for the top guild on the server who's players have insane playtime. As soon a you get down to lower power guilds, it just doesn't work. When you are in a guild that is already in high end Ssra/VT killing Grummus/TT/Behemoth/Aerin'Dar is either good for (1)c0ckblock or (2) waste of time/effort because the loot you get in Luclin is far superior. So yeah guilds will take time to kill mobs that yield nothing to them over and over until everyone is flagged. What game are you playing? The game many people play is that on patch day they go for much more important targets like Emperor, VT, Behemoth maybe MM/RZ. Who knows. Due to the mentally retarded race for content vision of EQ and VI's crack smoking desigers, many guilds can't afford to make sure all their people are flagged ASAP because those mobs drop garbage loot, 0 power gain for guilds. By the time the much more important targets are dead, the flag mobs are also dead. Then the waiting for spawn and racing for spawn game begins ... or continues.<br />
<br />
I've also seen people bitching that they will never see any tier 2 zone besides pos/v.<br />
- And even if they do ... they'll end up in PoV anyways. Torment is a waste of pixels, PoS and beyond is heavy slow mitigation and much harder mobs, Tactics same crap as PoS and beyond, plus tactics is much harder than any other tier 2 zone. Just as EQ history proved it, the end of the day people will be back in PoV farming XP because it's safe AND great XP.<br />
<br />
I've seen people complain that POP divides guilds, when they have some people getting flagged, and not helping their own guildmates get flagged.<br />
- Wow, that is one moronic statement. I wonder how I can help my friends getting HoHB flag when (1)Trial is bugged (2)Another guild doing it/killed it/c0ckblocking it (3) Not up. Yeah whoopeee do, let me give him moral support while we have fun in HoHB. Feel free to replace HoHB with any major flag mob.<br />
<br />
Lots of people that are not in uber guilds are realizing that with a little effort and cooperation, they too can go where they want and do what they want in POP.<br />
- ROFLMAO! Thanks for the laughs. I'd like to see &quot;lots&quot; of people not in uber/power guilds in Tactics, Torment, Elemental Planes, HoHB or Solusek Ro's. /ooc 63 SHAMAN LOOKING FOR RAID ON BERTOXXULOUS!<br />
<br />
It's truly annoying seeing people complaining about POP features, but totally ignoring criticism on what they can do to get around their problems with POP.<br />
- And by you calling people &quot;bitching&quot; and &quot;whining&quot; does make the situation better right? And you surely acknowledge their point of view ... right? Hypocrisy owns you.</div></div><hr />

This whole &quot;I have my flags so the people without them are lazy, whining leeches&quot; is really laughable.<br />
<br />
I have malo and torpor, therefore all 60 shamans without those spells are lazy and worthless.  Mmm, hmm.   Good thing MY brain didn't turn into a massive ball of stinky cheese as soon as I got something I wanted out of this game.<br />

I've been making liberal use of the /feedback command lately (not that I know whether or not anybody READS those, mind you) to send colorful commants about the nag screens and GM spam about the ykesha expansion.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">BlargX,<br />
<br />
I think SoE's counting on PoP to continue a trend we've seen over the years. The &quot;ubers&quot; move on to new uber zones and mobs, while everyone else play catch up and play around in a few zones given to them.<br />
<br />
In Kunark, theoretically everybody COULD have gone to Chardok, Karnors, Seb, Skyfire etc... but how many were successful there during the first 5 months of the expansion? Sure, you could have seen these zones, but you could not do much in them besides dying.<br />
<br />
In Velius, theoretically everybody COULD go to ToV... but how many were successful there during early Velius? You can zone in, and that's about it.<br />
<br />
In PoP the difference is that unless you prove you belong in a zone by killing a guardian, you don't get to see it. Is it really that far of a stretch from previous expansions? <br />
<br />
I get the feeling that the people who are complaining about bottlenecks in PoP are the same ones who complained about ST in Velius, when they could barely make it into Kael arena. The fact that these bottlenecks exist does not affect you unless you are actually hindered by them. If you cannot kill Aerin'Darr, then it's a little early for you to worry about how RZ is bottlenecking the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
Flags are tedius, and quite frankly they suck. However, you do have a few options if you belong to a guild. 1) Give out your info to people you trust so they can log on and get you flags when you can't make it, 2) Be there yourself, and 3) wait until the guild comes back to do the flag again.<br />
<br />
If you cannot progress in PoP, then progress in Luclin--I'm sure there are many things you haven't done there. It should be obvious to everyone now that getting level 65 doesn't mean anything--except making previous content that much easier.<br />
<br />
Get exp in new expansion zones, and raid mobs both old and new--does that sound familiar to anyone else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Blargx you made the point that people will leave EQ for SWG.<br />

I'm not so sure I'd bet the horses and pigs on that.  While it is true (message board true - not confirmed) that Lucas has his hands on the game, I've also seen a lot of people who have said they will: a) NEVER play a SOE game again, or b) Have NO interest in a Sci-FI MMORPG.<br />
<br />
 I've been making liberal use of the /feedback command lately (not that I know whether or not anybody READS those, mind you <br />

<br />
Personally I think that the 'send' key is really the 'delete' key and we're wasting our time. I'm much more convinced SoE lurks on message boards.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is not a job - it is a GAME. Sadly it is a zero-sum game. I shouldn't HAVE to put in 40 hours to advance reasonably.<br />
<br />
 For the first time, having 8 hours a day to play, having the best gear, and being in a capable guild is no longer enough for a player to progress <br />
<br />
Counting weekends, yeah. I guess the above defines people like me and Gart - &quot;Frustrated power gamers&quot; Only my guild is microscopic, and my gear is average (Not for trying).<br />

EQ should look at &quot;pay to play&quot;<br />
<br />
Your monthly fee is $9.95. You want Kunark - add a buck.  You want Velious - add a buck. You want Luclin? Ok we'll refund a buck.<br />
<br />
You want PoP Tier-1? Add a buck.  You want Tier-2? Ok once you pass the trials and start sending us another buck you get access. Tier-3? Same thing - more money.<br />

Boinshar, have you ever left good friends behind in a guild and joined another because you thought the new guild would be able to do more? Have you ever been in a guild that accepted new recruits that applied because they wanted to see a few more zones?<br />
<br />
If you have then you are actually indirectly affecting other people. It has always been like this but that doesnt mean I have think its a good idea. And it certainly looks like PoP made this aspect of EQ even worse. This is what makes EQ a negative game - you have to work (how stupid is that in a GAME?!?!) more and more and you have to leave friends behind. When a new game comes out that manages to avoid these pitfalls EQs bubble will burst and only the truly uber will be left.<br />
<br />
I know SOE like to brag that they think they are a success because they have 400k+ customers but with a slightly different view on how EQ should be I think they could have 4000k+ players. They definately have something good in EQ but I dont think any other game has so many unsatisfied customers and some day it will hurt them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well even with all the discussion ... there is more than one way to flag, XP, or play this game than outlined.  Hence the section on this board based on levels and where to experience because everyone has a different perspective on the game.    <br />
<br />
So, blame it on whatever you want, but people are not going to stop at level 60.  Human nature encourages players to move along throughout the game for better spells, items, AA's, etc ... which have been the way of life within EQ from day one.  My guild is much like many others based on comments here ... not an Uber guild nor are bunch of newbies.  Most of us have played the game for 2 years plus at least, leveled past 60 and pushing if not at 65, Mult AA +, and lots of Alt's.  Our goal is to stay out of the way of the Cblocking/fighting over spawns as much as possible while moving quickly to do fun things.  PoP zones CAN be fun for us.  <br />
<br />
Therefore, while we are doing trials, flags, raiding, and allied raids  we also go for the low hanging fruit within PoP and older zones.  This still means that places like SSra are packed by those working into VT ... as that's a problem Sony put into this game by poor design.  Many question the thought of leveling to 65 and then constantly having to deal with the competition for only PoP experience zones.   The hope was the Dev team would continue to expand both PoP AND other zones which would give the bigger guilds 'Carrots'  thus opening new for us but old to the Cblockering folks new stuff to chase.     <br />
<br />
On my soapbox here, but I'm hoping that someone from the Dev team reads these posts ... and maybe getting some of it.  Maybe LoY will be updated in design to lvl 35 - 65 ... plus offer some updates on the empty zones for the lvl 61-65 folks to experience outside of PoP.   Heck  repeat yourself  update Toxx with a Kithicor forest type revamp with fighting between the Erudites.  Or update the completely wasted zones of Kerra Island or Eruds Crossing.  How bad can you screw up a zone that has zero use today  blow it and it is still an empty zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In a word, you are screwed.<br />
<br />
PoP forces you to change your play style, or quit the game, but there is a third option. SoE hopes that you'd linger in EQ regardless of your current misgivings about PoP, and maybe one day you'd suddenly want to see the higher tier zones of PoP, or maybe even PoTime itself. Or at least these thoughs will keep you occupide just enough so you'd pay your monthly dues until SWG comes out. <br />
<br />
Dead on, so much so it's scary.<br />

By the way, you can't stay 60 and do something else. I tried. PoP has sucked in every single person who can survive there, and they're not leaving.</div></div><hr />

Come on now brother. With ST revamped, we're talking literally like 15 items out of tens of thousands, most of which don't matter. Box of abukar? Tink bag. Guise? Woody hat. Manastone? Manarobe, sorta, and the stone is still very limited. Rubi BP? Fungi. Prenerf circlet of shadows? Well, there's tons out there, pay 10kpp :) GFG? /yawn Gem encrusted ring? OK, but there's tons better, too. Fungi staves have been fully nerfed, right? The only ones to cry for are sods, salendrites and gnome masks -- and only the latter is without replacement.<br />
<br />
First is may have benefits, but realize how nominal they really are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">There are examples in Pop too though mormegil, parchments were nerfed many places in first couple tiers, gear like raintraveler's overcloak and the 41% haste on the bees in PoStorms. I could name more examples but dont need to. Every expansion has things like this. Get there first OR ELSE is the lesson we have been forced to learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Don't forget the nerf over time.  There are two NOTs in EQ.  It starts with the release.  A new expansion is released and the uberest of the uber are the first to get there and get phat lewtz dropping like rain in the plains in spain.  After a short amount of time - that drop rate is cut back.  Once there is enough of the lewtz in the world, it's guaranteed to become super rare drops off of rare spawns while the rest of the mobs drop a rusty dagger and 2p if you're lucky (most luclin and pop mobs drop zilch).<br />
<br />
The second NOT is mudflation.  If a new person to the game today goes and loots a Short Sword of the Ykesha and tries to bazaar it - they'll be lucky to get 100p for an item that was worth 1k or more just a few years ago.  Because of the first NOT, it'll also be difficult to get much better equipment on their own since the drop rate will be horrific, they can't get much platz for anything they can loot themselves, and bazaar prices for brand new lewtz are staggering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">The advice not to sweat PoP and all its flags is good advice, of course.  I'd be the first to agree with that advice, because it's what I've also been saying for a very long time and often getting roundly criticized for saying; certainly the advice is usually ignored.  <br />
<br />
The problem is, most people didn't take that advice when anyone gave it -- they just zoomed to 65 regardless.  What now?<br />
<br />
So advice on not getting your self stuck in PoP is just too late for a lot of people.  Not that they don't have themselves to blame for it to a very real extent; but most of them were pretty gullible when listening to people constantly saying levels &gt; all for everyone all the time without exception.  <br />
<br />
For many players, a combination of naivete and simple blind optimism merged with just not really thinking things through -- people must have thought that somehow flagging wasn't something to worry too much about, or that it would somehow magically take care of itself.  Heck, whole guilds have probably done the same and found themselves stymied en masse; there certainly is no shortage of level 63's and up who are not flagged for much of anything at all.<br />
<br />
It was pretty predictable that getting yourself high enough level to only be able to experience in a couple of zones BEFORE you and your guild were powerful enough to reliably get flagged for higher level zones would be a big mistake.  But, I suppose people perhaps just hoped for the best or something, and now a LOT of them are in a jam.  Human nature being what it is, I'm sure a heck of a lot more will get themselves in that same jam as time goes on.<br />
<br />
So, dealing with things as they are, not as we would like them to be, the game has a problem with a lot of higher level people getting stuck and feeling stuck -- and many more to come.  <br />
<br />
Like it or not, Sony will have to deal with those people and give them something to do, or they'll be lost and won't be back -- if they leave under these circumstances, they might never be back to another Sony online game again, losing the company potentially hundreds of dollars per customer in game purchases and subscription fees.<br />
<br />
And since the game world has become so small so quickly for many, Sony will have to charge in with another high level expansion VERY quickly.  It's one thing to only feel like there are a half dozen or a dozen zones that are worthwhile; it's quite another to feel that there are only one or two -- and even worse, to eventually find 1500 people in those one or two zones!<br />
<br />
For those who did not have foresight, hindsight works, but doesn't do them any good.  At 65, it's too late for insight.  They need content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">If I was Sony, I'd be sweating bullets over this expansion.  I think they are already tho.  It practically just came out and they're rushing in a new one to keep people occupied, with a third shortly after.  <br />
IMHO, if Ykesha doesn't contain at least one or two zones that are VALID for exping for a lvl 65, it will have failed the players miserably.  <br />
<br />
I said the player level had to increase or the game would stagnate horribly.  It did with PoP.  I didn't anticipate the added factors tho, that made any other exp zones a total waste of time.  Those were:<br />
1) harsh level range caps on blue exp mobs.  It should be lvl 51 and up blue.<br />
2) Incredible exp in PoP zones.  Higher exp in the higher planes.  This made any non-PoP zone look like **** in comparison.<br />
<br />
The above poster is right, there is no good option for those 55-60 to just do something other than PoP.  They are all in PoP and aren't leaving.</div></div><hr />

And, for the record, EQ is losing people to SWG, out of perhaps 15-20 friends of mine that played EQ, totalling about 30 accounts, 5 of us are currently playing, the rest either quit due to high level frustration(nothing to do for a solo or a few people when level 50 +), uber guilds being greedy, or just boredom.

What does that get you?  Nothing.  So I can exp in FG or Sebilis or Chardok?  I've done that.  And unless they blow up the exp in those zones, no one will do them, even the 50 to 60 set - who have also moved to PoP.  Leavening out the exp calculations would certainly help.  <br />
<br />
I dinged 61 the first day of PoP knowing full well that other zones would become mostly irrelevant.  That's fine, because I've done those zones.  <br />

Not allowing fairly dedicated players (40+ hours a week) to become Jedi is a mistake. It's not being the top shaman on the server, since there's no single quest that can make you the top shaman on the server. Plus that's hardly static. <br />
<br />
If you start a game where an underlying premise is to become a Jedi, well, people will want to become Jedi's. Plus, look at the fan base. You don't think 75 percent of people will want to be Jedi's? Come now.<br />

In EQ, would you only play if you were the top shaman of the top uber guild on your server? That would be similar.<br />
In EQ when you start a shaman, you get shaman powers out of the gate.  They are small and weak and grow as you do.  In order to be a Jedi, you start as a farmer and pick skills that slowly make you force sensitive.  When you get enough sensitivity, you can try to gain force powers.  In other words - you may want to be a Jedi, but until you pick enough cotton, you can't even feel the force, much less attempt to use it in even the smallest way.<br />
<br />
In EQ terms, this would be like starting a shaman but getting no shaman skills or spells until you got to level 20.  After level 20 you still might only get a spell every few levels.<br />
<br />
It's the game developers saying they expect very few Jedi.  It's not speculation, but what the people making the game are planning.<br />

Why do people keep saying they know how to be a jedi?<br />
<br />
And you would be surprised how many people have no interest in becoming a jedi, a ton of people want to be crafters for instance.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, unless you are a developer and actually know, stop saying you have to do xxx to become force sensative, because no one knows. they may or may not pull it off, it could totally suck, and uber guilds rule there too, but we do not know yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
When a super star destroyer named &quot;Fires of Heaven&quot; starts pimping all the Death Star spawns, then you will know they screwed up like they did in EQ, me, I'll give em some credit. SWG will attract new first time online gamers, as well as more mature adults then a typical fantasy themed game, they might not all be EQ burnouts.<br />

Do people just disagree with me out of principle? Or does anyone read the posts?<br />

Faern, kind of hard to macro up when the quest is something like &quot;get hand-picked by a developer-controlled NPC based on your roleplaying/asskissing/whatever.&quot;  Real easy to control the total number of jedi that way as well =)  I would bet that there will be some element of hand-picking in the process somewhere along the line.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;you gotta be a farmer first&quot; thing, it's not really true.  You can supposedly become force sensitive no matter what profession you are, be it farmer or miner or blaster maker or brawler or marksman or whatever.  <br />
<br />
But overall, yeah, the game will probably be very UO-like.  The lead designer is Designer Dragon, after all.  Expect a heavy dose of tradeskills, a player driven economy, little in the way of immediately usable &quot;loot&quot;, and VERY quick (think weeks) character maxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">Uggok,<br />
<br />
 You are partially correct. To fully max your skills, it could be done in a fairly brief time, if you are &quot;uber&quot; however, how long would it take you right now, from scratch, to level to 65? Would the game be done? Also, EQ has a thing called GM events, like the Butcherblock hammer quest. Is this any different? I seem to remember on my server, only the top guilds were involved, and the funny thing is, they eventually were so whiney that our server never got the hammer(Povar at the time). Personally, I would love the devs to hand pick Jedi, that way, it wouldn't be a EQ uberguild thing of pimping spawns and playing 22 hours a day to become the uberestest dood out there. Skill and character should matter, not time.<br />
<br />
You don't think EQ has a player driven economy? How many of you bought your malo, torpor, fungi etc? only difference in SWG maybe, and only maybe, is that player made gear will be good, and crafting will be fun. Farming items in EQ is not exactly fun. It also generates alot of hatred and anger. EQ has a massive player driven economy, it is called farm, extort, repeat. God forbid players helped each other in game.<br />
<br />
Look, most of what people say about SWG is speculation, but from the official dev tidbits, it should be a tremendous game, much better then EQ if you can handle the genre.<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ was first(real big online game, UO sucked, let's face it, M59 too small), but EQ has alot of glaring problems they just can't fix at this point. Still a great game, but don't you think they learned anything?<br />
<br />
And, the only thing about SWG that will be even remotely like UO is more emphisis on player crafts, and skills instead of levels, other then that, nothing at all alike.<br />
<br />
It is fine if you don't like/won't play SWG, good for you. But at least be honest and do a little research. Personally, you will never see me say anything other then EQ is the best game so far ever to be made online. It is. However, it is frustrating to a casual gamer, and it is showing it's age, all they do is keep tossing bits of candy at the high levels to keep em going, they are too rigid and afraid to change the world.<br />
<br />
EQ will not die, it has too many dedicated people playing day in and day out. But SWG will be big, much bigger then EQ ever was, and you can bet it will be a damned good game.<br />

The casual player is probably a numbnuts who rocketed to 65 ASAP without considering if he could ever do anything outside of POV/POS again. And then found himself stymied. He probably DID think he would magically gain access to...uh, heck if I know. <br />
<br />
With the exception of Firiona Vie no server has trivial loot code in effect.  Just because you are 65 doesn't mean you can't gear up in expansions other than pop.  Experience only is the only thing limited to pop and a few select other zones.  But quests, loot and content is not cut off to the level 65 player.<br />
<br />
Use pop to acheive all the goals you had before pop.  Use the fast ports,  the levels and the aa's to make everything happen for you faster.<br />
<br />
Instead of dwelling on what you can't have, make it happen for you.  Gear up, learn encounters, find others in your similar situation and band togethor.  It's not impossible.  It's justnot handed to you on a silver platter.  You can't skip content in pop like you did with other expansions. If you want to do it now, see about joining a guild that is capable of doing it now.  If you want to do it with your guild, keep plugging away.  It'll happen in time, but you must prepare for the battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>robert135</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">Millman- I don't know about morrowwind, but with NWNs it is a completely overview 3rd person shooter, jedi is either AC style behind the back, or 1st person, in your face action style so more like a 1st person RPG (eq). <br />
<br />
The real difference is that JKII doesn't have the scale yet of predefined content that EQ does, of course this is a minus, but when you cannot even experience most of said content because of Cockblocking and Stupid 1 day,week,month spawn times etc.... It makes it an exercise in boredom waiting around for the real action. <br />
<br />
When I played EQ it was mainly for times when I could solo anyway, and have limited interaction with others through chat, and have opportunities to influence the game by my choices of action, but still not just be part of a sniping game that had no close combat (alot of quake).<br />
<br />
Nerfing is out, since the players themselves can set up and modify the ability levels and limitations on a per server basis.<br />

Also, for large scale combat, There is no substitute to 25 lightsabers igniting and watching 25 jedi fight it out in PVP.</div></div><hr />

&quot;If you want to do it with your guild, keep plugging away. It'll happen in time, but you must prepare for the battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
I very seriously doubt this is true. And apart from other guilds monopolizing the key encounters the major reason is that EQ is more and more turning into a game where the skill of the individual is irrellevant.<br />
<br />
Casting Turgurs for the 10th time and the 10000nd time is more or less the same. The only thing that determines the outcome is the mob you cast it on. Melee can hit autoattack and try to stay in range and thats about it. The mobs dont react much to who attacks them or how or howmany. The actual skill needed is very very limited but the knowledge of what attacks a mob has or how many people you need is very important. After that mobs become trivial fast because if its an important mob to succeed against (to avoid others getting it instead) then there is no reason to not zerg it enough to ensure a victory. <br />
<br />
I also doubt very much that they will (be able to?) make SWG different so that the individual can learn skills that will be truly decisive in the battles they participate in. Even though that is how I see Jedi's in Star Wars - individuals that have worked long and hard to learn skills that very few others have. Not someone that just holds down the trigger on a super-duper blaster and points it in the general direction of the enemy.<br />
<br />
I think we have to look towards WoW for a serious change in how this kind of games works. I know that if I was a developer for WoW I would browse these EQ-fan boards every day to get vital information about what people despise about EQ. But I wouldnt post on the boards because that would just give SOE a hint that I was here :-) Why people from SOE post here so seldomly I dont know.</div></div><hr />

Your remarks that PoP doesn't automatically kill every part of the game for every person are true.  They're self-evident.  The problem is that the sensible approach is not always the human approach; that's part of what I've been addressing.  I think you put a positive spin on things that doesn't acknowledge the human nature side of things quite enough, also.  <br />
<br />
PoP doesn't FORCE you to feel stuck; but it very much encourages it.  Put level 65 in, and there's pretty much a guarantee everyone will shoot for it; heck, it looks like that pretty much happened.  I know relatively few people who didn't try for 65 whether they could get out of PoV/POS (or even INTO them) or not, especially when PoP first came out.  Some people now are holding back from leveling, but for others, that decision was made a long time ago.  <br />
<br />
Naturally, many of those higher level people will be very frustrated at doing everything outside of a few zones for the rest of their EQ career for absolutely no experience whatsoever.  Not every player either wants to or can solve his flagging problems by joining the local uberguild or doing whatever it takes to get with enough well-equipped, well-organized, well-motivated people to bust down whatever problems stand in his way.  Those that can -- well, the problems kind of take care of themselves, don't they?<br />
<br />
But the more casual players who have leveled now have far less to do than they did before PoP came out.  Many won't want to either change their playstyle completely, maybe leaving their guilds and friends, massively increasing the hours they spend playing, or whatever, to advance into more than just the very few planes they can experience in with their friends.  Just playing around and experiencing is a very real part of the game for an enormous swath of people playing EQ and keeping the servers running.  Lots of those people are now stuck in just a few zones if they ever want experience again(and they do, of course).<br />
<br />
The solutions those people need won't be changing the way they may have played for years -- that won't even work for some of them if they wanted it to, as not all people want to leave their guilds to join tougher ones or put in more hours.  What they need is more zones appropriate to their level and their level of commitment and available play time.  If this game had always been more hard core, probably nobody would ever get themselves into an unexpected jam.  But since it never has really always  been that hardcore unless you wanted it to, some people will need the game to give them the ability to play the way they used to play, even at level of 65.  Which means a lot of new high-end, non-flagged content.  A lot of the solutions to the problems of PoP just don't apply to a great many people; new unflagged zones would.<br />
_______________________________________<br />

Millman and others talking about SWG -- there's no reason to assume SWG will be some kind of perfect heaven descending upon all gamers.  <br />
<br />
Every game seems to have people who assert almost as a religion that it has already achieved everlasting perfection even before it has come out.<br />
<br />
Before it comes out, we really don't have a leg to stand on when it comes to celebrating its genius.<br />
<br />
As to whether people leaving EQ will automatically go over to SWG -- that's just as much a blanket pronouncement.  Some will, some won't.  I'm willing to bet a large chunk of the SWG players will never have played an online game at all.  And I'm sure that while some people who have plenty of complaints about EQ will try SWG(though maybe not stay with it), of course many will not, feeling that a year or three has given them plenty of experience in what Sony products are all about.<br />
<br />
At any rate, each customer lost represents potentially hundreds of dollars.  I wonder if we'll see less profitability in EQ make GM's rarer still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;To me it seems BlargX post is not about the way PoP was designed but a lot more about the way some individuals deal with the limitations they encounter.&quot;<br />
<br />
I play on the 7th hammer.  If 7th isn't the most backwater server in eq, you can sure as hell see it from there.  It wasn't until last week that a 2nd guild stepped foot into VT, 10 days ago bertox mith marr and saryn hadn't been killed at all, and not a single person has zoned into an elemental plane.  Compare my magelo to Chuk's, and then consider im the best equiped shaman on 7th.<br />
<br />
Yet somehow on this retard server that's constantly half an expansion behind, 7 guilds are flagged for some or all of the teir 3 planes (HoH, tactics, BoT).  That's the majority of lv 60+ players on the server.  Not only has PoP NOT torn these guilds apart, its actually pulled them closer together!  Whether its a joint raid, or letting members from guild A who missed a flag tag along while guild B kills that mob, there's a level of cooperation the server has never seen before.<br />
<br />
Make no doubt about it, this expansion is made primarily for raiding, and the &quot;casual&quot; player (anyone who's 60+ and thinks they're a casual player really should have their head examined) won't be able to see as much of it as the &quot;ubers&quot;.  But saying its ruined the game is rediculous.  The original content and the other 3 expansions are just as viable as they used to be, unless your sole reason for playing the game is mindlessly grinding out AA points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was no &quot;hidden subtext&quot; to my post about people's individual limitations being part of the problem with PoP, rather than strictly the design itself.  Actually I was very explicit about it right up front, using myself as an example and extrapolating to others I knew and others I could imagine reacting to PoP in ways that wouldn't be ideal for their gameplay. The scenarios I detailed have obviously echoed the experience of some people.<br />
<br />
Further, I think those problems were predictably going to arise due to the way gameplay design inevitably interacts with simple human nature.  Problems are not necessarily going to happen to everyone, but it's unlikely they won't happen to a broad swath of players.  Design doesn't stand alone; it has to exist in tandem with human nature whether Sony or you would like it to or not, whatever either of your motivations might be.  A design that is very likely due to cause severe problems for a large chunk of players is by definition flawed.<br />

Glad that your personal anecdote relates that it's not a problem for you.  However, your merely stating that you believe your server is a &quot;gimp&quot; server is not much argumentative support to persuade one that your anecdote applies universally; it's just a personal anecdote.  Without any sort of argument behind it.  Good for you on your luck!<br />
<br />
By the way, on my server nobody is in the elemental planes, and it was just in the last couple of weeks that a second guild got into VT. :)<br />
<br />
Your observation that anyone post-60 is kidding themselves if they think they are a casual player is a little dense.  I leveled my warrior to 51 in 29 played hours.  People come and go in their dedictation to the game all the time, or go on vacations, or take up a tradeskill, or stay in their smaller friendly guilds rather than joining higher level guilds to get flagged if they want to.  As they see fit.  It is a game, after all.  Your pretending that many thousands of people simply don't exist is pretty unrealistic.  <br />
<br />
Kind of like your assertion that their problems don't exist.<br />
<br />
Not quite as unkind as your weird assertion that anyone having problems with PoP is a loser in real life.  I suppose that, by turning it around, people who sail right through with all their flags are real life success stories?  Either way you try to equate real life with EQ, you just get deeper into baloney and general nastiness.  It was a dumb thing to say.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my point stands that people who hit 65, as people are likely to do in a game that adds five levels, are in a different situation than people at the top level of the game used to be unless they are flagged.  They really only have two or a few more zones.  This is a massive shut-down of the game for them.<br />
<br />
There's nothing hard to understand about that.  Or about the fact that it has already happened to some people.  I've noted some friends of mine playing a lot less, as have others.  It's real enough.<br />
<br />
By the way, those casual guys are paying the check for your server.  Instead of calling them real life losers on the one hand or pretending they don't exist on the other, you might as well just face the fact that there are problems -- especially when other people acknowledge seeing and facing some of the same problems.  Just putting your head in the sand and saying that it didn't happen to me, therefore it didn't and can't happen to anyone else is, well oblivious.<br />
<br />
If there isn't an expansion out with at least a few high-level zones, the game is going to be in trouble.  <br />
<br />
And please -- no 65 wants to go hang around Lguk.  That's just stupid.  It's good enough for you if other people's game experience sucks, perhaps -- congratulations on your level of understanding.

I just feel like i am under so much pressure any more just to get to level 60 and join a high level guild that it has taken alot of fun out of the game for me. Alot of the high guilds have gotten so picky now that it's almost impossible to get into them. Even after PoP came for the first few weeks i kept myself busy and enjoyed working on a few quests either solo or in small groups. But they are done now or require a raid force to go any further. Being on Kane Bayle doesnt make it any easier since there have been very few pickups raids anywhere. In fact, I think i led the only successful pickup raid on Vox. Half the time i log on and just run around a little while, maybe do some alchemy for any potion orders i get, work on a little exp then either just sit there and bs in the market while lfg or talk to my friends. <br />
I cant wait til LoY comes out so i can have more fun stuff to do by myself or with a few friends. Right now this is just somethign to get by with until EQ2 comes out.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>bah!</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">Noone is stopping people from going to other zones. Your not exactly stuck in the few teir one PoP zones. If you are 65 and cant get flagged its not really a problem with the game, more like a problem with you.<br />
<br />
If by the time you have reached 65 level you cant find 5 other people to do a single trial in PoJ there is something wrong. Even casual players know people.<br />
<br />
Vi has already turned the game into a cakewalk compared out to how it was released, why do they have to make it any easier?<br />
<br />
Also a casual player does not go from 1-51 in 29 hours. Only people who do that are powergamers, or people who were powerleveled. You also said your warrior, how many other guys ya got? Total up their /played time and still say your casual.<br />
<br />
edit: Nm dont bother answering, i read a couple other of your posts and your clearly not a casual player. Anyone who is one of the few high level people on their server at 60 isnt casual, and to top it off you got a few high level twinks, surely if you can manage to do all this you can pass one friggen trial?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">&quot;I know, i got it just fine.&quot;  Obviously you didn't; you posted extensively showing that you didn't, and rudely too, into the bargain.  Apparently you have some aggression to let out; thank you for gracing us with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll just have to excuse me if i dont applaud your &quot;something's in my way, i quit&quot; attitude. &quot;  Considering you didn't even come close to understanding the clear and well laid out argument at all, despite it's being repeatedly explained to you, it's quite a stretch to say you understand the supposed &quot;attitude&quot; behind it.<br />
<br />
Your responses have been inappropriate to the point of being non-sequiturs at times, and aggressively rude and contemptuous, while injecting little insight to speak of.  I think the major insight they provide is insight into you -- a subject I doubt anyone came here for.  <br />
<br />
Except for you maybe.<br />
<br />
Good luck working it out.  <br />
<br />
It's a shame you put so much emotional investment in everyone being exactly like you.</div></div><hr />

Gikk, you couldn't make less sense if you tried.  Put the bong down.<br />

I liked this post by Thurdar from this thread:<br />

POP is an expansion that's aimed for the high level EQ crowd. <br />
<br />
If that statement were true, we wouldn't be having these discussions. Pop is an expansion aimed at a certain subsection of the high level EQ crowd, but certainly not a majority of them. Pop is a nice expansion if you're in a dedicated (not necessarily uber) guild or if you don't mind tedious time-sicks to advance. At a guess, that's maybe 25% of the high end EQ players? <br />
<br />
Given how long EQ has been around, there's a lot of casual high level players these days. Before PoP, you could basically avoid time sinks if you felt like it and it didn't really affect how well your character advanced. At worst you lost out on most of the Phat loot (epics, shawl quest, ToV loot etc.) and one or two zones per expansion if you avoided the time-sinks but that was about it. <br />
<br />
Now PoP comes out and tedious timesinks have suddenly become required to advance your character. Not only that, the people you group with have to be just as dedicated. <br />
<br />
Your post on how to advance in PoP did a pretty good job of showing why I dislike the system so much; the fact that people have to jump through those kinds of hoops to advance. <br />

Luclin had a large diversity of target levels for it's zones. It's nice that everyone can get enjoyment out of it, but for a lot of us, about half the expansion is a waste of zones. For me, I only used the UP, VT, Ssra, FG, and Deep zones for hunting. [snippage] So ya, while I CAN access every zone in the expansion, I only functionally use about 25% of all the zones in the whole expansion. <br />
<br />
So I take it you would have preferred that UP, VT, Ssra, FG, and Deep each required a guild raid or a 10 hour camp just to get access to the zone? <br />
<br />
I just don't see the logic in it and I think it's a mistake that you have to jump through those kinds of hoops just to get into exp zones. What exactly was the problem with the previous system where the toughness of the mobs determined where you could hunt? <br />
<br />
Somewhere in the whole flag process, it crosses the line from fun to tedious for me. Obviously the PoP designers agree with you and not me in this discussion, but that doesn't mean I won't call 'em misguided and out of touch with most of their player base for doing it. ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">bah -- as I said in the original post, I passed the trials a long time ago.  The problems I'm pointing out are not necessarily the same ones I face.  I'm just pointing the out.  But I can see others facing them.  And have seen it. <br />
<br />
I sometimes feel pretty critical myself, although I try not to say anything inside the game and make people feel bad, of people racing to 65 with no AA or spells and crappy armor and maybe no epic(at least some epics are fairly easy and can even be partly multi-quested) and then feeling trapped because they don't know how to get out of tier 1 or tier 2, yet stuck themselves in positions where they can't get anything but really crappy experience anywhere else.  I think they were dumb to put themselves in that position, but once it's done, it's done.  Hindsight doesn't do them any good.<br />
<br />
The expansion should have taken guys like that into account a lot more.  In my experience, pretty much everyone raced to 65 as fast as they could.  People are impulsive!  I know two guys who did it in about a week.<br />
<br />
I'll bet those players would still like to play a lot more though, and I'm sure Verant still wants as much of their money coming in as they can possibly get.  And Verant wants them to continue to buy as many expansions and new products as possible, well into the future.  Reasonable assumptions, both.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure those goals are in conflict with the way PoP is working out now for a very notable percentage of people.</div></div><hr />
