ropes. When you pulled on the ropes the mattress tightened, making the<br />
bed firmer to sleep on. Hence the phrase &quot;goodnight, sleep tight&quot;.<br />
<br />
33. It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4,000 years ago that for a<br />
month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his<br />
son-in-law with<br />
all the mead he could drink. Mead is a honey beer and because their<br />

34. In English pubs, ale is ordered by pints and quarts. So in old<br />

<br />
35. Many years ago in England, pub frequenters had a whistle baked<br />
into<br />
the rim or handle of their ceramic cups. When they needed a refill,<br />

the whistle to get some service. &quot;Wet your whistle&quot; is the phrase<br />
inspired<br />
by this practice.<br />
<br />
36. In ancient England a person could not have sex unless you had<br />
consent of the King (unless you were in the Royal Family). When anyone<br />

them a placard that they hung on their door while they were having<br />
sex. The placard had F.*.*.*.(Fornication Under Consent of the King)<br />
on it. Now you know where that came from.<br />
<br />
37. In Scotland, a new game was invented. It was entitled Gentlemen<br />
Only<br />
Ladies Forbidden.... and thus the word GOLF entered into the English<br />
language.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Canoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">heh, lot of interesting facts bud... but isn't number 22 wrong?<br />
<br />
Thought the rams won 2 years ago?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fingelfin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No Canoe, Redtree found it on the internet - therefore it MUST be true.<br />
<br />
Which is weird, because I was pretty sure that Ozzie and Harriet predated the Flintstones . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yep Ozzie and Harriet came 8 years before the flinstones but i've not been able to find any information regarding their filmed bedtime shenanigans.  Also, I will some day find a way to disprove number 16!!  it can't be true!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well i'm not happy about the answer but here it is for number one.  it just seems anticlimactic for some reason, which now that i think about it, was probably the point of fifties television :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fingelfin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, very ironic that the very fist domestic comedy was also the very first sitcom in which a cople shared a bed; starting in 1947 no less.  It's funny how politics goes in cycles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hoarmurath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heheh, Snopes debunks about 80 percent of that list.  Good fun, though.  Snopes is a good place to go anytime you are checking the validity of a rumor or urban legend, etc. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">22. No NFL team which plays its home games in a domed stadium has ever won a Super bowl. <br />
