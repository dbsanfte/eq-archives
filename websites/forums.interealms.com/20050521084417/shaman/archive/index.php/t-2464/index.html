<br />
OMG they UN-nerfed something!  Wow, and I thought this line of spells was intentionally broken forever.  It never did make any sense whatsoever to have this spell only castable on line-of-sight critters.  Made it completely useless actually.  Unless you just wanted to follow a puller around, since it still worked on groupies ok.  Possible uses now . . hrrm. . still can't think of many.  Aside from perhaps using it in certain dungeons to check if a certain mob is up thru chain bind sight.  <br />
<br />
Changes to NPC casters sound reasonable for once, rather than completely off the deep end as is normal for VI.  <br />
<br />
The shadowhaven faction amulet should be more useful now?  Hmm. I destroyed mine when I got it cause it actually lowered prices for me a tiny amount.  I have a +6 char neck slot as normal gear and the amulet is only +4.  Maybe I'll have to run around and do that quest again real quick just to see how it works now.  <br />
<br />
Well at least they didn't nerf anything this patch.  They've been nerfing like crazy the last few patches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good fixes, assuming they work as intended.  When the list of upcoming fixes to NPC casters was posted on the dev forum the other day, I honestly didn't expect to see more than one or two of them make it into today's patch.<br />
<br />
The AI upgrade is a great example of why the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  In principle, the changes were a great idea, and had it been done properly we'd have (almost) all been elated.  As has already been stated elsewhere, prior to the patch casters were notorious wusses.  Unfortunately, they obviously rushed the 'fix' in with little to no real testing.  Now due to player outcry, these changes are being rushed in with little to no testing.  It should be quite interesting to see what sorts of issues these changes introduce...  Personally I think the right thing to do would have been to back the A.I. upgrade out, and reintroduce it once these fixes have been thoroughly tested.<br />
<br />
Now I'm anxious to test these out when I get home from work.  Once the servers are back up, hopefully we'll see some feedback on how well / poorly these changes affect things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, the Vision bit caught my eye too. :)  For those of you who've never used it that way before, you could 'hop' through a dungeon from the zone.  But be wary, because I also read about people using it in Permafrost to spy on Vox - and getting summoned. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm..no mention of the NPC's having to use line of sight rules....<br />
<br />
Something tells me this was intentionally &quot;missed&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah,<br />
<br />
Woop De Doo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Figured the NPCs having to use Line of Sight wouldn't make it.<br />
<br />
Not only is it probably a bear to put in, it's easily exploitable.  It's alot easier for a PC to duck and hide to avoid a spell than an NPC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was hoping they'd fix/change the focus item effects. Some of them (mask from Yelinak, melee eye from Nevederia, Onyx Gauntlets from Vyemm) have really poorly thought out effects for the people that use those items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As i recall kylong gloves where pretty nice altho I don't remember the stats off hand. Always nice to have a bit more selection.<br />
<br />
The acrylia armor needed some help but the weapons sure didn't. Hopefully they added a nice upgrade to the armor.<br />
<br />
Lets see if they got it right this time, They said the clay was stackable last patch too =)<br />
<br />
I'm assuming this means the chain classes which would be nice. My only complaint about the chain stuff was that while the plate compairs favorably to the SS armor on ac the chain stuff didn't even match the pog armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Keeping my fingers crossed on the chain stuff as well. As is, it isn't worth the time nor cost for most pieces (except bracers, I like resists :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unless they changed it with this patch the Kylong BP is both ND and not shaman useable.<br />
<br />
Quite why I have no idea as other pieces used to be iks/shm wearable and tradeable. I kept one in my bank for about 5 levels hoping they'd change it one day.<br />
<br />
And yes, Kylong gaunts are rather nice mid level gloves, only used to see rangers and Iksar shaman after them so they were always cheap.<br />
<br />
Kylong Gloves<br />
AC: 12   WT: 3.0<br />
AGI+4  WIS+4  SV DISEASE+2  SV MAGIC+2<br />
<br />
edit: duh, didnt notice the bit in the message specifically about the Kylong BP. No mention of Shaman. So still no full red chain set for us, bleh. I always had a secret desire to have full set of deep red armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Truunka gotz Junk in da Truunk! :P<br />
<br />
HUGZ TRUUNKA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/wave Grakk<br />
<br />
Hullo my friend!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Believe the Kylong greaves are 16ac 4str.  Not sure about the weight.<br />
<br />
Logged in and nothing had changed with my acrylia cloak, but not sure that's the armor they were talking about.  Said something about the acrylia smithed armor?  Not exactly sure what they were talking about.  Thought all the acrylia armor was tailored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There is a smithed Acrylia armor around too, you just don't see it that often.<br />
<br />
It looks like they upped the AC of the older cultural stuff. At least, that's all I've seen mentioned so far on the eqtraders smithing board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">All this is is another in a long series of poorly thought out changes. Hell, I would have to say it seems as though they didnt think at all. The changes they are talking about are threatening to unbalance the game again. this time in favior of players, but still, unbalanced. The longer it remains unbalanced in one way or another, the more chances they have for digging their hole deeper (which is what they will do, it always gets worse before it gets better with verant) and screwing things up worse. <br />
<br />
Could the caster NPC's have used some slight tweaking? Yes, I suppose they could have. But when the game has been balanced on the way that they behaved for about 3 years, then they introduce drastic changes to just ONE side of the equation, the balance flies out the window. Anyhow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">According to EQTraders boards, bunch of old cultural got tweaked, along with acrylia armor and weapons.  From the brief look I took, Acrylia plate will be a decent choice for BP and legs for pre-planar.  Chain is still crap and iksar skyiron is unchanged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They gotta nerf True North now. It's too powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just you wait, one of these days an end MOB will have AE True North as an attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;The Bind/Cast Sight line of spells now works as it used to. You do not need to have line of sight to your target to use this spell&quot;<br />
<br />
Talk about some funny crap.  I remember a certain representative at Verant talking all kinds of crap about how the old way was bugged.  Pretty funny to see them come full circle :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">6th ring quest fixed yet?<br />
<br />
First the ghost wasn't spawning. Now, Poxbreath Yellowfang doesn't pop after you follow the wolf to the rygorr camp. grr. I'm kicking myself for waiting to start this thing.</div></div><hr />
