<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">5 months till EQ expires for me.<br />
Was going to quit MMoRPGs but the more i hear about WoW the more i like the sound of it so am tempted.<br />
Few totally basic questions i would like answered if poss.<br />
<br />
1. 1.6ghz PIV,128MB gfx card. Would this be enough to run it ?.<br />
2. What is the community like so far.I ask this as i went to their forums to have a look and it was basically full of what id call arseholes who use stuff like &quot;uber l33t dood sukxzors&quot; etc.:).<br />
3. Does the game have any zoning as such.Just ask this as i read Verants new game will be seamless.<br />
<br />

PS Question number 2 is why i posted this here and not on the Blizzard WoW forums btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Plenty of horse power.<br />
2. Pay no attention to the B.net jerkoffs on the official/beta forums who think that any game without PvP is 'teh suck'. There are some good posters there, but you have to filter through a lot of crap to find them.<br />
3. Only time you zone is when you change continents or into an instanced dungeon. Everything else is completely seemless.</div></div><hr />

1. I ran the stress test on an athlon 900 with a nvidia gforce2 64 meg vid card. It ran as smooth or smoother than EQ did post luclin (I ran eq with old models mostly). Actually going ld in classic fashion happened a grand total of once during the whole test.<br />
<br />
2. The community is what you make it. The people I interacted with in the stress test were good people. Word on the street is that once the payment plan takes effect a lot of the L33t D00ds will find other pastimes that don't come with a monthly bill. Expect a lot of whatever you're used to in EQ combined with a game design created with an eye towards minimising friction between players. Incidentally, I don't recall anyone complaining of having been trained either in ooc or other channels during this time either... Neither have I suffered trains of any sort (other than bad pulls). <br />
<br />
3. Seamless on a per continent basis. The only times you will see a loading screen is on entering the game and when taking the boat or zepplin to another continent. These trips are handled in the classic movie style of showing a map with a red dotted line appearing from one point to another. On the continent itself, you can walk from one ocean to the next and the only indication that you have zoned is that the name of the new zone will appear for a few seconds on your screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. I have run closed beta on my 1.5 GHz Centrino Tablet PC (with 32 mb nVidia card! - below min requirements) and the game is easiy playable.  On that machine I give up some screen resolution and graphics detail for higher frame rate.<br />
<br />
2. Jerks are everywhere.  In my experience, there a fewer in the closed beta because we are there to do a job.  The Stress Test opened the door to the maximum number of jerks since it was essentially free (more than there will be with paid membership after release probably).  The game is big enough and the internal mechanics are built well enough that the impact from jerks is mitigated (no KSing, no &quot;non-consensual&quot; PvP, no &quot;special drop&quot; single mobs, plenty of stuff to kill, shared quest items via grouping, etc).<br />
<br />
3. &quot;Zoning&quot; (screen switching to non-play while loading of new region takes place) happens in one of 4 instances in my experience: 1. Changing continents via ships/zeppelins, 2. Teleporting either using a hearthstone to teleport back to your bind point or via teleport spells, 3. Dying and being &quot;teleported&quot; to the nearest graveyard, and 4. Zoning in or out of an Instance Dungeon.</div></div><hr />
