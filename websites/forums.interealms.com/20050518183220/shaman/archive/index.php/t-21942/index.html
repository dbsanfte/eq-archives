<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, i'm just wondering if I do a right-click on my C drive, will it wipe my other drives also (C being the one with my OS). I've never done this before, so i'm just asking ahead of time.  Will I need to reinstall windows XP?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Howee_C</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you mean right-click and choose &quot;format&quot;, it should only format that particular partition or drive. Whether or not it will actually let you do that (wipe the OS partition) from within Windows I have no idea. Never tried it. I HAVE done it to format OTHER partitions on the drive after setting up XP on the C: partition, however.<br />
<br />
(Does Windows have a sense of self-preservation? I can just hear the response after trying that... &quot;I'm sorry Dave, I just can't do that&quot;) :)<br />
<br />
But if you format the OS partition, yes, you will have to reinstall SOME kind of operating system...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, generally speaking right clicking on your hard drive will only open a context menu . . .<br />
<br />
What are you trying to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes.<br />
<br />
/me promotes fear in the masses.<br />
<br />
No, just right-clicking on a drive will not cause you to have to reinstall Windows.  It takes a bit more than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, heres the problem.  When I use my router to transfer files, the router is somehow storing information on the C: when it should be on my D:.  So I have a folder which is 12gigs which I can't delete anything in it.  Yet my D: still uses the space from the transfered file, which means I still have around 80gig's or so left on my D:.  <br />
<br />
Kinda complicated to explain, yet that's the jist of things.<br />

<br />
Are you saying the files appear on C: instead of D:?<br />
Or are you saying the files appear on both drives?<br />
<br />
If it is the first case then it is the way you have your Shares configured, likely only a folder on C: is shared and none on D:<br />
<br />
Do you get a message when you try to delete the files from C:? If so what is the message? Please be as detailed as possible when describing the problem. Many of us, I am sure, can help with the issue but it is difficult to diagnose a problem with general descriptions when you cannot actually see what is going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, here goes.  I'll try and explain it a little better.  I have only the one hard drive, which I petitioned into two.  The C is 20 the D is 80.  Now the problem came up when I was doing a file transfer with my brother.  He sent me 4 gig's through msn (don't ask :P).  When he did, the file was saved into C:\Documents and Settings\Al Petras\My Documents\My Received Files. <br />
<br />
	After realizing it went into the C, I quickly cut and pasted it onto my D drive.  When I checked the C drive for the space that was left, it simply showed 4 gig's less than I originally had.  So I did a little check, I sent a different file which was 7.5.  The same problem arose, so I lost a total of 11.5gigs of space somehow.  Now when I go into My Documents, right-click, it will say that there is 11.5 gig's in this folder (even though I removed these files).  I opened the folder up further to the al petras section.  Right-clicked,  I got the same amount 11.5gigs.  I've tried to delete this folder completely, yet I had no luck. <br />
<br />
	It told me that it was required for windows.  So now this folder has nothing in it, there is no hidden files, it says there is something in it, and it can't be deleted.  I think that there is about the best I can do when it comes to explaining it, if you'd like I can try to get a little more into details, yet really I can't get much more than that.  I'm starting to wonder if formating would just save us all alot of time :).<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Formatting almost ALWAYS saves a lot of time.  It's a PITA to reset everything, and that's the main reason people want to fix problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Urm... empty your recycle bin.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, I dug a bit more, than used ms-dos.  After I used ms-dos I was able to find the file.  For some reason it was saving the files as hidden tmp's so I just deleted them from dos.  Don't ask I have no idea.  Thanks for trying to help though, really appriciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Translating from german here so some of these might be labeled differently for you:<br />
<br />
In the windows explorer go to:<br />
extras -&gt; options -&gt; view (second tab) -&gt; show all folders and files<br />
<br />
Check that box.<br />
<br />
You should now be able to see those files in windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Had that on, yet still they wern't there.  Gotta love XP.  Still, dos worked so it's all good heh.<br />
