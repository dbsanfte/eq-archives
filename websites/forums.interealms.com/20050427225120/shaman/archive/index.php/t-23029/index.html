<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Out of retirement and tired of making forged  javalens for my monk so I was going to venture to the Ssraeshza temple with my monk(60), to get the Dusty Soriz Worker Pouch.  I was curious if it is worth staying here for a bit for exp/loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not really for loot, but i know of 1 mage who, as pop came out, lvled to 65 in 4 days in sraa...well prolly he stud 24 hours per day there *gg*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Outside the raid targets in SSRA, other than the emp key (Ring of Shissar) there isn't much for drops imho.  The exp hasn't been too bad for me at lvl 65 with the snakes and if you get a good group going, the exp in the mines can add up quickly.  The exp itself isn't all that large off of the skeletons, but you're constantly pulling/fighting so it's a near endless stream of exp coming in (ymmv).  Had some really fun times with friends there, helping them farm lucid shards for VT key.<br />

Edit: spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kirenaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ssra isn't too good pure exps unless you get a really good group running in the basement, usually AE groups work the best because of high chain aggro and sow speed runners. The named loot is usually junk, but it should be easy enough to convince others to come help you get your pouch with reminders of shards and the elusive green metals used in Bane weaponry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I find the basement of Ssra to be rather invigorating.  I ran it the other day with me, 65 SK, 62 Pally, 62 Ranger, so I was on CC, heals, Slows and everything in between.  No deaths, but there were definitely some close calls.<br />

Hint:  Load Tigirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I actually found Ssra to be ok XP doing snakes and such. On the issue of the pouch take a look at these:<br />

Remember when hunting in the mines if you don't have a snarer don't use procing weapons - they break root! Unless of course the thought of the nekid CR thrills you. hehe</div></div><hr />
