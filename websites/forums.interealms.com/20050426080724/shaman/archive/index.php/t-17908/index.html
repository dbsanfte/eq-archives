<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mortenous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have heard it a thousand times on boards across the internet.  That Shamans are the best solo class after 60, or after 65, or after 65 and the Cann 5 AA.  I have yet to meet a 65 Shaman or a 65 Shaman, or a 65 Shaman With Cann 5 AA who would not tell me that a Necro is not better at soloing.  I'm not going where you think I am with this.  I like my shaman a lot, am playing him in early 50's now and LDoN is awsome.  I have a Necro that could solo PoN courtyard at 51 and am wondering if I will have the same solo experiences as I was planning on, or will I have to wait much much longer for the same zones.  <br />
<br />
I had thought that Malaise + Root + DoT's, and maybe adding hasted pet to a 75% slowed mob would rule through most of the game, but it does not seem to be the belief overall.<br />
<br />
Would some Shaman in these ranges, 60+, 65+ and Elemental please give me an idea?  Long time players who have done more then 1 of the favored &quot;solo&quot; classes please also add your 2 cents.  I love to solo, but hate the group role of a necro, so I was thinking shaman could be my choice, but I'm not really willing to give up much solo power just so raids could be a little more fun when I need gear upgrades.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It depends how you define &quot;best.&quot;  Shamans have always been known for being able to take out the toughest creatures solo.  Charm in PoP has largely changed this.  <br />
However, if you mean the best as far as soloing for the most exp per hour, we are behind quite a few classes depending on where you want to solo.  We aren't bad, we just don't kill fast enough to really be considered a top notch solo class anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">right on walruss...best is a term that needs further defined to answer the question at hand.<br />
<br />
my idea of the best he is speaking of-enchanter charm is LARGLY over powered and broken.  they are the best at XPing, taking down mobs solo or partnered that would otherwise take groups to do and overall farming gear/pp (solo or partnered).<br />
it is probable that a good enchanter can solo just about anything any other class in the game can solo, and do it faster.<br />
<br />
pop charm/slowmidigation/fearlvlcap was the death of necro/shaman solo kingage.  sadly, i might add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mortenous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I guess there are two.<br />
<br />
Can kill 200 dark-light blues an hour.<br />
<br />
Can kill 20 scary as hell mobs an hour.<br />
<br />
I usually prefer number 2, though I know various game changes have likely made one the preferred way to advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mortenous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One of my friends is a 61 and leveling fast enchanter who has done charm soloing for most of his gaming career.  Chanters are one of the tru power classes at soloing, there is no doubt there, but he has his own list of gripes, and i'm willing ot bet most high level chanters into charming agree.  The nerf stick hit hard with the reduce in the amount of magic resist a chanter can hit on their own.  This heavily effects charm breaks.  Secondly a 30% minimum exp loss when using charmed pets, even if you do 1 point of damage.  They fall into the burn down huge amounts of mobs fast category, but have issues in planes where mob magic resist is high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grumbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I solo quite a bit as a Shaman at 65th, mainly for cash and a little AA.  Shamans are a powerful soloing class.  Since our DOTs stack, I can deliver over 1200 points damage per tic in stacked DOTs.  Creatures go down quick if you play it right.<br />
<br />
Can't speak for the Higher level Necro, but I have noticed that my lower level Necro can solo better than my Shaman did at level 30.  Either class is a powerful soloing class, but I can see where the Necro has benefits that exceed the Shaman.  However, as stated earlier from previous comments, the Shaman can solo the tuffer mobs and it does take us a bit of time to take it down, but it's doable.  We are also masters at multiple mob soloing where the Necro has a more difficult time handling.<br />
<br />
An example of this was a mob that I was watching a 65th necro take on solo.  He did ok at the beginning till an add and then he just lost it.  At 15% health, he ran with no time to FD.  Well, low and behold, I at 64th (before the Q and no Torpor)went after both mobs after he left.  Frankly, I made short work of the mobs and barely got scratched.  Was sort of proud of the fact that I took on mobs that a Necro couldn't. It's gud to be the Shaman.<br />
<br />
Hehe, too bad we don't get the FD ability when things go bad.  Fortunately, they gave us SOW to outrun the mob.<br />
<br />
I've seen a high level Necro at work and its a pretty sight.  They are extreemly good at soloing and getting experience more efficiently than a Shaman at equal level.<br />
<br />
One last comment, once the Shaman obtains 65th, we gain the spell Quiescence.  If you were good soloing before, U become a master with this spell.<br />
Should be your first purchase at 65.  At 65th Level, I believe we obtain the solo capabilty that may exceed the Necro, especially with Canni 5.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to make a few comments.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">cani V &gt; litch in some places.  other times have the litch as a passave mana regen is &gt; cani.  it all depends.<br />
one thing not to overlook is necros can charm/buff, slow, mez undead.  we can slow and &quot;root&quot; but can't charm.  charm is insainly over powered and would push, without any doubt in my mind, a necro over the shaman in a solo situation.  then again charm for them is only undead, so take that as you will.<br />
<br />
shaman + necro is a sick combo.  i am pritty sure that 3 necros and i can drop paffa.  i tried with me, 1 averager to good geared necro and one sadly undergeared.  we needed 1 more person to act as CC since the 2 necro already had pets =/</div></div><hr />
