Also, the goddamn guild title is because I let Itchy the retard be GM and he was being funny, so I have a funny ass guild title.<br />
<br />
not bad damage eh? Think this will work. 1067 hit on one of the gnolls, yum. Best I have done to a peep so far is still 656.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Photoshop will convert really well.  If I want to convert the whole directory I use ABC.  Google for &quot;ABC converter&quot; and you get a 30 day free trial.<br />
<br />
I had lots of good screenshots but something went horribly wrong last night and I had to format.  Lost them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Mill, are you using CT Mod there (I notice the DPS counter which is now integrated into the basic 1.45 CT Mod download)  Can't beat that 'no waiting for the stupid quest message to slowly appear' option in CT. <br />
<br />
(I read fast, honest, and that darn thing just scrolls waaaay too slowly for my liking)<br />
<br />
I don't convert a lot of WoW images, but all my conversions to .JPG format have been using the inbuilt &quot;Save As&quot; feature in ACDSee.  Turns the monstrous 3Meg+ WoW screenshots into 100k or so and they still look great.  (see this one for instance : Random Screenshot from WoW (http://members.swiftdsl.com.au/~cube/graphics/NE-river.jpg)  )  I tried some other programs for converting the images to JPG, and the file sizes were still up around 400-800k.  It all depends on how much playing you want to do with the settings I suppose, but the default ones in ACDSee seem pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't think thats CT Mod, looks like cosmos from the little icon on the minimap.<br />
<br />
I'm using CT Mod, it's decent just for the extra spells bars.  I liked Cosmos but for some reason it keeps disconnecting me.  You guys know any other decent ui mods?  I try to stay away from the official WoW forums as much as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cosmos ya, really just wanted the extra tool bar, but little things about it are pretty cool, no problems as of yet. Will try that other stuff, thanks guys.<br />
