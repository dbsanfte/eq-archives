Same cast and recast time as Deluda's. It's only Test, but 99/100 times everything on test goes live. Hopefully, SOE will boost Shaman healing to compensate. <br />

I don't care much for pally's getting heals to the same power as ours, but I'm not tottally against it either. I don't know planned changes to our healing lines yet, so we'll see about it then.<br />
<br />
but as it stands, if paladins were given this without our ability increasing, it would seem overpowered. we heal slightly more (&lt;50HP) for slightly less mana (3 mana) with yoppa's (we also get yoppa's at a later level than paladins would get this spell.) but that difference is so marginal it might as well be exactly the same, and last I checked, paladins had &lt;b&gt;better&lt;/b&gt; access to &lt;b&gt;better&lt;/b&gt; healing foci than shaman do, simply because they are a plate class and we are a chain class.<br />
<br />
but we haven't seen slated changes for shaman healing yet. its just one of those &quot;wait and see&quot; situations. no point in calling for a nerf on a spell that isn't tweaked yet, and spells &lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; get tweaked alot before release, needn't I point out the history of the Maw line on test.</div></div><hr />

otherwise we better be getting a much bigger direct heal... This makes me a very sad panda... err bear... errr shaman :o</div></div><hr />

i disagree that you have to compare expansions. EQ expansions combine to make up one whole. compairing spell levels and spell power, makes much more sense...<br />

Well, if you are talking about spell sets as a whole, shaman at that level would likely be using a combination of their HoTs and fast heals. From that point of view the original assertion that pallies come close to out healing shaman is incorrect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I love the comments on that paladin thread.<br />
<br />
If we get a 3k+ targeted heal, we'd be encroaching in on priest healing. Pallies in CHO's? uhh, how about no.  ENCROACHING? hahaha.<br />
not sure on shammys top heal but im sure a 3k heal on a pally wouldnt be over theres.<br />
Shaman and Paladin heals were supposed to be equal, where they not? <br />
paladins were better healer than shaman and equal to druid b4.<br />
<br />
All gems.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The direct heal spells they cast can be as equal as they want, the difference in SpiritualSerenity-or-no, and 200/tickManaFromCanni-or-no still keeps them from being main healer in exp groups.

<br />
The spell looks good on paper, but as it is now, I don't even mem our high hp heal, because its completely worthless to me.  They are gonna add some hps to the heal and decrease the cast time from 5 to 3.8 sec..I still won't mem it most of the time.  I won't be able to cast it while fighting and after the fight, Hots are more efficent to top off hps.  <br />
<br />
Don't even sweat these changes.  Its not like paladins are gonna take any healing role for a group.  Shamans aren't even chosen for their healing most of the time.  Its a MUCH needed change for paladins and other classes, our heals now are not up to the damage that mobs dish out.  I do agree that shamans should get a bump in healing also, but either way its not gonna effect the shaman class one bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was thinking why they did this, finally putting Paladins over the top of Shaman healing.  What always seems to pop up in my mind, is that the Shaman feedback from this &quot;class re-invisionment&quot; shows that we do not want to be main healers.  So, they could be saying, &quot; Fine, if you dont want to heal, we will just give it to the Paladins then!&quot;.  Now, have we just blown our chances to get an upgrade to one of our abilities ?  Or, do you think they might give us another chance at improveing something else ?</div></div><hr />

Well, Daludas is a GoD spell, and as such is somewhat more difficult to get than our 68 spell. So, a 66 paladin allready has a &quot;better&quot; heal than the corresponding shaman. Nothing new there, and nothing has changed ;). Now, I know that if someone is organized enough, they can get the GoD spells without too much trouble, but, that is likely not the case with someone who is 66 now.</div></div><hr />

So what is it? Is this a MUCH needed change or is it useless since you are always tanking. You'll have to pick one, sir.<br />
<br />
Btw, I think Shamans should get a 4k nuke. Not like we can use it much anyway, since we are healing, slowing and stuff!</div></div><hr />

You have much more faith in SOE then I do. I will believe that Shaman are getting an upgrade to healing when their is a spell we can see.<br />
<br />
As far as Palis, I dont mind the upgrade as long as Shaman also get one but I wont hold my breath. These kind of things are why EQ is falling apart</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So what is it?  <br />
<br />
I am just stating the fact that giving paladins better heals isn't going to effect group dynamics in the least bit.  A shamans role will be EXACTLY the same as it was before the changes.  Even giving a paladin complete heal wouldn't change that much.  They couldn't be tanking and cast it.  They have a smaller mana pool then clerics and zero specialization, with lower skills.  All it would become is a nice patch heal after the mob was dead.  I am not suggesting that paladins get CH, but showing you an extreme expample of how no matter what paladins get for healing, they will never take the spot of a shaman/cleric/druid in a group.<br />
<br />
The changes to our FAST heals are nice, becasue when tanking we can buy another second or two if we need a fast patch heal.  The change to our BIG heal is nice, but I still don't think it will be fast enough to cast while fighting or good enough to make it worth it.<br />
<br />
Shamans should and WILL get improved heal spells in the future.  Just relax and see.  SoE will at least keep the ratio the same from before and after the upgrades, so these changes will help you.  If you ever group with paladins, you will be much better off now as you might be able to concetrate on dotting/slowing/debuffing/nuking more then patch healing the tank, which is what we all live for.<br />
<br />
P.S.- I also have a 66 shaman, so I am just as concerned as you, but focus your effort toward improving shamans and not trying to keep other classes down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm, if they ever fixed shaman healing ratios to make them worthwhile healers at least in a secondary healing capacity, I may consider returning.  As it is, I haven't played for over a year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I am going to make this my mission: Everytime I'll read secondary healer from now on I'll scream: The secondary healer role does not exist in EQ.<br />
<br />
People need to realize that groups can not afford to require 2 main healers, even though at some point or another there will be such situations that constitute the exception confirming the rule. But a group does NOT require or need a main healer AND somebody else filling up random people's HPs at this point. Your HoT does not save anyone in danger. That's fiction.<br />
<br />
This is nothing against Land or something, just a general statement.<br />
<br />
A quote from the superb movie &quot;Over the Top&quot;(serious!) comes to my mind: &quot;Second is ****&quot; or something along these lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well in WoW, which is my current game, shamans are probably the most powerful single class in the game.  Tho that's able to be contended of course, which is good.  Shamans, druids, and priests are very close on healing abilities, making any one of them viable for a group.  <br />
I know you all probably hate the comparison anymore, but it's worth doing to show how things COULD be.  It certainly seems easier to get a working group there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">&quot;As with Druids, we are looking to increase your healing ability so you can function better as main healer in groups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats a Direct quote from Brenlo from his &quot;Class reenvisioning post&quot; .<br />
<br />
So shamans can function as MAIN healers ... MAIN .<br />
<br />
Not Back up healer , not support healer ... not patch or secondary healer ...<br />
<br />
SoE is looking at ways to Increase our healing ability so that we can function better a MAIN healers .<br />
<br />
I 100% agree the concept of a &quot;Back up healer role&quot; is pretty much non existant . There are times when extra healing helps , Adds , ect .. but its not something groups are generaly built around .</div></div><hr />
