<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I've recently returned to EQ and created a troll shammy on the Stromm server.  Having played EQ in the past it wasn't hard to farm spiderling silks and do the newbie quests and decently equip myself (see clicky in signatrure).  I am now level 11 and have a question about my tactics.<br />
<br />
For solo I usally just pull with my poison dot and melee till dead.  The reason I do this is because I can only get 1 spell off before the mob is on me.  I suppose when I get root it won't matter.  Anway, can anyone share their solo tactics for a pre-doggy shaman?<br />
<br />
I grouped from level 6-11 in PC this past weekend.  I was the only healer in the group so that's just about all I did as we were taking on reds and yellows.  As a result my piercing was way low as well as evocatoin and the skills necessary for the dots/slows.  It seems there are very very few healers in PC so if I want to group there I'm going to be expected to be the primary healer.  It seems my choices will be group and have my offensive skills suffer, or solo and be at greater risk for death and make few friends.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am hoping some of you can share their solo and group strategy for this level range.  Also, check out my magalo.  I think he's doing pretty good for being my only character but there's something you can point out I can afford at my level by selling silks.  I usually farm a stack of silks before I log each night and sell them in bazaar while I sleep .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check the 1-20 hunting area - There are usually some good posts in there about low level shaman stuff.  <br />
<br />
I was clueless at your level (some probably think I still am), so I don't have any specific advice other than to grp as often as possible.  Your skills will catch up in the low 30s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">much has been posted, once you get going you'll find theres quite a bit of reading to catch up on :).<br />
<br />
At that level solo the method was to kill mobs fast as I could, rinse repeat. When I got the first root spell, then I would root the mob, apply dot/debuff, melee it down, root, heal, etc. rinse repeat. have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, I learned the hard way that I should leave solo'ing for later on.  I grouped up in PC lastnight and got 11-13.99975 (1.5 blue from 14) before my group split up.  I figured no prob I'll just solo a couple mobs in Hollowshade.  Low blues took me forever to kill.  Took like a half hour to get 1.5 blue at level 13.  So I figure I'll just group up and not worrry about skills too much till later on.  Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />

You said that you had played previously, so you probably already know this, but try your best to keep your melee skills up!  Especially your Defense skill!  Next time you try to solo, head to PoK and check the OOC chat to see if any shaman are offering buffs.  Anyone that asks me **nicely** for buffs gets them!  :-)  HoS or IoS will go a long way to hleping your melee skills raise quicker.<br />

Please don't let your time grouping in PC fool you!  XP will never come that easy again!  The rule of thumb that I use is &quot;one yellow bubble per hour.&quot;  If I'm not getting that much XP, I'm doing something wrong!  Yes, lvl 59 drove me nuts because I couldn't get that kind of XP anywhere.</div></div><hr />
