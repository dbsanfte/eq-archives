<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I've started a Troll Shammy who worships Innoruuk, with three main plans.  I really fancied Iksar, but the 3 items below sealed the decision for me.  Now that I'm playing a Troll, I'm really enjoying it :)  I'm currently level 9, and semi-owning the swamp area outside of the UGuk entrance in Innothule.<br />
<br />
1) Snare Necklace<br />
2) OT Hammer<br />
3) JBB<br />
<br />
My simple questions are:<br />
<br />
1) Bearing in mind that I have a level 60 Monk friend who can help me do the short quests, is it practical for me to get the Snare necklace soon, and does it have a minimum level limit for it's use?  I really want to be a dungeon dweller, and the necklace would help no-end.<br />
<br />
2) Am I right in thinking that I will be eligible to get the OT hammer?  I'm pretty sure the evil outpost will love me as a super-evil Troll :)<br />
<br />
3) How much is an OK price for a JBB?  I play on Antonius Bayle.  I can get a 'loan' of 10kpp from the above friend, but I assume that might not cover it? (Edit: I know this is not something I need to worry about for at least 30 levels)<br />
<br />
Actually, I've thought of a 4th question!  Have the high-end spells become noticeably more widespread since the spell-drop changing patch?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. You have to be at least lvl 15 to use the effect<br />
<br />
2. Once you are amibly in OT, hand in a jade and get the hammer<br />
<br />
3. It depends on ur server , about 12-15k in ayonae ro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you might start out indifferent to the outpost guards - you need t be aimiable to do the hammer quest. Just hand in sarnak braids until you are, but remember the hammer doesn't work until level 50 so there's no rush :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">start at dubious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ulthaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i started apprehensive in OT as a troll shaman following inny<br />
<br />
by the time u get to mid 40s u will be amiable easy from handing in the braids from the sarnak bezerkers.....<br />
<br />
once you've done that grab ur hammer ASAP then u dont have to bother with OT faction anymore<br />
<br />
Im KOS to OT now after hunting in places like KC, etc and i can still hammer in easily.....the only mob i have agro is a green skeleton which i can just run away from......on the odd occasion u do get agro just use ur SoW like all good shaman do and run :P<br />
<br />
none of the mobs or guards can catch u</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Like Mukka said the necklace starts at 15 so start the quest as soon as you'd like. The OT hammer on the other hand will not proc until lvl 50 if I recall correctly...if not 50 I know its at least higher 40's or so.<br />
<br />
 Ulthaun has a point in that you dont 'need' VS faction after you get the hammer to actually use it because the only mobs in aggro range when you zone in are green. I on the other hand have found keeping my VS faction at amiable is a plus....you can bind anywhere you'd like and always have a fast easy place to bank and sell.<br />
<br />
Totally up to you though as allot of Kunark encounters will need you to lower VS faction....I just made sure I kept mine up :) I found from my starting faction(apprehensive) to amiable took about 10-15 hand ins(at 4 braids per hand-in)<br />
<br />
question 2 I cant answer since Im not on your server....prices fluctuate on Inno though...theres a hard core set of traders(as Im sure there is on every server) and they listen to all the nerf/lowerdrop rate hype and frantically set prices accordingly lol<br />
<br />
question 4...yes...the level 55-58 spells have been up-ed recently...bane, tigirs, ect. not a problem to get any more. Topors, Malo on the other hand.....;)<br />
<br />
g'luck to you my friend...you made the right choice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">2.  OT hammer only will be useable at 50 level.  In addition you need good VS faction to get it (amicable), but the quest is really easy as you just need to hand it some easy to obtain gems.  By the way, the braid turn in quest is great xp so just have you monk friend solo a bunch of sarnak and let you loot the braids<br />
<br />
3. JBB is only useable at 45 or 46th.  As to price, I see a wide variety of it :)</div></div><hr />
