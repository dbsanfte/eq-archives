<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brindelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Personally I would like it if they added a very high point value but very very good aug for epics only.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like my epic and I still wear it even though it has subpar stats, most people nowadays do not even do them especially if they are melee.<br />
<br />
I think something like this would motivate people to still go through some of the better quests in Norrath, and still force people who already have them to work to get a prime weapon instead of just getting a free upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Every expansion since Velious has talked about having Epic 2.0.  I'm surprised it hasnt happened yet.  Modifying the Epics to have 2 aug9 slots (for example) would be a cool way to upgrade them.  Allow players to purchase/find augs and round out their weapons individually.  But what do I know, i just got my epic last night.  :) :) :)<br />

Grats on your epic...Yeah another quest to turn your epic into an epic epic would be good as well but I think would take more work than giving it some good aug slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another 'epic' quest to upgrade your epic I could agree with and would support... Uberizing an epic via LDoN points I'd have to disagree with.  Epics weren't supposed to be gotten while you were grinding xp.  They were quest rewards for what, at the time, were long drawn out quests.  If they were to be upgraded in any way it should be through more questing.<br />
<br />
Epics are kunark era.  They're supposed to outdated now. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It would be nice to see a weapon that is called &quot;epic&quot;, one that took a lot of blood, seat, and tears to get, be worth equiping.<br />
<br />
Whether it be through the current augment process, or an uber-epic quest to upgrade one's epic, I would like to see SOE ad something to make the epic on par with current items, or even &quot;epic&quot; again!</div></div><hr />

I agree with you that it probably should be through an epic quest, not something gained while exping.  I guess I found it more likely for it to be implemented through LDON slots, plus maybe just bring it on par with a good luclin drop would be good enough for me.<br />
<br />
Also if it was through LDON i wouldn't have to wait 5 expansions before my family guild could get it!! ! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I figure Planar progression and the focus effects on higher Tiered armor are hard to compete with. In my opinion it would be nice to just add a slightly more powerful additional item, a 4th to add to the epic's other 3 items. Not neccessarily an offensive focus, maybe a defensive one. With the same unique quality that the original epics had. And about 3 more parts to the Epic involving some 65+ raid mobs on the new continent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Brindelin that is an outstanding idea. <br />
<br />
However, we at SOE discourage such &quot;outside the box&quot; thinking.<br />
<br />
Bailiff - whack his pee pee.<br />
<br />
(It IS a good idea though)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This sounds like a great idea, but I also don't like the idea of &quot;buying&quot; the upgrade through LDoN points.  My suggestion, make the type 9 augments quested.</div></div><hr />
