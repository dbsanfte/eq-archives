<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwedo18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">how do i make canov hot key ? <br />
<br />
like <br />
/g casting canov blabla<br />
/cast ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/g inc CANN5 dont panic . . . . .  USING Q<br />
/pause 20 ( adjust this number to your liking)<br />
/altactivate 47 ( im not positive thats the right #, been a while since i made mine)<br />
/cast 2 ( the slot i have Q in)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmm, you forgot a line, <br />
/target self<br />
also, I need at least a /pause 30 to make it work regularly, otherwise I end up with the infamous &quot;spellrecovery time not met&quot; error</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd suggest just opening the alt abilities window and using the hot key from there.<br />
<br />
a)  After the 1st or 2nd time, there's no need to spam everyone with &quot;Hey I'm cannibalizing&quot;.  They know you're a shaman, and hopefully with buffs you only drop to about 60% health anyways.<br />
<br />
b) you can click the AA hotkey and it will tell you when it will refresh - very, very handy.  <br />
<br />
I have the AA hotkey, and right above it is a canni announcement, for those rare occasions when I feel like the grp needs to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mrwallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's very useful to know when the ability is available again.  I just &quot;/g cannV&quot; the first few times or let them (the cleric) know up front that you will be using it.  Sometimes I don't use Q when casting because the cleric (in certain ldon groups) has too much mana.  I cannV and he quick heals with one shot to full health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to canni without hotkey for a while.  But with mobs hitting for 1200 the cleric doesn't have much time to decide if this was a canni or aggro.  So I prefer to tell them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm generally against hotkey spam but I think it's good to tie a message to canniV since the hp hit is pretty big and can be shocking to people at first...and even if they're used to it it's good to let them know you're doing canniV and didn't just get smacked hard.  On my main hotkey bank I have the straight up canniV hotkey, so I know when it's refreshed, and on my secondary bank I have a hotkey with the message tied to /alt activate.  I haven't tied casting Q to my hotkey yet since sometimes I Q before I canniV, and sometimes I Q after - just depends.  :)<br />
<br />
I tried going without a hotkey message at first and got tired of typing out 'canni' every time I hit it...and simply typing 'canni' wasn't clear enough as people would often heal me or wet themselves anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Having a fun message you play occasionally is good for a laugh.  The two I use on my hotkeys are:<br />
<br />
I'm starving! Dousing my arm in steak sauce!  (That never fails to get a laugh from the group)<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Mmmmm.... That leg looks mighty tastey!  (Not as funny but breaks the monotony)<br />
<br />
Both of those were made with GU comics in mind and the 'toon Woody made about shaman canabalizing.</div></div><hr />
