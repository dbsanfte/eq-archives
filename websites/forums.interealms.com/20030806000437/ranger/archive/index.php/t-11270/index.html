<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, as a Rogue in a past life, I've been wondering about this.  Never had much of an opportunity to try it, but now that I'm playing a Ranger who actually can hit things from a decent range, wanted to ask if anyone has done much of this.<br />
<br />
This thread on the Safehouse describes the tactic: <br />
<br />

<br />
Basically, you're just using sneak to reduce the aggro range and get single pulls. <br />
<br />
I'm just curious if any Rangers have ever tried this in dungeon situations where Harmony won't work.  I''m in Paludal, so I might try it tonight . . . (Of course, I'm not even 22 yet, so Harmony is a moot issue.)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting will have to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantom042</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, this does work for Rangers, and I sometimes use it if I simply don't have harmony memmed. One example of a good place to use this is at the orcs in Everfrost. Just pull from long range with a bow (bow range + arrow range &gt; 200 works I think), and no harmony needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Firion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, sneak pulling works well in many situations.  It's very useful for single pulling in indoor zones where harmony won't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm happy to report that, yep, it works.  I just pulled one blue /con bandit from the middle of the PC camp.  Warned the other two folk in the zone that I might be coming by with a train, first, but it worked like a charm.<br />
<br />
Man, I'm really liking being a Ranger.  I even got to root-park last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Alexzander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It does work yes, though not as consistently as it does for rogues (obviously).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>StarGazeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep, it works.<br />
<br />
I use a slightly different method though.  I use innate camo instead of sneak.  Seems to work better imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Had a (potentially) bad experience with this last night in PC.  I'm pretty certain I was sneaking - slow speed, hotkey stays down for a while . . . I went to pull a blue /con bandit from the northern camp. Of course, the first two arrows &quot;Couldn't hit your target from here,&quot; I guess because of the slope. Argh, sneak a little closer . . . pull it, and get two, one yellow. Thanks to Flashfire, the friendly 23 Wizard nearby.  With both of us rooting, he took care of it after I killed my blue.  <br />
<br />
But my question is, does it just not work all the time?  Or is it more likely that my sneak dropped somehow and I missed it?  I'd had good success with it before this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lauranthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't have it down to a science yet even though I've used it numerous times. But, given your account of two instances, one succeeded, one failed, it may be possible that you had to get too close to get a good shot. If you are in front of the mobs, you need much greater distance than if you are behind them.<br />
<br />
Another tip:<br />
We don't get confirmation messages like rogues, but there is a way to check to see if sneak worked. You can verify that your sneak attempt worked by sitting down and standing back up. If you hear the associated sounds for sitting and standing, sneak did not work.<br />
<br />
Using camo, hide, sneak and lev, it's possible to pull off some fairly miraculous things. I still enjoy using the OT bank with the General standing in front of me the whole time. You get some strange comments from the evils when they show up to bank and a wood elf is standing there in front of the general and he's not attacking. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
/em smacks himself in the forehead. <br />
<br />
Of course, that's it.  Forgot about the whole range thing.  And I have trouble judging range in the first place.<br />

<br />
Wish I could - this is Sullon, where someone would cast on me just to make my camo and hide drop so the General would kill me.  Maybe when I'm 60.  <br />
<br />
And thanks for the &quot;how to check Sneak&quot; tip - just discovered the self-targeting trick for Hide yesterday.  I love this place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Menlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To check if sneak worked before pulling, I always con any mobs that I'm worried about.  If they are indifferent, then you are GTG.<br />
<br />
Menlaan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lauranthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Conning only seems to work if you're behind the mob. Many times, I'm sneaking past mobs that are staring at me. They con kos, yet do not attack.  Ie, the General in the OT bank as mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Also, you can have sneak and hide activated at the same time as long as you're standing still. Once you move, hide drops though.<br />
<br />
Firing a bow does not drop sneak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Norwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think its been well summed up and covered  - yes Sneak pulling works and in some cases works well.<br />
<br />
However there will be situations that look IDEAL where it won't work (mobs reactions are linked differently, Red Con in camp, etc.) as well as many other variables that can impact it (level, Range, sneak on, hit by spell, etc.).<br />
<br />
I will say that with more practice, level and new zones it seems to be working much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hendrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It does work. I have used it in Velks Village to sinlge pull with arrows at 57 and just recently for the BoB quest when Hamrony wouldn't work on most the giants around the Captain. Nothing's 100%, but this certainly helps in the right scenario.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I sneak pull all the time, works quite well.</div></div><hr />
