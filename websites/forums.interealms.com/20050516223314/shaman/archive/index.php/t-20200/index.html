I'm more a casual player in a family guild, although the guild eventaully wants to gain a raiding focus. I don't know whether I'll ever see the Elemental Planes or even get my Epic, but I really enjoy playing a Shaman and that is all that matters.</div></div><hr />

Don't plan on ever being Elemental flaged at this time. Though I do LDoN hards and content in GoD.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">so far there seems to be a large percentage 40% of shaman at the higher end of the game, and the rest just a step down , which is interesting. Certainly the problem at higher levels will affect a good amount of shaman.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">make a new poll check how many AAs people have :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah, I was wondering the same thing. Don't see anything asking how many AA you have.<br />
<br />
On that note, I kind of laugh when people are ooc'ing for groups and tag how many AA they have in the ooc also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Got my Time Flag 10 months ago.   We still do Time on Sundays for the easy loot, but our main focus the rest of the week is high end GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">65 and will never be in elementals because I find raiding as enjoyable and tolerable as listening to Dr. Phil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Not entirely sure what the whole intent of this thread was about, but you're making a number of assumptions going into this poll that might make this poll inherently flawed.<br />
<br />
Not getting into it, but look at what this forum caters too and then look at the poll results - they're pretty much identical...<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, not saying this is a bad thing, I just wanted to point this out before people started drawing too many conclusions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Lvl 65 75 AA's flaged only for PoV, PoS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zrakkonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just hit 65 yesterday, 6 AA's, probably wont ever see the elementals as I dont have the time.  Small kids only allow for video games when they are sleeping :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">65, 200+ AA, PoTime flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Actually I assumed that most of the people who come here weren't 65, but I was wrong. With all the outcry about how the high end game was messed up for Shaman I was thinking that it was a vocal minority makin the noise, but in fact if this poll is semi accurate then a vast majority of the people who use the crucible on a daily basis are 65. Just thought it would be interesting to see what kind of a make up there is on the boards.<br />
I probably should have put up more options, but wasn't really thinking correctly I guess. thank you to everyone who has replied/will reply for satisfying my curiosity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">65, 136 aa, been in Time since end of October 2003, doing some Kod Taz trials in GoD days we aren't in Time.  <br />
<br />
Yes, raiding can be boring, but so can exp, and why get to 65 and not try to be the best, beat the hardest content, and have the best gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">65, almost 400 AAs, and my guild is 2 kills from PoT(coirnav and rathe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">and just to point out, that aside from lurking on these forums because of GoD, I didn't even got the Crucible for about 6 months just because I really didn't have anything that I wanted to know or talk about.  I'm sure that many are in the same boat (or just don't go to the general section because lately it's been a lot of crap.  Just being honest though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">65 and in PoTime. Only around 150 AA's though. I rarely get to exp these days except on weekends as my playtime during the week coincides with my guild's raid times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">65 130+ aa's.  Still goofing aorund trying to finish my flags, probably a month away from elemental flagged.  Not sure what good it will do me, but its fun stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">65, 142 aa's, non-elemental.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's next to no chance for me to see the Elemental planes, but if they're on a par with hard LDoNs and the mobs deep in the Sewers trials... maybe that's no bad thing!<br />
