<br />
standing mana regen for me - 5 per tick. ( 1 natural, earring of the solstice, MC 3)<br />
<br />
Canni 4 - 82 mana for 148hp. 2.25 cast time 3 second recast. I can cast it 11 times in one minute, for 902 mana, eating about 1600hp. Thats 10 ticks - 900 mana, good lord am I calculating that right? ~FT 90.<br />
<br />
Canni 5 is reusable every 3 minutes ~ 1100 mana for 1924hp.<br />
<br />
1100 mana/30 ticks ~ ft 36.<br />
<br />
+ bard song and crack (ench and beast and bo9) 41 more FT<br />
<br />
+ horse 17 more<br />
<br />
So if I am sitting around doing nothing but making mana and someone else is healing me, I can gen out about FT 189 MAX over a 3 minute period. I guess that makes since, my mana pool is about 3600 and I can go from a rez to FM in about 2 1/2 ish minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I doing this right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sounds about right ... but how often does that happen?  You've got plenty of delays (those damn melee always wanting buffs, trying to slow, malo, tank, pull, heal, root park, etc), that you're nowhere near actually generating that.<br />
<br />
I could refer you back to Thott's graphs of &quot;theoretical maximums&quot; if you're interested, but I'm pretty sure you saw the hubub caused by that =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahh clearly I forgot a graph to validate my point.<br />
<br />
And to answer your question, this will basically never happen, but it is a &quot;theoretical maximum&quot;. I'm mostly wanting to check my logic and train of thought as it relates to mana regen.<br />
<br />
FT 12089379857934 isnt worth a damn if you cant do anything with it. Shaman are just unique in this fashion. <br />
<br />
This isn't going to get us nerfed. This is why we have such a crappy heal, this is why we have crappy ratio's on our nukes, and mediocre ratio's on our dots, buffs cost a ton of mana...i've no problem with any of this, thats just how it is. Shaman are very self-sustaining once Torpor/Q are obtained (and i'd assume they are at lower levels now with Stoicism) ...but hardly overpowered 60+ as compared to most casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Krak, those numbers look darned close to the ones I came up with when I ran the Cann / Torpor cycles, too.  Looks right.<br />
<br />
Tho we can't do things as fast as other classes, we never need to stop.  We just keep going, and going, and going, and going, and...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Numbers match what I figured out a while back, so yea, should be right.<br />
<br />
I don't use canni5 everytime it pops though, so theoretical max doesn't mean much to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">assume you do nothing while recovery mana, best you can do per minutes is : 9 x canni4(5.25s) = 47 second ;  2 x torpor(6) = 12 second, 1/3 canni5 = 1 second, that 59 second total<br />
<br />
* Torpor = 1200hp/200mana ==&gt; 6hp/1mana without AA<br />
<br />
* canni5 = 1100 mana for 1924hp, minu torpor cost(6hp/1mana, 1924/6=320mana), it become 780 mana every 3 minutes(30tick), or 26m/tick;<br />
<br />
* cani4 = 82 mana for 148hp;  9 canni = 738mana,1480hp ;  torpor cost = 1480/6 = 243; so 495mana/10tick or 50m/tick<br />
<br />
* VoQ + song + Bst buff = 41m/tick<br />
<br />
* horse = 20/tick<br />
<br />
* MC3 = 3m/tick<br />
<br />
* FT item = 1/tick (max 15)<br />
<br />
total = 26+50+41+20+3+1 = 141m/tick (your calculate show 189 lol !!)<br />
<br />
280+700 = 4200<br />
thata mean if you have 3500mana, then it take 2.5minutes to get FM after MGB Fo7<br />
<br />
that is theory max regen rate for you, lots of time you FM or spend time do other thing; for average I only press canni4 about 3 time per minutes or less and mostly get mana from canni5 + horse + buff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya, as Shamam's numbahs show, da ting yu not takin inta account Krak is dat CannV takes 1924hp off ya, which needs healin sumhow (unless yer standin regen covers dat much in 3 mins ;)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sorry, but you analysis is incomplete unless you add some line charts from Excel.<br />
<br />
You get 1/2 credit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Do you really get the horse mana regen (for sitting) while casting a spell? I always thought you dopn't get that when casting, which will reduce the calculated mana regen by some.<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">BUt you have to realize, while you are sitting there doing nothing but making mana, you will be doing nothing else.  SHaman mana-making requires the player to spend his/her casting time doing the actual mana making itself.  In a busy group situation one also has to heal, slow, malo, and if time, DoT and/or nuke, and root park if necessary . . . also refresh buffs.  <br />
<br />
This mana regen is most noticeable when we have to buff a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You forgot to account for the casting time for torpor and the mana it takes, but yeah we are mana regenerating monsters when we have nothing else to do.  That's why spell haste is so important for us:  The less time we have to sit around waiting for spells to finish casting, the more time we can spend cannibalizing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For fun lets take Shamam's numbers and calculate shaman dps!<br />
<br />
<br />
assume you do nothing while recovery mana, best you can do per minutes is : 9 x canni4(5.25s) = 47 second ; 2 x torpor(6) = 12 second, 1/3 canni5 = 1 second, that 59 second total<br />
<br />
<br />
So 9xcanni4 = -1332hp; canni5 = -1924hp; 2xtorpor = +2400hp<br />
<br />
1332+1924-2400 = 856hp/60s = 14.2dps!<br />
<br />
Even when we canni our dps sucks how about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There that guy did it, you just figured out how much standing regen we need to have while makeing mana so that we will end up FM and FH at the same time, 14.2 Hp/s or 85.2 HP/tick ...... which i dont think that is posable to keep up for the time it would take a full mana regen shaman to get to FM. well the number would go down if you had some aa to extend torpor for some more healing but still .....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Grats on FT189... too bad to keep that up you can't do anything else (i.e. use any of that mana)</div></div><hr />

No sh1t I cant do anything with it. MY QUESTION WAS - AM I CALCULATING MY MAXIMUM MANA REGEN CORRECTLY OR AM I MISSING SOMETHING.<br />
<br />
Goodlawd.<br />
<br />
And to answer your question, this will basically never happen, but it is a &quot;theoretical maximum&quot;. I'm mostly wanting to check my logic and train of thought as it relates to mana regen.<br />
<br />

Thanks for reading entire thread.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">These calculations ignore the fact that you need to spend mana on torpor to help cover hp regen.<br />
<br />
So for example, net mana regen for Can 5 is <br />
<br />
1100-200 = 900 net mana<br />
<br />
so mana regen is 900 mana / 30 ticks = FT30<br />
<br />
It would be a bit more complicated for Can 4, but probably lower than Krak estimated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">3 minutes... 180 seconds... Lesse now.<br />
If you have someone else healing you, it's pretty straightforward.  Of course as already said multiple times this assumes you :<br />
1. Aren't doing anything else at all<br />
2. Have a mana pool large enough to need 3772 mana of refilling plus whatever extra mana regen from actual FT items, songs, buffs, etc...<br />
(i.e. FT15, Bard song for 21, VoQ for 18, SD for 9, MC3 gets you 66m/tick which in 180s or 30 ticks is going to add another 1980m, thus you'd have to have a mana pool of 5752 to actually achieve this max theoretical rate...)<br />
<br />
Cannibalization is 2.5 second cast time (-1924hp, +1066m)<br />
Torpor is 6 second cast time with 2.25 recast so effectively 8.25<br />
Cannibalize 4 is 2.5 with 3 second cast time soeffectively 5.5 (-148hp, +82m)<br />
<br />
32 x canni4 at 5.5 seconds including recast =176s<br />
1 x canni4 at 2.5 seconds, no recast delay on canni5 = 178.5<br />
2.5 for canni5 for a total of 181 seconds.<br />
<br />
Mana regained is 1066+(33*82)=3772mana<br />
<br />
3772/181 = 20.83977m/s X 6s/tick = ~FT125<br />
Add in 66 more for songs/buffs and you can indeed, theoretically, achieve a max mana/tick regen of 191!  Don't forget though you need to have a mana pool of at least 5752 and be completely OOM to start!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just out of curiousity I wanted to see how necros stack up.<br />
<br />
I took these numbers from lucy:<br />
<br />
Chorus of marr:                 21FT    20hp<br />
Spiritual Dominion:               9FT     9hp<br />
Blessing of the Nine:            8FT<br />
Seduction of Saryrn:          50FT   -63hp<br />
Blessing of Replenishment:             25hp<br />
AA(MC3, Regen3):               3FT      3HP<br />
Flowing Thought:               15FT   <br />
Horse (I will assume iksar):  18FT     11HP   unsure of these actually,<br />
                                                       but using your 17 horse, 1<br />
                                                       natural mana regen, and 11 for<br />
                                                       no reason in particular (should <br />
                                                       probably be more though)<br />
<br />
This is a total of 124 mana per tick or 124FT. 5 hp regen (that is the do not lose HP).<br />
<br />
This is all passive mana regeneration so they are free to cast any and all spells or simply wack off and they can still achieve this number.<br />
<br />
Now for shaman the numbers with canni 5 (but not canni 4 to make it simple should be like this)<br />
<br />
<br />
Chorus of marr:                                        21FT    20hp<br />
Spiritual Dominion:                                      9FT     9hp<br />
Blessing of the Nine:                                   8FT<br />
Voice of Quellious:                                    18FT   <br />
Blessing of Replenishment:                                   25hp<br />
AA(MC3, Regen3):                                    3FT     3HP<br />
Flowing Thought:                                    15FT   <br />
Horse (I will assume iksar):                       18FT     11HP  <br />
Canni 5(1066 mana,1924hp every 30 ticks): 36FT   -64HP<br />
<br />
This gives us a total of 128FT and 4 hp regen. This is not practical however, because the probability of casting canni 5 everytime on the second it pops is VERY unlikely. Furthermore, it is often dangerous to allow your hitpoint to regenerate via natural terms and therefore mana is spent to offset this (Torpor/Q).<br />
<br />
Canni 4 gives you 82 mana for 148hp every 5.5 seconds including recast.<br />
Over a 180 second period, assume you can cast this 32 times and you get. ~87FT and -158HP Adding this to our totals we get 215FT and -154hp per tick. Even if the 11hp natural I proposed is slightly larger, and the individual has 30HP/tick regen from gear this number is still at approximately -117hp/tick. This also requires precision timing probably not possible to produce. If someone else is healing this theoretical shaman, he could fill up 6450 mana in this 3 minute period. This should fill up pretty much any shaman mana pool out there. Now the downside is that <br />
a) You cannot cast anything else at all<br />
b) There is no point in sustaining this past the 3 minute period since you cannot deplete any mana while gaining it.<br />
<br />
I would say in most practical situations necros have us beat or at least matched in mana regen simply due to the fact that their's is all passive and incremental vs the active and sudden mana regen of the shaman. Not to mention their dots/poison nukes are far more mana efficient. Of course they can't slow or buff or heal quite as well so it's a tradeoff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You do realize that by your own data, shamans who does nothing except pressing a button every 3 min can achieve FT128.<br />
<br />
You do also realize that by your own data, the shaman can spend half that time casting can4, getting another ~FT43, for a total of FT171. At this level of mana regen, the shaman still has aproximately 90 sec per 180 sec to cast whatever he wants.<br />
<br />
That just proves one thing. A lazy necro, similar to a lazy beastlord, is far more useful than a lazy shaman.</div></div><hr />
