<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen a couple posts where people said fish in PoS are really good exp.   in the desert area, there is a pond surrounded by armadillos with a waterfall in it, that has like 6 &quot;a fish&quot; type mobs that are blue to me at 63, i tried to engage one and the whole pond came. <br />
so i assume the place people were talking to is somewhere else in the zone.<br />
heres a couple questions i was hoping to get answered: where are they? whats the best camp spot? are there any kos mobs i should be watching out for while in the camp?  what do they hit for? cast? total hp?<br />
<br />
thx in advance.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what Ive read in the previous post and what I understood was those fish are in the lake where u zone in (where the GY is) ... you can find them  using sense animal. I dont know if there is any KoS mobs tho sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ah ok, thanks divinator.<br />
