<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bumbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So i'm wondering... anyone found a good EQ2 shaman/priest community?... <br />
<br />
I'm not saying the people here are bad...  :p<br />
<br />
But, a MB and site dedicated to the EQ2 shaman would be nice. I still consider this the best and only EQ1 shaman community, but it's lack of EQ2 content is leaving me to seek other message boards for info and questions.<br />
<br />
<br />
So... Anyone know of any primarily shaman EQ2 message boards or sites?.. i can't find any...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and i found a good Scout/predator board if anyones interested. I found that http://www.thescoutssanctuary.com/ is a great replacement to the safe house.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, there's EQ2 Priests (http://www.eq2priests.com/), but I haven't found it to be that great. We're trying to rework the boards to give equal treatment to EQ, EQ2, and WoW, see this (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=25062) thread in the General forum for more info and put your two cents in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Toktuk, I checked out the thread in the general section (Your second link in the post) but didn’t see that thread to be one for suggestions on what to do for an EQ2 section of these boards, but rather people debating the relevancy of EQ2 and WoW on the EQ1 side of the boards.<br />
<br />
What are the plans to include Class, Quest, Spell and other information pertinent to EQ2 Shaman classes here?<br />
<br />
I haven’t found anything on the net yet, but when I’m REALLY stuck on a quest, I’m finding it tough to find a place with viable info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, the thread started out as a whine about EQ2/WoW posts, started to get constructive with some good suggestions for re-working the boards, and then delved into more whining and flaming once again. Last post from Glori was here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showpost.php?postid=312582&amp;postcount=72). It looks like there are plans underway to give equal treatment to EQ, EQ2, and WoW, she just hasn't had the time to do it yet.<br />
<br />
For general spoiler info on quests, I'm using a healthy mix of AllaKhazam's (http://eq2.allakhazam.com/), Google, and in-game info from guild mates.<br />

The thread starts out with complaining but keep reading it, the thread then evolves into a plan to change this board. Give it a couple weeks and I'm sure you'll see a place on this board for all your eq 2 posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2?no_redir=true<br />
<br />
You might have to search for some stuff but there's a LOT of info so far on the official forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Official forums don't have mods who are interested in maintaining information a - la Medicine Chest.<br />
<br />
Within a couple months those forums will simply be the same questions over and over and over.  We need something done here, or somewhere else to deposit and maintain Shaman specific information for the more experienced members of the community to share with the newer ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cradossk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to admit the conversation on the Sony boards is kind of bland and not very active. I'm dreaming of a Crucible that focusses on EQ2 still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That would seem to make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm also hoping for an EQ2 Crucible, this has been an excellent resource for EQ1. It would be nice to carry on the tradition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For those who want to make an EQ2 Crucible a reality, please send a forum private message to Glorianna and encourage her to make it a reality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried to send a message to Glorianna and it failed.<br />
<br />
I was able to succesfully send one to someone named Gloriana though.</div></div><hr />
