<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lvl 65, load of aa, got all of my spells. I want to exercise my abilities and see what I can solo. What I have done so far seems pretty minor but is a fun challenge like;<br />
Lodizal(hardest part is finding him up)<br />
Guardian Wurms(Finished with 80m the other day on one of these)<br />
Gantru Dalkenr(GREAT FARM MOB)<br />
Gantru Raldukan(easy)<br />
Netherbian Flesheater<br />
A Cliff Golem(for fun annoying amount of hp though)<br />
Shak Dhak Warlord(pain in the ass to pull one, unrootable so annoying when run dropped Dathor great hammer 5th one I killed)<br />
A Corrupted Elysian Elder(Annoying to pull one again)<br />
A Shadowy Assassin(Another one hard to pull had to kill with entirely cold nukes pr/dr resistant)<br />
Cracked fingerbone trial Gunthak(think is this one, is 2nd hardest one)<br />
Load of Nadox names, Undead weaponsmith/Decaying Fisherman blah<br />
A Black Reaver( Opportunity came up once I had one single pet tanked and just chain torpored, would be much easier now)<br />
Camps of Shadel Bandits(How you deal with adds, or how you  break is as much of a challenge as soloing a big mob=p)<br />
Lol and one more funny challenge is great sapphro in Echo caverns, using pure melee, using no pet, no spells and no damage shield and no rabid bear &lt;cough&gt;<br />
Future challenges( this is where I want feedback)<br />
<br />
Other UP names like Radir<br />
Talendor?<br />
Va Dyn<br />
Pristine Fingerbone Trial<br />
Maybe Trak? ( or soloing through juggs as a future challenge)<br />
Zelnithak(aka big camel in UP, got him to 89% but badly have to try him again)<br />
Looking for other ones, because imo challenges is where you can test to see how much you have improved in gear, or what difference aa has made. And also can be good for farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fungus King(Sebilis)<br />
Eom Va Dyn(Vex Thal)<br />
Gargoyles(Sleeper's Tomb, post-awakening)<br />
<br />
A few challenges i can think of. The Fungus King is the most fun probably, because it's hard to die, yet winning isn't trivial either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Zelniak is too hard i reckon. I have done with 65 mage, and 62 necro, took 35+ mins. Radir yes. Tawro yes. Vadyn no, too much HP and 700 hitter. Trak no, too big an AE. Talendor same. Both are too difficult to slow. Try soloing inner acrylia named, 400+ hitters cleric type etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Trak touch would make soloing him problematic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
For the love of god, I hope no shaman ever solo's one.   Would only take like 13 hours! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gargoyles in Sleepers would be a pain to.   Very high MR makes landing slow after molosinia problematic.  And they have a crapload of HP too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fungus King(Sebilis)<br />
<br />
<br />
You can get to him and solo that mess alone?<br />
<br />
I been thinking about trying it lately cause i want just 1 fungi for my alts before i quit EQ. I just wanna see one and hold it lol.</div></div><hr />

I would rather end myself :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">cool Ty for the info. Will have to try a few of them ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
45 minutes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The dragon (kelerodek dar?)in cobalt scar isn't too hard, i did him duo with my ranger.  But i think i can kill him solo too, bio orb and haste cloak can be good for the bank account.<br />
The only problem with solo'ing is the time it takes to kill something, so most of the time i bring my ranger to add some dps to speed up the kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Zlandicar is always fun and his earth is good for bank account too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Talendor is very very hard to slow, I've faught him with a group of 3 several times and quickly learned to stop wasting mana on slow and just heal.  <br />
<br />
Ragefire is a pain to get spawned, but I'm 100% convinced he is soloable.  Slow will take a few casts but it will land (maybe take a chanter to tash and do the rest solo)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't forget to bring your journeyman' walking stick for these; proc's tash.<br />
<br />
Radir and Tawro are not that hard to kill; we regularly farm them for bracelets with a 62 BL, 59 shammie (me) and 61 druid.  Pretty easy kill, although the pull is a serious pain--we usually use the druid to harmony/invis our way in.<br />
<br />
Also, if Radir is ever weilding 2 shadowhearts (look like daggers), forget the slow; they are +25 MR each.  I bounced slow 9 times on that battle.<br />
<br />
If you want a challenge, try the swarmlord.  Hes a bit easier than radir/tawro, but really, really hard to get alone.  Tip: start with Tigirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Zlandicar is soloable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The problem with dragons like Zlandicar is that you have to be in melee range in order to land a slow(still very hard), thus having to tank him.<br />
<br />
So, with a lucky slow before you die, Zlandicar is soloable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My most amusing solos lately.<br />
<br />
Kelorek Dar (I got 3 cocw's, to say my jaw hit the ground is an understatement, was fairly easy, but a long fight, took around 30 minutes).<br />
<br />
Neh Ashir (she was up and outside the house in the open, when I went over to buff some guildy twinks, needless to say I couldn't resist it, she was easy).<br />
<br />
Rak Ashir (Same deal, took 2 attempts and outside buffs, but with ~370fr it really wasnt that bad even with my virtue getting dispelled both times at 80%, I just rabid beared for dps, then backed out and focused on keeping the pet alive).<br />
<br />
Eom anything is just too much dps, too much hps, too much atk for a shaman atm, maybe in a few expansions time.<br />
<br />
Vah Dyn in akr is pretty much the same, although its dps isnt so bad, its hps are =(<br />
<br />
I think Terror in fear might be shaman soloable though although adds from trash would be a major issue, if it is then I could pretty much do the entire shaman epic solo =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At the risk of sounding a bit inexperienced in this matter I've got a few questions on soloing the Big mobs, I've done plenty of regular xp soloing in various places but when levelling and doing big kills, I've usually been grouped most of the time. (the fact I didn't have any form of torpor untill very recently didn't help much, though in the 2 weeks since I've gotten quiesc I've managed to grind scr3, scrm and Qb3... the difference is godly).<br />
<br />
What I'd like to know is what does the usual Solo Kill look like to you guys. <br />
<br />
do you usually go after rootable mobs so you can sit back and debuff/slow before stepping in ? Or maybe have Dogdog Keep the mobs busy while you get to work ? In the slowability storyline thingie, talendor is listed as unslowable... Does that mean pet tank or just stay alive and try to channel dots and heals while getting beat up ? This is an aspect I wish to explore and I'm wondering where to start, and quite possibly what to start with. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Put quiessence on you, pull with malos, try to slow on inc (send pet in early to buy some time).  Depending on what mob, melee it while refreshing Q while dotting it with epic/disease/2 or 3 poisen dots.  Most important thing to remember is manage mana, don't overdot and don't be inpatient it can take a LONG time.<br />
You'll be amazed what you can tank with Q on you, a guily monk jaw dropped to the ground when he saw me tanking the bracer dropping gantru in UP for the entire fight and never go oom nor below 60%hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zeeta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Trak touch would make soloing him problematic.<br />
<br />
I don't think Trak will 'touch' pets.  So you just have to get Puppy to tank him throughout the fight  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Good luck having the pet stay on top of the aggro list from beginning to end of the fight.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Pet with haste, FA, focus and a couple proccing weapons is amazingly good at holding aggro if you go carefully on the poison DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Cerath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Okay, stupid newbie question...  Why not Nag/Vox?  Pre-53 and with mini-torpor, of course.  I mean there's a 75% slow at 51, and while I've never been on a vox raid and only a few naggy, his aoe's weren't that bad with good resists.  Immune to slow?  Root I'm sure, but I can't see them being immune to slows and not the bigger dragons.  Canni2 doesn't regen enough mana?  Insane resists on DoTs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Naggy/Vox are not immune to slow, but I don't know of anyone who's ever landed one, either.  And there's no 75% slow at 51. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, touche.  I keep forgetting to caster's realm lists the max level effect, not first available... when it even gets the stats right anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just not going to happen at that level cerath. Not enough healing power with stoic. ON top of the fact I don't think you would have enough mana to kill. The main reason these big kills are doable solo is because of cann AA.</div></div><hr />
