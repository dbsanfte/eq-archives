<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K, here's the deal. Every other day we have a new &quot;Shaman brothers, let us rise to face teh evilz of $oE and triumph by making our class once again balnced!11!!oneone!1&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm sick of it, is anyone else? We know there are problems, resurrecting them every other ****ing day in a thread that basically reads the same as the one before it is getting old.<br />
<br />
So, stop. Let the leaders of the Crucible community figure out what they're going to do, and what they plan to propose when a single class rep is appointed. <br />
<br />
This is rapidly becoming a more obvious issue, at least to me, than the rampant equipment check requests we used to have. We made a new sub-forum, and we haven't really had a problem since.<br />
<br />
No, not suggesting a whole new sub-forum. I'm suggesting or asking that every other lurking_poster_014 stops beating the long LONG dead horse of class balance and shaman issues. Am I alone in this request?<br />
<br />
BTW, please use quote format to flame, and please leave names for positive and negative rep bumps so I know how to come at accordingly :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
Anyone else care to comment in either agreement, or disagreement?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree in the sense that every day shaman_0098234 discovers that DoT aggro is a little much, or that he can't quite cut main healing in Kod`Taz, or that he feels useless on raids and decides to start a new thread. If you're new to the crucible and you'd like to start a thread about something I'd suggest using the search function to look up old threads that might have been about what you wanted to post. You'll more than likely find the answers you're looking for, and won't make another useless thread. Trust me, the majority of us already know said problems exist, and have discussed them in such threads, so please do your research before posting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh the irony.<br />
<br />
What's up with the obsession about rep bumps anyways?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I first started reading this board during Luclin era (when I made my shaman), it was full of lots of useful information on spells, quests, and general things about the game as it relates to shaman, which helped me immensely in figuring out our class.  For a while now, though, the percentage of useful posts has decreased, to the point where I am actually surprised when I read something informative.  The majority of these threads that Garf mentioned all say the same basic things, none of which are new to anyone, including Sony.  Now I'm not talking about posts by people who parse stat buffs to prove their uselessness or threads which are aimed at compiling positive improvement ideas for the shaman class, such as the polls by Murtak recently.  I'm talking about the posts that demonize Sony for destroying the shaman class without offering any suggestions for a solution.<br />
<br />
We all know that shaman have serious class balance issues, especially stackability on raids (which we share with quite a few other classes).  Instead of repeating this fact over and over in reworded threads which accomplish nothing, our complaints and desires should be forwarded to Sony through a class representative - apparently they felt the same way.  This way, we can use the board to disperse new, useful information to our fellow shaman without cluttering it with complaints.  Also, remember that being reasonable in our requests for our class that we send via our class rep will go a long way toward seeing them realized - i.e. things that Sony might actually implement, rather than things like giving shaman rez, making Daluda a 4k heal, etc.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm just hopeful that having someone through which we can channel our discourse will lower the amounts of trivial threads on this board and turn the forum back into what it used to be - the most informative and useful class board for EQ on the Internet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree. Constantly trying to raise a army for your cause , while admirable, is counter productive. You need to pick your fights well. Look what others have done and have not accomplished by doing so. Learn from them.<br />
<br />
Right now we are in a stagnate status. nothing can be done about it, SoE is refusing to listen. Witht his new Rep thing ( gratz Sudedor ) we have a chance to surge again and see if something can get done.<br />
<br />
Again, your effortis admirable, but if you do it ever week then it becomes complace and loses its motivational effects. Save it for when it can really do good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Serbitar:<br />
If you have a question just post it. I do not see replies to questions getting slower or less informative. I do not see non-complaint threads being shot down by complaining shamans.<br />
<br />
To everyone who does not like negative posts:<br />
Go ahead and start a positive discussion. Post quest descriptions, tell us about your new soloing spot, tell us about an exciting new item. The amount of positive threads will go up - as opposed to replacing negativity about our class with negativity about the players behind the class like this thread does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Murtak is right, if you want positive, informative threads, go make one.  People still make good contributions to the Hunting Ground forums on new spots.  But really, what do you want to talk about?  Charisma's effect on slow rates?  WIS vs AC vs HP?  DEX and spell crits?  root/dot vs IN TEH FACE?  What race is TEH BESTO?  How is my gear?  Does JBB RAWK?  OMG Fungi RAWKS !!111!?<br />
<br />
This was the best class site in the game, but that was a long time ago.  There isn't all that much left to talk about anyway, at least compared to the days when people were trying to figure out how the game works.  If you have a new comment, comment away.  If you have a new question, ask away.  I haven't seen anyone post a worthwhile topic only to have it drowned in &quot;WHO CARES WOE IS ME SOE KILLED MY CLASS WAAHHHH&quot; posts, have you?</div></div><hr />

The irony is, you are acting similar to the people you are trying to silence and didn't even realize it.

You may say that things would be a lot more organized and civilized if our complaints came from a few shaman class representatives, and that would be true.   However, past history with Sony has taught us that they ignore class representatives and only listen to unruly mobs.  <br />

And as long as nothing happens to the state of shamans and the mess that is GoD in general it is necessary to continue the complaining. It is the only thing SOE has ever listened too, thats not our fault they are deaf to moderate reasoning.<br />
<br />
If you do not like it, do not read those threads, they are easy enough to spot.  I would rather suggest you do though, it may be your future as a shaman that is decided there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like clockwork, over the last few months, there is the token post (like this one) bemoaning the bemoaning shaman class threads. **SEARCH** is your friend.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the crucible has its share of whine-fest threads. That percentage has increased since the release of PoP and exponentially done so since release of GoD. The whine factor of the threads have increased in response to player frustration from the lack of justification and/or changes that would allow shaman to effectively play in the game in the manner they were designed to. They are the progression from rational, documented, well thought out threads defining the problems that have been ignored by SOE. Blantantly ignored and discounted - not on the merits of the points, but rather, SOE's inability to address them professionally.<br />
<br />
Now, ranting about the people ranting about the problems that everyone suffers from is less productive than those ranting about the problems. If you hate those posts ... control the urge to read them. The first post in a thread determines the topic/point of view/whine/moan/complaint.<br />
<br />

You want positive threads then start some.  If you’re tired of reading about the nerfs and pleas for help, then don’t read those threads.  As far as the Crucible community spokes people, I will make my own voice heard and express my own views nicely thank you.  I would add that I give much more weight to the opinions of active players over those with a sig that states “RETIRED”.<br />
<br />
Finally, you want to flame me and say that I’m a newb, guess again friend.  My toon was started when Kunark was released and has been a four year member of the same guild that now clears Time handily, has won Ikki4 and is currently working our way through Uqua.  In short, I  have been around for awhile, worked long and hard for everything that I have and am very familiar with Shaman class problems (past and present) as well as SOE’s track record and focus on maximizing profits at the players expense.<br />

I loved the first book but the later parts of the series just seemed like rewritings of the first one with new scenery. I guess it is understandable though. If I got offered a pile of cash to write another book &quot;just like the first one&quot; I probably would not try to be original either.<br />
<br />
Hey, let's turn this into a positive thread! List your favorite books!<br />
 * Roger Zelazny - Amber series (fantasy for aspiring demi-gods)<br />
 * Ray Bradbury - Something wicked this way comes (horror / children's story / fantasy)<br />
 * Frank Herbert - Dune (scifi classic)<br />
 * Lovecraft - The mountains of madness (there is someone who needed therapy)<br />
 * Sun Tzu - The art of war (before I read this I would not have believed anyone claiming to have written a general book on strategy)<br />
 * Miyamoto Musashi - The book of five rings (philosophy - and I enjoyed it!)<br />
 * Tolkien - lord of the rings (I do not even love the book as such, but the world is still the most convincing I have ever read about)<br />
<br />
I also like the Harry Potter books but I would not actually call them great books. And I consumed a mountain of soso and trash books of all genres. Will post more if I remember any great books I missed.</div></div><hr />

Hi, anyone can be a leader, you just have to be able to contribute with useful information. And you can talk all you want, just stop making threads that read the exact same as the one that came around the day before it.<br />

We don't need more: &quot;Shaman brothers...it is time to rise up&quot; threads. We get it. We understand that there are problems, and we understand we want them fixed. If you want **** fixed them do a parse shoving information into Sony's face, like I've seen some of the other Crucible members do. I can link threads if you want.<br />
<br />
My point being, bitch if you want, but please at least have something unique that will help us progress in our quest to be balanced. Telling us the same crap we heard yesterday does nothing - showing us new figures and facts that shine a light on the flaws in SoE Shaman logic, however, is yet another step in the right direction.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Pardon me for this, but this is just funny. I got a grey rep bump, unsigned of course, for my post in this thread. It reads: &quot;Bad post on your part. You can only ignore 2 people at a time not group of whining poster.&quot; :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
To the unnamed person who made an attempt at a rep bump: <br />
1. Sign your name to what you write. To do otherwise (to my mind, anyway) is cowardly and detracts meaning from your words.<br />
<br />
2. The ignore feature DOES work quite nicely. I meant two things by (rather short) post: first, that these boards do, of course, have an ignore feature under the USER CP button at the top; second, that a person can simply choose to overlook that which either irritates or displeases him.<br />
<br />
3. I do believe it is possible to ignore more than two people. When you add folks to the ignore list (type a name in the field provided and click &quot;Edit Ignore List&quot;), the list expands to add more fields. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I get quite a few grey bumps, and 99% of the time they're anonymous.<br />
<br />
Just brush them off, the only ones you need to worry about are the reds and the greens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">LOL Garf, aye, I brush most of them off (green/grey/red) unless the person actually takes the time to sign their name and write something intelligent. I got a negative one once, and promptly got an apology via PM because the person was upset at the time they bumped me. I just really enjoyed that; I'm still snickering over here. Sorry for hijacking your thread. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">STOP WITH THE ANONYMOUS BUMPING.<br />
<br />
HAAGEN, THANK YOU FOR LEAVING YOUR NAME, IT MAKES ME CRY TO SEE THAT YOU ALONE ARE ABLE TO GRASP THIS SIMPLE SIMPLE CONCEPT. HAAGEN FOR PRESIDENT. (I can only see my last 5 bumps, so forgive me if I've not listed you.)<br />
<br />
People, no one takes anonymous rep bumps seriously. You accomplish nothing when you leave the comment box blank, don't you see what I'm trying to tell you? Even you people who give anonymous positive bumps, they still carry much MUCH less merit and satisfaction than those with names following the comment.<br />
<br />
I am in such complete awe...bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">People, no one takes anonymous rep bumps seriously.<br />
<br />
Frankly, anyone who takes any rep bumps seriusly, regardless of colour, needs, in my opinion, to buy a sense of perspective.<br />
<br />
Garf's thread is, for the reasons already mentioned, ironic; I agree. But, ironic or not, I heartily agree with the the sentiment that he expresses: Whining is easy. Whining constructively - now that is a completely different kettle of aardvarks altogether...</div></div><hr />
