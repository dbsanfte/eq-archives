<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've seen it drop twice since the &quot;we upped your spell drops&quot; bs. Once off gorenaire and once off talendor. The rareish 60 spells aren't going to drop off common mobs, even if they upped the drop rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Read the thread, wow he has been 60 since December, a real old timer. As sympathetic as I am to spell drop issues I fail to feel a lot of sympathy in this particular case. However, maybe that does highlight spell drop problems when I am not impressed that someone has been 60 for 3 months and they don't have torpor yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That wouldn't be that bad if, for some reason, those 'rareish 60 spells' didn't include all our level 59 and 60 drop spells.<br />
<br />
It's not even that we have one or two spells dropping only as uncommon to rare drops from rare, contested and/or raid-level MOBs. It's that all our level 60 Kunark spells and most of our level 59 ones do, unlike practically every other classes.<br />
<br />
I have seen mid-50s enchanter get ALL their 55+ Kunark drops in a single Jugg raid. Good for them! In that same raid, 3 shamans spell dropped: Talisman of the Serpent and...  2 copies of Malosini. %@#! Verant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It makes perfect sense.<br />
<br />
What does not make sense is why all those 60+ mobs are stuck in one Kunark zone, a zone that requires an absurdly long and boring key quest and that you can't gate/port/evac out of.<br />
<br />
When risk becomes runaround, reward is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My advise , hang around WW, DN, ToV area and ask any passing raid if you can tag along for a Kland,Zland,Yeli,Sont kill or something similar , I practically guarantee youll get your spells within 2 weeks and the other shaman there will be more than happy for you to share in the usual duties I'm sure. <br />
<br />
Eoin , add something constructive for once please or just keep a lid on it, why shouldnt people be rewarded for their efforts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I kinda have to agree with Eoin...are people rewarded for getting rare spells in VP or is everyone else punished because they don't have the time to do the complicated key quest or belong to a guild with members that have the time to do the complicated key quest (and kill Trak for all those teeth?)<br />
<br />
My guild has cleared VP, but I know how hard it was to get a VP keyed raid force of the appropriate classes, it probably took us about 8-12 months of concentrated effort to get there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you really think that people should have to endure the astounding timesink that is VP just to have a remotely decent chance of looting their level 60 Kunark spells, then you should go work for VI. I hear they're hiring....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My guild will likely not ever see VP. We are a guild who's members are spread out across the continent, so our play times are random.  Theres about 2 hour each weeknight that most of us are on.  Not nearly enough time to do much outside of XP grinding.  Currently, I'm the highest level shaman in our guild (4 blues to 58) and I've only got two goals for the immediate future: To get level 60 asap and to get Malo somehow so that I can be of greater use to my guild on raids.<br />
<br />
I'm giving up on ever getting a JBB. I've camped the crypt for 6 months and no luck. Ever. I've never seen it drop.  Oh, I've HEARD of it dropping but never actually seen it.<br />
<br />
For that trade out, whenever my guild isn't doing a raid for some reason or another, I'm XP grinding in a group somewhere, usually Seb.  I've found that one group of well tuned players from my guild that I usually hunt with can do Juggs easily and its mad XP.  Add to that the bonus of getting spells, makes it even better.<br />
<br />
As it stands I'm the quest officer and spell officer for my guild (I'm a workaholic, what can I say?) so I try to stay in Seb alot for spells and juggs camps.  I never sell much of any high end loot I get because someone in my guild almost always needs it, so I pass it to those that need it.  So buying any spell I might need thats more than 10k is out of the question as its taken me 2 months just to garner the 10k I have now.  <br />
<br />
I DO believe that they've upped the drop rate.  I just think that it will take a long time for that rate to filter to the servers enough to effect prices for our rare spells.<br />
<br />
Do I think its still too rare?  Well, probably, but any improvement is just that...an improvement.  So what if they upped it by 1% for our rare spells.  Personally, given the way VI grudgingly corrects problems like this, I'll take what I can get.<br />
<br />
So, in the mean time I'll be peddling my SoW and Shrink potions trying to inch my way to the 100k mark to buy Malo and continuously camp juggs with one group for a few hours a night for XP and the odd chance that Malo will drop.<br />
<br />
Funny how passionate we feel over bits of data, eh? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I still say that Verant needs to make spells drop in the new Cazic Thule. There are plenty of mobs in that zone that are level 60 and the risk vs reward are on par. Why the hell sould I have to kill a dragon on a one week timer or force my friends to sit in Trak's lair on the off chance that Jumpy or the Prot will drop a spell that I need?<br />
<br />
Face it, the Crypt is crappy AAXP and the Emperor is pretty damn rare. Juggs are crappy AAXP even for one group and Prot and Jumpy are both on 3 hour spawns. VP is never going to be seen by the average player and the only other real option are Guardian Wurms which are pretty rare.<br />
<br />
While I totaly agree that when I ding 60 I should not have Malo and Topor mysteriously appear in my backpack. I do believe that Verant needs to spread out the spell drops a bit more. And CT is the perfect solution IMHO.<br />
<br />
The average player not in an Uber or hell even a dragon capable guild should have a shot at these spells w/o having to pay 100k out of their pocket to get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Get spells in VP? Didn't we hear this retarded statement at least 200000 times before? Good luck trying to convince your guildmates to actually camp keys and go to get YOU spells while loot for them is utter crap compared to Velious/SoL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wouldn't say VP loot is utter crap, Zorlac.  The casters seemed pleased with their robes (DMF necro robe?), bards love that lute, monks love the slippers, shaman got hammers of the dragon born and snare spears, rogues seemed pretty happy with a couple of the daggers, one of our paladins was nearly verklempt with joy over some sword he won (sorry, don't remember the names of the melee loot), and two of our warriors got SoW swords to our perpetual amusement.  Not to mention the VERY yummy phara loot: robe of the azure sky, back slot items, shield of the elders  and bunny earring (nice for ALL casters). <br />
<br />
Sure there was some stuff that everyone kinda went &quot;eh,&quot; but the majority of the loot was more like, &quot;ooooooh.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Good luck trying to convince your guildmates to actually camp keys and go to get YOU spells while loot for them is utter crap compared to Velious/SoL.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a problem with your guild,  a good guild wouldn't whine and bitch about going to help out guildmates because nothing dropped for them in that zone.  Yeah, there isn't much there in VP for a melee, but there isn't anything in Sleepers for casters either.  A good guild does things to benefit their members as a whole and not just themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aye, VP has some nice loot in it, my guild is working on it now (we have around 15 teeth now I think), but really the only spell from kunark I really want still is pox...sure avatar and VoB would be nice, but I want pox!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We could argue days how SoL Boss mobs drop better caster gear than VP, how Lodizal drops an insanely good back piece for 0 risk, how worm in Acrylla drops the group Primal Essence hammer and so on. It won't change the fact that reward in VP sucks for an extremely long boring and pointless key quest. <br />
<br />
As it was pointed out, melee get nothing in VP, it takes 12-16 people to confortably farm Progenitor, MotG and FA. When a guild is capable of doing kunark dragons fast (to get keys) and easily then this guild I am sure it's capable of heading to kill Velketor, Vindicator and the easier First Brood dragons.<br />
<br />
And Jaradis, it's not about the guild helping out someone or not. It's about getting 20+ people bored to death for hours with risk not being equal to reward. Whenever you like it or not, Malo is the only key spell for guilds. Avatar is on weapons, Group Focus drops fairly well from SoL bosses, Torpor ... who cares, it's not important to a guild. Plus if your guild is capable for mobilizing and killing Trakanon for keys, you should get a copy of Torpor soon. Asking a guild for everyone to waste 6-8 hours is not like asking them to kill one mob for a quest.</div></div><hr />

Easier said than done, as is everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">First the Shaman in question has been an Oracle for what? 3 months.<br />
<br />
Go cry me a river bucko. And while you're at it - go commiserate with the non-ubers who have been 60 for a year and can't get the darn things to drop.<br />
<br />
Honestly I'm suprised his guild didn't hand him all his 60 spells when he dinged.  <br />
<br />
Maybe they sold their last copy for 50k to some schmuck like me to finance more raids.<br />
<br />
Heck, maybe they don't even DO Kunark any more.  Maybe they're concentrating on Luclin and Velious.<br />
<br />
Maybe they already have X number of Shaman in the guild with Malo, Torpor, yadda, yadda. (Which speaks to Shaman stackability I suppose)<br />
<br />
Maybe he is feeling what a lot of you have been feeling for months.</div></div><hr />
