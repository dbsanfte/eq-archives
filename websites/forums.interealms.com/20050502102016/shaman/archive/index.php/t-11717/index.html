<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I get 4-5 tells a night asking me to come to PoV.  Obviously there is a Shaman shortage, but I tell them I'm not tagged but would very much appreciate one.  This is usually met by silence, or just an &quot;OK&quot;.  I've heard from others how slowers are needed there.   I find it frustrating, personally, as we aren't valued as much in Trials as the big DPS folks.  I'm 61 at the moment and do not have a guild capable of doing Trials (I'm the biggest).  What's a person to do?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and this will never stop.  Once you get flagged for PoV/PoS, you'll get tells for BoT.  I think it's a rule, they'll want you wherever you're not flagged  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NipperRipper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just sit LFG in front of the Tribunals for a couple weeks, eventually you will get into a decent group that can pass. You may want to get 62 though; you can still get to 62 pretty easily in the better camps in tier 1, such as PoI factory, PoD courtyard camps, and PoN hobgoblin, mephit, cave camps. Don't bother going past level 62 until you are flagged.<br />
It took me 2 full weeks of camping out in PoJ. Finally an ol' buddy of mine who is a 65 necro in one of Xev's uber guilds came by with some of his lvl 65 friends including mage/cleric to get a level 60 alt warrior flagged. They had a spot for me and I got through (it was sooooo easy).<br />

<br />
/sigh<br />
There is NO shortage of shaman flagged PoV/PoS on E. Marr.  I DO receive requests every day for pick-up Tier1 or BoT groups. :(<br />
<br />
Tier1 is SO slow in comparison to Tier2, and the groups are generally MUCH poorer in quality.  And I'm still missing one dang medallion for BoT, 2 pieces for HoH. :(  I was so happy with my former guild family, but we disbanded &amp; my current family sounds very similar to your own.  We have a small handful (maybe one group's worth) of people 60+, and we aren't all on at the same time.<br />
<br />
I recommend calling in favors, making a deal, or whatever is necessary to get flagged Tier2.  With moderate gear, Aego, &amp; KEI, you can solo mobs in PoV/PoS (inefficiently, but it works) while waiting to find a group.  Oftentimes the shaman is the linchpin for the group, and you can create a group around yourself easily.  <br />
<br />
By the way, while you are stuck in Tier1, take the time to get the pieces for your exp flags (agony mephit heart, block of peryllium, etc) NOW instead of later.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The same way anyone gets anything in everquest. <br />
<br />
<br />
*sings*<br />
<br />
&quot;If you have to asssssk, you'll nevah knoooow&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
easy way - find 4 magi and anyone else and own the trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also if your magi are banishing they're wasting mana :p We found that if we just all nuked it was easier, cause banish got resisted like half the time anyways...  Ideal group would be Paladin, Cleric, You, Mage, Rogue, Bard, since the bard can mez any mobs that get out of control, contribute some damage, and keep everyone's mana up.<br />
Your job is to Cure Tash and Slows, and throw around some direct damage. The 61 poison nuke works pretty well here because it's quick casting. just make SURE you get a mage summoned earring, Bracer, and Ring. if they don't have the ones that affect 61+ spells, just use Ice Strike.<br />
<br />
My spell lineup during Trials was always:<br />
<br />
Ice Strike (Efficient Nuke)<br />
Spear of Torment (Quicker, &quot;oh ****&quot; nuke)<br />
Torpor (or Stoicism if you don't have it, you want a heal you can drop on the cleric if they get agro)<br />
Malo (For when the prime exe pops)<br />
Slow (Also for the prime exe.. he mitigates 75% of slows but every bit helps)<br />
Tnargs (This will probably get you serious agro, but if someone is GOING TO DIE it's what you need)<br />
Canni<br />
Disinfecting Aura (For the curing)<br />
<br />
The pally can grab agro doing Healing Wave of Prexus if things start to get out of control. For the most part, your cleric should be using Supernal Elixir, which is a great low agro heal over time spell.  If a mob gets on the cleric, I'd just slow it to get agro off him, and try to keep it occupied. The damage dealers will switch to it next if you communicate it necessary for them to do so ;)<br />
<br />
Lastly, When the prime exe pops, have the paladin throw a couple stuns at him then proceed to kite him around the platform if your mana levels aren't so hot. I'd use this time to mem Kragg's mending instead of a nuke in case the cleric needs a bit more help with the healing. The prime exe doubles for 720, and since you're using a paladin he can't disc defensive on him :-/ Kiting may be a little bit gimp, but it's a surefire way to have a chance to get mana if you weren't able to manage it very well through the 4 waves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Judlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Man I thought my group had this in the bag last night, but we couldnt get past 3rd wave...<br />
<br />
we had<br />
65 Mage<br />
65 Chanter<br />
62 War<br />
61 Wiz<br />
60 Cleric<br />
and me 62 Shaman<br />
<br />
first time we tried we did ae, but someone forgot to tell the mage<br />
next time we tried nuking, if you are depending on crits, it wont work(in my opinion)<br />
well needless to say we tried this about 15 times last night. <br />
<br />
Any ideas on what we should have done with this style of group??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Any ideas on what we should have done with this style of group??<br />
<br />
You should be nuking and so should the enchanter. Basically I'd dispense with slowing at all.  Have the enchanter mez.  Then everyone else nukes. <br />
<br />
Make sure you're close to the warrior so if you get aggro you don't cause ping-pong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did it at 61 with a <br />
62 wizard<br />
60th mage<br />
61 warrior<br />
61 enchanter<br />
61 cleric<br />
<br />
It was an aoe/stun kind of group. I didn't bother to slow until the last guy. My only role was keeping the skirts alive using torpor and chlorblast. I really didn't have the option to nuke. It was more than enough just trying to target the dog inbetween heals. <br />
<br />
 I think it would have been much easier at 62 and tnargs. We attempted about 10 times before we finally made it. Biggest help was keeping everyone parked in the middle so that ping pong was kept to a minimum. Tossing Torpor on the enchanter before each wave also helped quite a bit. My advice is just to stick with the same group and refine tactics until it works. Swaping people in and out causes more problems than it solves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nuking is good.  What I did was load Tigir's, nuke, and /assist MT.  Tigirs?  Yeah.  So I was slowed, who cares.  The things that weren't on the MT came to ME, not the cleric.  I wasn't as much DPS (usually the thing the MT was on was dead by the time my nuke landed) but keeping things off the healer is a much needed quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's very hard for shamans to get through in general; the best bet is to remind your guildies, friends, and strangers how much they'll need shamans once they get in anyway, or call in favors.  Mobs that hit for 500 and up make having shamans around a very good idea.<br />
<br />
I tried a few times and didn't seem to be making any progress, then tried with a chanter and two wizzies, and a cleric to heal and a warrior to be the meatshield/taunter.  It went down very smoothly considering it was our first time and the group level average was probably 62, the first time.  I got the kill shot with an ice strike. :)<br />
<br />
AE'ing is what we did.  Warrior went for the unmezzable mobs first so the chanter would have less aggro, otherwise standard AE stuff with the chanter and wizzies.  I tried to make it so that if anyone died from healing, it would be me, not the cleric.  The cleric actually did wind up doing a rez mid-battle, and I think one or two died on the last mob and we rezzed them in after.  I put a fair amount of torpor out, and cast torpor on myself before the mobs popped.  I used my own torrent of poisons to add in to the wizzie AE's, and topped that off with DD's and kept looking around for who to heal.  I got a lot of aggro in spurts, but my equipment isn't that great and I still didn't get in a whole lot of danger, since I started out torpored and the chanter and wizard work were constantly kicking in.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't sit around the halls buffing people, by the way.  Once they have your buffs, they don't need you, and they won't be back when they're done.  Sitting around buffing people just in the hope they'll be grateful will work too infrequently to bother with.  Buff people who buff your group with missing buffs and put an /afk tag on for the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ideal group for exe trial I've found is:<br />
-Main healer (cle/dru)<br />
-2nd healer and partial nuker (cle/dru/sha)<br />
-Main tank (any melee, though taunt preferred.  Have used a monk as tank before)<br />
-Main damage dealer (Mage if you can, then druid, then anyone good at fast damage like monks/wizards/rogues/necros)<br />
-2nd damage dealer (same thing)<br />
-any other gimp class you want flagged.<br />
<br />
The absolute ideal group you could get IMO would be:<br />
Dru<br />
Shm<br />
Pal<br />
Mage<br />
Mage<br />
Mage<br />
<br />
You have 4 classes that can banish (don't let anyone tell you that banish sucks in exe trial.  banish makes the exe trial a joke).<br />
You have 3 classes that can throw heals.<br />
You have a class that can res if you really need it.<br />
You have 4 pets that can help on CC work.<br />
You have a tank that's good at getting aggro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">my lvl 61 shaman got through doing the healing role.  group was 65 war, 62mage, 62 druid, 60rogue, 60 chanter, and me, 61 shaman.  this was a guild group and the war/mage/druid already their flag.  We did the straight forward approach of mez/ single kill.  At the end of waves 1 and 2 I had 90plus mana.  3rd wave we had a little ping pong so ended up at 50m.  by end of 4th wave i had 80mana.  on exec, cloud of grummus hit but was mitigated so exec was slowed about 20percent.  after slow, i was chain kraggs mending on the warr.  when exec went down i was had maybe enough mana for a sup heal.  the druid was completely oom also.  this was done w/o topor/stoicism/canni5.  w/ kei my wisdom was 215 or so.<br />
<br />
it is possible to get through the trials as the main healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hargin, try to setup an AE group. It seems to be the best way.<br />
<br />
<br />
I could not agree more, if you can stack a tank, cleric, chanter in with yourself and either two mages or a mage and a wizzie you WILL get through fast, provided you're not level 55 or so. Although I got in easy (3rd try, *ducks) back in November I have spent a ton of time helping other through..I couldn't believe how easy the AE route was compared to normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just got flagged as a 65 shaman, probably my 20th attempt. The easiest group setup is...<br />
62+ wiz<br />
62+ wiz<br />
60+ cleric<br />
60+ warrior (defensive is a must)<br />
61+ chanter (ae stun)<br />
anyone else<br />
<br />
We tried with a paly as MT he got eaten 3 times by the exe as the cleric went oom. Swapped him for a warrior and we were flagged in one attempt.<br />
<br />
AE is the way to go, do what I did and shoot a tell to all 62+ wizs that are on. As soon as you get 2 wizs you are set, finding the cleric/chanter/warrior is easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Did you kite exe to regain mana mcast? I've seen rangers and beastlords in average or a tiny bit above average gear tank it. If your pally can't you needed a different pally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">We didn't kite the exe, the cleric was at 90m when he spawned and the wizs around 40m, chanter and I were FM. The paly was wielding a SBS and some 1hs, I'm thinking he may have had crappy gear or something. The cleric (64 with kei) basically went oom by the time exe was at 75%, no clue why. When we swapped in the warrior he used defensive and the cleric had plenty of mana.<br />
<br />
/shrug no idea what was wrong, most palys I've met can tank very well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I did it yesterday.  Core group was me 61shm, 62sk, 60cleric, and a 62 mage.  We got two, count them two (lucky me) level 65 mages to take a stab at the trial with us.  We totally owned up on it, it wasn't even funny!<br />
Then the one 65 mage left, and we picked up a druid who hadn't gotten through, and completed it again.  I guess the key link was having a couple mages, just one being 65 -</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">What exactly does the Tank do in an AE style group?  Is he just for tanking the Exe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My guild is melee-priest heavy so we had to find a different way to do trials. Our trial group is;<br />
<br />
65 rogue<br />
65 rogue<br />
65 enchanter<br />
64 cleric<br />
65 paladin/warrior (MT slot)<br />
any other<br />
<br />
When I got flagged, we had a 62 warrior in the MT slot, and it took us a few attempts to succeed. A decently equipped 65 paladin has no problem holding aggro (AE stuns) and taking damage. As the odd-man-out, I didnt even bother with slows except on the executioner. I was backup healer and would nuke each mob once for extra dps (used poison DD). I also had a 61 pet up, and used Spirit Call on the executioner.<br />
<br />
It took me a while after PoP came out to get flagged for Valor/Storms. Even though people always sent me tells to group up there, nobody was interested in taking a shaman through the trials. I had to wait until we got our flagged people down to help me and the warrior. We also flagged a different enchanter at the same time, so the enchanter we used was not 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've only been in 2 trials and was successfull both times<br />
<br />
rogue, rogue, warrior, enchanter, me and a druid<br />
<br />
(we were getting different enchanters and druids though) <br />
<br />
druid healing was more than enough and the warrior/ rogues were enough to take the mobs out easilly<br />
<br />
my job was to nuke and to topor the warrior on the last mob of each wave to help the druid out a bit and then to malo/slow the exe<br />
<br />
druids in general can heal just fine for this trial with their ICH spells and damage shields are just bonus.<br />
<br />
i used the poison DD during the fights, .. canni V helped and so did horsies .. to keep everyone pretty high in mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">trials...?  DS potions are our friends...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">don't let anyone tell you that banish sucks in exe trial. banish makes the exe trial a joke Banish has a 2 minute refresh time, costs 500 mana (same as a firebolt of tallon), and like 80 plat to cast, and it it resists the mage/druid is probably going to have agro. Using banish was really more trouble than it was worth.  Your best bets are to get a mage bracer, ring, and earring (earring is 15% mana pres on nukes/dots/slows etc), then just assist the tank and nuke.  also make sure your pet is equipped with mage loving, and that all the pets are ASSISTING THE TANK... often pets will get hit by spells or get mobs on them which make em switch targets. Know what your pet is attacking!<br />
<br />
When the prime exe pops, if you are pretty much out of mana, have your tank tag him and proceed to kite him around the platform. you no longer have a time limit, and as long as he doesnt go below 97% health, he won't summon the tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and DS potions really ARE a big help :D</div></div><hr />
