<p>If this was in the least bit trivial, I'd pass it to one of my friends to post for me. Some things you just have to do yourself just to make sure they get down. This is one of them...<br />
<br />
I'm miding my own business, when I get a doozy of an email from a ranger on Quellious who got cheated out of Earthcaller by a scammer. BTW - If you are on this guys server and can help out with recovering from the loss, it would be appreciated. =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I generally do not reprint emails that are sent to me.<br />

<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
I am sending this to you in hopes that future occurrences of this won't happen.  My character is Vytor Vexxen, 56th Ranger on the Quellious server.  Last Sunday 10/22/01, I was scammed out of the final piece of my epic.  I have had Swiftwind for about 4 months now and have been on countless PoH raids trying to get my last piece.  I have had no luck whatsoever.  On Sunday I was in EC and don't ask me why (sheer stupidity) I auctioned to trade for the MQ'ing of the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.  About a minute later a 14th lv Bard gave me a tell, his name was Xeba.  Xeba told me he had one on his rogue that had been in the bank forever.  We chatted for a minute and I told him to log to his Rogue.  I wanted to get his name and toss it around in guildchat to see if anyone knew who he was.  The Rogue's name was Backs.  Backs was a lv 53 Rogue and I thought to myself, well, I have been playing for nearly 2 years and am lv 56, so I found it believable that he could have the Emerald.  I spoke to my guildmates and the general consensus was Backs was a pretty reputable guy, and they thought he was trustworthy.  Unfortunately this wasn't the case.  We went to NK to hand the final piece in.  I made him hail the tree and did everything correctly (all the faction stuff was fine).  He told me he handed in his piece, and said it was fine if I handed mine in.  So I did.  To my dismay I got absolutely nothing in return.  No Earthcaller, no nothing.  It made me sick to my stomach.  I couldn't believe the months of work I had done were gone.  I have petitioned and spoken to the server GM, but there will be no reimbursement.  Basically I was told since it was a MQ, there is nothing he could do.  He did however lead me to believe the person I was dealing may not have been completely honest with me.  Now mind you, I only gave this guy a Blood Point, and was supposed to give him additional items later on.  The GM also told me to ask around and talk to other Rangers.  He also led me to believe there was a way to quest just one of the swords!?!  If you have any knowledge of this PLEASE reply to my e-mail.  Anyhow, later that night I did some homework and found out that at least 2 other Rangers had been scammed by this guy, in exactly the same manner.  The next time you post information could you please post something to this effect and let people know about this person that continues to scam people out of all their hard work.  I know how I felt after this happened and would hate to see it happen to someone else.  Thanks for your time.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Vytor Vexxen<br />

That guy needs to be hunted down and drummed out of EQ. It would be so nice if VI could just approach CS from a common sense approach and get rid of these grief players. People like this guy do no good playing in such a social environment.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>That really blows.  I wonder though, shouldnt the treant have given a message when the guy turned something in?  like "havent you forgot something..." Wonder if you saw that message. <br />
<br />
Looks like to do earthcaller by itself you have to basically do the whole quest over again except kill VSR.  DE corruptor, foraging, Hole, Sky globe, Hate stone.  Bleh.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I got a tell out of the clear blue sky about 3 weeks ago from a character named Backs asking me if I needed the Hate stone.<br />
<br />
I thought he said he had just come across it recently on a Hate raid, but remembering back 3 weeks I can't be sure.<br />
<br />
That would really stink if a Rng MQ scammer is loose on Quell.  Seems like a lot of accounts have been changing hands recently and you don't know who you can trust anymore. <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<p>When I got mine I Multi-quested with a druid but my biggest fear is you get a lucky ranger with the hate stone but no Swiftwind. They offer to MQ the stone because they don't intend on doing the quest or so they say. They then wait for you to turn in your sword and poof they have an Earthcaller (and your money no doubt).<br />
<br />
My heart goes out to them, i know how it is to screw up a quest but I can't imagine the epic getting wrecked in this manner.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that this scam can be perpetrated with any MQ'ing.  Just so happens this one was with an epic weapon (making it even worse).  This is why Verant does not support MQ'ing and why they won't reimburse.  You just can't trust many people.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

We should all make an alt on Quellious and get the word out about this guy Backs...1 person saying something will make little difference, but many people throwing his name around all over Norrath will ruin him and IMO he deserves it.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>He did it three times now, his reputation seems to be doing okay. If you want to ruin someone's reputation who deserves it, it's going to take being very loud and obnoxious.<br />

<p>I think this shows a couple of things.  First of all we are trying to play a game that is as close to virtual reality as we get in 2001.  Second this game (as all roleplaying games) are steeped in good vs evil.  This was evil and if this guy was roleplaying an evil character, it could have well been in his "code" to do this.  Now I don't think this is true, I think he is a punk, but it makes you think.  Reward is valueless unless it comes with risk.  I don't know how many Hate raids I went on before my stone dropped but I would never have trusted anyone but a close friend to MQ this, in the same way I wouldn't ask a total stranger to transfer 10k (or even 100pp) between characters.<br />
<br />
There is a reason that Verant does not support MQ'ing and we should not skip casually through Norath thinking that everyone is good and just.  There are bad people out there in fantasy land  as there is in real life.  We should protect ourselves against them.  I don't think Verant has a responsibility (nor should they) to protect ourselves from poor judgement.  I think there is a lesson to be learned for all of us.<br />
<br />
Having said all this, I am sorry a fellow Ranger got scammed and if I were on his serrver, I would attempt to help him back to where he needs to be.  Maybe the Rangers of that server can band together to do this.  Because, for every scum like this guy, there are many good and honorable real people behind those charatcers on the screen.  And many of them play Rangers!<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Vytor, I am sorry to hear about this. There is a post on the Quellious board about this loser Backs or whatever he goes by. Seems to be a routine with him, at least until a GM happens to do something about him. <br />
<br />
It is sad to say, but don't trust a stranger with something that big. I am 3 drops away from my epics and I know I will have to do the Hate stone myself no matter how long it will take. <br />
<br />
I would love to help you out with re-doing your epic...sadly, right now, EQ and my computer are having a huge fight. I don't know when I can get this fixed, but I would be happy to help when I can log in.  Good luck.  <br />
<br />
Just remember to watch each other's backs folks, keep your eyes peeled and don't let desperation get ahold of you.  Patience...<br />
<br />
Oh yeah..roleplaying is no excuse for ripping someone off that much...that's just plain mean.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>How about someone trying to bait this guy while in the background they get a GM to witness what's going on?  If he's greedy enough and the ranger sounds REALLY desperate to get his Earthcaller, this Gimp just might take the bait and it would allow him to get caught in the act.  Just what I would try if it happened to me......<br />

<p>Vytor,<br />
<br />
I am unsure, but I think this happened to someone else in our guild.  If I see this guy, I will enjoy chasing him across Norrath.<br />
There is another guy that offered to do the MQ with me......same MO....stone been in bank for months.  All I had to do is give him 20kpp and I would have Earthcaller.  His name is Nonolian, and I do not know if this guy is reputable, but he contacted me.  I apologize in advance and do not insinuate that these guys are in anyway connected, but I would beware.<br />
<br />
Also, Vytor, I think it may be a good Idea for us to all get a group to go to Hate to slay the mob bosses and stay there a few days for us all to get stones.  Maybe we can go through ORQ.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think what this guy did was #^%$$* and I hate this happened to you.  Been a long time since I have seen ya man, but you've always been a nice guy.  Take care and I hope that you may be able to get your blade back soon.<br />

<p>HI,<br />
<br />
I am pretty new in the game, so I am very interested in learning all the scams so I won't fall into one.<br />
<br />
How this one benefit the Backs guy?  If there is no benefit to him, why would he do this?  <br />
<br />
Another question, what is Multi-questing?<br />
<br />

<p>Generally BeZoie, if someone is multiquesting with you, you pay them first, then they MQ with you.<br />
Multiquesting is where you need something for a quest that is nodrop and someone else has it. They turn in thier part, then you turn in yours and you get the reward as if you turned in both parts. The NPC doesn't know they came from two different chars.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>This is why I almost never MQ, and when I do decide to do it, I make sure it's a trusted friend who has the piece(s) needed to MQ.  Especially something like our epics, which take a considerable amount of work if anything goes wrong.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

I got a tell from this guy a couple weeks ago as well.  He said one of my guildmates said I was looking to MQ the hate stone.  Fortunately, I blew him off as I'm kind of funny that way, and have an inate distrust of MQing with any but the closest of friends.  <br />

<p>Backs has offered to MQ me 4 times in 3 months. I did not know he was scamming people at the time. I turned him down everytime due to my dislike of Multi-Questing epic items. I informed him each time that I do not MQ my epic and he went on his way. The last 2 times, he told me that he was informed by friends of mine that I was looking for the Hate stone. I found this strange because all my friends know I do not like MQing. In fact, they know because this guy was /auctioning the stone once and told me about it. That was when I informed them I do not MQ the epics.<br />

<p>/em grumbles at friends who keep dragging me back to answer questions...<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>I wonder though, shouldnt the treant have given a message when the guy turned something in? like "havent you forgot something..." Wonder if you saw that message.</b><br />
<br />
This is not the case with Xanuusus. He's one of the NPCs that says nothing untill all of the correct items are turned in. Many epic NPCs are like this. Niklas hit it right as to why Verant doesn't support Multiquesting, and I honesly have to agree with them on it. While I believe the feature should remain, there is always some level of risk involved with it.<br />
<br />
<HR><br />
<br />
My general advise in regards to multiquestings is to know who you are doing it with. Although it probably is really obvious for some, I think it needs to be stated due to cases like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Preferably you should only do MQs with someone you know and trust or someone that is referred to you by someone you trust. For example, Crydee's in-game big brother MQed the sky sphere to him. I think I could trust my character's big brother not to cheat me.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're buying a MQ, always keep in mind what guild the person is with first and foremost. Oftentimes such loot is considered guild property, so contacting an officer of that guild [or whoever their official guild loot selling person is] is a better way to get to ensure a proper MQ than some random indivudal. The more merchant oriented guilds that love to make money off of selling MQs tend to be very reliable as they will loose all their customers if they start cheating people though you will pay a lot going this route.<br />
<br />
If the person is unguilded, it's probably best to just pass on the deal. Unless it is an unguilded individual who is well-known throughout the server to be a good person. In that case, you are probably safe - unless the character has been ebayed.<br />
<br />
If the person is with a guild that has a bad server reputation, just run away.<br />

<p>I play on quellious and have met Backs too.  He never seemed like the type of person to do something like that.  He almost joined my guild too.  I guess you can't trust anyone these days.  I'll keep my eye out for Backs and see what that was all about.  Losing your stuff for an epic sucks.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

I think this is a GREAT idea!  In this thread it sounds like we've got 2 guys on Quellious who need the Hate stone(Glol and Wadin). AND this Backs character has been in contact with them both.<br />
<br />
My advice is to do it now and do it fast...because you never know who lurks our threads here. <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<br />
No offense intended to you at all, but I hate that kind of cop-out.  Roleplay or not, people can't just go around screwing other players over.  There are ways to roleplay an evil character or a thief without hurting other people.  In general society, stealing is unacceptable.  The same rules need to apply in all facets of society, including EQ.<br />
<br />
Besides, if that's the kind of attitude all Rogues were to display - that it's somehow "ok" for Rogues to steal because they're "roleplaying" - I think Rogues would quickly find themselves excluded from most groups and guilds.  Just like in RL, people won't tolerate thieves and con-artists.<br />
<br />
Using the excuse of being a Rogue to steal doesn't serve the Rogue community, and it hurts other players in the EQ community.  There are no excuses for this type of behaviour - what was done to Vytor is F'd up and there's no justification for it.</p>

<p>Feeldary, you usually say smart things at the Glade so I won't be too harsh on you.. but that was a really dumb comment. There is simply no excuse for scamming. Scamming somebody is not at all excusable.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Hello everyone and thanks for the support.  I was just contacted by another Ranger named Simples.  He told me a couple days ago Backs contacted him and was looking to MQ the Hate stone.  Thank god he had seen this post.  Simples also stated when Backs contacted him, Backs said he heard through one of Simples guildmates he needed the stone.  Simples asked who and Backs told him he had forgotten the name.  <br />
<br />
To be honest I am still furious that:<br />
<br />
1.  I was foolish enough to try this, and<br />
<br />
2.  He is still on trying to scam other people<br />
<br />
Other than slander in EC letting everyone know how much of a scammer this guy is, I am not sure how to better communicate this information to people.  Obviously even with three confirmed accounts of theft he has not been banned, which is a disappointment.  Please pass the word onto any and all Rangers you know on Quellious.  Backs is clearly the character he is using as the scam, but I know he also has many other high level characters.  I am not sure if he will switch to one of the others.  Xeba and Backs are the only two characters I spoke to him directly with, but many people have given me other names.<br />
<br />
As I sat there in Misty Thicket for two hours foraging tonight I thought about many people I have met in EQ, and how much I trust the people I call friends.  I am saddened to say this has left a very bitter taste in my mouth, and if you see me in game and I am not quite myself for a while, you will know why.  I am however trying keeping my chin up and won't let some loser get the best of me.  <br />
<br />
And I will take you up on that offer Baz.....it's been a long time since I saw ye last.  <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

G'night all and stay safe.<br />

Let's get this guy!  I do not know how, but I do not know if baiting him would work.  I think that Verant would not support us due to their stance on MQ.  I do know that the drops in reavers have been rare, but I think all ya need is the hammer.  If you need a raid to go to the Hole, I would hope that all of us could help ya.<br />
Good Luck and give a tell if you need help.<br />

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>Here's the reasons WHY Verant should(has to) do something about this guy Backs. Quoted from the EQ "Rules of Conduct":<br />
<br />
<blockquote><FONT face="arial,helvetica" size="1">quote:</font><hr><b>1.1(7)  You may not defraud other players.</b><br />
<br />
Fraud in all transactions between players will result in disciplinary action when confirmed by an internal EQCSR. Fraud is defined as falsely representing one's intentions to make a gain at another's expense. Examples of this activity include but are not limited to offering to drag the corpse of another player to safety but instead hiding it deeper in the dungeon as well as using flaws in a secure trade window to deprive someone of one of their items.<hr></blockquote><br />
Hmmmm... It seems like Backs violated this rule!<br />
<br />
And, for those of you who want to claim that he was "Role-playing" the rogue:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><FONT face="arial,helvetica" size="1">quote:</font><hr><b>1.1(11)  "Roleplaying" does not grant license to violate these rules.</b><br />
<br />
Though EverQuest is a Role-playing game, the claim of "Role-play" will not be accepted in defense of any of the anti-social behaviors mentioned above. As an example, you are in no case (PvP or otherwise) allowed to "Train" a guard onto an enemy in protection of your homeland. In another example, a rogue is not allowed to steal someone's corpse under the guise of role-playing a thief.<br />
<br />
By all means we want to encourage you to play your role, we just cannot allow that role-play to be done at another's out-of-game expense.<hr></blockquote><br />

<p>Lurked these boards for a long time, and now I must speak...this guy Backs is scum of the earth.  <br />
<br />
I MQ'd my Swiftwind with my RL brother so I was safe, and would MQ only with him, my guild or his guild.<br />
<br />
As to the question of a short cut to Earthcaller.  I've heard the druids just destroy their bowl when finished with it.  Have a druid (guildie preferred) turn in the bowl to Jahel, the ranger in need loots the hammer. Still need the PoA stone though **shrug** best I can think of.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I have no doubt that was the real Backs posting above. In the last day, Backs was in the Quel auction zone (ec) to rub salt into the wounds.  I logged in to catch the tail end of the shouts when he was shouting something to the effect of “I can’t help it if people want to give me stuff.”<br />
<br />
There have been others, not mentioned above, that have also been scammed on Quell.  So maybe at least a dozen Rangers get to start over from scratch on epic.  Considering the amount of time/effort involved to get this far, I am at loss for words.<br />
<br />
It’s the BS from one person like this that causes many good folks to just give up on EQ.  <br />

<br />
Park an alt in EC and check for this P.O.S. everytime you log on, Then SHOUT about his scam , be relentless. Put the him on your friend list, it may seem like a waste of a spot but then you will always know when he is on.<br />

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>It has been a habit of mine that whenever somebody tries to solicit me for my hard-earned money whether by trade of services or items, they do things by MY terms. I remember THEY bothered ME and want MY MONEY.. they are not there to be my friend, they want my cash one way or another.<br />
<br />
Hence, I approach them with extreme caution and persist that they do things my way - in this case, I would refuse payment until I had an Earthcaller in my hands. If they don't like the risk that I wouldn't pay them, that's too bad.. they have to remember I am their customer and they must do things my way or forfeit my 'business'. In all my time in MMOG's I have not been scammed.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend that everyone adopts this stance. The MQ'er that bothered you on your time has to do things by your rules. If they refuse, they are not worth it. Remember that the customer should always be in control of the transaction.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Well. I must say that I'm really sorry for what happened to Tortuga and Tegeras. I know those guys. They really don't deserved to be scammed.<br />
<br />
This guy Backs was also trying to scam me by offering me to MQ the HATE stone too. But since I'm not in that part yet ( need HOLE, VSR, Jade and HATE ) , I turned down his offer, plus I never carry equipment that I would like to sell later. I alway have what I need and nothing more.<br />
<br />
This kind of people really need to be stopped. Too bad I didn't took a screenshot of the conversation or else I could have enough proof to talk to a GM and take some action<br />

<p>Okay how about this. . .<br />
<br />
Lets port him to skyfire while some meanies (cough) are hanging around the wizzy circle . . . so he gets killed. . . darn . . .<br />
<br />
Wizzy /tell Backs "Crap I ported to the wrong place ! Sorry about that. Consent me I have a cleric at the zone who can rez us. . ."<br />
<br />
Drag Backs corpse to some lava pit.<br />
<br />
Turn the screws to Backs.<br />
<br />
Tell every necro who comes into the zone NOT to summon his corpse until he coughs up the cash, and bards should not find it for him<br />
<br />
All of the above occurances of course would be "on accident" except for the necro business. That is where is bad rep comes into play.<br />
After all VI wants us to know that our reputation is important correct? <br />

<p><b> perhaps a save?</b></p>

<p>Maybe I don't understand the intricacies of MQing, but let me relate a simple example of my point:<br />
<br />
There is a quest where you turn in 4 bone chips and get a little reward.  If you turn in 3 bone chips, you get no reward, and you walk away. Some time later, another person initiates the quest, turning in 4 bone chips-- he gets his reward and moves on. Another player comes and does 4 bone chips -- gets his reward and moves on. A fourth player initiates the quest, but gives the NPC one bone chip at a time instead of all four at once. After the first bone chip is given, the NPC matches that to the initial first three and *presto*, the fourth player gets credit for completing the quest, though he only turned in one chip.<br />
<br />
Relating this to Earthcaller:<br />
<br />
Isn't it possible that all these unfinished quest items are stored up in the NPC's memory? That approaching him with the missing last piece (be it the stone or whatever) would trigger completion of the quest? Most players, usually hand in all items at once, so I doubt other players would have cleared out these mismatches.<br />
<br />
Only hiccup I can see is that all bets are probably off if there has been a patch: doesn't that reset all NPCs? I apologize if I'm talking out of my behind, but I'm just trying to brainstorm a possible solution, and I know the bone chip example from first-hand experience.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>If you do have the stone, why do this to another player?  Why would you want to make his life miserable?  What gain do you get from this?</p>
<hr>
<i>Posted by Vytor Vexxen on 10-31-2001 01:15 AM:</i>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>I almost wasn't going to respond to this, but I will.  Your "rep" is something I really don't care about.  Your actions speak for themself and I don't have to do anything to have a negative effect on it, you have already ruined it.  Even though I hated to waste a spot with your name, you have earned the right to be on my /friend list and I will be around for a long time.  I will continue to tell people of your heartless deeds.  I will randomly pop up where you are just to say hi, and /shout about our dealings.  I cannot control whether people group with you or not, but my ultimate goal would be to make sure people know what kind of person they are grouping with.  Once a thief, always a thief.  <br />
<br />
And for your information, I know for a fact that you did not hand the stone in.  I know that you stole an Amulet of Necropotence the other day, and I know that you are a blatent liar.  I know that many other people despise you and have also been screwed over by your actions.  I loath you and people like you.  You prey on people that you believe are weak and foolish, but unfortunatly for you, you picked the wrong person.  My continued pursuit of this case is far from over.<br />

<p>I didn't finish reading all of the posts. I too have been through this with backs. he also have a 52 warrior I believe named barur. nonolian was the char he first contacted me on. I've been on the last step since early in feb of this year so I too was very excited to hear about someone that would MQ the hate stone. However, Ryowen a 59 ranger in Hero of Heros (my guild) was scammed out of a few items and I heard about it from him and read his post on the quellious board. So I told the guy he wasn't getting anything up front. I couldn't even remember the guys name from the thread on quellious but it turned out to be the same guy. I figured i was safe if i turned in item prior to paying him. I never even imagined that he would allow someone to just throw the 2nd half of the epic away and then laugh about it. Truly sick f*ck this guy is. Nonolian told me that Barur was the char he was saying had the stone, but mysteriously Backs showed up to "vouch for his good character" so that I would give him some items prior to the MQ. I adamantly told him no about 15 times then had my friend port us out. So lucky me because he wanted a fungi up front. Ryowen fortunately didn't lose his sword, that appears to be a new and cruel twist to this guys scam. He just gave him some stuff and the guy /q'd out.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story it seems is that you should really only MQ stuff like this with someone you really trust and know personally.<br />
<br />
Here's Ryowen's original thread on quellious boards.<br />

<br />
I am very very sorry to hear about your loss Vytor. Backs in all his character formations is a true scumbag and should be dragged out into a field, beaten with bats by a couple big ass guys,  then buried alive casino (i think) style.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>This Backs character is a known scam aritst on the Quellious server.  I have had the misfortune of running into him numerous times over the past few weeks.  He scams on trades, kill steals, and just is out to ruin everyones time.  During the Halloween events he kept killing the North Ro quest mob because he could.  He needs to be drawn and quartered.<br />

<p>I make it a point to inform my groups that you are not welcome to join when I see in the zone.  I also tell them why. There aren't that many places to hunt over 50.  Everyone will know what you did before long.  I just hope they take my advice and avoid you all together.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon4.gif" alt="Exclamation" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Bait idea  - may stop him anyways</b></p>

<p>For those of you on Quellious, while his hearing about the bait idea is bad - i think he has a problem now, US.<br />
<br />
If anyone who seems to be buying into his MQ Scam could be just baiting him for getting caught by a server GM.   Then he dare not try it agian (with out being even more of a fool than he is).<br />
<br />
I say that all who read this on Quellious, especially those that have not posted here, simply agree to MQ with this ***hole and instantly /petition it so that he will be caught.<br />
<br />
A server GM can instally tell that Backs has no such item on himself or in the bank and can then take action once the terms are confirmed and he says "so go ahead and give me the money".<br />
<br />
Ok Backs - lets see you get around that one...<br />
<br />
You loose faction with Ranger Community<br />
You loose faction with Players of Quellious<br />
You loose faction with Harodotus<br />
<br />
May the lag beast bite you and your account be perma-banned.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I havent been scammed by Backs but I met him during the recent halloween events and he didnt make a good impression. For more than an hour he was shouting out orders like he had been elected king and he insisted on only using caps in all he said. Very annoying attitude. He has been blacklisted by my guild and I will make an effort to tell my friends about him too.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Heh, now backs will have to watch his back..<br />
<br />
Seriously tho dude, this is being linked all over, seemed ye irked some people with that witty comment above. A truly smart rogue wouldnt have posted at all.<br />
<br />
At least his ranger preying is over, he wont know what is bait and what isnt, now. If he contacts you, reply in varying manners from reluctance to eagerness, bargain or dont bargain.<br />
<br />
Those scammed by this person, copy and paste those rules above and include it in a email to the head server GM detailing what has happened to you. If you do not know the head GM's email, contact a guide or GM and insist upon recieving it, they will give it to you. If they try to snowball you and offer to take care of your problem themselves, say that it is a problem concerning a violation of the Everquest rules and that you wish to email someone in charge.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/Tear_Face.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> what a nice welcome</b></p>

<p>Boy, I return to the game yesterday after a four month layoff and this is what I come back to.  Vytor, you might not remember me but you won your Cloak of Flames over me by about 12 points on that Nags raid a few years back.  <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Since then I haven't known you at all in game but I've seen you around, as well as Tortuga and the rest.  To see that this happened really leaves a horrible taste in my mouth.  I had a bit of bad luck with my epic quest as well but it didn't have anything to do with a scam artist like this.<br />
<br />
I don't have any distinct memories of Backs (I'm still re-learning some of the zone acronyms after my break) but I do remember the name, and that I didn't care for him at the time.  I will definitely keep an eye out for him in the future.<br />
<br />
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you out Vytor.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

<p>Backs you fool, you wont get away with hitting another person, you're fu*ked with the wrong ranger one too many times, i am a gear in EC and 1 gear can stop everything, you are going down and going down fast you little prick<br />
<br />
you've cost some of my friends everything, and some more. I will see to it personally that another ranger on quellious is ever scammed you lying sack of sh*t<br />
<br />
You were somehow admited to my guild once, and before i became an officer you were removed when this was found out. I am now the leader of Dark Side and you will not get away with this again. And if that actually isnt backs, then we wont hear this until i catch his sorry ass in EC<br />
<br />
My apologies about me not having another ranger informed, the world shall be all around EC from now on, i will make it one of my guild's number 1 things. We may not be a Vis Major or a Lotus Cult but damn straight you find yourself in a PVP arena you wont get your corpse w/o friends or a necro!!!<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> Thank god for Moderators</b></p>

<p>Just wanted to thank Backs for posting here because moderators have logged his IP so it's possible to contact his ISP about his actions or at least ban his subnet from the glade to stop the harassment :P<br />
<br />
Grief players suck.  Whoever moderates here should feel free to use ARIN whois, work with his ISP, learn and post his home phone number to the US Telemarketing database and click the checkbox "Yes, I don't mind sales calls after 10 PM Pacific" at the very least.<br />
<br />
Sorry man, I still use my epics even with the velious toys out there.  Don't worry though, it's not like our epic quest is ..say...Magi in difficulty :P<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>
