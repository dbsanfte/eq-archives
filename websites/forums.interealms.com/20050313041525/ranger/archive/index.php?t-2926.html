So you can spend 20k on a bow that does the same DPS as a DN bow you can buy for 2k?  DEAL!!! <br />
<br />
Um...yeah.  That, and it's got 5 Str, Dex, Agi, Wis, 50 HP and Mana, and 10 to Saves Fire, Cold and Magic.<br />
<br />
This thing is head and shoulders above a dragon-dropped bow! (Skydarkener, off Wuoshi, not hard, but c'mon, it's a dragon!)<br />
<br />
Add to that that you have to have 230+ fletching skill to craft this reliably (and still count a great deal on luck) and the components of an attempted combine alone cost upwards of 2k.  20k is certainly reasonable.<br />
<br />
Oh, and hey, this thing gives you an actual reason to grandmaster fletching!  Sure, you could before with acrylia arrows.  But that's a lot like grandmastering Jewelcraft for the gold jasper earrings; not precisely the most useful item around, quite expensive for their little utility and hardly a bankbreaker/maker.</div></div><hr />

Funny, I like my primal velium reinforced bow that Hshraana the Warder dropped just fine...<br />

if they are 2k on test lovely, but ive only ever seen two veliums auctioned on drinal when i was looking, as i said in other thread it frees up multi spots in bank too</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you vastly underestimate the value of this item.<br />
<br />
1. This target market for this item is NOT the top 2% of the player base who can get primal, WBoRZ, BoD, and so on. Many of the people(the top ones) in the target market are raiding PoF/PoH, the lesser Kunark and WW dragons, maybe Kael, and getting wiped out often on all of it..<br />
<br />
2. A 30/38 with the outstanding 250 range is the best tradeable bow in the game. The advantage vs AE targets is huge, especially since the people in this crowd usually have poor resists(no NToV gear). And as high damage + high range it's value for pullers is also huge(more then Rangers can use this).<br />
<br />
3. This collection of range slot stats is nothing short of amazing for the target market. For these low resist, low hp, low stat people, this thing is great. Even without the fact that it's a great bow, the range slot stats would bring a hefty price.<br />
<br />
4. The look. It has a great look. People pay for things with great looks. That's the way it goes.<br />
<br />
5. It's rare. It is not trivial at 250, and still fairly hard to make at that skill. It can only be made by Woodelves. The Woodelf is going to have to be a good smith too for the fier'dal forge. It requires hours worth of foraged parts per attempt. It requires at least 2 blue diamonds per attempt and you have 7 differant combines in which you can loose the blue diamonds. Getting the skill is harsh. Going past 202 is very hard, and expensive. Going past 225 is much harder still. (225 to 231 took me 417 fletching attempts at 255 dex, that is not accounting for the associated smithing attempts or the massive time spent camping drops by me and my very nice/helpfull friends). It's hard, and that makes it rare. People pay more for rare things. That's just the way it is.<br />
<br />
It will easily go for 20k, if you can even find somebody selling one on your server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyone who feels less is definatly not a fletcher attempting this, or is being a tiny bit too smug about being in the top 1% and getting primal, wborz, or something on that level. this is after all the best tradable bow in the game.<br />
<br />
soz sells for 50k and sometimes more, and there are other 1h slash out there that are equal and aren't too difficult to obtain with one or two groups. it's all about perspective ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone have a definite trivial on this yet?  If it's like Velious tailored items, i.e. no trivial, people who want to buy this bow will have a tough time respecting the amount of effort required to make it.  I blew way too much cash trying to make a Tigeraptor Cloak, just to say I did it.  This bow is even harder to make - again, assuming it never trivials.  Just thinking about actively trying to make this bow gives me headaches.<br />
<br />
I'd say add a few k to whatever the Double Recurve Velium Bow sells for, and there's your PC....</div></div><hr />

If willing for that im game. I used all my stuff making a couple more for friends and guildies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxxius</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People to argue here what the bow SHOULD sell for is pointless.  The Market will determine the price plain and simple.  If you want to ask 20k for it fine, but if no one is buying it at that price because a competitor is selling it for 13k well your out of luck.  The people that will buy it are probably those that are unlikely going to ever get a super nice no drop bow.  They also probably don't have 20k to plop down for a bow either.<br />
<br />
Is it a sweet bow ? Yup.  Will it sell for 20k? Maybe a few mght pay, but I suspect the price will be eventually closer to 10k.  This is not a knock on the bow nor is it ignoring how hard it was to get to the point to be able to make the bow, it is simply a reflection of the realities of the marketplace.<br />
<br />
Remember, this is a player made item and hence, in theory, it has an unlimited supply.  As such a lost sale is exactly that, a lost sale and therefore lost profit.  You can hold out for 20k I suppose, but if you could sell 10 of them for 10k (and assuming that still renders a profit at that price) you will make more money in the long run.</div></div><hr />

So you can spend 20k on a bow that does the same DPS as a DN bow you can buy for 2k?  DEAL!!! <br />
<br />
mmm. yeah. same DPS. Now go buy a range item with equivalent stats that also matches the DPS.  And figure you can do that DPS from 100 yards further away with these bows.<br />
<br />
What makes this bow very appealing is the combination of decent archery DPS, excellent archery range, and quite respectable range item stats.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In general trade-based items start high and quickly drop to just over cost.  Long-term, there is no way you can continue to support a 700% mark-up (if I am reading this right that's the amount) for long.  2500pp per attempt someone quoted.  Even with a 50% failure rate, 20k would represent a 300% profit.  Market forces are going to come into play, and just like the fleeting quiver or the velium fire opal ring, eventually you'll have to settle for a profit margin of 50% or less.  Depending on failure rate, the eventual price of one of these bows should be 4-7k roughly (assuming 2500pp per attempt is correct and failure rate is in the ballpark of 50%).<br />
<br />
So the short version is, if you are one of the first few players on your server to make these, you'll clean up.  If you are one of the hundreds who come along later, you'll probably never recover the money you spent learning the skills needed.<br />
<br />
Me?  I plan to hold out a while.  20k is a lot to spend on a bow.  It's a damn good bow, but I can wait till it's 10k or so.  It'll happen, and it won't take that long.</div></div><hr />
