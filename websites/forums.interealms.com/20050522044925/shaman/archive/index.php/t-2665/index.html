I didn't think what he was doing was very nice at all, but I had to laugh at some of the stuff he said, he and my boyfriend have very similar senses of humor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sssithmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Charmed mobs keep thier faction.  So some one attacked the bard, and the PoD assited.  Same thing for bards soloing dragons in WW, charm a CoV mob, have it attack what you want to kill near another CoV mob, once the mob damages your charmed CoV mob, boom, dead mob.  And mobs over 55 dont poof if an npc assist, so as long as you do 1point of damage ......<br />
<br />
And in defense of pvp servers, once you've killed uber_mob_034 for the 20th time whats left?  Sure you get your share of jack asses but there are jerks on every server.  Some of the best times I've ever had in EQ are massive 60-70 person battles.  PvP is not for every one, thats fine, but just remeber it is a pvp server, expect to die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's more sad is if Fansy had a tad less wit, and presented it with a tad less humor, many people who are laughing at it would express various levels of distain or outrage. It is sad that something which is negative by nature can be made over to become entertainment among those who always presumed they have values to uphold.<br />
<br />
Just because the perpetrator made it &quot;funny&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Boinshar, there is still a bit of a perspective angle to the humor.  This is a game, people are not truly hurt (property, physically) in an way.  I do think Fansy went too far and I'm really really glad that I don't play on that server.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, what I mean to say is, I can see the humor in what Fansy said because it wasn't a terrible situation.  I doubt I would find Hitler* or bin Laden* funny, no matter how witty they were.<br />

* extreme examples</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Geeze can there be more red server hate on the boards lately? Yall act like bluebies cant and dont grief eachother, never talk smack on message boards or in game, and that yer poo dont stink =p<br />
<br />
And regarding SZ.. everyone who plays there *knew* *knew* *knew* they were signing up for a NO RULES pvp server with NO level limitation and NO protection from trains, pvp exploits or anything. What Fansy did at the time he did it was *perfectly* within the rules according to the Sullon Zek ruleset, as ANYONE who plays or played on SZ should know(IE they werent poor downtrodden victims.. they willingly put themselves in the path of danger knowing the risks).<br />
<br />
Note: I dont play on SZ.. for exactly the reasons stated by many here and the above clarification, but the broad sweeping bile directed towards red players lately and frequently on the board required rebuttal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's funny and sad a the same time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It's not really about how &quot;evil&quot; the red players are, nor is it really about how &quot;good&quot; the blue players are, because let's face it, we all have our own little &quot;evil&quot; tendencies. It's not about sympathy for Fansy's &quot;victoms&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's about how easily people can be diverted via presentation, and how easily their &quot;values&quot; get ignored.<br />
<br />
If some d00d performed that with a whole bunch of bastardized words and incomplete sentences, many people who are laughing at it now would be posting in an entirely different nature.<br />
<br />
He's exploiting a bug, to kill people, for his own pleasure. The only thing funny about it is his delivery, and I guess more people pay attention to that than what's actually going on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I thought it was funny.<br />
<br />
For a server that had few rules from the outset, he wasn't doing anything wrong.  Rules are rules, and there were no rules to break.  That's what makes SZ a hell hole.<br />
<br />
Not to stereotype everyone on that server, but there's an inproportionate amount of morons and &quot;dewds&quot; on it vs any other server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Shouldn't PoD attack Fansy as well?<br />
<br />
She did hit him when the charm broke, so why doesn't PoD assist her then?<br />
<br />
Also this is SZ, a no-rule server.  They shouldn't be on that server if they has something to complain about this.  There are dozens of servers to choose from last time I checked.  <br />
PS: Funny as hell, Good work Fansy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bards aren't the only ones who can do this.  I've done this with charm animals in Qeynos on occasion.  I've also had it done to me on occasion.   All ya need is ally faction (or at the minimum better faction than your victim, but can be risky) to the guards/npcs you want to use to kill other pc's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What a bunch of contradictions SZ seems to be.<br />
<br />
1) The &quot;no-rules&quot; server suddenly invents rules.<br />
2) Good is 11% of the server. I am sure that when L337 d3wd_01 and his band of merry SK_Trolls whack some guy at 40% there isn't any consternation over the rules.<br />
<br />
Fair fight? Yeah right. Suddenly the evils are whomped by a perfectly viable strategy and they resort to name calling?<br />
<br />
Cough poosaes cough.<br />
<br />
Go Fansy.<br />
<br />
Man, these D00ds got PWFND and the best they can come up with is &quot;Dude you are gay IRL right?&quot;<br />

<br />
The newts should have called on forces to kill fansy. That's what happens when the evils/newts corpse camp the good guys, and as Faern pointed out no one complains when a group of evils kill one goody over and over, but everyone kicks up a stink when one guy goes on a killing spree.<br />
<br />
It was a bad move getting the GMs involved.</div></div><hr />

You look on Fires of Heaven website, you see &quot;We killed this suxxor ubermob and got SS of all the phat lewt which sucks cuz we be uber lol&quot; over and over again. All the other uberguild websites look exactly the same. Fansy's? You come away and /shout GO GO GOOD TEAM!</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvP will always atract the same kind of jerka over and over and over again.  People who take great pleasure in causing other people frustration.  Some people in PvP are fine but their will always be large numbers of people like Fancy (not as clever or as smart) that are atracted to PvP becuase the think it is fun to go around greifing others.<br />
<br />
I disagree with people that think someone can make a perfect PvP game that will solve these problems.  The problems are not in the game they are in the people that play the game and it does not make any differance what rules the game enforces they will figure out a way to do what they want to do.<br />
<br />
If you realy want a guud PvP game then joo must have a method for policing the population just like IRL.  Identify, locate and exclude the greifers form the environment and joo can end up with a guud PvP game regardless.<br />
<br />
Showdowbane?  Looks like a great game concept but no thanks....  I don't want to play in a world that will be dominated buy a buch of 20 somthings who have huge time to play but no real life.<br />
<br />
Mez not want to listen to a bunch of d00ds or smack or whatever the current &quot;cool&quot; speach term is.  I don't care what =D or :\ or &lt;3 or .. means.  I just want to play an online fantasy game and have a lot of fun, and I do :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">The best thing about Fansy is the way he never lowers himself to the moronic level of the rest of the population.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Folks please remember that beaing a victem is the only true way to be a god at the game .<br />
<br />
Please remember that when people can kill you with zero effort or risk that they then know thier place in the universe is complete.<br />
<br />
Please remember that anyone on a blue server is a soft, mewling, farming peice of **** that only deserves abuse and mocking name callings because they are obviously weaker than the masterful, amazing, super skilled folks on the real EQ servers.<br />
<br />
Please remember that the only real players of EQ are red, everyone else is dead. Or fooling themselves.<br />
<br />
Please remember that the red servers are 733T (Or some such I cant spell K001 D00d very well sorry) And the stinking bluebies are only here at their suffance.<br />
<br />
Please remember that Red servers have won Every damn thing due to thier super skills and amazing tactics. (Oh you mean they havnt?)<br />
<br />
None of the stinking bluebies have the right to even look upon the might, glory, and sheer cock size of any red player.  Bluebies are not worthy. <br />

Snoww Silverhammer Bashy bear. E marr &lt;--- Yes a Blue server, I tried Red. Found it to be childish, populated by punks and weasles, and simply not much fun. It is like a server full of wannabe druids. (Level 19 Shaman on Rallos Zek Almost 3 years ago.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember SZ is like Rallos only worse.  There really &quot;no rules&quot; so they changeds some of the game mechanics... like a 20% ?? or so raise in xp gain across the board and specific quests for no drop gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Grump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">SZ is also hardcoded unlike RZ, no grouping, buffing, healing, binding anyone on the other team. There are no immortal healers/buffers, you can attack anyone not on your team. It is not item loot like RZ. There is no lvl limit on who you can pk. You take 50% less xp for all deaths. And yes there are no rules. So these things make SZ &gt; RZ not worse imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">As some others have mentioned, I don't see why it's okay to have &quot;no rules&quot; when that is to the advantage of the evil crew(or neuts in this case), but when they are the ones getting killed, it's suddenly time to implement rules. <br />
<br />
All of these people should have known what they were getting themselves into when they signed up for a very well advertised &quot;no rules&quot; server. I know personally I would expect to find every exploit and cheesy tactic to be used to its fullest effect on this server. Some of the folks he killed were indeed innocent and wanted to just loot their corpse and get out, I do feel sorry for them in a way, but they should expect to get hit with cheese like this. <br />
<br />
That kind of humor is indeed somethingawful.com type humor, he even used several catchphrases that originated in the SA forums. Very amusing indeed.</div></div><hr />

As cheesy as corpse camping (happened to me twice on my week long tenure on SZ), zoneline camping, portal camping, recoup rushing...?   This should just be an openening eyes to how PVP is (a hillarious one at that) and just move on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">The thing that bugs me is it's &quot;okay&quot; for the evils to do it, but if someone on the good team tries it then it's obviously wrong. You can't pretend for a second that if those evils/neuts had thought of those exploits they would've jumped at the chance to grief as many goods as they could for as long as possible. That's why people pick the evil team! They think then they'll be evil and just grief others! But when the tables are turned... /sigh<br />
<br />
If I'd thought of it, I probably would've done it too. It's kind of funny how all the evils/neuts were lashing out at him and actually petitioning on a &quot;no rules&quot; server. Geez... you want GMs to come save you from trains you should be on a different Zek. All the people that complained &quot;I'm just trying to level&quot; and such are the ones that should NOT be on SZ. It's PvP. You kill or be killed. Take every advantage you can get. Why don't you petition that Necro for gating after he dotted you... or the Iksar for only fighting in the water... or Caster_01 for levitating out of range... etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
And I thought the whole thing was stupidly funny and laughed the whole way through before proceeding to send the link to all of the RL EQ playing friends... who then proceeded to laugh themselves silly.<br />
<br />
I especially like this bit.<br />

I'm not saying I agree with those &quot;tactics&quot; at all, but since there are no rules against them, I can't say I'm surprised to hear such a report from a week's stay on SZ. Maximum cheese is legal, so maximum cheese will be served.  And yeah I gotta admit it is comical, seems to be like a melting pot of dewds, griefers, idiots,and other such nonsense.</div></div><hr />

Seriously I would have a much larger problem with it if it was on a server that had a play nice policy or any rules what so ever.<br />
<br />
It isn't a bug, it is a clever use of the very few rules actually put on the server (under 5 can't be attacked).  When Verant changed it so that he wouldn't have this immunity, he went in and found another great loop hole in the rules.<br />
<br />
Does it suck to be nailed like that?  Yep?  I can say I was a halfling rogue that was hit by Fancy myself in Rivervale.  I died, found out what was going on, and proceeded to do something else for the evening.  I wasn't going to be dumb enough to fall for the same trick twice.  It sucks being killed by someone who is doing something I would never have thought of, and for him to be so persistant about causing grief.  But, it was also funny as hell to see all of the stuff that was said as well.<br />
<br />

it IS kinda funny that they didnt call in help for the pod thing. I've seen a well equipped monk solo pod down under 1/4 hp..not like it takes too much oomph this late in the game.<br />

He is witty in a way though.  Not nearly as funny as Bonedood &amp; Platedood.  That was quality l33tPK humor.  It would have been an honor to be AzzR4p3d by those guys.</div></div><hr />

If you ant PvP there need to be some ingame mechanics that doens't make it horrible like corpse camping or a guy 40 lvl higher than you destroying your gameplay.<br />
&quot;hey it's PvP stop whining&quot; says the high lvl redish player. How would ytou feel if at lvl 10 you couldnt do anything at all because of higher lvls?<br />

I am VERY glad to see the high lvl 55+ group being taken down by a lvl 6 bard btw. This game is overly broken.</div></div><hr />
