<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's been a crazy four and a half years of EQ. I started playing just after Kunark was released, and have seen the highs and the lows and everything inbetween when it comes to the shaman class. <br />
<br />
I'll never forget soloing Yeldema the day I dinged 60, with a meager 2250hp self buffed because HP gear didn't exist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiding&quot; mistmoore at level 23.<br />
<br />
Killing Sir Lucan Delere to finish Tavist's soulfire.<br />
<br />
CoM Reaver raids!<br />
<br />
Tower of Frozen Shadow, 3rd best zone in the game.<br />
<br />
The first time I saw Dain Frostreaver die. <br />
<br />
Entering Temple of Veeshan. <br />
<br />
Regular Howling Stones groups with a bunch of friends, because POP didn't exist and HS was awesome.<br />
<br />
Farming PoM for 2 months to get my boots. Then they ruined the zone. Bastards<br />
<br />
Killing Emperor Ssraeszha. <br />
<br />
Ninja AFKing in shifts with the other shaman on my team in VT. <br />
<br />
Dying 20 times in one night being the only shaman on for the RZTW script (god those Gindan Flayers were brutal).<br />
<br />
Camping my Sharkspine club with one of my best EQ buds, Reyortsed. He finally got his pet sword, and I got my sharkspine. He quit shortly later :(<br />
<br />
Being there for the first kill of every elemental god, and being a part of the first spite team for Rathe Council.<br />
<br />
Being there for each phase clear and god kill in time, and coming up with the strat that enabled us to drop quarm.<br />
<br />
Spending like 18 hours over 2 days in ikkinz, getting those damned trials done so we could raid.<br />
<br />
Being the only shaman on for Transcendence, and getting the class kill on one of those stupid golems :P<br />
<br />
FINALLY looting a TA on Saryrn kill #22, the first one to drop for my guild. in 30 times I've seen the bitch die, she dropped 16 mage veils.<br />
<br />
Uqua.<br />
<br />
Cursecallers aka the best event ever.<br />
<br />
That goddamned Zun event. Argh, its like tipt x 10000 plus a ring event. **** enchanters in the eye.<br />
<br />
Getting killed in trial of foresight trying to heal people who were dying due to thier own stupidity.<br />
<br />
Late night NToV runs. Wiping to Vulak script because we were laughing too hard from the &quot;penis&quot; game.<br />
<br />
Soloing Rumblecrush self buffed. Sorry XTC, I couldn't make it happen =\<br />
<br />
<br />
For you younger shaman out there, remember, have pride! Rabid bear is KEY! Daiku makes you impotent, and KEI makes you weak! You are the future, make it a good one.<br />
<br />
- Griz out<br />

<br />
I've only recently begun to post frequently on these boards, but you've made your impact on this community. if I had no other opinion, I'd simply have respect. I've read your posts on these boards and seen some of your experiences. I've seen some of these things myself and hope to continue to see more.<br />
<br />
I understand there are a variety of reasons for going in different directions, even as sudden as this one. all I can say is I hope things go well for you, and that I hope you are happy, because in the end, thats all that really matters.<br />
<br />
and with that comment, I can only simply bid you farewell.</div></div><hr />

Edit:<br />
<br />
943 was a crit with bane, and kinda a lousy one :(<br />
773 is 34% increase on sisslak's 577 base. I had the bracer from Zun Muram with 35% magic focus.<br />
<br />
.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">HOLY HELL - what Focii and AAs do you have to do 942 a tic with Bane?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Dot crits are dot crits. Any dot damage focus of 25% or better can make that 942 number.  Glowing Stone of Expulsion, Attunable range item from Kyv Bowhound in RCoD, would do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">That 773 from Sisslak is more telling. It requires a GoD focus of 45% or an OoW focus of 40%+.  He probably had Serpent's Girdle from the &quot;zoo&quot; event in Qvic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">He specifically said he was using the bracer from Zum'Muram Volklana, which has a 35% magic focus on dots and nooks up to 70.<br />
<br />
figure 420+(420*0.35) *2 for a max... is like a max crit of 1134 at the most.  so a 900's crit on bane with that focus is about average or sub-par like he was saying.<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
Oh bah, griz edited that focus int here after Sam and Brohg asked/commented. Now I feel like a tard heh  : :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Err I always thought that was true but I know that I &lt;b&gt;frequently&lt;/b&gt; get crits on Bane over 1000 so it must take into account the focii amount or something else screwy is going on.  I only have the glowing stone of expulsion, so nothing super special there.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">are you grouped with a bard when these super crits occur ladikennoch ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Super crits? hahaha<br />
<br />
No, I can't even remember the last time I grouped with a bard.  I see those crits both solo and when duoing with a friend's druid.   I never really gave it much thought until tonight.  I will have to solo some mobs and post the log I guess.  I know I'm not hallucinating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">It could be that the dot formula is different.  But that's definately the way it works for both nukes and heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Hey griz.. we need another shaman here in my guild now.. you should look me up first before you quit /wink</div></div><hr />

uh, actually, for DoTs, crits do double the focii. I've seen 1700 sisslak crits with a bard. Ultimate max crit would be with Dragon Thunder and a bard doing ancient, for 2077 or so.<br />
Hey griz.. we need another shaman here in my guild now.. you should look me up first before you quit /wink<br />
Who's paying the $75? not me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Kandies Cuddlehugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Hard to believe from his gear that Grizlor was in a Ikkinz raiding guild .

<br />
We should of dueled when both of our guilds were at the VT level in progression. Back when shaman were THE class to play.</div></div><hr />

This is the key post for me. Says it all. I think if my guild folded, my future in EQ would be identical. I would try another guild, just not find the &quot;magic&quot;, and fade away. I will probably pull a &quot;Matt Damon from Good Will Hunting&quot; though, where Ben Afflek says &quot;I wanna come knock on your door one morning, and your just gone, no goodbye, nothing, your just gone&quot; or something like that. <br />
<br />
Good luck Griz. You have been a staple on this board since the day I started posting here. I got my own Sharky the day I read your &quot;Get your own Sharky&quot; post, but it was more of an accident than a planned thing, since that was also the day after I got EP flagged and went to Water to help a Bard get his Class Pet Proc weapon, LOL (still use the Sharky as my DPS weapon, since I havent bothered picking up an HoH or an Illum Hammer).<br />
<br />
I would invite you over to Bertoxx, but my guild has enough shaman (4 REALLY active, 70% raid attendance, then me and 2 others semi-active, 10-30% attendance) and I doubt you would like any of the other guilds your &quot;level&quot; on my server. You seem more of a &quot;family guild guy&quot; than an &quot;in it to Win it, wheres the loot&quot; guy. <br />
<br />
See ya in Vanguard, heh, I know you will be there, just from reading your posts these months. Hope that game is MY answer to EQ steady decline to me. I love the game still, but . . . well you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Good luck Griz, you were one of the best posters to grace this place.  Welcome to retirement.  Shuffleboard is over there.  Bingo at 9.</div></div><hr />
