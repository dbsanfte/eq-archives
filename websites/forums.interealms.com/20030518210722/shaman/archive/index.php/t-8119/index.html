<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Again,<br />
OK, next question (and I realise that this may be more of a personal choice thing).  When do i start to worry more about Wisdom than AC/HP/STR?  I am just about to hit my first pet (lvl 34), and until now I have been focusing on being a pseudo tank.  I know, at 33, I make a pathetic tank, but my usuall P is a Druid, and thats worse than Shamy at tanking.  Anyway, with the comming of my puppy, I was thinking that now is the right time to make the switch to less ac/hp/str and more wisdom.  Am I way behind the curve, or will it all work out ok. What is the mana formula for wisdom anyway?  Thanks for taking the time to read and reply to this!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>chouka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I found that for a shamy, ac/sta is God followed by wis/hp/mana. I use the following formula: 1ac=1sta= 1.2pt  1wis=10hp=10mana= 1pt. Add up the points and you can compare items (not including items like regen/haste or other special items). <br />
<br />
You mention your pet, the thing to remember about Shamy pets is that they are a portable dot in a fur coat. They cannot tank, not even buffed. A typical encounter for me when soloing is as follow: Me fully buffed, pet with str, sheild, hp talisman. Cast haste on me and pet, pull with slow, sic pet, pet aggroes mob and get beaten up, cast fast dot (poison) mob decide to aggro me or I move up to the mob to get aggro... Tank for pet who unless you have a really nice weapon will most likely outdamage you big time. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I worried about AC, then HP, then Wis (in that order) until early 50's.  Then I realised I needed a tad more Wis.  Until lv. 52, my Wis never topped 150-160 or so.  Never had mana problems because I'm an active canni-dancer and had a bit of hiptoints on my gear.<br />
<br />
It's important to break 800 AC by your 40's (latest) I would think.<br />
<br />
Make sure to max defense.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It depends on your wis.<br />
<br />
Once you hit high 180's in wis, it starts becoming less of an issue. Before that, you probably are hurting by running OOM during battles.<br />
<br />
Once you get a wis level you're comfortable with - a good sized mana pool that enables you to not go OOM easily - I'd go HP. It's never to early to start, and most hp gear has good AC anyway.<br />
<br />
Str is worthless for us. We have good strength buffs, plus the rage line that stacks on top, and with that, plus str that comes naturally on my hp gear, I easily max out my str.</div></div><hr />

My AC is already 825(ish), but my Wisdom is Barely 125.  That is what has me worried. I was wondering how much manna you gain by having 25 more wisdom points (at level 34).<br />

I have 140 wis, im never oom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't know how accurate it is, but Caster's Realm has a mana calculator on it.<br />
<br />
This is what it says for 25 more wis at 34...<br />
<br />
Your Current Level Is: 34<br />
 <br />
The Base Wisdom For Your Char Is: 125<br />
 <br />
Your Base Mana At This Level Is: 918<br />
 <br />
Your Modified Wisdom Is Now: 150<br />
 <br />
Your Modified Mana At This Level Is: 1088<br />
 <br />
Extra Mana As A Result Of Modifiers Is: 170<br />
 <br />
170 / 25 = 6.8 mana per point of wisdom if my calculations are correct and the info at castersrealm is accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went AC for most of my early career.  My wis was around 145 to 150 for most of that time and I didn't have problems.  <br />
<br />
Now that I'm passed 50 I'm starting to run out of mana more often.  I'm in the process of changing over to more HP and wis/mana gear while trying not to lose too much AC. <br />
<br />
It's getting really expensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With 825(ish) AC, you should be tanking extremely well at lvl 33 unless you have low HP, or you're not slowing the mobs.<br />
<br />
You'll find that as you lvl and your slows, pets. and buffs get better, you can let Doggy tank more while you stand back and cast.  (Specifically, the 34 pet is a horrible tank and the 39 pet isn't much better.  Let the 44 pet tank till he's about 25% health, then you should take aggro from him.  He regens hp in between fights faster than you do.   My 49 pet tanks 75% of the time and the only time I even think about healing him is when I kill several mobs in a row without any breaks.)<br />
<br />
Regen/HP &gt; AC &gt; WIS/Mana  This applies at all lvls.<br />
<br />
The more hp and regen you have, the less often you have to heal mid-battle.  This frees up mana to dd/dot each mob more, and the faster the mob dies the less healing you have to do.  <br />
<br />
Sure, you can cast more spells before you go oom if you have a larger mana pool, but then you also have to cannibalize more and med longer to get the larger pool full again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heehe...Whoops,<br />
I was writing this from work, and got my numbers mixed-up.  My real AC is 685, NOT 825.  I guess I may have turned some heads at that snafu, I dont know how i could get it to 825 without paying about a million pp!!  Is that a very low AC for my level, or am I about right? I just started grouping in Rathe Mountains, so PP is comming in a little more frequently (thank God!!)<br />
