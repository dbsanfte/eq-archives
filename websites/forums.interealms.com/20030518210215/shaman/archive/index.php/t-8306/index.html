<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Canute Castrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A while ago my guild helped me get the Black dire pelt.<br />
I had no idea at the time what it was for but I've finally been researching diff. quests.<br />
<br />
My questions are:<br />
Can you turn in the pelt and recieve the boots w/o doing the other parts of the quest, and if you can will you have to do it again when completing the full spear quest?<br />
<br />
Also I read that the quest is bugged. Does anyone know if it is still bugged? <br />
<br />
and finally I'd appreciate all the help I can get on getting more info about quests, especially for shammys. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You must do all the steps of the quest leading up to the handing in of Black Dire's pelt FIRST. The quest is faction based and if you hand in the pelt before doing all the preceding quest parts, the spirit will eat the pelt because you didn't have enough Truespirit faction. But don't worry -- all the steps before Dire's pelt are very easy, just involving some time on your part.<br />
<br />
The epic quest is not bugged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Canute Castrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thx for Info.<br />
