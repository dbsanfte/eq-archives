<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just dinged 58 and up until this point I have had a full spell book (Minus PE and a few Poison nukes)<br />
<br />
Anyway, for the past few days I have been checking prices on Tigirs insects and have yet to see it for below 3k, now having only 5k to my name (and JC and smithing are draining it fast) i'm a little irked by this.<br />
<br />
Im just curious what 58-65 spells are worth paying the overinflated bazaar prices for? Which ones will I use on a daily basis and which are &quot;fluff&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure I can certinly think of a few for instances in which Tigirs would be nice to have, but they really don't constitute 3k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spells that are worth it....<br />
<br />
<br />
 Malo<br />
 Torpor<br />
 Pox of Bertoxxulous<br />
 Khura's Focus<br />
 Talisman of the Brute<br />
 Tigir's(important if you like old world dungeons like seb and KC, not much use in PoP)<br />
 <br />
 Avatar(highly situational, very useful for things like trials or boss mob fights)<br />
<br />
 These are the pre-pop ones... I'll let someone else who has more experience comment on the PoP ones.<br />
<br />
Beliael</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">3k is not bad at all for Tigir's and I would get it.<br />
<br />
I have noticed a dramatic drop in the price of spells and increased availability.<br />
<br />
It is time to go farm some cash to fill in a few gaps like Pox, Tigir's and Avatar.<br />
<br />
Lots of the PoP spells are getting quite cheep and the bazaar had a lot of spells in it last night.<br />
<br />
Malo x2<br />
Malos<br />
FoS x2<br />
Torpor<br />
Avatar<br />
<br />
and both the high level dots which where the most expensive.<br />
<br />
Things are so much less painfull now and I think that trend will continue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do the Stoicism quest if you missed that and definitely work on getting a copy of PE, IoS, and Levitation if you missed those too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll get Tigirs *sigh* Now I need cash.<br />
<br />
What should I start hitting to try and get PE, and componetless lev and EB?<br />
<br />
Got Stotism, no pure blood though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The sticky post at the top called &quot;Spell Locations&quot; is a fabulous reference on hunting for spells.  <br />
<br />
For Tirgir's I would suggest killing cliff golems in OT.  Don't buy a damn thing that you can kill for if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Imo which spells are worth it depends on if you are able to get flagged for tier2.<br />
<br />
if you can get tier2 flaged at 60/61, you can get lvl65 in 1 week if you are in pov everyday, or 2 weeks if you play avg.  <br />
<br />
think about it, theres no reason in these groups that you NEED malo or torpor, using kraggs mending and tnargs mending will fulfill most of the healing you will ever need to do for the most part.  <br />
<br />
Imo if you can get tier2 flagged just save the 100k that you would have to dump into torpor/malo and lvl to 65 in pov then get quiescence and malos.. i sure wish i had, because now less then a month after i dumped that much on torpor and malo im destroying them and dumping another 100k on quiescence and malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Everlasting Breath - a group of us went to Hate, both research components for this dropped within an hour or two.<br />
<br />
Levitation - both parts of the WIZARD research components (and yes, I scribed it) for this one dropped for me in FG within 4 hours.<br />
<br />
Finding the research components for these two spells was SO MUCH easier than hunting down the spells, themselves, IMO.<br />
<br />
Tirgir's - every time I've killed Juggs in Seb at least one copy (or three) of this has dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After looking from level 50 to 57, I never saw Tirgir's for less than 4k in the bazaar.  The day I dinged 58 I went in bazaar and saw it for 1.5k.  Very nice to have when you need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The only time I get much use out of tigirs in in places like chardok royals.  The 4 target limit, tiny range, and high resistability makes it a very mediocre spell imo.  Not worth more that a couple kpp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you want Tigirs head to seb and get a group to do Juggs, drops very commonly there. Torpor and Malo and Pox can drop off Juggs/Jumpy allegedly, but I have never seen them. You will get dozens of Mala, Mage pets, Druid spells and all manner of other junk, but apart from Tigirs and maybe Bane of Nife shammy spells are rare.<br />
<br />
Damn annoying really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll get Tigirs *sigh* Now I need cash.<br />

<br />
If you can get together a group for jugs, I wouldn't bother with  trying to buy it. It really is a pretty common drop down there. <br />
<br />
Same goes for the levitate spell. An easier camp than jugs and a 35ac pally and SK cloak/shield drops off of the same mobs so it shouldn't be too hard to get a decent group up. 4 people your level would be more than enough. <br />
<br />
EB camp is a bitch. Don't thik I'll ever waste my time on that. <br />
<br />
PE is an extremely common drop. If you do the camp you'll get 2 or more every time, and usually one group acumen. Never gotten more than one and had one trip were we didn't get any copies. The reason you don't see PE more often is because you need one person with the key to get into the Mystic room and even these days I wouldn't consider it a trivial camp, mainly because of the occasional elite that hits for 450 and can't be slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Korginard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Both Malo and Pox dropped off Severilous the other night, which was a nice surprise since all I expected was to help my brother get his Warrior his Green Scale.<br />
 I've helped kill him a few times before tho, and usualy all I saw was Voice of the Beserker, which I've always assumed is one of the not worth it type. Correct me if I'm wrong, I never won the random and don't have it, but I assume I'm not missing much since I rarely if ever solo and I'm not even sure it would be usable then<br />
