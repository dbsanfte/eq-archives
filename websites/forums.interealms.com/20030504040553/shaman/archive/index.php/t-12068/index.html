<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I put points into Healing Gift 1 last week. I have gotten lots of 2600 crits on Tnargs, but not a single crit on Kraggs. Since I cast Kraggs about 10 times more often than Tnargs, this seems odd. Can anyone verify if they work together? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">anything considered a &quot;complete heal&quot; doesn't get affected by AA or foci as far as my research has found.  Please correct me if I'm wrong :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've seen many, many clerics Crit Complete Heal for 15,000. After talking to some people on my server with more AA than I, we've come to the conclusion that it doesn't work on any percent based heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Healing AA/foci don't work on druid/shaman CHes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As it currently stands you can't crit the precent based heals but you can increase them with healing adapt. Healing focus items like improved healing iv etc don't work with it tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It doesnt, I asked before same question...feel kinda wasted since I got Advance healing gift 1...<br />
well when a crit tnarg land it still helps a lot</div></div><hr />
