<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have some friends who play DAoC and say it's not as problem ridden as things they hear about on EQ.  Also what are the requirements of DAoC as opposed to SoL?  I mean if it's not as much what was the thinking here?  I feel like a dial up user with 64M of ram now that changes were made and I don't have SoL yet.  I got on last night and only half of my songs worked :(.  Not to mention WHY DO BARDS NEED A CASTING TIME METER ?????.  I don't know if I speak for other bards but this is annoying.  I have packet loss out the whazoo and lag from the 9th layer of hell where I never had any.  It takes minutes to load a zone like I was back on dial up and having half a gig of ram and a cable modem are useless now....except to download patches really fast, ha.  I'm wearing of paying 29.99 to have tons of lag and slow system play just to have new character models and a new place to go.  Taking bard's Selo's Accelerandro is like taking caffeine away from a coffee drinker no likey be very bad :).  Anyone else not seeing the logic in this new upgrade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of that is bug related and will be fixed soon.<br />
The long zoneing and lag, well expansions bring a lot of players back into the game, so thats prolly temorary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Frankly, VI has done a lousy job of optimizing their programming, and it is showing badly right now with this much new content.  Expect things to smooth out a lot over the next three weeks or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, bard song seems to be working fine again.  It was linked to a bug they introduced with group buffs.  Since all but maybe three bard songs are group based, bard song just simply stopped working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Willow, I believe the recommended requirements for DAoC are the same as the minimum requirements for EQ-SOL.  However, given that Camelot has a PvP aspect that can be very sensitive to lag, I'd consider the hardware requirements about equal.  (Getting killed by a mob b/c you lagged is not fun; getting killed by an enemy PC b/c you lagged will make you pound your head on your keyboard.)<br />
<br />
In terms of content, DAoC is far ahead of where EQ was 2 months after release, but behind where EQ is today, especially in high-end content.  Considering that the &quot;average&quot; casual Camelotian is only now approaching 30th level, that's not a big issue.<br />
<br />
In terms of stability, DAoC was the smoothest release I have ever seen.  It was more stable 1 week after release than EQ is today.  It typically does take VI a few weeks to shake the bugs out after releasing new content, whereas Mythic does that on their Test server before rolling it out.<br />
<br />
I'll be getting SOL for Christmas, and am certainly looking forward to seeing everyone again, but I don't think SOL will bring me back to EQ going forward.<br />
<br />
PS when did you apply to KoE?  Heh.  Welcome home!<br />
<br />
EDIT:  OK, I looked at some of the graphics from SOL.  Maybe I'll be playing more than I thought :)</div></div><hr />
