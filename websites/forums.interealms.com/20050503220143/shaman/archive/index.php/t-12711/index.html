<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just browsing around recently, and looking at the uber and even not so uber guilds on my server as well as others, I have become kind of disturbed. As you might know many raiding guilds maintain a &quot;class priority&quot; listing. The first two or three times I saw shamans as &quot;very low&quot; or &quot;not accepting applications&quot; I just blew it off as a coincidence. But the more I looked I couldn't find a guild that was really seeking shamans or even happy to accept them.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
I checked rosters... most of them had 6 or 7 shamans at the most, whereas they had dozens of clerics or warriors or enchanters... all 3 listed as high priority on the class priority listings.<br />
<br />
From my experience more than 1 shaman is a waste of a raid slot. They want your buffs, they want a primary slower, and thats all. 1 shaman can do that all. After reaching 61, after all this time... I think I picked the wrong class. I wanted a mediocre soloer who was useful in groups and raids. Only the latter has left me feeling bad about my shaman...<br />
<br />
am I wrong about this? agreements/disagreements?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">because after you have about 5 shaman at a raid the extras are basically dead weights</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To be useful on a raid you have to be one of the highest level shamans there otherwise you're deadweight. Can get dull ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In my experience, you need 2 Shammy's on a raid.  If one dies, the other can keep the mob slowed.  Any other bears are just assist healers and DoT curers...  gets very boring.  If you have 5 shammy's in the roster, then you'll probably have 2 online during raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you can't compare yourself to a cleric or a damage class.. most guilds will always be looking for more of those.  Find your niche.  Work as a team malo, malosinia, slow , cripple.  Can all be cast by different people in quick succession.  also spreads aggro out so no one person gets raped.  If you get bored with that train up your healing aa and play cleric for a bit, or your nukes and play wizzy.  You can't really hold a candle to either but its sometimes fun to think you can :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wrothgar is correct.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, my guild puts multiple to shaman to good use on SOME encounters.  Like Vulak Ring has multiple simultaneous spawns, so get 'em all slowed at once.  Behemoth requires you to split up into four sub-raids to handle the corners, each needs a shaman.  But for the most part if you're not one of the top 3-4 shaman there you are an inferior cleric.</div></div><hr />

/boggle you're going from a class that doesn't stack well on raids to one that doesn't solo well and is the worst stacker in the business?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just get your shaman to level 65, find Q and Ferine.    With those 2 spells suddenly we DO stack fairly well.<br />
<br />
   One person can keep Q applied to the MA or RT at all times, and it eases the C-heal rotation rather greatly, or at least gives spare breathing room.<br />
<br />
  With Ferine Avatar, you are guaranteed casting a spell every minute and adding quite a nice chunk to the raid's DPS, assuming you have the rogue/ranger/monk there to put the ATK to proper use.<br />
<br />
<br />
   With either of these, you are filling a role that is a PAIN IN THE ARSE to fill while playing main slower, but helps the raid.   Between casting those spells you can eitehr backup the slower, play as only healer for the group, or toss out nukes, DoTs, buff refreshes or chat.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Of course, this still isn't AMAZING stackability, and requires you be 65 with 1 of 2 out of the 5 or so spells for the level :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you want a class that will always be needed on raids go for cleric or some kind of dps ideally rogue or monk. Can't have enough. <br />
Actually with PoP encounters and AA, a wizard or ranger is the better choice. Pure melee DPS is not always the best route anymore.<br />
Can never have too many clerics though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How can you say Enchanters have worse stackability? They not only can do the slowing and debuffing jobs that we can, but they have the best crowd control capablilities in the game and keep up haste rotations, on top of better damage output, possibly even excluding charm. That is far more useful than what we can do with &quot;patch heals&quot; and DoTs.<br />
<br />
And even if I built a great case, the material evidence speaks for itself. These guilds all have dozens of enchanters, just like I said. Yet they are always, always listed as high or very high on the demand list. Why would that happen is enchanters had the worst stackability in the game?<br />
<br />
I agree though, DPS classes are almost always accepted in guilds. I'm taking what you guys said into consideration, maybe Enchanter isn't for me. But I didn't create a cleric because they looked boring... but I can't think of anything more boring than slowing and then sitting on my ass until buffs fade.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I've thought about it, and I think I'm going to choose Mages. They can put out great damage in both grouping and raid situations, and can solo reasonably well. Plus everyone loves CotH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wrothgar is correct.

Well yes we can do this, we can do that. But the point is upper end guilds dont want us. You can espouse how good we are till the cows come home, but that still doesnt change the fact that upper end guilds dont want us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/boggle you're going from a class that doesn't stack well on raids to one that doesn't solo well and is the worst stacker in the business?<br />
<br />
What world do you live in? Enchanters are the BEST soloers in the game, one of the most wanted in a exp group. Marginal on a raid, but they put out more DPS than a shammy, and have more utility stacked. There is a reason guilds want 10+ enchanters but only 5 shammies. And its not cause enchanters suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They want us Flargy... or that is to say they really really want 2 of us and then we're just a burden. Ideally for a guild 1 shaman would be on and that is all. You only need one for buffs... only one for slowing. Any more are just making random probabilities on loots worse or soaking up DKP (or any other seniority/attendance loot system).<br />
<br />
Or maybe I'll make a Rogue... those look fun. Or a ranger.. they can put out great damage with bows... decisions decisions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well I have experienced the exact opposite - guilds are always on the lookout for a good Shaman and it's Enchanters that are on the low desired list. Enchanters do stack worse than Shaman - they can slow but typically that role will be filled by Shamans due to a slight advantage in percentage and greater durability. They can tash of course but that does not overlap with Shaman malo, that's two seperate things. In my experience Enchanters hate tashing because of the aggro it draws. As far as CC, dream on. Typically you will find that in a LOT of raid situations you will hit unmezzable mobs so the best crowd control ends up being multiple tanks. Yes Enchanters are needed for haste but if they are not CCing then they get to be buff hos for the most part and how much fun is that? If there is nothing to charm or it's not allowed, all they have for damage is their pitiful nukes and more pitiful DOTs. And you find this more more stackable than what a Shaman does? As a Shaman at a raid I buff, malo, slow, cripple, dot, heal and even nuke on occasion. Depending on the raid my roles can change. There is plenty to do even as the 4th or 5th Shaman. &quot;Patch heals&quot; can even save a raid on occasion. <br />
<br />
I think raids can lend themselves towards any class being boring because you specialize at raids and to reduce the chance of failure you cut down on things that can go wrong and simplify as much as possible. As far as Shamans being boring at a raid, if yer bored yer not trying. I never just slow and sit on my ass until buffs fade. <br />
<br />
However that being said, mage is a fine class. Great DPS, people still like mod rods, coth is required a lot. Just make sure you get pet hold so you don't hose a raid. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">okay I'm sold for the no enchanters thing but there really isn't any convincing me about the Shaman class. raids are composed of the following classes.<br />
<br />
DPS, warrior, cleric.<br />
<br />
Thats about it folks, especially with the slow immune and mitigating mobs around. So with that limitation, Raid -essential- (meaning not just ho'd out for their buffs and then &quot;allowed on&quot; for the ride) are...<br />
<br />
Rogue<br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Mage<br />
Wizard<br />
Monk<br />
and possibly Bstlords and Rangers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Shaman just dont stack.<br />
<br />
You only need one really, but you MUST HAVE at least one reliable shaman.  A second shaman is a backup, or for splitting the workload.  Three+ is someone being bored.<br />
<br />
We dont do single mobs anymore.  Most of our raids are moving raids, with multiple pullers and multiple mobs in camp at all times.  With PoP a lot of mobs are unmezzable, or its just not efficient to do mobs one at a time.  So we tank and slow.  This helps with shaman stacking, as we can break into teams, each supporting a different tank.  This gives each shaman a job to do... but I can still do those same raids as the only shaman.<br />
<br />
Shaman are wanted.. but once you have a few good shaman, its more efficient to focus on making them the best they can be than to deal with recruiting multiple mediocre shaman.  <br />
<br />
Enchanters, mages, beastlords, any niche class, is limited stackability.  Casters all want faster mana regen, melees all want haste, sometimes you can mez, or charm, but how many chanters does it take to do this? One? Two?  Mages... pets arent always welcome, and once all the focus stuff has been summoned, and everyone coth'd what do you need a medium grade nuker for?  Beastlords... a bunch of inferior buffs, a couple unique buffs, mediocre melee, and a nice pet.. but wait pets arent always welcome...  <br />
<br />
If you are concerned about being stackable, make a cleric, or make a pure melee class.  Know that if you do, you will be just one of the crowd... There is always a use for more melee and healers, but they are common as dirt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Penny:  I think you havne't been on enough high end raids.  One or two Enchanters are needed for KEI, haste and GRM; as many dr00ds as possible for Bot9 and CH rotation; Bards for every song they can twist (especially OOS and resist songs); Necro's for mana batteries, heavy DoT's and DMF; and Pally's for pink hearts etc...  Shammy's are there for buffing, resist debuffing, slowing, CRIPPLING(don 't forget this spell), healing and curing.<br />
<br />
Every class has a niche in the raid.  Fill a raid with DPS, clerics and a puller and you'll die every time.  The question is how many of each class is optimum during these raids.<br />
<br />
Flargly:  I'm not talking about a level 65 charming chanter.  Since Penny is talking about rerolling, I was talking about the soloing potential of a low to mid level chanter.  It's NOT good.  Chanter pet is great, but won't attack till his master gets hit.  Chanters have the lowest aggrigate HP's in the game.  The have no self-healing and damage mitigation is very expensive till the high game (rune reagants).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats the Problem. These high end guilds have people clawing and biting their way into positions in their ranks at any cost. They really dont have any shortage of any class unless they want to. So my chance, as a Shaman, of getting into one of these guilds relies on only one thing... that the shamans they have retire exactly when I apply, and that I look markably better and more skilled than the other hoards of shamans likely applying when the shaman comes out of &quot;useless as dirt&quot; on the class priority list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well if you are talking about raid essential, I guess only Clerics and Warriors fit that bill. However they are also the most one dimensional. <br />
<br />
As far as Shamans go, I was in that funk a while ago about stackability. One of the things that got me out of that funk however was increased healing powers. When you are utilizing your Clerics for CH chains, someone has to keep the group alive. Depending on the raid/AE it was doable but difficult at 60 with Torpor and chloroblast and inc heal. Now at 65 with quint and some healing AAs and Tnargs, it is a pleasure. I can even help out some poor saps in other groups with only a CH chain cleric to heal them. My goal every raid is to never let anyone die in my group. I am usually successful. I end up doing a lot more usually on raids then that but if that was the only task I had, I would be content knowing I helped us succeed by keeping my group alive. Plus I contribute some DPS at the same time plus ferine avatar is always nice. I guess I am just saying that you can get in that &quot;I am useless funk&quot; if you are the third or 4th Shaman but really, get some levels, some AA and you can make yourself an invaluable member of any raid force. Hell if I can get away with not buffing aside from an occaisional MGB Focus, I am happy. I have other more fun things to do.</div></div><hr />

Mostly... might want to add 1 more shaman to a raid just in case main shaman dies...  I was 3rd shaman on most of the raids I attended and my life was relegated to healing casters, curing dis or slows if necessary for the encounter, doing dmg where possible, adding single buffs when asked for etc... pretty meaningless.  I always felt like I was not needed and I was only 3rd shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I always felt like I was not needed and I was only 3rd shaman.<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear that.  If we do not have four shaman on a raid the two or three there are cutting corners resulting in people getting killed and a slower raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">/shrug or they are just bad shaman<br />
<br />
Its well established on this board, or at least from the opinions I have read over the years, that shaman simply dont stack on raids.  1 or 2 shamans that have thier poopoo together can easily handle an efficient raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">THe shaman numbers have changed in my guild, though over a big period of time.  It used to be just me for a LONG time, till we broke into Ntov and we started having 2-3 shamans, generaly 2.  having a second shaman was very nic and helpful.<br />
<br />
We progressed pretty far with 2-3 shamans, getting to about emp.  At the time we where killing emp and starting VT we had about 4-5 shamans on raids.  As of late its droped down from 1-3 shamans on the raid depending on the day etc.  Cleared VT the other week as only shaman.<br />
<br />
being the only shaman is exhausting and a workout.  when we had 5 shamans the under 65 ones where kinda bored and the rest of just overwrote eachothers slows ALOT.  I dont think any of us where excpetionaly bored.  i was kinda relaxed for a change and able to slack off.<br />
<br />
As of late when the shaman attedance has been slacking and i am the only shaman its not been fun.  We currently have 5 shamans on the roster, 2 MIA, 2 are almost full time but not quite.  I have been fulltime for over a year but having to take a break for RL reasons.  i say that we need more shamans cause with 3 able to show up but sometimes a none thats no good.<br />
<br />
When you are the 3-4th shaman if your not 65 your going to be bored, that simple you cant overwrite.  but once your 65 whats to stop you from doing stuff?  afraid your slow is gonna get overwritten? whatevers just cast it.<br />
<br />
I think rerolling a shaman just cause your going to have a hard time getting in a raiding guild is stupid.  If you have good play time, good skills, and good sense a guild will be stupid to turn you down, plain and simple.  low priorty means they are not activly seeking shamans, but doesnt mean they are not wanted, IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gillaina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My guild raided NToV last night.  It was a fun raid to some aspects.  Was a bit stressful for me though...I was the only shaman there to buff 8 groups.  Now, it really shouldn't have ended up being so many groups, but 90% of it was our guild, and for us, that is a great turn out.  I'll tell you this right now...1 shaman can't buff a raid like that.  I spent half the night oom and continously buffing.  I had to have the chanters slow for me.  I'm lucky I got to try out my new 65 dot once.   So no, more than 1 shaman is needed on a raid.  If anything, one to buff and the other to do battle. <br />
<br />
Our guild isn't very large, but we are starting to take on the bigger mobs ad such...and we do a great job by ourselves.  We have 2 active shaman..well, 1 active and 1 semi-active.  It's good to have 3 or 4 shaman because there are good chances that at least 2 are going to be online on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You only need 1-2 shamans on a raid pre tier 3+ in PoP.<br />
<br />
At any given time when you have to deal with a lot of adds at once, or a few hard hitters at once, (which happens a lot in upper tier PoP encounters) 4 or more is ideal. When you get 1 rounded with 6k+ hps, a 2 shaman raid start to feel the strain.<br />
<br />
Having more shamans than the bare minimum helps a lot, just as while most raids only need 1 enchanter, 1 bard, 1 rogue, 1 beastlord, and 4 clerics as the minimum, you still want to have more just in case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">One no. Two possibly. 3 probably, 4 yes. See the problem here?<br />
<br />
Yup the problem is there is not enough shaman on raids.<br />
<br />
There is also the AA progression problem of not enough shaman.  AA progression requires groups of six or less with a slower.  Shaman, preferred, and enchanters are the classes that determines how many exp groups there are.  If your guild has two shaman and two enchanters only 24 can get exp for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Just get your shaman to level 65, find Q and Ferine.    With those 2 spells suddenly we DO stack fairly well.<br />
<br />
   One person can keep Q applied to the MA or RT at all times, and it eases the C-heal rotation rather greatly, or at least gives spare breathing room.<br />
<br />
Provided some cleric doesn't get the notion to elixir the person thus nullifying your Q.  But yes, that helps out some.<br />
<br />
  With Ferine Avatar, you are guaranteed casting a spell every minute and adding quite a nice chunk to the raid's DPS, assuming you have the rogue/ranger/monk there to put the ATK to proper use.<br />
<br />
<br />
It also adds a lot of incentive for people to invite you to a group in the raid when they're forming.<br />
<br />
1 shaman can do just fine on a raid, I've done it more often than I care to, despite having 8 shaman on the roster, but 2 - 3 is the perfect number imo.  After that people get bored and eventually log off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Penny, you keep on mentioning the possibility of going with a warrior, there are some problems with that one if you want in a TOP end guild.<br />
<br />
  With most casters you can gather up the spells you need and work around the gear however you manage to and soon as you scribe all the spells, you are at your most useful.<br />
<br />
  With a warrior, exp groups don't really want you cause SK/Pally are far better at your job for everywhere people tend to EXP.    You have to settle for hunting in areas where your level alone gets you the groups, meaning normally lt blue pulls.   So you will level slower.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Your character as a warrior is COMPLETELY dependant on levels (already said, hard to get) and gear.    You have to have gear that is on par with the top warrior of the guild you are trying to get into if you want to get in very easily at all, and that means you need to have been raiding the content they are raiding or above already....  so sorta see the problem here with getting into a top level guild?<br />
<br />
<br />
    If you roll to a warrior, you will have to spend a TON of cash on gear, and then join a guild that will take you at the level you can buy up to, and progress with that guild up to the point where they are finally a &quot;top end&quot; guild.   or you can leech gear off them and guild hop, but you do that often and soon you find that you are moving DOWN the ladder of guild strength as your rep catches you.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Playing a shaman, you just work your arse off, figure out your class to the best you are capable of playing, and impress everyone you can with your &quot;mad skills&quot;  Then suddenly you are an asset that they cannot live without.   You make your own fun.<br />
<br />
  Playing a cleric, if you show up too late that is fine, they replaced you with one of the other 12 thousand in the ranks.<br />
<br />
   Druid?  port, buff, jump in heal rotation or nuke.<br />
<br />
  Rogue?   hit autoattack, make sure you stay behind the mob, and jam the BS button.<br />
<br />
   Monk?   hit auttoattack, make sure you don't get caught by enrage, and jam the kick button (if you feel like it)<br />
<br />
   Ranger?   get a nice bow and a ton of AA, jam the arrow key.<br />
<br />
   Wizzard?   Sit on your ass, and every now and then pop off a nuke if you aren't still AFK (who can tell when you aren't?).   Wait for end of raid to mass TL everyone out.<br />
<br />
    Beastlord, necro and bard?   sure, they can be NICE on a raid, but a VAST majority of raids happen without them, they have NO vital role, they just expand on the capablility of the group a little.<br />
<br />
   Mage?   summon junk, start to scribe your real spells, get a tell, rescribe the summons, summon junk PLEAD for people to tell you if they need more, decide you are done, start to scribe real spells, get a tell for summoned gear..... repeat till you finally REFUSE them the gear since they are too late, and then deal with a whiny no-nothing for the rest of the raid bugging you for hating him.    Send in your pet occasionally, and sit back trying to guess which wizzie isn't AFK.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Enchanters?    toss out clarity and haste, sit down and wait for someone to ask for a new haste.    Occasionally try to mezz a mob so that it beats on you when you find it isn't mezzable, or so that it beats on you when you are informed that &quot;we aren't mezzing, we will just offtank to kill faster&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
   In all reality, RAIDS ARE BORING!  Incredibly BORING!   No matter what class you are, you just do the same thing over and over and over.   Occasionally you witness new content, or perform a new kill, then the game is exciting again, but a week later you do the same thing and the excitement is probably gone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   The way to break out of boredom is to try the same things, with less people.    In that case, shaman will begin standing out as we stretch our mana beyond any other caster, prove to have incredible flexibility in our function, make 3 other classes a minor upgrade rather than essential presence, and overall outshine anyone less skilled than ourselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
   All in all, I restate what I always say, &quot;The fun in this game is where you make it.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shayne716</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I would say the optimal number of shaman for a full raid of 72 would be about 3-5 shaman.  The benifit of a shaman is our flexibility, where if we are short healers we can help cover there, debuffs/buffing of course, but we can also add decent dps for long luclin encounters or help the nukers burn PoP short enounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I would love to have a few more 60+ shaman in my guild, especially if they have malo!<br />
<br />
I am the highest level and most active shaman in my guild and I am usually the only shaman on a raid. Or if we do have another shaman they don't have malo or MGB ect.<br />
<br />
I would like to see three shamans on a raid and I am sure I could find work for more. <br />
<br />
I usually set up a tag team with the malo/slow. The lower level shaman with malo gets the job of landing malo and calling it out. Then the higher level shaman steps in and lands slow. If both shaman are same level and have malo the one with the better ac/hps is on the slow duty. If we get another shaman they are on cripple duty and/or malosinia duty. I will even have a shaman on disease debuff duty if they are looking for something to do. All shaman are always on backup slow duty. To make it more interesting switch the duties around at times, let the secondary shamans step up and get some slow duty time in. We can stack our dots.. so if we get some extra shamans in they can throw their dots into the mix and work as patch healers.<br />
<br />
Buff duty gets split between the shaman.. I handle the MGB Fo7 and primal, other handles Group sta/agi. Other shaman can handle buffing the latecomers or freshly rezzed. Multiple shaman with MGB on a raid is a big bonus for when you wipe.<br />
<br />
I agree that being a one of the &quot;extra&quot; shaman on a raid can get boring, but only if you or your guild let it get that way. Just because you are not the shaman up there slowing all the time doesnt mean there isn't a role for you to fill and have fun with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">My wizzy will ding level 49 tonight.  My shaman has not played for experience in a long time, his sole purpose is to show up to raids &amp; collect DKP that my wizzy will eventually cash in.  When I went to 3 raids in a row and never even cast a spell, I started leveling up a wizzy.<br />
<br />
This, btw, makes me sad.  Taladaen is far more fun to play in a group but he's just there to soak up DKP  on raids.  There's currently 6 shaman that all play in the same time period and are my level or higher.  I haven't tried to level up Tal because it's just not needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">First of all Caan I was not considering making a warrior... nor was I only considering melees in fact.<br />
<br />
I'll say this again. There are 3 classes that are essential for raids. Tanks, DPS, and Healers. A slower is great but is a job that can be done by one person. In high end raid situations the only truely useful Healers are Clerics, druids and shamans just dont have the ability to keep up parts in a CH wheel and good HoTs and quickheals. That sounds boring to me, the life of a cleric. So then Tanks and DPS are left... Tanks above trivial raids must basically always be warriors simply because of defensive disc as well as the innate HP bonus they receive. That does not interest me.<br />
<br />
So basically What I was looking to create was a DPS class. Of any sort. You never hear a guild saying &quot;Damn, if we could only have 6 shamans on our raid instead of three, we could kill fennin ro!&quot; because it doesn't work like that. The only limitations on killing mobs is if you can put out enough damage, and stay alive long enough to put out that damage.<br />
<br />
I wanted a character who could participate in one of those roles, because the shaman really, really doesn't and the big guilds realize this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">one advantage of the buff length reduction, if you want to call it that, is that you need a bunch of shaman for buffing again.<br />
Lets see, my typical work load is Fo7, Boar, Wrulan and Diaku, that's  3375 mana per group.  Fast Can4/5 gets you about 700 mana per minute, or one group every 5 min.  So, if you want to quick buff a full 72 peeps raid in 5 min you need 6 shm (who will be oom after that), or 4 mgb shm and hope you don't wipe.  Most of these shaman will alos be pretty busy during the raid casting FA, so I already regret getting that spell, it's a pain. <br />
So we are doing better now then a year ago, where 2 shaman was considered plenty, byt yes, a top guild will probably have a shaman target of about 8 max, depending on what their average raid attendance is.</div></div><hr />

I'll say this again. There are 3 classes that are essential for raids. Tanks, DPS, and Healers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uhm.. So you don't want to make a melee? Well then theres goes Tanks and pretty much all DPS. Only real DPS non melee is a wiz, maybe magician (but they dont bring much to raids, shaman brings more). So you've basically just chopped your choices down to a wiz and a cleric.<br />
<br />
There you go, problem solved.<br />
<br />
IMO your whining way way to much. Waaa my class sucks, waaa I want to play an uber class that everyone loves. Sorry buddy, but this game doesn't work like that. Ever class is interdependent on every other class in Everquest, thats the way it works. You've leveld your shaman high enough, just get him to 65. <br />
<br />
You moan and complain now about your shaman, and how 'useless' you think you are.. but in reality an excess of anything is just deadweight, besides maybe clerics. But if you have 15 clerics at a marginal encounter, some of those are bound to be dead weight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Everyone has their own opinion, but for the elemental planes and certain encounters like the RZ run, I'd love to have SIX shaman on at all times.  Sound sick?  Probably.  Bottom line, when all the mobs you pull quad for 1k damage each hit, they have to be slowed ASAP.  Unfortunately, most of the crap takes malos to land slows.  Assign 3 sets of 2 shaman--one does malos, the other slow.  We can have the mobs slowed FAST.  It's rare we get pulls of less than 4 or 5 mobs, and tanks can't always split them that fast--which means dead clerics or casters.  Sure, there is some overwriting, but I'd rather have that than slow down the raid with dead people.<br />
<br />
As for boss mobs, we can rotate jobs around.  Depending on the type of boss, we can DoT, nuke, or assist heal as needed.  Lately, I've been assigning 2 shaman to assist heals on the MT since our healing chain has been sucking a bit at times.  It has made a noticeable difference.  Have them casting it at all times and just ducking out if the MT is near full.  Or how about those mobs where the other melee are taking massive damage.  6 shaman can actually make a dent, helping free up clerics to keep the MT alive.  Heck, with a few AA and the elemental arms, most of my tnargs are hitting 1700-1800.<br />
<br />
Buffs?  Wipes happen.  4 MGB shaman can actually be useful when you're learning new scripts.  What about singles when you have 10 people down and you are on a timed script (plane of earth, anyone?)?<br />
<br />
You can do these encounters with 1 or 2 shaman, but it REALLY sucks.<br />
<br />
I think we have 7 shaman on our roster, and 4 of them are pretty high play time.  I LIKE having a lot of shaman on a raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">So much wrong with what you said...<br />
<br />
Uhm.. So you don't want to make a melee?<br />
<br />
There you go, problem solved.<br />
<br />
<br />
the key word in what I said was ONLY. &quot;Nor was I ONLY considering melees&quot;. Yes I am considering them. I'm also considering Mages and Wizards. Please pay attention to what I write before bashing me.<br />
<br />
<br />
You moan and complain now about your shaman, and how 'useless' you think you are.. but in reality an excess of anything is just deadweight, besides maybe clerics. But if you have 15 clerics at a marginal encounter, some of those are bound to be dead weight.<br />
<br />
okay that is so very wrong. You CAN have an excess of clerics, having more CH casters than necessary for the mob you can take down. But I cannot think of a single raid regardless of tier, zone, or guild executing the raid, that would EVER say under ANY circumstances that they had &quot;too much DPS&quot;. You cannot even deal too much damage on a raid. Never. The objective of raids are to do as much damage as quickly as possible to the target(s) before your healers run out of mana and your tanks fall.<br />
<br />
You might think I'm whining, if so then feel free to stop posting here. I dont need you to try to convince me that shamans are a great raiding class, I can do my own investigations, and see how desired they REALLY are. And I've already done those investigations and I already have the results.<br />
<br />
And for the rest of you, My guild has several shamans who attend our raids that are several levels higher than me. The only time I ever remember really having a blast on a raid was when I was the only shaman. I buffed everyone up, they said their thank yous, and I was in the break team because they needed me as primary slower. I was having a great time... <br />
<br />
Then after it was broke a shaman joined, higher level than me. I was out of work. I don't have avatar yet, but he had the AE slow, he had turgurs, he could do everything I had been doing only more efficiently. The job is doable by one person... which is all that bothers me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Did you read what Chutoi posted?  That is my experience in a higher end guild (near elemental).  My guild has 8 active shaman and I am far happier when 6 show up then when 2 show up.  <br />
<br />
In my recent experiences in VT, the pullers RARELY brought one mob to camp, it was typically 3 -5.  Most of the mobs require malo to land slow easily, it would be nearly impossible for one shaman to malo/slow 5 mobs effectively, not to mention being the only healer of your group and rebuffing some guy's agility.<br />
<br />
How about the Bertoxx event?  A fixed 2 hour event, if you don't get done in time, the big guy despawns.  The goal of the event is to kill 12 Kings (minibosses) who pop accompanied by 5 adds.  Get two kings and 10 adds in camp and you lose a shaman immediately...  Not to mention the one King who lifetaps for 5K and after the fight you have 15 melee dead and less than 20 minutes to go before Bertoxx...nothing like 3 MGB shaman to take care of rebuffs under a deadline.<br />
<br />
How about the Agnarr fight?  Each level when your raid zones in, there are portals which must be quickly maloed so wizards can land disentegration, there is a mini boss who must be maloed/slowed and various adds being offtanked who must be maloed/slowed.  There are three levels of this fight!!<br />
<br />
What about Terris Thule? 50% into the fight she dispells 12 buffs.  Nice to have 3 MGB shaman to get the instantly rebuff your raid. Lots to do on this fight, keep TT debuffed, help keep clerics/casters alive during the butterfly onslaught, help keep kiters healed/gargs slowed during that part of the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My experience is that the high end of the game has good rolls for everyone now.<br />
<br />
BST can slow in a pinch, do good damage between them and pet. Not to mention several nice buffs. Spiritual vigor is a nice combo of attack and hps. Spiritual dominion is a nice source of addition mana regen. <br />
<br />
Bards are great. AE mana song and AE resist song is always nice and that just the start. I'd easily be able to find something for a bard in every group to do that would contribute nicely. MT's group? I'd love to have 2 bards in that group. One playing dmg shield/attack songs the other playing ac/resist songs. Grouped with a bunch of melees? break out the attack songs and jack thier dps up. Grouped with a bunch of nukers? Break out the imp dmg focus song and jack up thier nukes. Throw in some additional mana regen with the 32 song and lifes good. Grouped with nothing but clerics? Pulse 32 mana song and ae mana song if need be for massive mana for the cleric chain. If you can't find something for the bard to be doing then you aren't looking.<br />
<br />
Necros can do fairly descent dps with pets/dots not to mention the group tap buffs for more attack, more regen, what ever you need. <br />
<br />
Paladin's (opps you forgot to mention them) are doing more dps than warrios often times with thier 2hders now a days and make great group healers especially in ae's.<br />
<br />
Mages? have you checked mages lately? They can nuke nearly as well as wizzy's have pets that will outdamage the lower end of the melee scale and can summon focus effect and other nice items to cover the effects people might be missing on your normal gear. Not to mention mod rods and coh where you can still use it.<br />
<br />
Shaman? yeah sure one shaman might be able to work thier ass off and get lucky but the first time you get 1 rounded by a mob even tho you have 6k hps after bouncing a slow and the yard trash is now unslowed in camp you sure as heck are wishing you had another couple shaman around. Even if you aren't handling debuffs quiesence and tnargs are a pretty effect heal combo in alot of situations and ferine avatar makes the melee's drool. Shaman stack now better than they ever have IMO. Avatar is finally a useful and usable ultimate melee buff, we have much better options for heals and even on slow mitigating mobs you still want the damm things slowed asap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still, play yer shammy, pal. Go solo. You can do things and stretch limits that make even chanter want to puke. Besides, if anyone envys us..it's everyone. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">You know, the value of multiple shaman really depend on your situation.  <br />
<br />
I have 26 members in my guild, our average raid size is 15-18.  4 of us are shaman, 2 of us are on almost all raids.<br />
<br />
I was the only shaman for well over a year, I never realized how valuable additional shaman are.  Raids did not happen because I was not there, if I died, we probably lost... that was a lot of pressure.  I am very glad to have Gwain and the other shamans in my guild now.<br />
<br />
Sure shaman can't nuke the best, heal the best, etc.  But for our guild they offer a ton of flexibility, which is really important at a small size.   In a guild that has only 2 clerics, our shamans do a lot of healing.  In a guild that only has 1 wizard and druid for magic dmg, our shamans do a lot of nuking.  We may not do it the best, but when we need healing we are there.  When we need nuking or magic dmg, we are there.  When we need CC and healing off tanks and rampage, we are there.  <br />
<br />
If you need to be the hero and the center of attention all the time, and can't enjoy working as part of a team ... and not being the BEST at something, all the time....well, probably the shaman class, in a raiding situation, isn't for you.  If you want to be able to contribute significantly in a number of different roles, and comfortable playing your part as a support person.. well then shaman is a good choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Yes it can be boring being 3rd shaman on a raid.<br />

However as has been pointed out a few times, there are zones and mobs where the More Shaman The Better!!.<br />
<br />
VT would be a wipe-fest without multiple shaman slowing big pulls, etc.<br />

No matter what class you play you'll probably get bored eventually. Thats why you make Alts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">1.  Shaman stack on raids.<br />
2.  Don't bother with other guilds websites.  Your only concern is your guilds needs.<br />
3.  We can heal.  Not as good as Clerics or Druids but we can heal.<br />
4.  Being the only shaman on a raid is a new defintion of the word aggravation.<br />
<br />
The guild I belong to has 7 active shaman.  Mutiple times I've been the only healer for my group.  Mutiple times I've been the only shaman on a raid of 40+ peeps for over 2 hours.  And that was before I got group sta.  I still don't have 7 or MGB.<br />
<br />
We stack on raids pure and simple.  Anyone says we don't isn't doing their full potential.  Don't need to heal?  Fine, dot.  In VT, for one of the named we had a SK be MT.  He kept aggro so well that I stacked 5 dots on it doing over 100 damage per tick for the ENTIRE fight of about 4 mins.  What that translates into dps I don't know nor do I care.  What I know is I contributed to my guilds success.<br />
<br />
In the end, play what you want.  Any posts by people saying were uselss or not needed are posts by ignorant individuals who have yet to take the shaman class to its full potential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I think everyone considering a new character has done this calculation in their head. And as you learn things about the high end game you can see weaknesses in your analysis. Which may even lead to disatisfaction with your class choice. My current best thought is this (and i'm not above tier-3 in PoP):<br />
<br />
Tanks: Vital up to moderate N. A huge amount of work to get to raid level.<br />
Cleric: Vital up to large N, with most non-uber guilds not reaching N.<br />
<br />
Melee DPS: Unlimited. Slightly reduced dominance in PoP.<br />
Ranged DPS: Unlimited. Increased importance in PoP. DoT &lt;&lt; DD.<br />
<br />
Utility: Vital up to small N, often only 1 and perhaps a spare. Utility spells, such as buffs, simply don't stack.<br />
<br />
Shaman's stack poorly on raids. Their primary ability doesn't stack and their secondary abilities (DPS, Healing) are average. If a shaman is strictly relying on their secondary abilities it would probably be better if they where playing another class. Same is probably true for chanters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">There are always ways to increase the effectiveness of your &quot;secondary&quot; abilities.<br />
<br />
Healing:<br />
Try to get hold of an Improved Healing IV item AND start putting AA points into Healing Adept/Advanced Healing Adept/Healing Gift/etc/etc.<br />
After enough AA and an IH 4 item Tnargs suddenly becomes a VERY handy, quite effective fast heal.<br />
Get Radiant cure so you can cure peeps when everyone gets hit by an AE DoT or Curse etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
DPS:<br />
Get nuke focus items (to enchance DD's) and get Spell Casting Fury and then Fury of Magic.<br />
Do your best to get your 925 DD ice nuke and 2k AE rain.<br />
Maybe get Spiritcall for a laugh.<br />
<br />
Don't forget other useful stuff like SCM to cut down mana costs of these spells. Or SCRM to make Quiesance or Torpor last longer.<br />
Also get Quickbuff (to fire off Torpor/Quiesance faster) and a Spell haste item if possible (to speed up spot heals and everything else).<br />
<br />
Yeah I am talking about a BUTTLOAD of AA's but so what? :)<br />
<br />
Note all those AA's wont have you doing Wizard or Mage DPS but thats ok.</div></div><hr />

Shammy's are there for buffing, resist debuffing, slowing, CRIPPLING(don 't forget this spell), healing and curing.<br />
<br />
Every class has a niche in the raid.  Fill a raid with DPS, clerics and a puller and you'll die every time.  The question is how many of each class is optimum during these raids.<br />
<br />
Flargly:  I'm not talking about a level 65 charming chanter.  Since Penny is talking about rerolling, I was talking about the soloing potential of a low to mid level chanter.  It's NOT good.  Chanter pet is great, but won't attack till his master gets hit.  Chanters have the lowest aggrigate HP's in the game.  The have no self-healing and damage mitigation is very expensive till the high game (rune reagants).<br />
 Enchanters have cripple too, Final Justice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">If you want to be loved by high-end guilds, play a wizard or a cleric. No guild in their right minds will ever turn down a good wizard or cleric. If you don't want to play a shaman anymore, then don't. Nobody deluded you into thinking shamans were godly in all aspects of the game, and I'm sure more than a few threads came up here during the time you were leveling about how poorly shamans stack on raids, but how absolutely essential they are to raid success. Why are you acting so surprised now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Shaman numbers on raids have always been a tricky thing, but asside from certain encounters, 1 shaman is often all you need as long as that shaman is prepared to be busy and is capable of staying alive in somewhat hairy situations, I was the only shaman on our very first Aten cycle kill and I coped just fine, tbh I enjoyed the workload too =)<br />
<br />
Generally 2 or 3 shaman present is best for the raid to ensure that buffs are always quick and theres some level of redundancy on debuffs, anymore and the extras basically get reduced to gimped druids for the day, its plain fact.  And yes I've always ensured that when we do have multiple shaman, I spread the workload as much as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Last night we had all 6 60+ shaman active in the guild and 2 more 60+ shaman who were pledging to get in on a raid.  Let me tell you how much fun it was, I was able to chain cast Burst of Flame and never be OOM.  I also found out that Fleeting Fury stacks with everything, even primal weapons, UBER!<br />
<br />
At the end of the raid, I was allowed to heal the people that just got rezzed so I could feel like I did something.  Ha!  Take that!   Lots of shaman at raids R0x0rs!  Got my DKP, got another couple blues exp on my wizzy at the same time (quadding birds in TD) and found a stacking sploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Gunna toss my two cents in here as well, although most have already covered it. Unei especially nailed it right on...<br />
<br />
I used to be of the mindset that 1-2 shaman on a raid is fine. In most cases that is true....I *can* do it all, technically. <br />
<br />
But to be a well oiled machine, you typically need 4 shaman, average for highend luclin and beyond mobs (pop wise we are just breaking into HoH/PoT).<br />
<br />
MGB - pretty simple. Doing new stuff you are going to die, need 2 MGB's up at all times to do boar/focus. Or certain encounters where buffs are dispelled in mass, or even a backup MGB haste can be helpful sometimes. <br />
<br />
Debuffs - we all know how unkind the RNG can be sometimes. 2 shaman ready to malo/sina as the pull is inc and 2-3 more all casting turgurs GREATLY increases the chances of your MT making it though that initial unslowed onslaught. There are also mobs in luclin that rampage like a mofo and really require cripple to keep em from chewing the RT up....and also tend to dispell themselves. Having many shaman around to cripple and spread that agro is essential. <br />
<br />
Not sure about how ya'll pull in PoP or luclin, but i'll be damned if I can remember the last time we pulled just one mob at a time, or hell just 3 at a time. We dont mez sh1t either, ever. Its all TM these days. 3-4-5 shaman split up into TM groups, and then assisting each other when they get a resist is mega helpful as well. <br />
<br />
Alot of responsibility is on the &quot;main&quot; shaman of the crew as well. I know that seems lame, but generally inorder for things to be coordinated correctly and quickly someone has to lay out the shaman battleplan. I guess thats me in the case of my guild. I always try and do my best to mix responsibilities up and change things around whenever I can.<br />
<br />
And dang, sometimes its nice to be that 5th string shaman when you raid for a living.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">We generally run 3-4 shaman per raid.  We have 3 level 65 shaman with MGB. One does Fo7 (2 have it), one does Talisman of the Boar (2 have it) one does Talisman of Diaku (3 have it).  If we have more (on big raids we have 5-6 shaman) the others then fill in with AGL, Talisman of Tribunal etc.  Most of the time one shaman keeps Focus of Soul while another keeps Boar up for spot buff on deaths, decreasing downtime for rebuff.<br />
<br />
For encounters we have 1 shaman is casting malos and malosinia (backing up slows), 1 on Disease debuff (ID or MD) and Disease slow (backing up malo cripple etc) 1 on Turgurs (backing up malo, cripple) 1 on cripple (backing up Turgurs and malo/sina).  In general we can debuff a mob fully in  rapid succession preventing MT deaths, especially on Flurry type mobs.  Once your main spell is in you go to a back up if its not in.  Once all debuffs in we all switch to Dots (epic, plus regular dots) and nukes with spot heals if needed. <br />
<br />
Lately our team of shaman have been really working well as a group.  So to say shamans dont stack means your shaman arnt working well together.  We have 4-6 active raiding shaman and make it work smoothly using our own raid channel for coordination and annoucing debuffs in /Raidsay<br />
<br />
We run 60-72 people on normal raids and welcome everyone of our shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Fynris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">IF I may also add my thoughts to this... /waves to Litchebane.<br />
<br />
Penny began this thread with a dissatisfaction for our classes ability to stack in a raid environment. Penny's research revealed to him/her that many guilds weren't interested in haveing a great deal of Shamans in their ranks as opposed to classes like Cleric, Warrior, etc.<br />
<br />
Many have posted their thoughts, for and against the Shaman class. Here is my viewpoint.<br />
<br />
There are so many factors to consider... What is the target? Are there enough healers? Are there enough Shaman online at that time? Is the mob slowable? etc, etc, ad nauseum. In fact, there are so many factors that it can boggle ones mind sometimes. There are too many factors to say definatively that the Shaman class doesn't stack well. It's very easy to point out any one, two or three instances where having too many Shaman is counter-productive. It's just as easy to point out the one, two or three instances where a raid can't have enough Shaman. I'll even go out on a limb and say that, for ANY support class, it's easy to point out instances for and against having too many.<br />
<br />
The biggest factors for me are this... Am I having fun in my game? Am I having fun with my friends? Do I still have obtainable goals for my Shaman (i.e.: gear, tradeskills, zone experience, etc)?<br />
<br />
As long as I'm having fun with my friends and I can still see an obtainable goal for my Shaman... then I **DECIDE** that I'm going to have a great time, no matter where I am on the Shaman totem pole.<br />
<br />
Please allow me to present an example... I'm an applicant with a high end guild on Veeshan (Cestus Dei)... They allowed me to piggyback into the Plane of Earth with them the last two nights (probably tonight as well). Each night, I've been the 4th or 5th Shaman there on the raid. Now, I know these other Shaman and they know me, so we have that repore (sp?) with each other. When I arrive, I make a mental decision that I'm not going to just sit by idly... I offer buff in /rs or /channel... I get into a friendly competition with my Shaman buddies to see who can land Malos or Turgurs first on incoming mobs. The fighting is fast and furious in PoEarth, one has to pay attention to all calls or else you can find yourself left alone and in a world of hurt. Often times mobs drop too fast for Turgurs to really be effective from more than one Shaman, on pulls like that I switch to Cripple, Ferine on a Rogue (or other high DPS toon), heal a group member, back up heal the MT, look for adds to slow, rebuff the dead. I look for anything that I can do to make myself useful and productive. I have so many options on things I can do it's amazing to me how anyone can say their bored. To me, it's a mental choice... the person makes the decision themselves to be active or not.<br />
<br />
IMHO, Caanus Grey said it best, &quot;The fun in this game is where you make it.&quot;... this one statement is the heart and soul of the issue, the very foundation from which we all determine our desire to continue playing this class. If I CHOOSE to be active, productive, involved, in any or all aspect of a raid... there is no better class than the Shaman... nope... let me change that... If I CHOOSE to be active, productive and involved in any or all aspects of a raid... there is no better class than the one I'm playing at the time.<br />
<br />
You see, what Caanus said isn't Shaman exclusive... it's EQ exclusive. It doesn't matter the class... what matters is the decision that the person behind the character has made on their level of involvement.<br />
<br />
If you CHOOSE to be active and involved... then it doesn't matter if you're the 1st Shaman or the 100th... you can still enjoy your game.<br />
<br />
I hope I've added some food for thought... there have been many opinions out there and mine is just one more to add to the pot...<br />

Um yah...maybe you have been dozing off in class while others were getting things that helps them survive a bounced slow.<br />
<br />
Chanters have Runes that allow them to channel through something a helluva lot easier then us getting beat on. They have a much greater chance at getting a 2nd slow off then a shaman that is getting beat on. We have what? superior AC? give me a break......<br />
<br />
Hell for that matter, let's throw beastlords Stonestance into the equation for good measure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Have you ever even played, or seen an enchanter, trying to survive bounced slows consistantly even with full ~2250 worth or runes? (most don't bother spending the peridot, and only cast bedlam reluctantly)<br />
<br />
Having a 2k rune doesn't really help when stuff are doing 1000-3000 melee dps and you are getting hit every single swing. As a shaman, you suvive by getting missed, or mitigate with much higher AC. As an enchanter, you don't get missed very often, and you don't mitigate very much.<br />
<br />
There comes a point where both classes go splat in about the same time. Shaman survivability is much higher until that point is reached.<br />
<br />
I hope you realize that stonestance and runes are completely different things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Just to add fuel to the flame about enchanters hehe, I played enchanter in a guild that raided every night it seemed.  It was boring as hell, and I died at least 3 times a night doing nothing but trying to mez.  Slow?  You must be kidding, enchanter's hate to slow and they hate to cast rune cause of the expense.  The only time I enjoyed casting Rune was on those fights where it made a difference .. casting it on the MT.  Oh and do you think enchanter's get reimbursed for thier expense just to cast rune on themselves on a raid?  Hell I was lucky to get any loot at all, don't even get me started on reimbursement.

Just one thing to Mcroc however... I agree the important thing is to have fun. But at this point in my EQ experience I get the most fun out of going on intense or particularly pioneering and fun raids... as well as participating in them. Believe me if raids didn't interest me, I would have never brought this topic up. We're one of the most saught after Exp group classes (up there with clerics and possibly above enchanters) so really this was just about the amount of fun I want to have feeling like I&quot;m playing a real role in raids. Which I'm now feeling better about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can one shaman avatar a dozen or more melee, MT list, all rogues, all rangers?<br />
- No, they are gonna use their primals or suck it up and live without Avatar for a few hours. Plus no melee should expect Avatar before an important boss fight. No melee needs Avatar for yardtrash, period.<br />
<br />
Can one shaman MGB four or five wipeouts learning an enounter one night?<br />
- No but a shaman bot sure can! <br />
<br />
Can one shaman slow pulls of a dozen or two dozen creatures?<br />
- No but that's why you have Beastlords and/or Enchanters. Been there done it, I was often as only shaman on countless raids. No problem. Other classes can chip in. My guild did Emperor with a bot shaman. We did NTOV back in day with one shaman, quite a few raids with one single botted shaman, we did a few PoAir raids with one shaman. It can be done.<br />
<br />
Can one shaman help heal four tanked mezz 1500+ hitting critters?<br />
- You have clerics/druids heal tanks AND shamans on initial pull, when tanks get their targets and mobs are slowed the shaman(s) click on the &quot;Yes&quot; button on the rez box, loot and make some mana. During this time ONE SINGLE cleric can heal a tank tanking a slowed 1500+ hitting yardtrash.<br />
<br />
Can one shaman malos, sinia, slow in five seconds?<br />
- Thats why when we are low on shamans on a raid, we always have mages Malosini[a] and Beastlords assist slowing. Not like there is a HUGE difference in mitigated slow anyways. Again your point was? <br />
<br />
Can one shaman slow pulls and buff newly rezzed at the same time?<br />
- Yes. Been there done that. Plus there is always a Trusty Shaman Bot (c)(tm) sitting around somewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamans stack poorly on raids. It's better than before but still needs work. <br />
(1) Our DoTs have insane aggro, death sentence for shamans.<br />
(2) Our healing is subpar to even paladins. When a yardtrash triples for 1k+ that 1300 heal or the 2k ghetto CH is pathetic. Not to mention mobs tend to have 2k+ AEs in many places or some insane 500/tick DoT AE.<br />
(3) Our buffs are a non issue, thanks to MGB and a_shaman_bot03.<br />
(4) Our nukes, while they have improved, still low DPS.<br />
(5) Slow mitigation, Mala/Malosini[a] for mages doesn't help either, not to mention Beastlord slow, Paragon and their tanking ability.<br />
<br />
There are a few raids where many shamans are almost essential. RZ encounters, some EarthA rings, spider isle in Air, maybe Mithaniel Marr run but in most cases having many shamans is a loss of efficiency. Get 2-3 competent shamans on a raid, and it will fly. Replace the others with wizards and/or rangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">- No, they are gonna use their primals or suck it up and live without Avatar for a few hours.

But, the more shaman you had FA'ing folks, the more dps you have, the quicker things die, the quicker we can all go home. Not a requirement, but then again the only REQUIREMENT in eq raiding is 12389 warriors and 234890 clerics. <br />
<br />
<br />
- No but a shaman bot sure can! <br />
So you have an army of shaman bots? Well hell you can also have an army of enchanter bots, or any buff bot. Hell my guild bots a bard around for manasong on raids. Again, nothing new here.<br />
<br />
<br />

Sure, anything *CAN* be done with a ghetto crew as long as you have enough clerics and warriors. Period!<br />
<br />
 You have clerics/druids heal tanks AND shamans on initial pull, when tanks get their targets and mobs are slowed the shaman(s) click on the &quot;Yes&quot; button on the rez box, loot and make some mana. During this time ONE SINGLE cleric can heal a tank tanking a slowed 1500+ hitting yardtrash.<br />
Grats! See, you have shaman stacking well here with heals, while the other slows. /shrug. I must have missed your point here.<br />
<br />
- Thats why when we are low on shamans on a raid, we always have mages Malosini[a] and Beastlords assist slowing. Not like there is a HUGE difference in mitigated slow anyways. Again your point was? <br />
You're point was? Its awesome magi can fill in when we are not around. But if you have shaman around you wont have magi doing the malosina cause they need to spend time doing what they do best on raids, DPS. And having BL's slow? Well, I guess it can be done, but its obviously not as good. Sure, the BL can slow the mob initially, but when its time to put the lockdown on its DPS, you call in the shaman. If not, just add clerics as needed!<br />
<br />
<br />
 Yes. Been there done that. Plus there is always a Trusty Shaman Bot (c)(tm) sitting around somewhere.<br />
Again, sure it can be done, but does it take long and use up more folks time when people are being botted or there is only one of them? Again, the more shaman you have the quicker this goes and the easier life is on the guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having an army of shaman is never going to win the raid. Having 5 or 6 around is plenty. Any more than that and they are just assist healers/gimpo nukers. <br />
<br />
<br />
So I guess for the most part I agree with you zorlac lol! Just playing DA and trying to poke holes in your ramblings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">- No, they are gonna use their primals or suck it up and live without Avatar for a few hours.<br />

You are assuming all of today's melee have primals.  Lots of guilds stopped doing ST long ago.  Assuming all melee have primals in today's game it not true in my experiences.  You do the math, avatar on seven rangers with true shoot on a 10 minute fight.  Group a bard with five rangers works well also.  Numerous PoP fights also have AoE that are unkind to melee.  Melee, archers have risky cases of getting a primal to proc.<br />
<br />
- No but a shaman bot sure can! <br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you have bot shaman on your raid.  We have two or three bot clerics and that is it for bots.  Players running one character do much better when it comes to reaction times and focus.<br />
<br />
<br />
- I was often as only shaman on countless raids. It can be done.<br />
<br />
I would not have fun being the only shaman on any raid especially PoP ones.  I doubt most would, but fun is opinion based so I glad to hear you have fun being the only shaman on a raid.  Personally I think a guild that is happy with only one shaman on a roster is not going to get far.<br />
<br />
<br />
- During this time ONE SINGLE cleric can heal a tank tanking a slowed 1500+ hitting yardtrash.<br />
<br />
Great in theory but not in practice.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Thats why when we are low on shamans on a raid, we always have mages Malosini[a] and Beastlords assist slowing.  Again your point was?<br />
<br />
If there four shaman on a raid they will be doing malo, sinia, and slow.  Mages and beastloads will not be displacing them from this role.  Mages and beastlords will be filling in if there are not shaman.</div></div><hr />
