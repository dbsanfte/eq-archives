<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I had to guess, it would be your &quot;AC Gear&quot; profile. You seem to be focused on stats, but your AC is lacking greatly. Even if you're short on cash, there are many options for upgrade availiable to you... either purchased, soloed, or acquired in a group.<br />
<br />
Suggestions:<br />
<br />
Earrings: Go BS... get AC/HP/MANA here.<br />
<br />
Neck: Ivory Imbued Collar or Black Ally Medallion are two viable options.<br />
<br />
Mask: Bone Mask of the Jarsath, Crystal Spider Eyes.<br />
<br />
Helm: Totemic or Jaundiced Bone for a major AC upgrade.<br />
<br />
Rings: Do the spider quest in Skyshrine, if you have the faction, to get a pair of AC4, +DEX/INT/WIS rings. Else, you can probably get some AC6, +65 HP rings quite cheap too.<br />
<br />
Wrists: Totemic might be good for an AC upgrade.<br />
<br />
Arms: Jaundiced Bone. 15 Raw AC points is worth losing 3 WIS for.<br />
<br />
Gauntlets: Again, Jaundiced Bone. Huge AC upgrade for minimal stat loss.<br />
<br />
Shoulders: A Cheaper WW dragon mantle, Obulus Death Shroud, maybe an Elder Wolf Hide are viable upgrades.<br />
<br />
Chest: Totemic, Iksar Regeneration BP, or perhaps a Froglok Scale Chestplate are viable.<br />
<br />
Back: Dragon Cloak from WW is good. Save up a few KPP, you could get an AC20, +25 HP cloak... Ancient Seahorse.<br />
<br />
Belt: Smiter's Girdle, Chitenous Belt, Flayed Turmoilskin.<br />
<br />
Leggings: Jarsath Scale, WW Dragon Legs, maybe even Totemic.<br />
<br />
Boots: Good for WIS. Perhaps carry around JB if you need more AC. Tribal War Boots are good too.<br />
<br />
Weapons: Lose the 2HB, and get a 1H'er / Shield. Much better overall, since you probably don't melee much. For your primary, get a spear... Etched Icewurm Fang, Jade Prod, Howler... anything with WIS, maybe even AC.<br />
<br />
For a shield, you can probably use that SBS. Else, get a CCS, even a CGS is good.<br />
<br />
Range: Medicine Totem.</div></div><hr />
