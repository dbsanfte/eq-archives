<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kincaidia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I've only been a shaman for a few months, so while I've read these forums frequently, I've never posted until now<br />
<br />
I play with my old college roommate, and we each bot 2 or 3 toons, level 65 cle/sha, level 63war/rog/monk, with me usually doing the sha/cle.<br />
<br />
We've recently been taking BoT named alot, just to spice up the grind a bit. We wiped once the first time taking a wing boss (Gaukr to be specific), but after that we waxed him 4 or 5 times in a row, even taking an add or two during the fights in stride. I usually did malos + turgurs a couple times and it would land - if it didn't, I'd disease debuff and Grummus him. Worked every time.<br />
<br />
Enter the patch.<br />
<br />
Pull. Malos. Turgurs. Turgurs. Turgurs. Turgurs. Disease debuff. Grummus. Grummus. Grummus. Grummus. Grummus.<br />
<br />
And not one landed.<br />
<br />
We wiped and tried again. Same thing. Not one landed - probably about 11-12 casts of each between the 3 tries.<br />
<br />
As I don't have alot of expierence being a shaman, I might be just jumping the gun. Is this kind of thing normal?<br />

<br />
Wow, what a helpful comment! Lol. <br />
<br />
<br />
Resists go from being 1 or 2 casts to slow, to having to cast 12 times and STILL not landing slow, and your only comment is &quot;BoT named routinely resist spells&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've run into this recently as well... our warrior has about 8k hps buffed, and she would get triple proc'd on as well..... his 1500 DD proc is going off like mad... swing, proc, swing, proc, swing proc.... 6k damage quick unslowed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sometimes  you will run into a randomly rolled named with higher stats/resists then expected.<br />
<br />
Possibly he's been allowed to buff up also.<br />
<br />
If he gives trouble, it's usualy one or ther other, once he's killed and the next one spawns, should be easier.<br />
<br />
Bot sucks. I've gone fromdoingMPG all day long, with some riftseekers for spice, with less then 5 resists(including named) then I went to Bot to PL a friend, and every single thing was chain resisted requiring me to cast debufffs and stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought it was just the RNG, and it probably still is.  I has having trouble in BoT last night too, just at the four way at front earth.  I just got 65 recently and figure I need to do my time in BoT getting some AA's before I move on... don't want a bad reputation.  : P<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's been mind numbingly boring... I can't get slow to land reliably without malos'ing first... so it's always been Malos lands on first cast, and slow lands on first cast.  /yawn and repeat for 4+ hours.<br />
<br />
Last night I was landing malos and having slow bounch 2-3x times in a row.  Then the next pull the SK brings two and I land both slows on the first try (which is good being the only healer in the group, heh, stupid SK didn't feign off the add, dern ogres)<br />
<br />
So, it's probably just post patch jitters, bad luck at the RNG, and/or fighting a NPC that got hit with some resist buffs that they normally don't have.<br />
<br />
Made me pay attention though, I liked it.  I just hope it is temporary or just my imagination... I'd had to have to worry about it all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dxkj21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hrm... I would buy the &quot;its a harder version of the mob&quot; but the problem is I fought one before the Second patch that night, and he was resisting everything, and then I fought him again AFTER the patch and he respawned and he was identical in resisting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Going out of mana trying to slow is no good... I guess I will grab an enchanter or bard and try again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From my experience, it's down to luck. Sometimes I can't land slow at all others it lands first time. Think it's down to the same kind of luck that causes no skill ups in forty combines followed by 3-4 in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was in BoT last night for four hours and only a few gave me problems with resisting.  I will say that sometimes there are mobs that I just cannot slow no matter the case.  Then the next mob...same thing...is done in one shot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Funny you should mention this cause last night I had an unusual experience.  Logged on around 7:00 pm PST.  Got into my static group and headed to MPG. <br />
<br />
Took the taskfiend camp (trying to pull taskfiend and the named for the anguish signet) which is a usual camp for us.  With the exception that all mobs had a fun ole time resisting my balance.  <br />
<br />
It really got ridiculous.  I had slows resisted after malos, I had a hard time landing a dot.  One trash dragorn mob came into camp, I hit malos, then chained balance and never got it to land.<br />
<br />
It wasn't a big enough deal for us to get into trouble (taskfiend is a relatively safe camp after all), but I will admit it gave me pause as to what else had inadvertantly happened in the patch that was going to affect my playstyle.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I would like to mention a couple of other things that were glaringly obvious after last night's patch.<br />
<br />
RC6 - I use it to remove Chaotica.  Last night I used it twice and it was not hitting my whole group.  The first time I thought someone was oor, the second time I made everyone gather round.  No go.  So I loaded RGC and single hit everyone.  <br />
<br />
Extended durations - last night my FA went from it's extension of like 8 something minutes to 6 minutes only.  You know how you get a &quot;feel&quot; for when to cast a rebuff, especially a round of FA on 2 rangers, tank and pet - using the pet as your first cast?  The first couple of blinks on my pet, I thought &quot;hmmm, that was quick&quot;.  The second time, I went into &quot;what the hail mode&quot;.  While the timer showed correctly on the buff, I just knew it was dropping faster.  So I did a watch ... and sure as heck, it dropped after 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, these may be flukes, they may be something that have been reported.  I opted not to, becuase I just know there will be 3 more patches today, and possibly a couple tomorrow and they will all work out.<br />
<br />
But here is my head's up on the things I noticed in a group that lasted 3 hours in MPG.<br />
<br />
p.s.  sort of merging all my frustrations into one thread here.  Forgive me.  What the hail has happened to rune drops?  Rundown of my week - 4 hour benches camp in RCoD - no runes, 3 hour bowlord camp in RCoD - no runes, 3 hours in Taskfiend - no runes.  Murkglider Expedition - 4 hours - no runes.  North Wall in WoS - 3 hours  no runes.  This has been since last Saturday.  5 nights - 5 no show on runes - in camps that usually net us at least 1 - 2 runes.  And to make matters worse, the names are dropping the same crap over and over and over again.  <br />
<br />
Please don't tell me about the nerf bat.  Been around long enough to know about it.  Just give me an idea of when the &quot;runes will drop 1 in 1000 kills&quot; bat came into existence?  I find this beyond diminishing returns.  Sort of gone into the realm of sadistic.<br />
<br />
That's all folks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I havn't raided BoT in forever, but even before the patch certain mobs just seem to resist *sometimes* more than normal.  Like the named in PoTime Fire trial, sometimes I can't get his arse slowed the WHOLE fight that is WITH malos/inia (if sinia lands) and tash and using Nihil (tried disease on those times....HA, not even worth trying either).  Sometimes is a simple as Malos then nihil (then try to land turgur's for the duration of it).<br />
<br />
Last night in Earth B the minis, first 1 couldn't land disease slow for NOTHING, second died to a cpl resists on it, and 3rd landed 2nd try. <br />
<br />
These guys are spawned and dont have time to stand around and buff up, and yet sometimes I can land slow the first time, sometimes it never happens.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what to think aside from that sometimes mobs just spawn with a higher resist rate for some reason (don't think it would be higher lvl so much though because they seem to be the same lvl everytime i fight them).  Take comfort that its not just you though, and not just the BoT boss it seems, nor is it from the patch (at least not in my experience)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I will also note that my group buffs werent landing on the whole group half the time I was casting them (and yes...everyone was standing next to me)  I also couldnt buff other groups with my primal hammer like I could before...maybe it was a bug.  <br />
<br />
It was frustrating because casting group buffs 2-3 times and having to ask people if they landed is irritating and wastes alot of time.  I would get the message that so-and-so grunted and they would tell me that they needed stamina right afterwards...and this was when I was helping to buff a raid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Having spent way too many hours in BoT along the way ...<br />
<br />
... here's how I think it works.<br />
<br />
When a given mob is spawned, a number of variables are assigned.  Some mobs are always the same level; others have a range, and so a level will be assigned to that particular mob.  It will have a specific number of hitpoints assigned, based on the range for its level.  It will have STR and DEX values assigned, within the range defined for this mob.  And it will have resist values assigned as well, within the range defined for this mob.  <br />
<br />
Which is a long way of saying:  all mobs are not created equal.  <br />
<br />
By random chance, then, you can end up with a mob that has very high resists in some or all areas.  Which can make it very hard to slow that particular mob.<br />
<br />
After you kill it, the next one that comes along will again be randomly generated, with a new set of stats.  So it could be just as tough; or it could be considerably easier.<br />
<br />
I've had strings where slow would always land on BoT names in the first or second cast.  And other instances -- including with your buddy Gaukr there -- where I alternately cast both slows for the entire fight, and never landed it.  <br />
<br />
In the end, we concluded that to take on a named reliably, we needed to have sufficient healing available to beat it when it was unslowed.  If we got it slowed, great; but it was unrealistic to count on it.  So we had to plan on having enough healing there to keep the tank alive with the mob hitting at full speed.</div></div><hr />

I've felt this way too at times. I've had times in PoFire where one soldier just constantly would break root after root after root, resist slow after slow, etc.  Yet none of the others would do that.   Happens for tons of mobs, you just get that one bastard that will resist everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I was boxing a cleric too, so I was able to watch health. This was while defensive was still up, and we didn't wipe until the end. The problem is we keep getting tripple procs of the 1500hp DD. And of course I started healing once it got bad. I was alternating shaman 2k heal with cleric CH straight, and it was working perfectly, then in 2 rounds of attacks we had 3 procs (4500) and 6 almost max hits (around 800 a piece, so 4800). The warrior went from full health to dead (she had 8k hps) in 2 rounds. <br />
<br />
Not much you can do about that. And I am a decent shaman :) I think... First time in WoS (with crappy gear and 40AA on both) I was cleric/shaman in a group and no one died or complained ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Spent a lot of time raiding/grouping last few days and I have not noticed anything unusual regarding resists in any zone.  I usually pull for our raid when I want us to move faster, and I pulled most of MPG moving from trial to trial and had no problems with any dramatic resists on slows (well, not for more than a mob or so).  Usually when I pull at least two mobs come, and I pull with nihil and almost 70% of the time get TA to stick turgors on the second mob before he even gets to camp first cast.  It's just random<br />
<br />
Btw.. that casting bug has happened a lot of times before to people.  Most of the time that I've seen/heard it happened, it was because the said person was on a horse or something like that.  I would suggest that you camp out and back in if you notice it happening again.  That should fix it, or has always for the people that I've seen it happen to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The resists are random.  A mob simply isn't more resistant that another, the roll made to determine if the spell lands is the random factor.  <br />
<br />
The random number generator is prone to streaky behaviour have been told.  What you are seeing when a mob resists 5-10 times is a random result.  <br />
<br />
if you have a 1 in 3 chance of success, trying 3 times does not guarentee you a success.  The chance of a 1 in 3 success on your tenth attempt is still 1 in 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I haven't played in months, so no idea on patch changes.  However, I had/have thought for a long time that level ranged mobs had the following attributes.  A higher level mob will hit harder, have more hp and LESS resists (the mob has lower mr/fr etc).  To make up for less melee damage (say for example the standard two hp / max hit per level in old world in say SF) and hp, the lower level mobs spawned with higher resist rates.  Not sure if this is something I noticed a long time ago or read, but for some reason thought it was the commonly accepted belief, /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It is not even necessarily streaky behavior of the RNG. How many MOBs do you kill per hour? How many people play EQ and post here? What are the odds of at least one of them having bad luck a couple of times right after a patch?<br />
<br />
Probably about 99.99999999%.<br />
<br />
This then gets attributed to all kinds of reasons, quite often ninja changes in the patch. The same string of resists somwhere in a 5 hour experience grind of brushed off as the bad luck it is. Humans are like that and it takes a conscious effort to not think like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Something at work tonight reminded me of this thread and how a fluke of random can seem like a change to things.  Like &quot;X mob resisted 10 slows in a row after patch, ninja nerf!&quot;.   Tonight at work, on the Roulette Table (I work at a casino) 00 came up 5 times in a row.  Now while that may not seem rare to some, the odds of getting 00 five times in a row on a 38 number roulette wheel is 79,235,168 to 1, which is close to the odds of winning the powerball with only one ticket.</div></div><hr />

On the plus side, they are pretty weak even by pre-OoW standards. I have taken them down with as little as three people, Cleric, Warrior and me, when the slow didn't land. The Warrior was in high end (100K+) pre-OoW Bazaar gear with all defensive AAs maxed or nearly maxed. We were LOM at the end, but we did it. Horses, FT and my Canni were all we needed to keep the tank alive while he and my puppy killed the named, one percent of HP at a time. We had two more people at first, but they cleverly decided to die in the first 20% of the fight, so it was primarily a 3 character affair.</div></div><hr />

There have been at least 24 casts of slow on Gaukr now with no slow.... I have fought him 6 times since the patch, beating him, but never slowing him.... I dont know, weird...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Spent a lot of time raiding/grouping last few days and I have not noticed anything unusual regarding resists in any zone.  I usually pull for our raid when I want us to move faster, and I pulled most of MPG moving from trial to trial and had no problems with any dramatic resists on slows (well, not for more than a mob or so).  Usually when I pull at least two mobs come, and I pull with nihil and almost 70% of the time get TA to stick turgors on the second mob before he even gets to camp first cast.  It's just random<br />
<br />
Btw.. that casting bug has happened a lot of times before to people.  Most of the time that I've seen/heard it happened, it was because the said person was on a horse or something like that.  I would suggest that you camp out and back in if you notice it happening again.  That should fix it, or has always for the people that I've seen it happen to.<br />
<br />
Would a mob survive long enough in your groups to resist spells more than 1-2 times? And are you the only person that can do anything to keep your group alive if something goes wrong? Maybe you are not always noticing the &quot;tough&quot; mobs because others take care of the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">it doesn't really matter.  The person was talking about resist changes, and I explained that I have been pulling a lot in MPG for our raid (and no, I don't go up, pull the mob back to the raid and let them kill it, I run up tag a mob with slow and wait there till the raid catches up to me).<br />
<br />
I haven't seen any resist changes.  If I did, then I would prob have to pull with malos, and I don't.  I always pull with nihil.  Sometimes it doesn't always stick, but I would venture that 70% of the time it does.  Even so, about 85% of the time that it doesn't stick, my TA will stick first try (even on the lightning guys).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I have noticed that trash mobs in WoS have been more resistent to slow since patch. I had been able to land slow with out Malo on 90% of the mobs before patch and last night I was resisted more then 50% of the time with out malo. It is considerably noticible that there has been an increase in resists with mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I have noticed various changes since the Dec 15th patch from lenths in duration on buffs to changes in backstab rates.  I play both a Rogue and a Shaman, so I agree that things seem to have changed.  I also have heard about changes in other aspects as well.  I hate nerf's but I hate stealth nerfs even more.  The only class that seems to be pleasntly happy are the monks, and I wouldn't take that away from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">well, we did velitorkin in WoS today, he usually slowed easily, resisted 8 shaman throwing everything for 5 min</div></div><hr />
