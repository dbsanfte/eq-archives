<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A discussion among the Class Correspondents turned up a very shocking and, to me, funny bit of knowledge.<br />
<br />
In talking with the Cleric guy, it came up that Clerics were all nervous about and snippy because Rytan had told them that there may be some huge changes upcoming for Druid and Shaman healing.<br />
<br />
Stunned.  No other word for it.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd share.  Cleric guy and I are talking it over.  I'll let ya know if there is more, but I was pretty freakin surprised that what we hear and what others hear can be so different.<br />
<br />
I suppose it's not really that important.</div></div><hr />

Clerics will not be satisfied unless they are guaranteed a spot in EVERY, SINGLE, STINKING group.  The other 13 classes can fight it out for the last five spots.<br />
<br />
Cleric's lot in EQ life is not as woebegone as they'd like you to believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In other news, water is wet.  The cleric boards were aflame when they announced that we were getting chloroblast, because that would destroy their healing role and nobody would play a cleric ever again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Clerics were put into that role by both the game, and players... everyone who's created a cleric over the last 3 years knew that they were going to be king of the hill.    It's been a LONG time since shamans and druids healed as well (Basically original EQ)... it just hasn't been as obvious since GoD came out.<br />
<br />
The Complete Heal raiding game made it so that guilds needed tons of them on the roster ... thus in the raiding game, clerics are required by the grouploads.     <br />
<br />
Players put clerics on thier high and required place by being unwilling to scratch thier ass without a cleric and 96% res in the group.<br />
<br />
I want healing changes... I want more of a healing balance.... but I understand why clerics are afraid.<br />
<br />
You would be too if you had nothing to fall back on... and clerics don't.    The day that a shaman can do the job in any zone, and raid, that a cleric can... is the day they get less groups by a lot.    They simply have not much else to offer.<br />
<br />
Resses can be done later in instanced zones, or by Pallies/Necros.   Virtue lasts long enough that you can get it beforehand, or deal with other buffs.<br />
<br />
Etc...<br />
<br />
That's all... I'm not supporting the cleric monopoly on healing... I just understand the fear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I told the Cleric guy that if we got:<br />
<br />
Tnarg = 1500, Daluda = 1900, Obkin = 2200, Kragg = 3500 the Shamans would be thrilled.<br />
<br />
We still wouldn't be anywhere near as effective as a Cleric at raw healing, we still wouldn't have a rez of any sort, but we'd at least have a chance to experience some of the high end content.</div></div><hr />

Of course we do.  Haven't you looked at all those l33t stat buffs in your spellbook?!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Clerics think druids and shaman utterly outclass them at everything but healing. Druids think they will not ever be able to compete with haste and slow, no matter what heals or nukes they get and that their nukes will never make up for cleric healing. Shamans think that slow mitigation makes slow completely pointless and mana regeneration is not cutting it anymore. A substantial part of each class thinks everyone else is out to get them.<br />
<br />
All of the above has a grain of truth to it. Clerics remember Luclin pretty well, where druids soloed circles around them and shamans utterly outclassed them in groups. Druids remember being a solo-only class and basically being pointless in groups. Shamans see themselves getting more marginal each expansion. Everyone's paranoia has reasons. Bashing other classes for voicing their legitimate fears and concerns while wanting our issues adressed is simply being intelectually dishonest.<br />
<br />
As to the original post - I trust the word of SOE employees and especially Rytan less then I used to trust anonymous Everlore posters. Every class has been flat out lied to by now (except possibly berserkers I guess). I trust things I see on lucy/test because more often then not they have been gone live. Anything else I will file under &quot;promises not yet broken&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Perhaps you are right Murtak, but what I find distasteful is that while Shaman are very open to Clerics being given more utility and solo ability, very few Clerics are willing to entertain the idea of a better Healing Shaman.<br />
<br />
I am certainly not &quot;bashing&quot; Clerics, I am simply trying to let everyone see both sides of the coin.  As you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Improving Soloability for clerics just opens up more group spots for shaman. So we are For it.<br />
<br />
But improving Shaman healing lowers group spots for clerics. So they are majorly against it.<br />
<br />
It all boils down to the 6 man group limit. And being told. Sorry we have six already.<br />
<br />
Noone likes to be the only kid left when the teams are picked. <br />
<br />
Even if Clerics could solo. The ones that want groups Will get nothing out of that. <br />
<br />
I still think one of the best things to do Would be to change the Raid rules so 12 man raids get equal XP to 6 man groups. So more friends can play together with no penalty. Now the xp will be worse since devided by 12. If all spots were filled.  But the odd 7-8 man group would still be a blast to play in and not cripple Xp like raids do now.<br />
<br />
Too many classes. But no solutions.<br />
<br />
I would hate to be a dev. But If I was **** would get changed. Some for the better some for the worse I am sure.<br />

&quot;Yep...I'm king of healing and I want it to remain that way. When people say they need a healer for a group, I want them to look for clerics...not a druid or a shaman. I don't want the other priest classes to get better heals, and I sure as hell don't want them to have any AA abilities available to help them with healing. Being the main healer is not their job...supporting me in my role as main healer is their job. &quot;&lt;i&gt; -- Exarch Velisaris, EQCleric Forums&lt;/i&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Snoww - I kinda see where you are comin from, but I am of the opinion based upon my experiences on Solusek Ro that there simply aren't enough priests available.  When I pop the LFG list, I see boatloads of names . . . but almost never a Cleric and only very rarely a Druid.<br />
<br />
I simply think that there would be more groups formed with three adequate healing classes.  I mean seriously . . . when is the last time a Cleric had to look more than 5 minutes for a group?  When is the last time a Shaman or Druid had a group in under 5?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a slightly better example is: how often have you had a 5 person group wait for a considerable time to get a cleric?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I always have a group. <br />
<br />
I am a group.<br />
<br />
Sure I might not Be doing the most challanging content. But If I am playing I have a group.<br />
<br />
A cleric has to have someone take hits. A druid can kite to solo But is more limited than a shaman ever is in where they can fight.<br />
<br />
Clerics are not alot of fun to play. And when Everything a group does hinges on you it is very wearing. (Yes I play a cleric some. Not a main But level 65 with 200ish AA) But I am not a cleric. It isnt in my nature to sit back and heal. I want to be up front beating the snot out of it Like I have done for 5 years with Snoww. (Not meele per say but I do swing a hammer/spear often as I can)<br />
<br />
Giving a cleric the ability to solo doesnt fix the stress involved at all at being the caretaker for a group of folks who are demanding you play for them at all times. (As a cleric this is 100% true)<br />
<br />
If you want to fix clerics You have to make the game more rewarding for them. Stuff Like DI is great (Divine intervention) It means that a mistake can be covered. And is cool at the same time when it works. Stuff like Vie. Is good too. And the hammer pet and proccing hammer.  But when you are told sit down shut up and heal me  that isnt fun at all.<br />
<br />
Many Clerics play out of a sense of Obligation to thier friends. Because they are required. And taking away that feeling of requirement is a scary thing once you get used to it. It is a safty blanket to them after a while.  And when someone is pulling on your blanky that you don't know you really really want to kick them. <br />
<br />
I don't have awnsers of course. Not my place. Just making some observations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm sorry, but we do have things to fall back on.    I do not deny at all that shamans have issues on their plates too.   Worst case for me on any day, I can go off and solo something for challenge, for loot, or for xp.    What will a cleric do on that day?<br />
<br />
I can heal for content that's not too hard... like Normal LDONs are pretty easy for me to heal... only getting slightly dicey when crap hits the fan... where I need to heal and slow.<br />
<br />
Groups still desire shamans.    More people will beg you for those useless stat buffs, than will say &quot;no&quot;.    We have been hurt slightly though in recent times... especially with Beastlords being pretty good... but I don't see shamans being ignored every day for groups both trivial and hard.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of you are too bitter to care anymore.   If shamans suck so much, and clerics rock so much (or beastlords, or insert popular class of the week)... go play one.<br />
<br />
Class balance sucks because no one really looks at the other guys problems.    Clerics have the most to lose of the priests... but they also have the highest &quot;requireability&quot; for raids and groups... and raid stackability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If the devs could be trusted. And said. Here are the changes being made. Shaman and druids are getting this this and this. Clerics have already gotten this this and this to redress the ability to support a group as main healers loss to soley clerics. Then it would be good.<br />
<br />
But the devs have no street credit so to speak. They don't followthrough and have zero accountability to us.<br />
<br />
The disease nerf way way back when all the way to current issues. They have promised things and never delivered. Like meele Balancing Caster balancing Healing balancing and all. Too many irons in the fire. And no followthrough. <br />

Are you implying a Cleric is having trouble finding a group?<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
a) Beastlords have been popular for much longer that a week.  You can't trivialize this and say &quot;Oh...THIS week we are bitter towards Shadowknights!  Last week it was Monks!&quot;<br />
<br />
b) If I could swap out my shaman for a similarly geared/keyed/AAd Enchanter or Beastlord I would.  (OK, only if I could still be an Ogre.  I care far more about my Oger-ness than my Shaman-ess)<br />
<br />
Clerics have the most to lose of the priests... <br />
<br />
So you agree that Clerics are more powerful than Druids and Shamans?<br />
<br />
You spend an entire post denigrating people who complain that clerics are more powerful than druids and shamans and then in your last sentence you admit it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you enjoy being a shaman you might not get the same pleasure at being an enchanter.<br />
<br />
The game play is completly different. Chanters are powerful But it is like powerlifting on eggshells. <br />
<br />
Shaman have thier feet on the earth but can't move as much mass as easily but have more stamina.<br />
<br />
Apples and oranges they are hmmmm. (Main was chanter for a long time and still hot box often with my level 65 chanter with 130ish aa.)<br />
<br />
The grass is nore really greener. Cause as a chanter you have to have  a healer. Cause you WILL get hit if you play right. And as a chanter your healer isnt a shaman unless there is no other choice or trivial content. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think my statement came off wrong, and I apologize for that.    Im not calling everyone in this thread bitter... I mean... look at a patch, people flooding replies saying &quot;nothing for shaman&quot; even if the patch is a good all around patch.   I think we all know that nothing moves quick in Everquest unless it's a nerf.<br />
<br />
Instead of trying to think about what might be done to help offset the losses to clerics, by improving priest healing by either a little or a lot, people like to complain about clerics.<br />
<br />
I do agree that clerics are overpowered.   I'm not trying to say they aren't... but they do have the most to lose.    Right now... they have their highly valued &quot;required&quot; status for groups and raids.    The better Shamans and Druids get a healing, the weaker that &quot;required&quot; status becomes.     <br />
<br />
For example, on some Luclin/PoP raids I've lead, I put Druids in the CH chain.   Before Druid CH... that really couldn't happen, and I'd need all clerics.    That's not to say screw clerics, I'll use druids... it means that a  raid doesn't stop because you're short a cleric or two - which is a good thing right?<br />
<br />
I think so... but it still lowers the &quot;required&quot; status of clerics.<br />
<br />
Healing is the absolute number 1 thing they bring to the table.   They don't bring much dps...  for short outings you can grab a Virtue before hand... or a Paladin can buff you close with more slots... they don't offer much utility... <br />
<br />
All I am trying to say... is try to see it from their point.    That's it.   I want a better Priest healing balance... I want more healing options for almost every situation.    I don't want clerics to go from a number 1 group and raid class... to nothing.<br />
<br />
And before someone says it, no... an 1800 point, or 2000 point heal is not going to shove clerics into a dark room never to come out again.   But every little upgrade, does have an effect.   Something you may not have been able to heal for before, you may be able to now.  <br />
<br />
In my perfect world... Clerics, Shamans, and Druids would have near equal healing power.    Clerics may have more healing type spells (ie: group, over time, instant, etc..) but at the end of the day... any priest could do the job for you.     The rest of the classes abilities would help you choose what you wanted.<br />
<br />
But this isn't the way it is for EQ.   Like it or not... Clerics don't bring much to the table outside of their amazing, and even overpowered healing abilities.</div></div><hr />

But other classes being soloable hasn't destroyed grouping/raiding, so one more class that can solo wont either.  In the end, it wont hurt anything for them to have a few dots, etc, to help soloing.<br />
But at the same time, I've had more raids called or targets changed for lack of clerics than any other reason.  I've just not seen any situation where more healers is a bad thing, either in groups or raids.  I can understand the monotony of being a cleric in a raid.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Again, its specialization. <br />
<br />
If a Knight can tank it adequately, why would you want a Warrior, who brings no side-utility to the group? If a shaman can heal adequately, why would ANY group want a cleric instead? Seriosly. <br />
<br />
Clerics are essential at the raid level, and currently at the cutting edge group level, but they are actually fairly worthless in lower content like LDoN normal and BoT. A shaman or a Druid bring SO much more to group. This is what clerics are bitching about, what they have basically lived with for years. As shaman, we are only now feeeling that &quot;uselessness&quot; in groups. I go to LDoN normal with Clerics and tell them to nuke and melee, cause I never get below 80 healing, slowing and Baning adds. How do you think that makes them feel, honestly. <br />
<br />
Its a long road. I am not sure they will ever be able to adjust the game back to a reasonalbe position where most classes have a relatively equal desirability in both groups and raids. There is just too much room inbetween.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not specialization, it's what content you are talking about.<br />
<br />
An LDoN Normal isn't a realistic measure of healing requirements.<br />
<br />
LDoN Normals could be done quite easily without any priest class in the group. A Paladin could be and do act as main healers in LDoN Normals without much of a problem.<br />
<br />
I'd venture that it's equipment and AA that makes LDoN normals so easy.</div></div><hr />

For the added damage, less mana spent by the healers and for /shield? <br />
<br />
If a shaman can heal adequately, why would ANY group want a cleric instead? Seriosly.<br />
If a shaman can, through combining slow and heals, exactly match a cleric who is simply healing we only have a few other things to consider. The shaman adds haste and the dog. The cleric adds more HPs and can benefit from slowing (which is already figured into the shaman healing equation). He can also pacify and rez. Looks pretty equal to me, although I would not begrudge clerics something else to do. But &quot;if shamans can heal clerics won't get groups&quot; is an urban myth. Shamans and druids can heal just fine in BoT but you do not see clerics sitting at the sideline begging for groups, do you?<br />
<br />
Clerics are essential at the raid level, and currently at the cutting edge group level, but they are actually fairly worthless in lower content like LDoN normal and BoT. A shaman or a Druid bring SO much more to group.<br />
Like? List them please, especially the shaman ones.<br />
<br />
This is what clerics are bitching about, what they have basically lived with for years. As shaman, we are only now feeeling that &quot;uselessness&quot; in groups. I go to LDoN normal with Clerics and tell them to nuke and melee, cause I never get below 80 healing, slowing and Baning adds. How do you think that makes them feel, honestly.<br />
And you think that the cleric could not just tell you to not heal at all and let DvA + paladin group heals do all the work? Given elemental+ gear you can just take 6 random classes and complete LDoN normals with no worries. They are utterly trivial and almost as moot for balance purposes as crushbone. Why do you even take two healers along if you want them both to feel useful? Two healers in a LDoN normal should feel about as useful as a mezzer in Dreadlands.<br />
<br />
Its a long road. I am not sure they will ever be able to adjust the game back to a reasonalbe position where most classes have a relatively equal desirability in both groups and raids. There is just too much room inbetween.<br />
PoP looked pretty reasonable to me, with the exception of plane of time (post warrior improvements that is).</div></div><hr />

CLR will lose the position? No. it will only be more flexible than now.<br />
If CLR think they will lose the position, they should imagine the situation that each group has one or two CLR.<br />
How many CLR do we need?<br />
<br />
If it will be more flexible, we do not have to wait for long time to form party until CLR will pop nor give up camping somewhere because of the lack of CLR.<br />

I was tempted, albeit for only a few seconds, to create a login to dispel some of those people ludicris notions about some of our abilities, but then realized people would have to want to understand before they can understand.<br />
<br />
They don't want to understand that our pet does less dps than their pet. They don't want to understand that while our pet is permanent, I have to resummon it quite often at a cast time and mana cost much higher than their pet.<br />
<br />
They don't want to understand we aren't the only slowers, and that realistically no group in semi-challenging content is without a slower ever, and that our utility of being able to self slow means didly-squat in regards to our inability to heal a MT.<br />
<br />
They don't want to understand that even a paladin can main heal a group in easy ldon's while tanking, and that easy ldon's are no basis for any healing argument.<br />
<br />
They don't want to understand that our &quot;magnificent&quot; solo ability isn't really that magnificient, and that in some content (seen a cleric solo faster in Qinimi the other day than I could) they are very capable soloers.<br />
<br />
They don't want to understand that our buffs are meaningless, be it stat buffs or haste buffs or even Ferine Avatar. Most groups in semi-challenging encounters will have some form of CC, which means either enchanter or bard who will provide better haste than we can. That Ferine Avatar, with current attack numbers is nothing but another almost useless number boost, in addition to being the second most annoying spell ever.<br />
<br />
They don't want to understand that in fast paced exp groups our &quot;magnificent&quot; mana regen isn't that magnificient but merely adequate to compensate for our inflated costs for all of our spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why don't they want to understand? Because it serves them no purpose.<br />
<br />
Do clerics need some utility? Sure, but reading the cleric boards some of their arguments are moronic. On one hand they complain that if druids and shamans got better heals they should get some utility to compensate their drop in group desirability and then they say they want invis and lev, as if those spells mean anything in the realm of group desirability.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Actually I don't think anybodies jealous of shaman soloability anymore. When you see a druid charm soloing in PoP you begin to realize how wacked the game is. Heck, I haven't even heard that &quot;shaman solo dragons!&quot; one of late.<br />
<br />
Clerics are a narrow class. If they're not a main healer they're nothing. I don't think it's wrong for them to be concerned, and some percentage of that concern is going to crest the lunatic fringe.</div></div><hr />

I do not deny at all that shamans have issues on their plates too.   Worst case for me on any day, I can go off and solo something for challenge, for loot, or for xp.    What will a cleric do on that day?<br />
<br />
I can heal for content that's not too hard... like Normal LDONs are pretty easy for me to heal... only getting slightly dicey when crap hits the fan... where I need to heal and slow.<br />
<br />
Groups still desire shamans.    More people will beg you for those useless stat buffs, than will say &quot;no&quot;.    We have been hurt slightly though in recent times... especially with Beastlords being pretty good... but I don't see shamans being ignored every day for groups both trivial and hard.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of you are too bitter to care anymore.   If shamans suck so much, and clerics rock so much (or beastlords, or insert popular class of the week)... go play one.<br />
<br />
Class balance sucks because no one really looks at the other guys problems.    Clerics have the most to lose of the priests... but they also have the highest &quot;requireability&quot; for raids and groups... and raid stackability.<br />
<br />
I and many others here have had groups ask us for buffs, but don't get invited to the group even though we have LFG on and the group has 5 members. We do not want to be buff bots.<br />
<br />
We created Shaman for a number of different reasons, and most of us created them before the class description was changed. We love the Shaman class and want it to remain a worth while class. If we were &quot;too bitter to care anymore&quot;, we would not be trying to prevent the decline of the class.<br />
<br />
You are correct in the fact that class balancing sucks. You have 16 different classes that all want different things. You have 16 different classes with different fears and concerns for their class. I would suggest <br />
<br />
Sariss that you take a look at The Priests' Covenant the druids grove is hosting. You will see that all three priest classes are working together to address the wants and concerns of their fellow priests to make things better for ALL of us. <br />
<br />
I would like to hear exactly how a Cleric loses if a Druid or Shaman is capable of being a viable group healer? What I see is that there are now 5 players plus a Druid or Shaman who are not left sitting around waiting for a Cleric to log on or become available so they can go do something that is not trivial content. That is not saying heal as well as a Cleric, it is say can do the job if we have to. The group will likely lose out on some of the other things we can do for them with us doing the healing instead of a Cleric. For most groups and content this is an acceptable trade to be able to go do something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">What game are you playing? Been through a GOD trial where Enchanters can charm? How about LDONs?<br />

Please, please, please, read an entire post instead of just one line.  Know many raids where enchanters are allowed to charm?  Heck, half the time, the raid leader wont even allow summoned pets if the target isn't rooted.  Yes, if an enchanter has to use his/her nukes, the dps output will be bottom of the barrel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">At the bottom of all this, I wonder just how much of all the worry is based mostly in the fear of change?<br />
<br />
Clerics have had a set role as just a healer for ... ever (more or less.) That is it. Med, heal, toss a hp buff, med, heal. Not much complexity to being a cleric. Not much variation in the role.<br />
<br />
Yes, the above is a vapid generalization. There are many clerics who look for little things they can do and add to a group to give them some flexibility. Generally though, clerics fall into a single role/responsibility box and that is where they stay ... because it is easy, safe and comfortable for them to be there. A person playing a single-dimensional cleric has the easiest job in the group ... buff and heal with an occassional (hopefully occassional only) rez of a groupmate.<br />
<br />
Now, if healing is balanced for all the priests and clerics are compensated with some new tools/skills it will fall upon clerics to make the most radical adjustment to find their new balance. Shaman and druids will easily slide into better healing roles. Not because they are more versatile (though this is likely true) but because a better healing role would be an improvement for both classes and so easier to adjust to. Clerics would have to adjust outside of the box ... tough to do; tough to break old habits; tough to break away from comfortable habits.<br />
<br />
Ironically, giving clerics more options and tools and flexibility can only improve the class enjoyment, but the reaction will be initially negative by many, many players who are locked into their primary healing only world. Once they find their balance the reaction of the majority would be, &quot;OMG, this is so much better (fun, interesting, challenging)!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The reverse is true also. There was a very funny thread started on cleric boards way back when druids got their 58 CH spell. About clerics telling the truth to them about CH chains. I looked but couldn't find it to link. The underlying gist of it was, &quot;hey, enjoy what you asked for - you got it and it aint that fun.&quot; Cleric version of shaman comments about being able to solo well - we can, but it aint the 'cat's meow' clerics think it is. Well, being able to be a basic level cleric healer in a group and being pulled into groups to only fill that role will not be the end all/fix all shaman think it will be. It will just be a different way to play the toon. Some will adjust, some will love it and some will hate getting the tools to compensate for the loss of role shaman had.<br />
<br />
But all of this thread, at this time, is pretty much moot. We don't have the changes and there is no plan anyone is aware of that is coming down the pike to give us those changes. Not for us, not for druids, not for clerics.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;cleric bashing&quot; in this thread, I suggest taking any comment you read on the cleric boards made by a passionate player voicing their opinion on potential class infringement and find a similar comment made here on the topic of beastlords and their assortment of might-as-well-be-shaman tools. Be sympathetic to their point of view. Clerics will not, if SOE implementation history is a guide, get an equal balance of change if healing is balanced between the priests. At best they will get token compensation. Most likely they will get a Brenlo quote.</div></div><hr />

So why in your 1st post do you state if you get the right gear.<br />
FT 15 and various Foci help you above the normal everyday shaman so just because you have the same level and same spells doesnt mean you are the same.5k unbuffed HP helps pretty much in your case too.<br />
Ok lets take you at your word.<br />
Read some posts by Chicago-Mob on the EQ shaman boards.<br />
He claims and gives evidence that there is still very much for him to do in High End GoD.<br />
Now taking your comment that means that because he can do it all other Shaman should be able to too.<br />
So therefore that means there is nothing wrong with Shaman and we need no fixes at all.<br />
Yes what i meant is you are a master of trivial content.<br />

At the beginning cleric were a class amongst other, now they see themselves as the most important EQ lobby.<br />
<br />
This is all ****ed up, and getting a small 200/300 hp upgrade on our heals won't change the fact that we need almost the same healing abilities as clerics to be worth a damn past BoT in an emergency situation (aka adds).<br />
<br />
Whether my tnarg goes from 1300 to 1500 or not won't change the fact that i'm totally crap at healing in HARD LDoN, EPs, and GoD.<br />

The problem doesn't rely on shaman getting better heals, but druids getting CH. we are a support priest class and it's fine as it is, give CH to druids, nerf charm so they don't solo things they aren't supposed to solo and the priests are balanced, since it will double the number of players able to be used in a raid environment, and fix the grouping issues.<br />

I have always thought that clerics should ge given shaman/druid level soloability the day shamans and druids are given cleric level raid effectiveness.  Since Kunark (the last time you could solo your way to a top-end character) soloing has gotten less and less relevant anyway.<br />
<br />
The real problem is that since clerics have had a stranglehold on the endgame so long (since Velious), there are now jillions more clerics than any other class (among high end players).  If SoE releases that stranglehold, the widely overpopulated cleric ranks will be forced to eat their young.  That's not good for customer retention.</div></div><hr />

Most of the clerics that I know that are running current (GoD) content dont use CH; its too slow.  They use lights because of the much shorter cast time.  With focus and AA they can heal almost as much as CH and it takes 7 seconds less.<br />

I don't get insulted if someone wants to add a BL/Druid/Cleric but I WILL speak up if we've got 5 people and we can either wait 5-20 minutes for a healer or grab another DPS and let me slow and heal.  There's no point wasting time waiting for a healer when you can snag a DPS and start immediately.  Now, some people aren't comfortable with a Shaman healing because they haven't experienced it for themselves.  In fact, this happened to me last night in a guild group.  We had 5 guildies and a 6th on the way and the Enchanter said she wasn't comfortable having only a Shaman for healing.  We explained that I had done this many times before and that she was fine.  She just asked that I make sure she didn't die which was perfectly acceptable to me.  The LDoN went without a hitch, I don't think she even got hit once and I know I never had to heal her.  I barely had to heal the tank.  I think I've got another person converted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Most of the clerics that I know that are running current (GoD) content dont use CH; its too slow.  They use lights because of the much shorter cast time.  With focus and AA they can heal almost as much as CH and it takes 7 seconds less.<br />
<br />
The last time my cleric friend used CH as a main form of mitigating damage was BoT.  After that, it was all about fast casting heals.<br />
<br />
Aye i have done Tipt too, and i know what its like to kill the named there.<br />
HOWEVER, to kill all the trash, 98% of the trial, clerics do use CH...they do with me since i cast Q on the tank before the mob is in camp.<br />
So your point is moot, do you have something more consistent to offer than &quot;i found a situation out of 1000 when a cleric doesn't use CH&quot;?<br />
<br />
My point was the following: shaman dont need healing upgrades, druids need CH to see there usefulness both in raids AND groups rise up.<br />
<br />
The pressure on cleric for raiding is too high, guilds kill themselves to recruit or powerlvl them, and doing a hard LDON without a cleric or a VERY GOOD druid (understand max healing AA and healing focus and fast cast focus) is still impossible.<br />
<br />
Maybe in OoW the healing gap will become horrible i dunno, but if its just for GoD, only druids do need CH, and maybe the cast time of their fast heals reduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">The argument about priest classes getting better heals vs. Clerics losing group spots(really that's what it comes down to) is about the good of the many vs. the good of the few.  Currently, Clerics have it very good.  For non-trivial content(aka GoD and hard LDoNs) and the average player(not the time+ equipped uber raid player everyone aspires to be), Clerics have a monopoly on groups.  Most people don't want to do GoD content without one.<br />
<br />
Groups languish all the time because of shortages of Clerics.  Many elemental players do not want to do normal LDoNs because the rewards(xp and loot) are so pitiful.  Whenever improving Druid/Shaman healing comes up, Clerics look at it as a doomsday scenario because suddenly they're not as necessary as they used to be.  They're still required for the best rezzes, I'd still want one in any of my groups for that alone, especially during hard LDoNs or GoD content.  They have good HP buffs that stack nicely with Shaman and Druid buffs.  The real difference would be that many more groups are not stuck waiting or doing lower level content because there are no clerics available for their awesome healing ability.<br />
<br />
Personally, when one class is such a lynchpin to doing the content that people want to do, this needs to be fixed.  Yes, Clerics may lose some groups but careful balancing, player bias towards Clerics(hard to change five years of behavior/opinion overnight, just look at Beastlords vs. Shaman, people still pick me over Beastlords on my server even though a Beastlord would probably be &quot;optimal&quot;), raid requirements, etc. will ensure that Clerics will never be stuck LFG quite like any other class in the game.</div></div><hr />

I have a community full of Shaman who will strongly disagree with you there.  And frankly, Druids already have a CH that is pretty freakin' good.  4600 HP is a very nice heal.<br />

4680 is very nice right up to the point where you hit the point of it not keeping up with MOB DPS anymore while the cleric 7500 HP one does.<br />
<br />
In other words, 4680 is completely identical to 7500 for a lot of players while at the same time being radically different for other players.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, your community of shaman doesnt see the whole picture, which isnt &quot;shaman &amp; druid vs clerics&quot;, but &quot;druid vs cleric&quot; and &quot;shaman vs beastlords&quot;.<br />
<br />
We have slow which is a damage reduction spell, it wouldnt be fair that we get heals on par with clerics, and the minor upgrade made to our heals recently won't do jack for us.<br />
<br />
The problem of EQ is that clerics are required for raiding everything, grouping in the last expansions.<br />
<br />
What matey said that you applauded is what i think: clerics have a monopoly which must fall.<br />
<br />
However, shaman getting pathetic healing upgrade is irrelevant. If just druids had improved healing on par with clerics, many, many, many problems would be instantly solved regarding groupind and raiding in EQ for everyone. We would just need maybe an upgrade in dps to match the class which REALLY hurt us in groups: beastlords.<br />
<br />
And then we would still have the problem of our stackability on raids.<br />
<br />
no sorry,  your &quot;shaman community&quot; has been brainwashed so long about getting better heals that they forgot that the true problem isn't that we cannot heal as well as cleric, but that only cleric can heal well, and are the bottleneck of EQ raiding.<br />
<br />
i'm sorry if what i say isn't &quot;i'm a shaman and i want to be a cleric who can slow&quot;, but i think i see the whole picture muhc better than your narrow-minded view about upgrading shaman.<br />
<br />
As for Druid CH, as far as i recall, totally useless on raids, marginally used in groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />

You are trying to compare us to our Hybrid.  Unfair and inappropriate comparison.  We are priests.  We don't share an archtype with BL's . . . we share it with Druids and Clerics.  Why would you compare us to something outside our archtype?<br />

<br />
and why would necros get eaten as soon as they get summoned? melee bot giants (the ones that summon) are as trivial to solo for necros as they are for shamans.  Course, if you say otherwise, I invite you to find proof</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Arctarus, it's a brave or (more likely) really stupid person who accuses an entire community of people as being brainwashed.  Somehow I see you as the person standing in the middle of the desert, looking around, and saying, &quot;Damn it!  Everyone else is lost!  Freaking idiots!&quot;<br />
<br />
My personal opinion is that most shaman have accepted, or at least acquiesced, to the fact that we need to be a 3rd string healer.  Slow IS powerful.  Druids ought to heal a bit better than us.  Clerics much more so.  However, in GoD, we make a piss-poor emergency healer simply because our heals are so low in raw hp.  Even focused, outside of a crit, we often can't even keep a cleric alive if they get heal agro.<br />
<br />
So, even if you accept that our role has been relegated to that of an emergency healer, we DO NOT HAVE THE TOOLS TO DO THE JOB.<br />
<br />
Don't come crying back here to tell me, &quot;I saved a cleric once in BoT!&quot; or some crap to that effect.  If we get a quadding 1k mob on a cleric and slow bounced, they're F'd.  We have NO hope of keeping them alive.  Give us another 300 or so raw hp on our blast heal, and after all of our AAs and focus items, we're getting closer to a situation where we can keep them alive.  Sure, it doesn't sound like a lot, but I guarantee you it adds up when chaining heals.  500hp would be better, but I think that's asking for a bit much.<br />
<br />
Bottom line though, our heals have not been upgraded for content changes OR mitigation.  We have heals poorly based on a resistable spell to which mobs can have partial or complete immunity.  Now you think we shouldn't complain because people are okay in old content?  Do you think clerics or druids would be happy if their heals has a resist check, and in the presence of certain mobs, their heals were mitigated or simply did not work?<br />
<br />
Right now people are focused on what they see as the BIGGEST problem--healing.  Without healing the group dies.  That does NOT mean that crucible shaman haven't highlighted issues with dps as well.  Go look at the list submitted to SoE.<br />
<br />
What it does mean is that it's probably not a good idea to come ranting into a community and claiming that we are 'brain-washed&quot; and have narrow views whereas you, in your vast splendor, have the whole picture in mind.<br />

FYI, necros have 3 tools to help them tank and survive aggro.<br />

I grouped regularly with a very capable necro (pre-elemental, just knew how to play his class well and was well bazzaar geared) in HoHa basement.  On a couple of occaisions he'd tell us to stand back and stay out of it, unless he asked for assistance.  He pulled the unslowable hummie and he tanked the whole fight and never once got into danger while his pet and DoTs ripped it a new one.  A couple of times he FDed partway for BRIEF periods of time, never loosing his pet, but for the most part he was tanking in TEH face.  BoT trash is no more challenging than HoHa basement with that mob.  As I said, he could repeat this at will.<br />
<br />
There are complete logs posted somewhere on these boards (or a link to them) of a necro tanking a GW in TEH face as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No question, just gonna go on.<br />
<br />
My view of the game isnt &quot;the class vs the hybrids&quot;, its comparing the abilities of the different classes in a group and raiding.<br />
<br />
Cleric vs Paladin is non-existent in my mind. Paladin tanks, cleric heals. period. I know cleric want to be lvl 55 paladins and paladins want to have CH, but its not my problem.<br />
Druid/rangers? One is a healing priest class, the other is a dps class. I do not know why you compare them, they both have snare? Great!<br />
<br />
Shaman vs beastlords. Shaman are a support class with minor healing abilities. Beastlords are a dps class.<br />
OhOH, we DO SHARE a key ability, it's called slow...<br />
You know what i think? bst are better than shaman because not only can they slow, but they can also tank when they got aggro off it. you might object that a well geared shaman can tank for a bit and survive too.. is a well equipped shaman the norm? I think not.<br />
<br />
Compare whats comparable, i'm not comparing my class with my hybrid, i'm saying giving a melee class slow was a sure way to withdraw shaman from groups, since slow was their main abilities, but they add no dps (at least before they get crit affliction and a dot focus, which is my case).<br />
Fact is, while people still grp shaman, a grp with a bst is faster.<br />
They don't have a hoT? They have a pet. They don't have DoTs? They have their own dps.<br />
The simple truth is that they have slow.<br />
Well that's nice for them, another class with slow! Problem is, it isn't nice for me.<br />
<br />
I feel with my shaman more and more like a chanter: a buff bot. Hell i even bot my shaman when i play my bard to add another dps in the group...<br />
<br />
Chutoi: <br />
Now you think we shouldn't complain because people are okay in old content? Do you think clerics or druids would be happy if their heals has a resist check, and in the presence of certain mobs, their heals were mitigated or simply did not work?Look, those tiny upgrades to our heals won't do jack for us, a real upgrade would be getting druid healing spells. that's why i'm saying that's all this fuss about shaman healing is irrelevant. We either get good heals to be useful, or we get nothing and try to get the larger picture fixed.<br />
<br />
Right now people are focused on what they see as the BIGGEST problem--healing. Without healing the group dies. That does NOT mean that crucible shaman haven't highlighted issues with dps as well. Go look at the list submitted to SoE.<br />
<br />
What it does mean is that it's probably not a good idea to come ranting into a community and claiming that we are 'brain-washed&quot; and have narrow views whereas you, in your vast splendor, have the whole picture in mind.I'm a failry realistic person, and your position is that of a shaman. Mine too, but i know that my enemies aren't clerics, but lack of dps.<br />
<br />
A little courtesy goes a long way.I'm naturally blunt and politically incorrect, that's how am I.<br />
As for all this &quot;community&quot; thing, while my account was recreated in dec 2003, i read the crucible ever since i started, it's not like i came here for the first time.<br />
<br />
Your example of a cleric getting owned underline a failing tank, not a flaw in our healing. As for slow, i'm sorry, it so rarely bounces after a malos that i do not take it as a problem.<br />
<br />
What is this larger picture i'm talking about that you do not seem to understand?<br />
The game, whether it be in group or raid, is totally dependant on a cleric monopoly on (good) heals.<br />
My opinion is that if you just make druid healing just a tad lower than cleric, you fix the healing problems. Why? Well, because you won't always need a cleric to group in GoD, hard LDON, EP, or be used in a CH Chain to kill your local boss.<br />
<br />
Shaman issues are NOT of healing, it's of dps because we share slow with a dps class, and inutility of our stats buffs.<br />
<br />
A good balancing would be that the cumulation of our stats buff and a bane with crit dot augmant the dps of the group on par with that of a single beastlord.<br />
<br />
I am ALL for upgrades in shaman healing, but since they will be STILL useless in GoD since we certainly not gonna get this magic heal that will allows us to &quot;save the cleric&quot;, i'd rather that cleric monopoly be broken by druids and our heal a little bit augmented.<br />
<br />
But don't dream, tnarg healing for a base 1500 or daluda healing for a base 1800  is an irrelevant change.<br />
<br />
And i'm not even mentioning chanter charming, which is even worse, but now went too far to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

A necro that is as well equipped with you (ie. over halfway through GoD) will be able to go mob for mob with you in BoT...that's why it's called *trivial* content.  In non-trivial content, Necro's might solo different mobs than you do, but they will still have the xp flow faster.  <br />

1.  Necro's cannot Slow a BoT giant.  Would you want to hang out in melee range of an unSlowed BoT giant when that content is appropriate for you?  Me either.<br />
<br />
2.  Necros have far fewer HP's and significantly less AC than a Shaman.  Even a Slowed BoT giant, when those are appropriate content, are quite formidable to a Necro who finds himself in melee range.<br />
<br />
Running up to a bot giant and tanking it down unslowed, while doable by a necro, is insanely risky.  It's generally better to kite them, which means the necro only gets hit for one (maybe 2 if stunned) rounds between summons, which occur every 10 seconds on a bot giant.  Between summons, depending on gear, they can simply let a tap dot heal back the damage taken (not as effective if the necro lacks Night's Beckon, as Saryns Kiss only heals about 150hp/tick), lifetap it back (850 hp w/o foci/crits, cast time of 3 seconds), or recast Forceshield (a 750hp rune with no component), or a combination of these.  Contrary to what you may think, using this strategy, summoning mobs that would absolutely destroy most people can be soloed with little risk (a good example being A Sludge-Eating Fly in one of the sewer trials, albeit significantly riskier than a bot giant).  And BoT aside, any necro with at least a shred of skill and a few AAs can walk up to any mob that doesn't hit harder than the dps of chain-casting Touch of Mujaki while their tap dot is running and tank it down unslowed.  Any necro who gets eaten the second they get summoned should reroll, imo</div></div><hr />

Clerics and druids heal well.  Shaman are adequate in most spots, still marginally below that for the endgame content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">My view of the game  isnt &quot;the class vs the hybrids&quot;, its comparing the abilities of the different classes in a group and raiding. <br />
<br />
There is the major flaw in your argument: MY VIEW OF THE GAME (TM). When compared to the reality of the game, your view is skewed in more ways than a Brenlo reply to a simple question.<br />
<br />
Cleric vs Paladin is non-existent in my mind. Paladin tanks, cleric heals. period. I know cleric want to be lvl 55 paladins and paladins want to have CH, but its not my problem.<br />
<br />
That Cleric/Paladin is non-existent in your mind simply ignores the point. Cleric/Paladin share the base character foundation with the difference being Cleric strengths are the heals, Paladin the melee. Progression of paladins allows them to actually buff more hps than clerics and their healing is significant enough now to borderline rival shaman. They are no where near clerics in the core ability of healing and never will be.<br />
<br />
Druid/rangers? One is a healing priest class, the other is a dps class. I do not know why you compare them, they both have snare? Great!<br />
<br />
Are you really this clueless? Druids are a very significant dps class. They are the second most powerful healing class - and that gap is very, very significant. Comparing their abilities, a druid is much more powerful as a dps class than it is as a healing class. Yet they can fill a very strong position as a healer when needed and in the right content.<br />
<br />
Shaman vs beastlords. Shaman are a support class with minor healing abilities. Beastlords are a dps class.<br />
OhOH, we DO SHARE a key ability, it's called slow...<br />
You know what i think? bst are better than shaman because not only can they slow, but they can also tank when they got aggro off it. you might object that a well geared shaman can tank for a bit and survive too.. <br />
<br />
How can you jump from the Paladin/Cleric and Druid/Ranger argument that cleric and druid are healing classes but shaman are &quot;just support class with minor healing abilities&quot;? You are too fogged in. There are 3 classes that comprise PRIEST: cleric, druid, SHAMAN. It has already been beat to death too many times about healing progression moving clerics to the forefront and the changes druids received to make them more group desirable. Shaman cheered these changes at the time. Little did we know.<br />
<br />
But to topic, lets look at Shaman/Beastlord and the line thinning to invisibility. Originally shaman had NO MELEE COUNTERPART. When introduced, bsts were on the same level (or lower) as rangers were to druids. Melee based with inferior shaman compatability. Progression has dealt bsts a very strong hand while that same progression has stacked the same deck against shaman. Mitigation, in effect, has brought bsts to the forefront because what they can offer in compensation is significant dps and usable group buffs. For shaman mitigation has completely nullified or reduced the effectiveness of every single attribute they bring to the group. That you think the only thing we share is SLOW just /boggles me to no end.<br />
<br />
Read the following slowly:<br />
<br />
Bst progression has far outpaced the progression of ANY melee based class into the realm of their caster counterpart. No one would pick a Paladin over a cleric for content requiring a cleric. Can a paladin act as primary healer ever? Yes - but the content has to be trivial. No one would pick a ranger over a druid for content requiring a druid. Now ... and this is simple ... groups do and some prefer to pick a bst over a shaman for content only a shaman should be required for. For that matter, groups do and some prefer to pick even an enchanter over a shaman for content only a shaman should be required for.<br />
<br />
Flip again ... No group would pick a cleric for a group position that a paladin is prefered for. A warrior or shadowknight, yes. But you don't pick a cleric for melee. Same can be said for ranger/druid - though less so. A druid can fill a dps role very well. A ranger will beat that dps to hell though, so if the choice is between the 2 for dps, the ranger is more likely to get the spot. Shaman are in the cleric zone here. No group is going to pick a shaman for dps.<br />
<br />
 ... is a well equipped shaman the norm? I think not.<br />
<br />
Yep, we are all nekkid and toothless. All other classes start out level 1 in time gear and 1000 aa. *** IS YOUR POINT HERE?!?!?!?!<br />

<br />
Shamans Legitimate complaints coem from the speed of encounters being pushed into ludicris speed. And Mitagation of slow when mobs can kill tanks faster than we can keep them healed before and sadly after we land slows. <br />
<br />
Take away some of the DPS. Allow us to actually remove the Proc damage from a mob reliably. and increase the hitpoints of the monsters in the current content and the extremly hard content of the past expansions and shaman would be rosey. <br />
<br />
If monsters are not hyper mudflated beyond sane means we wopuld be alot better off. But when slow lands in a perfect timing manuver. and I am spamming heals and a tank still dies. Then something is wrong. Either with the class or the content. <br />
<br />
A cleric should never be a requirement. I don't give a god damn about pretty much anything else. But when I am playing witht he tools gioven to me from the developers in current feasable content and playing in the top 98% of my ability then god damnit I should be successful On damn near any mundane encounter.  Flukes, problems, or the **** up fairy visiting should be common enough of margin of error to make the game challanging But when I am spot on and the content viable tank dies while I am at the helm and wouldnt die while a cleric is half watching TV then either the content or the god damn imbalances between classes need to be fixed.  <br />

Even if the classes are nearly equalized on healing, you will still want a cleric in GoD for 1)rezzes, 2) buffs, and 3) second healer that is needed in every trials.  <br />

We're just sick of getting locked out of the primary healer by a cleric and then watching the second healer ALSO needing to be a cleric.  It's just silly that any one class should be required to that extent.</div></div><hr />

Doomfires at the picnic tables in the Plane of Fire. With VP, Bane, Epic and other DD-less DoTs, apparently a shaman can take one of these down every six minutes for 14% AA each, which is faster than the rate you described above. I have not done it personally but I know people who have and I'm pretty sure it has been mentioned elsewhere on this board. Druids have real problems here because mobs are immune to fire. <br />
<br />
The point with shaman soloing is not that we are the best soloers. Bards can kite heaps of weaker mobs for loads of AAs. Druids can charm animals in certain zones and quad kite in others. Mages take mobs down through sheer DPS. Beastlords have great DPS and very mana efficient pet heals Necros have fear/agro kiting and life tap tanking. They all have different strengths. Shamans have root rot and slow tanking, although the later isn't viable at the uber high end. What does &quot;best&quot; mean anyway? There are mobs out there that one class can take down and others have no hope against. Just be glad that shaman are amongst them rather than unable to solo at all.<br />

How can you jump from the Paladin/Cleric and Druid/Ranger argument that cleric and druid are healing classes but shaman are &quot;just support class with minor healing abilities&quot;? Because that's what slow made us: we can reduce damage delt, thus we should not be clerics. It was the primary definition of the calss, it is still true and it shoulnd't change.<br />

I consider paladins as tank, cleric as healer, ranger as dps, druis as nuker/healers.

Shaman healing is a bottlencek: it cannot as good as it should be for us to be good healer in god, and it will never be. Thus why rejoicing over pathetic upgrades while clerics are still the end all be all healers is MOOT.<br />

Just taking this comment (and not the version of a game no one sees being played or defined as you do) I have to ask ... so now that Druids and Clerics are basically equal (if druids are given the healing upgrade you suggest) what .. do .. shaman .. bring .. to .. the .. show?<br />
<br />
Again: What will shaman bring to the show?<br />
<br />
Slow? Already been determined, decided, proven in game that beastlords are prefered for the other tools they bring. Even enchanters get the nob before shaman when a slower is the only need in a group.<br />
<br />
Try to critique all you want, but the real core at the ignorance of your posts is that you haven't clue ****ing one about shaman problems. You have zilch of an understanding, beyond your own presumptious self-deluding aggrogance, of the other classes you poorly attempt to define under of the guise of what you think or consider regarding them.<br />
<br />
That you play a shaman and have an opinion is one thing. That you play a shaman and are so totally clueless about the reality of the problems is another. Both of these are fine and I am perfectly willing to discuss our differences. I know that will never happen because you are lacking one simple requirement. Regardless of playing a shaman your posts highlight how little you know about the class. When you toss in your knowledge of other classes the cumulative IQ of the western hemisphere decreases exponentially.<br />
<br />
Believe what you will while the rest of us pray your ideas will never, ever filter into SOE where some jackass will pay attention to them. Keep them here where we know better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">My point was the following: shaman dont need healing upgrades, druids need CH to see there usefulness both in raids AND groups rise up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Give druids CH = Druids are now clerics with snare, SoW, Nukes, DoT's, invisibility (fixed and not fixed), and sharable mana regen.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, clerics still have res... I guess....<br />
<br />
CH should never be given to anyone but clerics.  Druids and Shaman do NOT NEED CH to be effective.  Druids already are on the verge of being plausable main healers for mitigating content.<br />
<br />
In GoD, the era in question, it is all about fast casting heals as well.  CH only heals 7500 base, you know, and is not affected by focuses.  There are a lot of heals in the cleric's book that are better suited to GoD content.<br />
<br />
Everywhere but those areas still see a lot of CH use.  CH will never ever ever ever ever be given to anyone but clerics, and I prefer it that way.<br />
<br />
Then they can give Shamans mez, and perhaps give Enchanters Warrior hp and ac while they are at it, heck, why not take every single hardcore bread and butter class ability and shift it to other classes to make them &quot;more raid viable.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't mean to sound offensive, but I think you would find more success in rerolling, to be frank.  Clerics lose a lot in exchange for CH.  People's anger towards them comes mostly from the fact that they are the gods of groups, and that you can get a tell for a group, be on your way, and get a tell &quot;NM, cleric left, group disbanded.&quot;<br />
<br />
Complaining that cleric's have monopoly on CH is like saying that Shaman have a monopoly on Turgur's and Enchanters have a monopoly on KEI... of course they do... it's one of their class specific spells.<br />

And Grafsha, I'd bet my root pants that Arctarus plays a druid main.  He is complaining about all shamans talking about is getting better heals when druids are the only other priest class and should get CH since cleric's have it and he wants it, and btw, stop envying clerics, all you shaman!<br />
<br />
Hehe.  You know, I have a druid friend who complains about druid group desirability ALL THE TIME... but you know what? He's ALWAYS soloing.  He's 65 unguilded with around 100 AA, crappy gear, no epic, and does nothing but complain.  I told him why he never tries putting his LFG flag up... he responded &quot;Because Druid's can't get groups.&quot;  I told him well, I have problems too, but at least turn it on while you solo and you'll get an invite eventually.  <br />
<br />
I know a necro who expresses the same attitudes and such.  This has no relation to anyone in boards necessarily, just something of which my memory seemed to just flow back for a second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Arctarus certainly has a point about dps.  <br />
<br />
Becoming less pathetic at healing is one thing, but doing a bit more dps is certainly important too.  <br />
<br />
I remember dropping ebolt on mobs and there was impact.  That was cool.  <br />
<br />
It was never cool buffing stat buffs, or redoing sow or all those crap jobs we used to have.  <br />
<br />
Slowing and dropping ebolt were just as big as healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Just taking this comment (and not the version of a game no one sees being played or defined as you do) I have to ask ... so now that Druids and Clerics are basically equal (if druids are given the healing upgrade you suggest) what .. do .. shaman .. bring .. to .. the .. show?<br />
<br />
Again: What will shaman bring to the show?<br />
<br />
Slow? Already been determined, decided, proven in game that beastlords are prefered for the other tools they bring. Even enchanters get the nob before shaman when a slower is the only need in a group.<br />
<br />
Try to critique all you want, but the real core at the ignorance of your posts is that you haven't clue ****ing one about shaman problems. You have zilch of an understanding, beyond your own presumptious self-deluding aggrogance, of the other classes you poorly attempt to define under of the guise of what you think or consider regarding them.<br />
<br />
That you play a shaman and have an opinion is one thing. That you play a shaman and are so totally clueless about the reality of the problems is another. Both of these are fine and I am perfectly willing to discuss our differences. I know that will never happen because you are lacking one simple requirement. Regardless of playing a shaman your posts highlight how little you know about the class. When you toss in your knowledge of other classes the cumulative IQ of the western hemisphere decreases exponentially.<br />
<br />
Believe what you will while the rest of us pray your ideas will never, ever filter into SOE where some jackass will pay attention to them. Keep them here where we know better.<br />
<br />
I'm devastated, 4 years of playing shaman and i have no clue.<br />
<br />
Mommy!<br />
<br />
personnal attacks as the only way to counter my arguments? that's pretty poor mr i wannabee a cleric.<br />
<br />
I dont play a druid main.. i play a shaman on Venril sathir server, log on, and /tell arctarus, maybe you'll try and find arguments instead of finding lame excuses since you have *nothing* to counter what i say.<br />
<br />
I can send you a picture of my played, picture of my char in 2000, i can link my magelo, i can make a list of what i do daily with ease, solo or group... but do i really need to do that?<br />
<br />
As far as i recall, you still fail to adress the fact that pathetic healing upgrades that we got are useless, and getting better heals would make us too powerful.<br />
<br />
It's been 2 pages i'm putting my arguments in front of you and i'm STILl waiting for something else than personnal attacks.<br />
<br />
i'm waiting, give me a clue, since i have none.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Arctarus, it's a brave or (more likely) really stupid person who accuses an entire community of people as being brainwashed.  Somehow I see you as the person standing in the middle of the desert, looking around, and saying, &quot;Damn it!  Everyone else is lost!  Freaking idiots!&quot;<br />
<br />
My personal opinion is that most shaman have accepted, or at least acquiesced, to the fact that we need to be a 3rd string healer.  Slow IS powerful.  Druids ought to heal a bit better than us.  Clerics much more so.  However, in GoD, we make a piss-poor emergency healer simply because our heals are so low in raw hp.  Even focused, outside of a crit, we often can't even keep a cleric alive if they get heal agro.<br />
<br />
So, even if you accept that our role has been relegated to that of an emergency healer, we DO NOT HAVE THE TOOLS TO DO THE JOB.<br />
<br />
Don't come crying back here to tell me, &quot;I saved a cleric once in BoT!&quot; or some crap to that effect.  If we get a quadding 1k mob on a cleric and slow bounced, they're F'd.  We have NO hope of keeping them alive.  Give us another 300 or so raw hp on our blast heal, and after all of our AAs and focus items, we're getting closer to a situation where we can keep them alive.  Sure, it doesn't sound like a lot, but I guarantee you it adds up when chaining heals.  500hp would be better, but I think that's asking for a bit much.<br />
<br />
Bottom line though, our heals have not been upgraded for content changes OR mitigation.  We have heals poorly based on a resistable spell to which mobs can have partial or complete immunity.  Now you think we shouldn't complain because people are okay in old content?  Do you think clerics or druids would be happy if their heals has a resist check, and in the presence of certain mobs, their heals were mitigated or simply did not work?<br />
<br />
Right now people are focused on what they see as the BIGGEST problem--healing.  Without healing the group dies.  That does NOT mean that crucible shaman haven't highlighted issues with dps as well.  Go look at the list submitted to SoE.<br />
<br />
What it does mean is that it's probably not a good idea to come ranting into a community and claiming that we are 'brain-washed&quot; and have narrow views whereas you, in your vast splendor, have the whole picture in mind.<br />
<br />
A little courtesy goes a long way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Gart - I agree - we do need some more DPS options, and I've got a thread running here to discuss them.<br />
<br />
Arc - I think I mentioned early in this thread that your opinion was in the minority in the Shaman community.  I believe that is being born out in this thread.  Perhaps you might consider re-evaluating your position instead of questioning others.  Either way, the information that is passed to the Devs will be what the majority feel is &quot;correct&quot;.  Whether that majority includes me, or you, is completely irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

Thats a hell of a lot of cancelled accounts isn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Just suppose, what if the majority are all wrong?<br />
<br />
As I said above, it doesn't matter.  It's totally irrelevant in this discussion.  We are talking about a game, and what makes it fun, not whether the world is flat.<br />
<br />
If a change the majority want will make the game &quot;fun&quot; for that majority, then it would be only logical to increase the enjoyment of the many.<br />
<br />
In the hypothetical, assume that everyone who was not with the majority cancelled their account, while the majority would cancel if their will was not followed.  Who do you listen to?<br />
<br />
If the changes that the community wants take Shaman to somewhere I don't want to be, fine.  I'll quit or re-roll or whatever.  The point is, right now, almost no one is happy with where Shaman are in the end game and it is important that the majority of end game Shaman are made happy.</div></div><hr />

Working slowly with you, Arc.<br />
<br />
Personally, as a shaman, I DO NOT want better heals. If I want better heals I will play a druid or a cleric. BTW - FYI - I do play both a druid and a cleric when the desire to do what those classes do is my preference for the day/time. When I play my shaman I want to bring shaman unique abilities to the game and I want those shaman unique abilities to be usable. I like slowing tough mobs. I like off tanking when needed. I like contributing effects that have ... an effect. I like being able to take a good group and making it a great group just with the tools and experience I bring.<br />
<br />
So, when you jump on your assumption bandwagon and call me &quot;mr i wannabee a cleric&quot; do yourself a favor and get your facts straight. Or find one place in all my posts on this thread where I made an argument to support increased shaman healing as a solution. Having eaten crow quite a few times in life, I have a taste for it. Point out my claim for better heals being the shaman solution I recommended in this thread so I can chow down.<br />
<br />
What do I want? Long fights. Slowable mobs. A healing base ability that allows me to be effective as a healer once I have brought the mob down to my level - when I need to be (cleric/druid dead.) But this has been taken from shaman. Faster fights, mitigating/unslowable mobs and a core base set of abilities that can not, no matter how good the shaman, be adapted to meet the new challenge.<br />
<br />
SOE word on that: not going to happen. Well if the game is not going to let shaman be shaman, it only follows that shaman have to be changed to find a new niche from which they can find useful group viability. Or go the way of the dodo.<br />
<br />
You never answered my question to you on this: so making druids and clerics basically equal healers leaves shaman where? What are your suggestions to improve shaman in the new-EQ encounter?<br />
<br />
As for lame arguments about your opinions - my argument was simply this: your version of what a class is or isn't in relation to the reality of what a class is or isn't are light-years apart. You made the connection between paly/cleric, druid/ranger and shaman/beastlord first. After connecting them you followed by saying they have nothing in common based on your opinion. I pointed out you clearly don't have enough real knowledge of each of the classes (either individually or collectively) to make an informed decision. Prove me wrong. Show how each of the counterpart classes is not really a counterpart.<br />
<br />
That you think slow is the only thing bsts/shaman share is a perfect example. Just look at the spell list. Focus on the ones that list SHM/BST. Do they share all abilities and spells? No-not all. Do the same with cleric/paladins and druid/rangers. Same thing. They do, however, share unique class abilities that are not shared by other classes which brings a commonality and cross over between them. Now - the key difference I pointed out regarding shaman/beast (and not occuring in druid/ranger or cleric/paladin) is that BST are the first melee based counterpart to reach the point of near equality compared to their caster &quot;parent&quot; in the &quot;parent&quot; core ability. Read **SLOW** here. (Not as in reading slow, but that BST are the first melee based counterpart to infringe upon a core caster ability and that ability is slowing.)<br />
<br />
That BST can slow damn near as well as shaman is damn silly.<br />
<br />
Moving on, where did this come from: &quot;As far as i recall, you still fail to adress the fact that pathetic healing upgrades that we got are useless, and getting better heals would make us too powerful.&quot;?<br />
<br />
As stated above (this post) healing as a shaman is the last thing I want to do for a primary group roll on a day to day basis. But since you brought it up ...<br />
<br />
Too powerful? How so? More powerful than clerics already are? What cleric doing top end doesn't find every encounter below that trivial based on what they bring to the group? Advancing shaman skill sets to significantly contribute to high end encounters (as they are currently being designed) causing them to be too unbalancing in trivial content is the stupidist counter-argument SOE has come up with. It already exists for too many other classes. For the most part, time equipped (even elemental level) shaman prove that lower content is trivial already, anyway. So giving shaman improved skills is going to make trivial more trivial and that is going to &quot;unbalance&quot; something? Give me a break.<br />
<br />
Arc, I have no idea how good of a shaman you are when played. Benefit of the doubt, I will grant that you are a good one. My targetting of your comments are simply this: what you are actually saying here goes against too many points already beat to death and &quot;agreed&quot; upon by too many active shaman. Perhaps the problem is in presentation. This all may boil down to the simple fact we are arguing the same points and have the same basic opinion. But what is written by you is not coming across that way. I am challenging what I am reading. What I am reading, and how it is written, is - and there is no nice way to put this - conceptually wrong.<br />
<br />
Lastly, this little tidbit: &quot;waiting for something else than personnal attacks&quot;<br />
<br />
Re-read your posts on this thread. In each you are extremely confrontational. Did you not expect feedback to deal with you in the manner in which you have approached others? When you state &quot;I think&quot; type comments and they are attached to points that clearly indicate that what you think has nothing whatsoever to do with actual facts do you think the rest of the board should just say, &quot;oh my, lets be collectively stupid and aggree to this!&quot;?<br />
<br />
I don't know if you have a problem explaining yourself in written form or if you actually just have a skewed and unrealisitic view of the game and classes in it. I do know the appearance is the skewed view. Then again, that is just my interpretation after reading what you post. Who knows, I may very well be the crazy one.</div></div><hr />
