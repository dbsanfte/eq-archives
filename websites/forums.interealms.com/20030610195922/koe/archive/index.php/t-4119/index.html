Excite@Home could unplug service Nov. 30 <br />
By Reuters <br />
November 27, 2001, 3:05 p.m. PT <br />
Bankrupt cable Internet access provider Excite@Home said on Tuesday it could cease providing service to its 4.1 million U.S. customers on Nov. 30 if it cannot renegotiate agreements with the cable companies that carry its service. <br />
Representatives of Redwood City, Calif.-based Excite@Home will appear in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco on Friday, where a judge will decide whether to have the service blocked if current negotiations fail, spokeswoman Stephanie Xavier said. <br />
&quot;It depends on the decision of the judge,'' she said. &quot;All I can say is we're in active negotiations with the cable companies. We're doing all that we can to maintain service.'' <br />
Xavier said many of the cable companies that carry Excite@Home have informed users that their service could cease after Nov. 30. <br />
&quot;They've been notifying them and giving them a heads-up,'' she said. <br />

Laters~</div></div><hr />

<br />
This really sucks, a lot of people are going to have to resort to Dialup for the time being with their cable service dead as of Nov 30th.<br />
<br />
Hope things work out for those that have it.</div></div><hr />

PITA switching email addies, etc...</div></div><hr />
