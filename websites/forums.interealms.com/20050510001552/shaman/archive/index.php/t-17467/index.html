<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, search don't work on COV.  I tried.<br />
<br />
I've gotten what I need from those giants in Kael.  Now I want to work on my Coldain shawls.  To do that I need to hunt in Western Wastes a bit.  Yeah, yeah, I could buy stuff too, but I don't want to.  Besides, I LIKED hunting WW back before I was KOS to COV.<br />
<br />
It would be SO much easier if I was again non-KOS to COV.<br />
<br />
I know it wouldn't be too hard if I just participated in a few Tormax/Vindi hits, but I can't schedule those.  What's the bestest, fastest way to improve COV faction that I could do solo or duo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">kael arena, can be solo'd and is the best hit possible; just try not to get more than one at a time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tormax doesn't give CoV but Yeli/dain if I remember correctly.  Vindi's CoV hit is good, but nothing exceptional, you get more faction from just the clearing I'd presume.<br />
I found the best faction camp is running the Riff cycle over and over, normal 65 group can do one cycle per respawn, good one 2.  And you might get lucky on a couple of Velious BP/legs for mq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depending on your server prices, you may be better off not worrying about increasing your CoV and buying the items from the bazaar.  It may take you less time to farm plat and buy them then it does to fix your faction and then go farm them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh and Vindi's guards and the PoZs give faction hits close to vindi.  I was max kos and had 3 vindi, 2 statue and 2 AoW hits and was still kos.  when I did factioning with a bunch of 65's we pulled all his guards and pozs and it didnt take long to become likable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kael arena and other shawl events got me to max ally.  Like an idiot, I started off soloing the giants at the fort in GD until I figured out I was going NOWHERE.  So, I spent awhile in Kael arena then an 8th shawl event finished me off.  I think the figure of 30 hours to max ally is an accurate approximation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You say you're going to work on your shawls.  How far are you now?<br />
<br />
If you're serious about going all the way to 8, you are going to need dire wolf whiskers for #6.  And these things can be really really rare (streaky RNG).<br />
<br />
I'd suggest farming GD dire wolves until you get 4 whiskers.  At the same time, save giant heads and toes (since you'll need them for shawls 1 and 2).  Once you have your 4 whiskers, see where your faction is.  Odds are you'll be non-KOS.  It will take that many wolves if you're as unlucky as I am.<br />
<br />
And dogdog can tear through the wolves -- load a low level nuke to pull and let him tank away.  Can give him a couple of those velium weapons the giants have for added dps. :)<br />
<br />
If you are still KOS, then the arena is a good option.  Another option is to buy up a bunch of giant helms and turn them in for COV faction bumps in Skyshrine.  If you kill a few dorfs in ThurgB first and get the amulet with faction modifier first, you may be able to get high enough to do turn ins.  If not, get a chanter friend to go with you, pull him to the zone and root -- and zone out.  Have your chanter friend pacify him, now you can stand just inside turn-in range without him attacking.  Give him 4 helms but don't click yet -- have the chanter invis you first, now click and you should get the 4 faction hits.  Helms are a nice bump, a couple backpacks full should be enough to get you to dubious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I recently collected SIX whiskers in under an hour with 2 friends.  It was simple.  Druid used track while I used Sense Animal.  Enchanter looted the whiskers &amp; every now &amp; then was able to toss a nuke.  Center your hunting near the spires and you will have your whiskers (&amp; some faction hits, though small) in no time using our oft-forgotten Sense Animal spell.<br />
<br />
Kael Arena/plate room &amp; adjacent areas would be my best recommendations for raising CoV.  Best of luck. :cool:  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Frekkels, I think you got a bit lucky, although the Sense Animal suggestion is good if you don't have a tracker.  <br />
<br />
I failed on the 6th shawl combine 3 times, so I spent a lot of time in GD looking for whiskers.  Sometimes it wasn't bad, but one time I spent 4 hours looking.  It's just RNG stuff.  <br />
<br />
Twoflower, I really wouldn't kill myself on CoV faction.  The only item you need in WW are velium hound furs.  You can buy them in the bazaar for 325-450pp each on my server.  You need a minimum of 8 of them.  You can kill in WW without faction but it clearly is risky business.  I just would think twice about spending that time on faction just for furs.  <br />
<br />
I did move from rock bottom KOS to threateningly by the time I got to Shawl 7 - primarily by slaughtering wolves/giants in GD for the Shawl, but there was also a vindi/AoW hit in there (No statue, go figure).  There are huge timesinks in the shawl quest as it is, I'm not sure I'd let that be one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh, the giant fingers and helms, keep those and turn those in at SS, also.  They might get half a faction point for all I know but at least that's half a faction point you don't have to kill those stinkin' giants to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The fastet way is to keep killing stuff, preferably in a group for faster kills in Kael Arena.<br />
<br />
Look out for guilds doing raids there and offer to help with buffing/slowing to get a faction hit from their mobs.<br />
<br />
Keep any warrior helmets also, when youre not KoS, you can turn them in for faction in SS.<br />
<br />
As others have stated, CoV isnt really worth the time raising when dont need the armor from ToV, but its your call.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem isn't that I'm KOS to Coldain, it's that I'm KOS to dragons in WW, where I need to hunt Velium Hound Furs for the 8th shawl.  But really I want to be able to hunt in WW ever after I get my hound furs, I like WW when I'm not KOS to COV, and it makes it easier to hunt wyverns in CS for gems and tailoring hides when you're not KOS to them until you attack (wyverns in CS are on COV faction but have no faction hits).<br />
<br />
I'm working on the seventh shawl now, all tradeskills where they need to be for that although my Magelo doesn't reflect it yet, have geerloks for everything.  I failed my Burin combine so I'm back to Cobalt Scar for another Moktor Hide and swordfish tooth.  Last tradeskill is going to be smithing for the 8th shawl, smithing is only 120ish atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">After tagging along a general walk doing spot heals and what not, I had gone from apprehensive to kindly with the Coldain.  Perhaps the COV faction hit was just as good?  Worth a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keyline Wintermystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Looking for a way to increase the good CoV faction?  Might try a couple of different quests in WL and WW.  The WL quests i believe involve the mercenarys along the right side heading from Kael to SS.  Supposedly they have a better faction hit then hunting inside Kael or turning in helms and toes.<br />
<br />
The other is in WW and involves the Poachers there.  Think you need to kill 4 of them and turn in heads in SS.  Would have to read up on quests at Allahs website.<br />
<br />
Couple of suggestions for ya, plus you will  be hunting in these zones for drops while collecting components for your shawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>grootz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you hear of a 10th rinqwar going on, just zone into GD and tag every giant you can.  Its a lot of fun too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't really care to be ally COV or anything, I just want to be non-KOS.  So unless there's a SS quest I can do while KOS, it's not helpful to me.  Giant helmets while charming mobs etc.... just too much work, lol.  Kael arena sounds easier.<br />
<br />
I just helped a guildmate do a 10th ringwar and I did get a lot of hits, but I'm still &quot;ready to attack&quot; with COV.  I have participated in several 8th shawl walks and while the Kromrif hits are pretty significant, the COV hits don't seem to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Avator of war, Vindi, Statue raid is best bet for CoV faction, it took 3 raid trip to fixed CoV faction from ready to attack(cannot be any worse) to doubt(non kos), <br />
<br />
Kael Arena gives much better CoV faction hits then GD fort and Ring 10, plus <br />
chance to drop some TG armor for MQ twinks<br />
<br />
WL geonids also good source for shawl 8 quest gems without CoV faction</div></div><hr />
