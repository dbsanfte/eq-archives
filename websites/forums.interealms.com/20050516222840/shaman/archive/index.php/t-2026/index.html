<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got bored with FG shrooms /yawn and headed off to HS for the first time ever with my 60 barb shaman (no malo torpor) and a 56 monk partner.<br />
<br />
First, off the entrance was a cakewalk, had up to 5 mobs slowed on me queued to die, I did this to stop runners. The monk died once chasing a runner, he fell off the east stairs then ran into a room with about 5 caster skels. (we didn't know about portal backup) After a nasty CR he ate the xp loss and was not happy.<br />
<br />
Couple of questions...<br />
<br />
I see quite a few rogues go by is it worth me asking them to get me access to south wing for named mobs? I don't mind spending weeks past the south door if the xp is good and we can handle some named. We have duoed a ton of mid 50s mobs with relative ease so I'm hoping the named won't prove to much of a problem?<br />
<br />
Also, if I get past the south door how easy is it to get a key back to entrance?<br />
<br />
Any advice would be much appreciated as another full death xp loss would be no fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not gonna count myself as an expert on hs, i always hated it :) too easy mobs, but i dont think one door would do it, you'd be stuck inside :) or rather, mr monk would be.<br />
other than that, i think it's doable for a good monk/shm duo, prepare to eat ht's tho, so i'd get torpor! :) (sell your gramma car and and house if needed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">surprisingly HS is the best experience zone in the game.  South wing = godly<br />
<br />
torpor is a good thing cuz pulling rooms with 4-5 ht's possible is a bitch.  If ya cant get torpor, then have a cleric with your group to cast CE just before pulls.  Also in south wing there is a coin that spawns on the ground you can have yourself 1 charge of clarity.  Helps things go a tiny bit faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well you can get keys to all the doors but there is a problem - they are no rent. One tactic you could try is bind outside in the safe spot and after you get the keys, duel the monk. You would have keys for at least a week then. The keys are on the ground at the end of each wing basically I think except the first which comes off a sperm, the candle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I love HS.  I've spent untold hours there, in all the wings.<br />
<br />
There are, and have been, rumors of a master key quest with a key that isn't 'no rent', but either no one has figured it out yet or (more likely) it's not working.<br />
<br />
Yes, the entrance is cakewalk, no question.  <br />
<br />
For those of you interested, this is a quick spoiler--and I'm doing this from memory, so please excuse all the mistakes.  In each wing, the mobs get a little harder.  The dungeon is designed as a crawl (or you can use a rogue to pick the locks as you noted).  You kill a sperm up top or in the basement, and it will always drop a candle.  One quick note on the wings (edited since I didn't think my post was clear):  there are 2 keys in each wing except the east--one is a ground spawn and opens the door to the 'boss's' room, and then the boss will drop the key to the next wing.<br />
<br />
The candle is the key to the north wing.  One of the rooms in this wing has a ground spawn (broach) to open a door where the 'boss' mob spawns.  I think the 'boss' for the north wing is the crypt keeper (easy kill, just a named, not really a 'boss' mob).  The keeper has a placeholder, so it may take several clearings to get him to spawn.  I believe one of his drops is the calendar.  The calendar is the key to the west wing.  Generally, any no-rent item will be a key for one of the wings.  The keeper spawns on the platform or dias with the sparkles (you'll know it if you see it).  In a side room, just to the right of that dias, is a porter back to the entrance.<br />
<br />
The calendar should open the west wing.  Actually, there are 2 groundspawns in this wing.  One is a claw of some sort and the claw is a 4 spot container (thought to be part of the broken master key quest).  The claw is NOT the key to the back part of this wing.  Keep looking in the rooms before you drop down the stairs.  I think the groundspawn key for this wing is a coin.  You can get back up the drop-down with levitate, but it's annoying.  :)  Also, the keyholder (I forgot which spawn) has a placeholder, so it may take a while.  The keyholder spawns in the room with the porter back to the entrance.  I believe the actual key is a broken dagger or dirk (again, no rent).<br />
<br />
The dagger opens the south wing.  South is great for exp and pretty good for drops.  I have yet to find a way to get through the south wing to the east without a rogue.  Unfortunately, the portal out of the zone is also on the other side of the rogue locked door to the east wing.<br />
<br />
At the entrance, the east wing stairs are an illusion.  Don't stand on them, or you will fall.  There are only 2 ways to get across to the east wing--either through the south wing, or by dueling someone with grav flux, getting knocked onto the ledge over the entrance, and levitating down to the east wing platform.  The east wing door is not locked.<br />
<br />
In each wing, there is a trapped rug that drops to the basement.  If you don't know which rug it is, just stay off all of them.  If you have a rogue let you into a wing, these drops are a good way to get back to the entrance.  I have a druid twink that I park at the entrance if I duo with a melee.  We fight in the wing of our choice, then drop to the basement and fight back to the entrance.  Then I can log in my porter and get the melee out (if you don't have a druid or wizzie in the group, or the tanks don't have a gate potion or overthere hammer).<br />
<br />
CRs suck in HS.  They suck badly.  You will need either a rogue or a necro (or SK) for a CR in a wing.  I would NOT recommend duo'ing with a tank in the south or the east wing.  Even with careful pulling, you may get a train of 5-6 (there are some fake walls and things agro easily).  Most of the mobs in south and east wings have a HT.  (At least 50% and probably 70%).  The HTs in the south wing hit as high as 701 I believe.  Six of those will take out most classes.  Three of those are usually enough to get low HP agro on a self-buffed shaman, at which point you won't channel through 4+ mobs and you are dead.<br />
<br />
HS is a GREAT spot for a group though, especially the south and east wings.  I'd take a chanter to the east wing.  You can get by without a chanter in any of the other wings.<br />
<br />
Trains of 7-8 are not uncommon in the east wing.  Drusella (who is easy to kill) has a number of mobs in her room who are tougher than she is.  Don't try her without a good group.  :)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Now maybe my map is out of date and things have been changed but also in HS is a named spawn called The Golem Master.<br />
Unless youre there with a solid group you may want to avoid this guy like the plague as he procs (yes procs not casts) Ice Comet.<br />
Also his drops are junk if my map is still accurate (and its been 99% right so far).Just a heads up on this one particular mob.<br />
I havent ventured to the East wing yet myself but have spent plenty of time killing in North West and South lvl 60 can usually single pull all day there tho when the nameds do pop they tend to bring a friend with them so be ready to eat at least 2 HTs depending.If i recall right the north wing was easiest but also mroe then a fair share of lt blue mobs and a few greenies even.<br />
North and west seemed to be almost identical level wise for mobs and HTs were generally are 541pts South wing gets much more painful tho.<br />
Had a named HT me for 741 or 761 and on average looking around 701 per HT.Worst I had was the crypt spectre and a sepulcher skele pull HT 701 HT 741 (or 761) lifetapped for 200 immediatly after.<br />
Losing 1600plus HPs before you even make it back to camp is always fun =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khervek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Golem master doesnt proc Ice comet .  He is easy to kill.  The hardest mob of the place is Drusella and she aint even hard if you have someone who knows how to pull her room.<br />
<br />
The key for the door at the end of the south wing (to get to zone out or east) is the clarity coin wich spawn on the foor of one of the rooms.<br />
<br />
I keep a corpse with the keys to west and south wing so that i dont need a rogue because the named that drop the keys are pretty rare.   We spent hours killing the North wing boss without seeing him pop once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heck.  I went back and read the original post and didn't really answer the question.  :/<br />
<br />
With the exception of the north wing (key is a candle and drops off all sperm), no key to the wing you are in will drop from a mob in that wing.  The dungeon was designed to be sequential--the prior wing has the key to the next wing.<br />
<br />
If you get a rogue to let you into the south wing, the only way to get out is to drop through the rug trap into the basement and fight out that way.  The North, West, and South wings also have drop-offs with a 1-way wall shortly after you enter them.<br />
<br />
Again, you can get out by going through the pit to the basement, but the only way to get back into those wings is with a rogue or by camping the key.<br />
<br />
Corpse recoveries REALLY suck.  Since there is a 1-way drop in each wing, and the no rent key (if you have one) will stay on the corpse, the only way to get your body is by summoning, or by having a rogue try to sneak in and drag your corpse into the basement through the rug pit trap.  I don't think you should try duoing south, especially without torpor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the map, Wildaar.  :)<br />
<br />
Two quick things about the map for those of you not familiar with the zone.  First, the map is orientated incorrectly.  North is to the right.  The south wing is shown to the left side of the zone in, and east and west are bottom and top respectively.  Also, only the green circles in the east and south wings take you out of the zone, I believe.  All the other 'exits' take you back to the yellow zone-in at the center of the map.<br />
<br />
Wildaar, just for my info, where in the south wing does the key drop for the door to the exit?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">South Wing has the clarity coin. That Opens the door to the exit room. (Or a thief will)<br />
<br />
Once in that room Face the teleportal thingy. To your left on the ledge is a fake wall. Follow that around till you get to a small ramp. At the top of the ramp is a fake (ONE WAY!!!! WARNING) wall that leads beyond the door to east wing. The key is not required for east. (You cannot get throught the door anyways the steps to east are fake) (Yes you can grav flux across but that is cheesy)<br />
<br />
If you want to have a safe place to camp past the door to South wing is an okay camp spot. (Up top, the first  door that is.) Of course breaking the room hurts.<br />
<br />
Another good camp spot is past the fake wall in south that leads to east. There is a wanderer there but is a single and most of the time seems to be a sperm. (But it can be a Specter for 701 pain) If you get into trouble you can just Zone out in that room area too with the zone out portal pad.<br />
<br />
Have fun<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">you see 'B' on the map? Just above it is a door, then through that door and to the left (first door) is where the coin is.  Spawns every 12 minutes I think.  There are also 4 mobs in that room and 1 hall roamer.  In 'B' there are 5 mobs and a roamer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you are a duo with a monk i would recommend North wing (camp entrance till u get a spermy to pop and loot a candle, shouldn't take long).  Candle is key to north wing. <br />
<br />
OR I would suggest you drop down and duo in the lower area.  It's much easier to hunt down there without snare, since mobs don't run into horrible areas and you can pick a nice camp spot and basically pull at will.  If you're debating Entrance camping, you might as well be killing down below.  Overall it's much safer.  Also if you want to return to the entrance there is a pad you step on in the middle of the big room down there that ports u up top.  This can be handy for escaping a nasty train as well, tho you'll still have to deal with any roamers up top.  Lower entrance is very easy however, and you should be able to grind out exp very nicely.  <br />
<br />
I was just in HS all day yesterday with a group.  We did South, East, and West wings.  Of them, East is the hardest, South being next, West, and then North being easiest.  West is interesting, but you'll need a rogue to get to the named, also will need levi to pull some of the place.  The pit trap is located at the best camp site for the area, might present a problem.  You'll need a rogue to camp here tho. <br />
<br />
If you want a small group I'd suggest getting a rogue to add to your duo and go to south wing.  There is an easily accessible (for level 60 single pullers anyhow) exit from the zone to OT in that wing.  <br />
Or if yer a master alchemist, you can whip up a gate potion for your melee buddy and stay at the entr.  Or have him make his own thurg potions.  Whichever is easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In south wing, above the B at that rectangular hallway is the best place for a duo or trio to camp and pull mobs to.  There is one static mob and one roamer there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm looks like shm/mnk duo isnt going to cut it in south wing, I will try north or underneath platform as suggested, it seems safer. Safe XP is the main aim, some loot would be just an extra benefit that may put me one step closer to torpor /sigh. Only thing I worry about is runners, hence why I pull 2-3 at a time. (I knew I shouldn't have switched from troll to barb as a noob...bleh) These mobs really hit like puppies even with only 930ish AC the shaman can tank for ages without much HP loss :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for advice, I usually logged in to find entrance camped now I know I can do North or pit without any other help it gives me some options :)<br />
<br />
HS round 2 coming up...</div></div><hr />
