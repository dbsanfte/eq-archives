<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durfenity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so w. t. f. up with drop rate?<br />
<br />
i dont have malo or torpor myself and i dont wanna pay 50k on malo, 100k on torpor, im not in uber guild. 60th monk partner and I killed 17 Guardian Wurms, yes 17, none of them drop shaman spell, not even tigir, not even greater bear form, avatar, poxx, malo, torpor, nothing! even they arnt dropping any 1k+ worth spell, (well, it did drop 1, but w. t. f., 1? 1!?!?! only 5k ish worth, wind of genil, however u spell, lvl 60 wiz spell AE).<br />
<br />
so i have question for you all, how many Guardian Wurm kills does it take until malo (or) torpor to drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Got Malo on 5th wurm I killed. Got Talisman of serpent on 40th one.. <br />
<br />
Killed 50 or so in all, first 2 times with 2 groups /gasp. next few times with single groups. last 30 or so have been groups of 2-4 all 60's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got Torpor while hunting them.  Malo dropped when one was foolish enough to attack me as I was buffing up a friend's Ragefire raid.  Not quite 57 yet.  Need Raptor, Avatar, Tigir's, Pox, and grp focus/acumen.  Not bad.  I refuse to buy spells, so I routinely camp where they drop.  XP isn't as good overall, but when I think I've just saved 60k on Torpor and 30k on Malo... I'm content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">DUH Shandy.  ANSWER THE QUESTION.<br />
<br />
About a dozen for Torpor.   Maybe 3 more later.  And then came back to SF 2 weeks later and got Malo.  Getting lucky with spell drops, and no luck with farming smithing components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To answer your question, it could be the first one, it could be the 1000th.  Spell drops are random, and rare.  Luck is your only chance really.  Patience too I guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Killed about 30 or so and never got a single shaman spell.  Oh wait, I can't post here, I never got Torpor or Malo from a GW. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We killed about a dozen so far and no shaman spells.<br />
<br />
So far I dont have<br />
VoB<br />
Pox<br />
Malo<br />
Torpor<br />
<br />
sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">17 gwurms is nothing,my guild killed 100+ while camping Ragefire.We did get a few good shammy spells,torpor and malo at least,heard of other torpor drops off gwurms.....<br />
<br />
Keep trying</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I obtained Torpor from a Guardian Wurm -- he was somewhere around the 30th we killed.  <br />
<br />
We hunted them daily for two weeks, and while they droppped many spells they rarely dropped a shaman spell (and when they did it was the ever popular talisman of the serpent - woot).  It did eventually give up Torpor, though, which was nice.  We also got about 93 million wizard/magician spells, which stocked our guild bank nicely.  <br />
<br />
I got Pox Of Bertox and Talisman of the Raptor from Talendor (our guild alliance killed him for the first time ever for us a few days ago).  <br />
<br />
I plan to continue hunting Guardian Wurms for Avatar, Voice Of The Berserker, and Malo.  I really, really, really want Voice Of The Berserker.  Huntin in SkyFire is less than appealing, and forcing the GWs to pop by killing the elders is extremely boring, but its much better than paying hundreds of thousands of pp for spells.<br />
<br />
I'd really like to find group acumen, too, but that seems to be a really elusive spell for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lelandpain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have killed well over 200 of them with no Malo or Torpor.  I payed 68k for Malo.  That is a good price on Brell.  It norm sells for 100k.  Have yet to see Torpor for sell in the bazaar or from anyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sateeva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've killed over 75 with various groups and no torpor. Did get Malo and VoB but the ever elusive torpor won't drop. :(<br />
<br />
What a hoot! The Guardain's now con blue at 61. We talking some serious under-con there!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Glaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A group I had last night killed around eight of them. I got avatar off the second GW and Malo off one of the last ones we killed.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough we killed an old wurm and he dropped a defiance and FS weapon. Guess that was dire charm + project alpha in action there as there was a 60 ench at VP before we moved there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sows McBuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i can't fathom how you people succomb to paying 50k for malo, 100k for torpor...saw malo for 25-30, torpor about the same this morning in bazaar...is my server just not as insane about spell prices? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Different servers have quite different price ranges, yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Torpor dropped on the 1st Guardian Wurm if I recall but I didn't need it since I bought it a few levels earlier cheap (like 6k).  The 3rd or 4th Guardian Wurm dropped Malo which I did need.  This was done after a Ragefire kill.  Guild friends pulled them and we killed them.  I haven't killed a Guaridan Wurm since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mukguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was helping kill Ragefire last night ( on my paladin) and a copy of malo dropped, when we pulled a guardian, before we killed rage. I won it for my guild. :)</div></div><hr />

I'm still trying to get Torpor, VotB, Raptor, and Pox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sshiverr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My guild has killed between 50 and a hundred Guardian Wurms and only one of them dropped malo which another guild shaman got.   However last nite we killed the named green dragon in EJ to get a guild warrior the scale for the shaman epic and he dropped Pox, Malo, AND Torpor.   I got Malo and Torpor being the only guild shaman there and 54 shaman applicant to the guild got pox and then gave it to me for nothing saying it would be a while before he would need it.    Must have been my lucky nite.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zugzub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ive been trying to camp Gwurms last couple days with no luck. I got a few questions about camping Gwurms that would really help me out. For one, how many people at the least amount of people can kill Gwurms and how do you get them to spawn?<br />
<br />
Any help would be great, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well,<br />
<br />
1) How Many People<br />
<br />
That depends on the poeple.  I've done it with one shaman, one cleric, and one warrior.  Generally it is nice to have a ranger or monk to pull, and an extra melee class can be helpful.  If your group is all &lt;55, get more people.  If your group is all 60s, you need less people to accomplish the same goal.<br />
<br />
2) Spawning<br />
<br />
They usually spawn at VP.  If you kill the 4 elder wyverns there, the next spawn may be an elder wyvern or a guardian worm.  Sometimes they seem to spawn out in the zone, but I'm not sure what triggers that.  Usually the best approach is to zone in with a tracker, find them, kill them, and zone out.  You can try forcing the spawn, but its awfully boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zugzub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ahh ok thanks, i been running around zone killing named wurms to try to pop them, Also had group at VP ent killing elders but no Gwurms poped. Guess ill keep trying it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">While finishing up a cleric epic, we got Malo (I already had it) to drop off a GW the other day this was one of the wandering ones.  I have done the forced spawn by killing Elder wyverns ( collecting cleric shards ) and the spawn rate wasn't that bad. Group was all level 60s  and enchanter a wizard a druid a cleric and myself, I tanked using DoTs to keep agro. We got about 1 an hour maybe a little faster. I did get Avatar from that. I seem to get alot of Enchanter and Mage spells from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zugzub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">People saying they killed 50+ Gwurms and what not, I have been back and forth in Skyfire killig elders at VP ent for up to 4 hours and not see 1 friggan Gwurm. So by saying you killed 50+ does that mean 50+ within a day,week,month? This really starting to frustrate me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The guardian wurm spawns are fairly unpredictable.  I've fought for as long as three hours without seeing one, and I've also fought for as little as 30 minutes and seen five.  It really seems to be VERY random.<br />
<br />
It is frustrating, I agree.  I think every level 60 to 65 mob should drop high level spells, not just the 2 or 3 that currently do.</div></div><hr />
