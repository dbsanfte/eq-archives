<br />
I am having some trouble with my Hard drive. I was orginally running Win ME and decided that it just sucked bad. I really like Win 98 SE and am going to install it. Now I know that you cant go &quot;backwards&quot; with Windows. So I have to format and start anew which is fine with me that way I can get rid of the bugs and lost chains. <br />
I have a Maxtor Hard Drive. I went to their website and downloaded the low lvl format to make sure I got everything. Once I installed the program and went ahead and started the low lvl format. Well after 30 mins and getting nothing back I firgured that my computer had froze in DOS. So I rebooted. Without a startup disk in. Well sure enough there was no operating system installed which is good now. So I went ahead and Put my startup disk (win 98 SE) and CD-rom and changed my BIOS to Boot A:/CD-Rom/C: that way it would read the disk first. Everything was fine it read it perfectly. It brought me to the 3 choose of starting with or without cd-rom support. I chose with cd-rom support. <br />
Once I did this it did a quick test and noted that I needed to run a Fdisk. So I went ahead and did that and picked the first chose which was partitioning the DOS, which I thought was the right chose. It went ahead and did and made the corrections. Then I went back and did a Setup with the A: drive. Well at that point it said that everything was loaded correctly on the D: and then a few lines down I noted that it had some stuff on E: to. <br />
Which I know that Win XP uses the E: to store some stuff and thats what you use to startup the program. <br />
So I went ahead and at A; typed in setup and it went ahead and did a scan register readding both A: and Cd-Rom drives. Then I get a message saying Windows requires 734 then it stops, with the A: drive light still going but not doing anything. <br />
So I reboot and try again this time it does the same thing but finishs what it was tring to say the first time. Windows requires 734003 of space.<br />
So I tried to use the e: to get a setup going and even tried without cdrom support and changed the bios to diffrent settings but still getting the same messages. <br />
Does anyone know what I am doing wrong? I only have my video card in nothing else. <br />
Well thats about it. Thanks for the help and sorry for any typos I tend to think faster then I can type. ;)<br />
<br />
EDIT: I did try to use the orginally win 98 cdrom then tried win 98 SE because I know I have to show taht I have the orginal disk and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Screeling</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice would be to re-run the FDISK and then reformat it. When you run the FDisk, erase the current partitions and specify new ones. This is pretty easy to figure out too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tegwedar</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which Partitions should I use? Or should I not pick any? I cant remeber off hand what my options were when the list came up. I know the first one is DOS.<br />
I also had alittle trouble getting to the c: prompt like it did reconize it, but then again I did change the BIOS startup and it does go in loops.. hmmmmm... Headache!!<br />
Also.....<br />
&lt;Cough&gt;  /whisper what is the command for formatting the c: again? I think I will use that then the low lvl format. &lt;cough&gt;<br />
HELP!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimirr</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Run fdisk.  Delete ALL partitions.  Create a new, single partition that uses all of the hard drive's space.  Reboot.<br />
<br />
Run the Windows setup from floppy.  Just after initializing the CDRom it will tell you that you have unformatted space, and will ask if you wish to format it.  Say yes.  Install Windows, and you should be all set.</div></div><hr />

I hope my C: was just goofing around and didn't show because of the BIOS startup I had configured.</div></div><hr />
