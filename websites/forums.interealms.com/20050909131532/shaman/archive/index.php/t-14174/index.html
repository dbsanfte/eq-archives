<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys I recently put a new computer together and im having some problems i hope you can help me with. Had an old 633 celeron with a 32 bit gforce so i got some parts &lt;from new egg of course&gt; and went to work. here is the rundown of what i have.<br />
<br />
msi 655 chipset motherboard<br />
<br />
2.4 gig pentium northwood processor<br />
<br />
msi geforce 4 4200 8x agp vid card<br />
<br />
256 megs of simpletech pc2100 ddr ram and 256megs of pny pc2100 ddr<br />
<br />
western digital 40 gig hd  and the 15 gig fireball hd from my old machine <br />
beside the cpu fan there are 3 fans 1 set up as an exhaust and the main<br />
hd has a cooling fan fixed on it.<br />
<br />
400 watt mustang power supply<br />
<br />
Now when i got it up and running it ran eq with the only problem being<br />
there seemed to be lag every 6 or so seconds. didnt matter where i was the 6 sec lag happenend.<br />
a friend in game tried helping me out. he told me to change the resolution to 1024/768 which i did then change the bits per pixel to 32 which i also did. then he wanted me to change the refresh rate but i didnt have that option all it said was default. after i did theses things the lag was still there. then after about 5 min of playing the screen just froze and i had to reboot. when i ran eq again, after the patcher ran and i clicked play, my screen just went blank and turned off like it was in standby mode. I hit spacebar and the monitor came back on but no eq login screen. ran the patcher again same problem. reboot ran the patcher same problem. went into eq client changed the settings to how they were before and the problem is still there. so now im at a loss. <br />
all the videocard drivers have been updated prior to the problem also.<br />
so anyone have any ideas?<br />
also the computer as a whole isnt as fast as its supposed to be. should i flash the bios? And if so how do i do it?<br />
Thank in advance all<br />

<br />
I had a smiliar problem on my PC.  Did you try to change the refresh rate from properties? or did you just try in game from options?<br />
<br />
If you already haven't tried this, here is what i suggest.<br />
<br />
right mouse button on desktop -&gt; properties -&gt; settings -&gt; advanced -&gt; adapter<br />
there should be a dropbox with a refresh rate with several options.<br />
<br />
Some video cards also allow you to change the refresh rate until a different menu, ie for mine, it is under a &quot;Display Mode&quot; tab, which offers me more choices than under &quot;Adapter&quot;.<br />
<br />
Try changing it to various ones to see what happens. At lower refresh <br />
rates, you may notice a flicker, but it may stop the problem.<br />
You can also look in your monitor manual to see what your optimal rate is.  As you dont want to set it to high or you could seriously damage your monitor.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps ya out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iohki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Another thing,  Flashing your bios: Do you need to do it or not, I would have to really hear more of the problem.  I will post steps to flashing it, but remember THE WRONG BIOS FLASH CAN RESULT IN A DEAD MOBO.   Just a word of caution there.  <br />
<br />
A BIOS flash should only be done if you are having system problems, or are using equipment which the current BIOS does not support and flashing the BIOS would support the new hardware. The age-old motto is: &quot;if it isn't broke, don't fix it.&quot; right? lol i seem to follow this always but in one way or another end up breakin stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Identifying your motherboard model number and BIOS version are the key things in determining your BIOS flash needs. When you first get a POSTing on your screen, you will see a set of numbers and BIOS date in the left hand corner. Identify your BIOS version and date, and write them down on a piece of paper. Make sure you check yourself twice, as this is a very important thing. Sometimes the screen does go by pretty quickly, so you might have to restart it a couple of times to get it right. Take your time and get the exact details needed to ensure a successful mission<br />
<br />
Find your manufacturer's Web site, and go to the drivers section of the site. This is found most commonly under the support section, but can also be found on the motherboard information page. Motherboard HomeWorld will also have BIOS updates available for download. Some sites, such as MSI, have an auto-update program that does this for you. If your site doesn't offer this, you will have to do it manually. Locate your motherboard and download the Phoenix BIOS 4.0 or the AWARD FLASH EXE program from the site. It is usually in the same place as the BIOS upgrade bin file, and can be found with a little searching of the site. Then you need to find the most current BIOS for your make of motherboard and download it. This is most likely to be a zipped up bin file that needs to be unzipped before you can use it. Once again, make very sure you are getting the BIOS update bin file for your exact motherboard. Download these two files to your system and you are ready to move on to the next bit.<br />
Go into your control panel, then go into Add/Remove Programs, and you will see a tab saying &quot;Startup Disk&quot;. Get a formatted 1.44 floppy and put it into the floppy drive. If the disk is not formatted do so at this time. Create a startup disk within this screen; it is the choice on the far right. After you make a boot disk, find the Phoenix BIOS 4.0, Release 6.1 or the AWD FLASH EXE and copy it onto the boot disk. Find your new BIOS and unzip or extract the new file to the boot disk. This will create a bin file, and it is the actual data for the BIOS Flash. Sometimes the disk will say it is full. If this happens, you can remove these files to free up space on the disk. The following files can be removed from the disk: FDISK, FORMAT and MSCDEX. These are files that are not used or needed in the BIOS flash procedure, so removing them will have no effect on the task at hand. You should also write on a piece of paper the new updated BIOS name. You will need it later in step 4. After all files are successfully extracted, unzipped, and copied on to the start up disk, restart your system with the boot disk inserted into the floppy drive. If your system does not boot to the floppy, you will need to go into your BIOS and change your boot sequence to search for a floppy drive and make the floppy the first boot device. This will enable the floppy to read the boot disk at startup.<br />
<br />
Once your system boots to the Windows Options screen after reading the floppy disk, hit the F5 key and this will bring you to the A: prompt. Type &quot;Dir&quot; (this is a DOS command meaning show the directory) in the chosen drive or file you wish to read. This will show you all the files on the boot disk or selected file. Find the name of your flash EXE and the name of the update bin file, and type the command &quot;cd awd flash exe&quot; or the name of your BIOS flash EXE. This will bring you into the flash BIOS programming screen. You will be asked to type in the name of the new BIOS you are trying to upgrade to. Type in the name of the new BIOS bin, and remember it is case sensitive. If you typed in the correct file name you will come to a prompt asking if you want to save the old BIOS. When asked, select &quot;Yes&quot;, so in case the new BIOS does not improve or destabilizes your system you can always flash it back. If you get any error messages do not flash the BIOS. If it is the right file for the right motherboard you will be prompted to save the old BIOS, and then it will ask you to flash new BIOS at this time. Select &quot;Yes&quot; and the firmware will update itself, and you will be told by the program that the flash was successful on the update screen.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer. If you followed my instructions, in the left hand corner of the POSTing screen you will see the new BIOS version number. Enter the BIOS again by hitting the Delete or F2 key, and choose &quot;set BIOS to default settings&quot;. Restart the system and go back into the BIOS, then you can adjust your BIOS to whatever your settings were before or choose new settings. Restart your computer and you should be off and running. If you do not like how the new BIOS affects your system, follow the steps and re-flash your BIOS off the saved bin file you created when you flashed the BIOS. If for some reason the system does not restart, you will have to worry with the EPROM chip, which since this is self built you will have to figure it out. The EPROM chip can go bad sometimes, even when everything was smooth sailing, and will have to be changed out. This procedure is not for the meek, as it is a delicate task and should be done by a skilled individual.<br />

Peace and GL with your PC<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">woot ! changing the refresh rate from optimal to the cards default has eq working now. dont know how the refresh rate got changed anyway since i didnt even have that option when i alt o only had default as an option. thanks a lot lohki ! now have any idea on getting rid of this lag every 4-6 seconds i have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Run Windows Update and make sure you get the full set of updates available for you, check to make absolutely sure your video and sound drivers are up to date and happy, install DX9a, and turn off all stuff starting up in the background.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Another option that may help...<br />
<br />
When you install Windows it is normally has bandwidth settings typical to a 56k modem.<br />
<br />
Try visiting www.speedguide.net and look for the appropriate registry patches for your OS to open up the bandwidth for DSL/Cablemodem... Assuming you have DSL or Cablemodem that is.<br />
<br />
There are also quite a few system tweaks you can do, but I wouldn't suggest doing them if you are not familiar with the registry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sweet ! ill ck it out and get back to ya....i do have dsl btw. so far nothing has helped the stupid lag problem :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The monitor driver is often overlooked.  By default most of the time you get a &quot;default monitor&quot; loaded on an install. Either install the inf files for you monitor or at least change it to &quot;plug and play monitor&quot; and reboot. You should (but not always) have more refresh rate options after that.</div></div><hr />
