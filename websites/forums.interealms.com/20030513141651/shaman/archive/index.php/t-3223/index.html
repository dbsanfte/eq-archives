<br />
The shaman have his place with the melee, he is able to wear high protection armors, he wear a shield, and a long spear to hit creatures from behind the warriors. Most skilled fighters know they are safe when they feel a friendly shaman presence, and know its dangerous when an enemy one is still alive.<br />
On tribal cultures, the shaman is the leader, the wise one. He makes you feel stronger, and enemies weaker, he prevent dangers by talking with the spirits. With practice and patience, he become an Oracle, able to read the future, not in a crystal ball, just by guessing the possible endings in a present situation.<br />
He is also able to play different roles, offensive or defensive, sometimes both at the same time, for the most powerful ones.<br />
<br />
In Everquest, the Shaman has the stronger poison and disease spells, combined as a weilder of the Spear of Fate, with the curse of the spirit, he is able to do incdredible damages, around 3000 HP per minute. He is able to reduce the fighting abilities by 75 %, lower armors and magic resistances by 50 points.<br />
He is able to convocate an Heyokah, a nature spirit, on a wolf form, he is pretty weak, but it show how strong you are by having a shaman as ally. The Shaman is also the one with the best mana regeneration, using cannibalize.<br />
<br />
In one word, the Shaman is powerful..<br />
