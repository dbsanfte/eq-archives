<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went ahead and dropped the 9k on a ghetto horsie this weekend. Worth every single plat in outdoor zones (models off).<br />
<br />
It almost seems like you are sitting and medding with c3. And god forbid you actually have c3. Soloing goranga's in ME, bane, pox, bane, epic I had a hard time getting below 75m.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm.. I have 11.5k in the bank.. =/ was saving up for a fungi.. how good is the cheap pony anyway?  does it just regen mana as if you were sitting?  and can you use it in places like katta? &gt;=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In DS (hey, I'm 54 whaddya want ;) ) Using slow, EB, VOS, dog, jbone, w/ c3, I kill consistently for about 25 mins, w/ 2 adds per cycle, w/o ooming.  About 1/2 a blue per cycle as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
In short it's THAT damn good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gorma:<br />
<br />
<br />
Outdoor zones only.<br />
<br />
yes, it's that good.  You can get one for 7.1 K at max chr and indiff faction in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i love my horsie. it's worth it if you can afford it and hunt in outdoor zones often enough to make it worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So would Katta qualify as an outdoor? even though its a city?  I know I can cast SoW there... Is it rule of thumb any zone you can cast SoW in you can use a horse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was in a similar situation (had 17k saved up).  Instead of running after every copper to get enough for a Fungi, I decided to take the leap of faith and buy a horse.  With good cha buff, the best price I could get was 8500p.  WORTH EVERY DARN PENNY!<br />
<br />
Picking the right mobs, downtime is non existant (outdoor zones)<br />
Pull with slow, bracer down, add a EB if needed.  Zero downtime!<br />
Now it is important to pick low dark blues for that.  But in my opinion, Horse + JBB &gt; Fungi any day of the week (outdoors).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">damn the jbb!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yes damn the jbb!!!<br />
<br />
and yes it works in Katta</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just bought a horse the other day and as much as I hate to say it I think my horse was a better investment than my fungi for outdoor grouping situations.  Indoors or solo the fungi still wins though.<br />
It's just soooooo nice to be meditating all the while your nuking away with your JBB or buffing / healing groupies.  Reduced downtime to zero compared to the fungi which would reduce my downtime to about 2 minutes of canning.  Which brings up another advantage of the horse, you can chain cast cann because you are always sitting even when casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I love my horse. Worth every single plat. However, I wouldn't like it nearly as much if I didn't have a JBB. Horse REALLY shines when you have a JBB. Although that doesn't mean its still not a good investment. There is no need to canni dance with a horse, chain casting canni is even faster mana regen than before since you catch all the med ticks. Another cool factor is that you no longer have to worry about sit aggro. Right after you drop turgur you are still medding, and if you need to suddenly swap in a new spell, you can do so without worrying about sitting and getting aggroed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mookle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With a horsey and a JBB my warrior pal complains he's just an unglorifed backstabber.<br />
It really does kill downtime and with a regen bp you dont miss the sitting regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hey  Krakster,<br />
<br />
sitting on a horse gives you piles! ;)<br />
<br />
I don't care as I've already got shrunken nads from using my JBB :p <br />
<br />
My friend has quit EQ :( and sold her gear giving me a share of it. :D That with my savings was enough to get me a GeeGee. Well worth every penny of it.<br />
<br />
On a side note I helped kill off my friend by levitating her over the hole and binding her in mid-air. :eek: <br />
<br />
After dying endlessly for an hour of so she logged and deleted the char /mourn Wellytopp<br />

In memory of my friend I've named my mare Welly :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had never really considered buying one before, thought they nice &quot;toys&quot;, heard various rumors about nerfing them so you cannot ride/med., in small guild, always short of cash..<br />
<br />
Hmmmmm, I WANT ONE!   8500 pp you say???? Hmmm I could get that with a little effort :) :) :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Even if you're saving for a fungi, I think the horse would be a good investment.  Remember that it sells back for, what, 80% of the cost?  so if you get close to the fungi, sell the horse back and the use of that horse will have cost you maybe 1600 plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I heard it sells for 60% of the original price..</div></div><hr />

<br />
sorry but isn't that a bug ? Or is it intended ? Especially sitting and casting is total bull****.<br />
If it trivializes so many encounters it should be changed ASAP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I thought that with high CHA and selling to an ALLY con vendor you could get a good bit better than 80% for that bag of coins ....?<br />
<br />
The first posts I saw about selling horses back (this was before peeps learned how to turn off the model, so you could use your own SoW, etc.) was 80% for selling in Bazaar - indiff con vendors.  I have Ally con vendors right around the corner in SH  (from running the gems delivery quest while waiting for rezzes - now ally to vendors near the sould binder, like the alchemy guy you use for the quest)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">So turning models off allows you to run at sow speed? =/ hehe if so i gotta turn that damn horse off lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So turning models off allows you to run at sow speed? =/ hehe if so i gotta turn that damn horse off lol<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup - turn off horse models, then sow yourself and you run at sow speed again.  You also dont have that damn horsey head and the annoying speed up/slow down time.  Another bonus is that you can duck to interrupt spells.  There are probably more but cant remember them.<br />
<br />
Horses are frikkin great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Mmmm I'm gonna make sweet love to my horse when I get in game tonight.<br />
<br />
*edit* I also didn't like the 'icey' feel to them whenever you start and stop.. :) and dammit how come we look so gimpy whenever we ride them.. we just let our arms hang to the sides.. hehe.. and plus the dammed horse makes it a pain to loot lol.<br />
<br />
*edit2* w00t.. and with models off I can bind wound w/o killin the horsie yay! Can I be in bear form as well or no? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Nope you cant use bearform normally, but in Cenos Thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3467) he explains how he does it...<br />
<br />
Need Rabid Bear to do it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You med just as well on the cheapest pony, but its so unmobile, it gets really annoying how slow it is, and trying to move out of the way of anything takes longer then normal, you sliiiide to stops, it gets really really frustrating, i couldn't stand it. I sold my cheap horse back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">With models turned off.. can you sit/stand.. and do you 'sit' when memming spells causing sit aggro?<br />
<br />
*edit* If no horse models causes sit aggro.. I guess I'll flip the models on when going to say.... cazik thule.. lol the mobs there hti too damn hard when you make them mad hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Not sure if anyone said this cause it didnt load all the posts :confused: , but, there is one downside to horse.  It eats through food and water at like 5x normal rate! Gah it sucks, I mean its definately worth it but I have to go buy food like every day or 2 and I get 3 stacks of each (water flasks and gremling jerky in bazaar).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">that's what happened to my fish rolls!!!! hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yeah I have noticed that, the horse TEARS though food. And you can't forage on it either. (OMG THEY NERFED LIZARDS!!) Took me about 6 hours to realise that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Anyone on luclin giving out horse loans?  I've got good credit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The best price with indifferent faction and max charisma is exactly 8399pp 9gold 9silver 9copper... I know this b/c with 120 cha it was this price, then with 140 charisma it was also this price... If you got a horse for 7100 you were mistaken. Only possability would be you had better then indifferent faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Dragher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My horse only costed 104k and some loose change, black chain thx ;). Yes horses are nice outdoors. Even med while you run :)</div></div><hr />
