Meeting place is outside the fort in EW in the front and 6:45 PM CST or just inside the zone to CC at 7 PM CST. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have to work on Tuesdays till 10 PM cst and usually get home around 10:30-11.  Anyone stay around that late, or will anyone want to stay and wait on me :P ?  I have my two lil'uns parked there and can easily get zyhri in there to heal us while we work. As Quaygon I can hold the bottom floor with zyhri healing+dsin so anyone that is willing to stick around let me know, we can make mad xps.  If not I'll just cyas when i cyas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sireena will be there. Even if she can't group with you all or doesn't get experience it doesn't matter....She loves a party....and to cause trouble :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mekil, the event runs just over 3 hours for most of us.. if you guys have enough to continue after we leave, then more power to you.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What I meant to say was, if anyone wants to stay around in CC after 10:30 PM CST I will be there with Quaygon and Zyhri and will welcome anyone that can come.  Zyhri is a good enough healer for doing orcs and can ghetto mezz (root park) adds.  So, anyone that wants to work on alts after the normal raid just stick around I'll be there.  If not, good luck on the drops before hand fellas, lots of nice trophies to be acquired in there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Math.. you don't need a key to get into Crystal Caverns and the GD key is the easiest one to get when you go to bind in Thurg.<br />
<br />
I might be able to help you move Maelen over sometime if you can't get someone to help you.. :)</div></div><hr />
