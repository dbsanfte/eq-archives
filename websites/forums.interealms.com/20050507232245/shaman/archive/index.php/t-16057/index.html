<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Basically I plan on this for my first AAs.<br />
<br />
Run 3<br />
Metab 3<br />
Mental Clairity 3<br />
Canni V<br />
<br />
<br />
If I had both Malo and Topor, I would AA at 62 when I get Tnarg's for certain.  However, once I hit 65 a friend is going to hook me up with Quiessence and Malos.  But AAs wont be as easy to come by, or so I worry.<br />
<br />
With Malo but no Torpor should I AA at 62, or just rush headlong to 65 and Qui and Malos and not worry about it?<br />
<br />
I know this question gets asked alot, and yes the almighty Search feature was used, but I couldn't find one already asked under these particular conditions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With those spells waiting for you, I would go for 65 before any aa.<br />
<br />
Its gonna be interesting leveling thru your 60s without the unlimited mana that canni v brings, and without run3 you will be noticable slower than those around you, if you use a horse you will go thru food and water at an amazing rate... but AA is easy to get at 65.<br />
<br />
At 65 you can solo for AA.  You can get groups just by logging in.  I get tells from people i dont know without even putting lfg on (of course, murphys law -when I am lfg I cant get one).  At 65 you can grab any melee and duo in halls of honor in any of the basements.  I made 2 aa in an evening of raiding the other night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">AA's will come faster at 65 because you'll get more groups and you'll have better spells (like Quiessence), a bigger mana pool, more HPs, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In your case, go to 65.<br />
<br />
AA come plenty easy in 65.  In fact, I think they come faster.<br />
<br />
There's some weird min-max analysis that some use to say that it's faster to get AA at 60.  This is only true in limited situations and essentially requires others to powerlevel you.  Yes, mobs may fall out of the magic within 5 level con range, but... kill speed is simply faster at 65.  <br />
<br />
It's much better to just go to 65 and scribe those spells.  Quiescence is great.  Malos is only good if you don't have Malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you don't have torpor or quiesence banked then it is imo a much better idea to just get to 65, get a copy of q, and get cann5.</div></div><hr />

I was soloing for aa in tier 3 at level 62...no root rot required.<br />

Do what you want to do, not what someone else tells you is the way to do things.</div></div><hr />

(responding since you quoted me...)<br />
<br />
Well, I didnt say root rotting.  I didnt say you cant solo earlier.  But err, what/how were you soloing in tier 3 without root/rotting at 62?  Or do you mean kiting in HoH?<br />
<br />
Not sure what the point of saying do what you want is, when he asked for advice... Just trying to help him out here. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Merwenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">your kidding right? get lvl 65 for those spells, aa's are freakin easy to get. hell, i wish i had that deal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Torpor aint **** compared to Quiescence.  I'd simply cry if I had to go back to it.  Q is as much better than Torpor as Chloroblast is better than Light Healing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I made it to 65 without torpor!  Kraggs mending works fine, Quiensence is a god send.  Torpor is good, but Quiesnece is god.  Personally, I leveled to 62, got MC3/Can V, then went to 65 without Malo or torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">However, once I hit 65 a friend is going to hook me up with Quiessence and Malos.<br />
<br />
DEFINATELY go straight for 65.  Those two spells will help you more than even canni5 will, and you'll have an easy time grinding out those AA at 65 with these spells.  Torpor/Quiescence are amazing spells, and I would definately want to get my hands on them as soon as possible.  Considering torpor is more or less a lost cause, go straight for Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">any pp at all spent on Torpor is wasted.  Once you get 65 (which is easy to do in a week of regular playing), you'll be able to mem Q which is far and away MUCH better than Torpor.  It's not really even in the same league as Torpor.  Torpor is an annoying spell, can only cast in the group (this gets to be majorly aggravating), slows and snares the target (double ouch), and costs same mana as Q, which has no downside.  <br />
<br />
Trust me, you will kick yourself if you put forth any effort getting Torpor when you can get Q instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Run for 65 ASAP.  get Malos and Quiesence.<br />
<br />
Quiesence is a godlike spell.  It is as much an improvement over Torpor as Torpor was over Chloroblast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I found Malo in the bazaar a couple of months ago for a measely 18k.  After much debate, I've decided to skip Torpor, and save plat for Q and other higher spells.  I'm on 20 pct AA and just heading to 65.  It's up to each individual on what spells they get, and how fast they get to 65.  I figure by the time I get to 65, the high end spells us Shamans are paying thousands of plat for will be flooding the bazaar, (or I'll even get lucky on a rune drop) and drop in price. All of us are going to get AA's in a way we choose, and how fast we level up to 65.  I say go for 65, get Q and Malos, and don't worry about Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">65 65 65 65 65 65<br />
65 Quiessence 65<br />
65 65 65 65 65 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/agree with the others, when you have those spells waiting for you, head straight for 65, I can verify I get AA's a lot  faster than I did at 60 (I hang with people my level).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Landragoran, I hope you were saying that any pp spent on torpor is a waste as a response to Caelum, and not a general shaman statement.. :)<br />
<br />
I just got torpor as I turned 60 and now half way through 61 I use it all the time on myself. Two Shaman in my guild are 65 with a ton of aa and they have not had any luck getting Q. I haven't seen a copy of Q up for grabs in the bazaar in months. (Rodcet Nife).<br />
<br />
I am planning on getting to 62 before going full aa and then levelling up when I hit canni V. I was planning to level up if I got Q though in the interim.<br />
<br />
Is this a bad plan? I am just looking for any advice you might have.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree with the others I turned 60 about 2 months ago ( dont exp much but raid often) and I bought Torpor ... gwad I wish i had not sold my jbb and saved the plat because im now 60 and dont have Q. if you have malos and Q waiting for you you should be strangled for entertaining any other thoughts than getting 65 and meming Q.</div></div><hr />
