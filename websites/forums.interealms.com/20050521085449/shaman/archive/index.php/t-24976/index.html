<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read somewhere we need to be upgrading our spells?  I am a level 12 shaman and not done this yet.  Anyone able to explain what I need to look for?  I have seen scroll type loot items drop when I am in groups but do not roll on them as I did not see them listed as skills in my skill column&gt;  But now I am thinking this was a mistake and they were needed to upgrade my spells.<br />
<br />
The post discussed Adept 1 2 and 3 ?<br />
                           MAstery 1,2 3?<br />
<br />
Any help on how I can getthese at this point in the game would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Base spell granted automatically is apprentice I or apprentice II. <br />
<br />
You can buy apprentice II from merchants in cities.<br />
<br />
Apprentice III scroll, rune, or essence are made by crafters.<br />
<br />
Adept Is are uncommon mob drops and are tradeable.<br />
<br />
I hear adept IIs can be given as quest rewards. Never seen one.<br />
<br />
Adept IIIs are made by crafters, but the components for these are incredibly rare.<br />
<br />
Master I is a very rare drop.<br />
<br />
Master II is not in game i believe.<br />
<br />
Master III is an artifact and there will only be a few per server, if any.<br />
<br />
You don't need to upgrade in sequence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Another word of note...dont buy your Apprentice II spells.  Save that money and go to a merchant and buy your apprentice III spells from a player instead.   The cost of App III spells now isnt much more than the App II spells and the upgrade is worth it.<br />
