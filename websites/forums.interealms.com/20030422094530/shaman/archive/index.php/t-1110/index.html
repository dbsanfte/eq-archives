<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>scooch74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since this is the board I turn to for all matters of advice, I wanted to post here on my latest dilemna - digital cameras. I'm currently in the market for a good digital camera, but I don't know a lot about them. I want one that takes good pictures, but it doesn't have to be top of the line quality. I want one that can hold a lot of images without having to download or erase them. I want one with a decent size LCD display so I can make sure I'm getting the picture I want. And if I could find one that also made MPEGs that would be an added bonus but not essential. Can anyone recommend a good camera and recommend a place to buy it without spending an arm and a leg? Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I recently bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canondv.com/elura10_20mc/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elura 20MC&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canondv.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt;. Love it very much. I was looking for something similar to what you described, except I wanted it to do video as well. Bought it from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.normancamera.com/shop/SearchResults.asp?ProdStock=013803007275&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</div></div><hr />
