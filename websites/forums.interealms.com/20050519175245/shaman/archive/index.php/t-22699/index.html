<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Finnyous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just recently hit 58 and got our ghetto complete heal.  So I get a tell the next day and this pally says &quot;we need ya,in POI,  is it ok if you heal?&quot;  I replied with I can slow also--  Let me tell you younger ones out there--there is nothing more exilarating Complete healing like a cleric, slowing and doing various other mutitasking.  It was freaking awesome, I had soo much fun, it was unreal and I fell like I had to post this.  Funny how being a shammy gets you into places my warr could never go into because he would get pwned.  Hope i dont sound like a noob =)<br />
<br />
Im always in cod now with 60 ish toons and the exp is insane.  Ive been there since 56 (More resists, but those mobs are slowable) and now im 58 almost 59.  Anyway's felt like I needed to share with mah brothers....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can main heal in Crypt of Decay at lvl 58?<br />
<br />
At any rate, yeah, it was fun for a while getting that 2k heal.  That &quot;OMG I can main heal&quot; feeling wears off quickly as you progress.  Then it comes back again when you get Q at lvl 65.  Then it wears off again after you move out of BoT go to GoD or EPs.</div></div><hr />
