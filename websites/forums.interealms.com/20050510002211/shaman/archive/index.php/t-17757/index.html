<br />
Yes, it is a rank and to gain higher ranks, you need to increase your post count.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's an Indian word that is used in EQ during a long quest for a shaman weapon.  <br />
<br />
Real world definition:<br />
<br />
The word heyokah comes from the Lakotah (Sioux) and is used in reference to a particular type of shaman.  According to tradition, the heyokah is one who has &quot;dreamed of the Thunder Spirits.&quot;  This dream bestows great powers upon the medicine man/medicine woman, one of which is reputed to be an ability to influence storms.</div></div><hr />

Im not afraid to tell you that those posts up there hurt me. They flat out stung cause there is a few places you feel like are your home in this life and this to me has always felt like it and when people that you automaticly give the title of friend and respect cause they share your home turn on you, its like a knife in the heart.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im going to say this as clear as i can. I am a honest man, i thrive in my life to not decieve in anyway and try to bring myself to another level of positive life at every step. I fail alot, but i never stop trying, thats the person i am. So when i tell you that i NEVER EVER spammed this forum with the intention of raising my post count, you can accept that for what it is, which is the truth or you can remain in darkness because i know in my soul what is real and the words you say are not.<br />
<br />
Yea ,aybe im a lil crazy maybe, flaky, kookey, out there, eccentic, silly, on my own brand of humor, out of touch, stupid. That maybe be true and in that light i post on my own terms and try to bring what god gave me tot he table and if you dont like it, thats fine, i can understant that, but please for the love of all thats good, dont fabricate stories and ideas about me spamming. There is plenty other things that are real for you to pick on me over.<br />
<br />
I dont know why this bothers me so much, but it really does. Im tired of fighting about it or being MIS-labeled, im tired of the hatred about it. Its like going to jail for something you didnt do.<br />
<br />
All that said, i need to draw a line here right now. If im such a horrible person and i have so little to give and everyone hates me so much, then say it right now and ill ask to be banned and will never come back.<br />
<br />
I like this place, but i cant be around the lies and hate no more. And no im not changing, there is no &quot; if you did this we would like you &quot; or &quot;if you would stop this we would like you &quot;. I dont care, im me, take it or leave it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im sorry for the drama, i feel like a lil girl typing this, but im sick of it.<br />

If you feel so hurt, then leave. Don't push for a ban when you know one won't happen. I'm too lazy to look up your first 1500-ish posts and point out how many truly were pointless, but I don't need to. Others have expressed the same opinion. The fact that you didn't post solely to raise your post count doesn't mean that your posts had any informational value. It only means that you posted useless stuff without a reason, as opposed to posting useless stuff with a reason. Which one sounds worse to you? I know which does to me..<br />
<br />
But anyhow...if you make valuable posts now, good for you. My comments were directed about 99% of your first 1500 posts as I don't read enough to comment on the recent ones.<br />
<br />
But like I said in the beginning...if you really don't want to be here, then just leave. Don't ask for a ban when you know it won't happen and then use the fact that it didn't happen as justification that the entire community wants you here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're looking for perfect understanding of your feelings and motivations from your fellow man, don't look on an internet forum.<br />
<br />
On a side note, people who spam to get custom titles or post-count titles (and it's easy to see because their posting drops off after they get their post count goal) cause me to laugh copiously at their puny e-penises.  If your e-penis is shriveled and chronically flaccid, don't try to make up for it with a big post count.  That's like stuffing a sock in the crotch of your pants.  Except it's online, which makes it even more pathetic and sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Cool it with the personal attacks please.<br />

I'm assuming this was directed at me...if not then ignore :D. I never attacked him as a person, I attacked the quality of his postings. I fail to see how this in any way is harmful to him as a person, and I also fail to see how, or rather why, I'm not allowed to comment on the quality of his postings as I wish..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps they (well, I'm assuming you meant Callir and Drinnar, though you might mean me) felt that what they percieved as the cluttering of their forum with pointless (unless you include post count fluffing as a valid point) gibberish, you know, spamming, to be a provocation.  And, since their motivation was to try to drive off a spammer (a form of troll), their actions were not &quot;worse&quot; than spamming.<br />
