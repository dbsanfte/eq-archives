(originally from http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=general&amp;message.id=194364&amp;page=1)<br />
<br />
Here are some details about how dying works in EverQuest II. <br />
<br />
Each time you die, you leave a spirit shard on the ground and take a penalty to your stats, experience, and item wear. When you retrieve your spirit shard, your stats are returned to normal and a large part of your experience penalty is paid off. If you choose to not retrieve your spirit shard, you will automatically absorb it after three days pass (online or offline), but you'll take the full experience penalty. <br />
<br />
When you die:<br />
You leave a spirit shard on the ground<br />
You lose some of your stats and pools (health, power)<br />
You owe some experience debt<br />
Your equipped items are slightly damaged<br />
When you retrieve your spirit shard:<br />
Your stats and pools are restored<br />
Your experience debt from that death is reduced by more than half<br />
The act of recovering a shard is purely an act of reducing debt and recovering lost power. Shards are not a repository for experience, and can only pay back debt, not add regular experience.<br />
Multiple deaths are cumulative:<br />
Each time you die you take an additional stats and pools penalty. This will cap out at around five unrecovered deaths<br />
Each time you die, you take additional experience debt and item wear, with no maximum cap<br />
The stat and pool penalty is based off the number of shards remaining in the world, so the more unrecovered shards you have, the larger your stat and pool penalty will be.<br />
As long as the player has five or more shards in the world, they're going to have the max stat penalty. Recovering shard number eight will immediately give back a chunk of experience debt, but would have no immediate effect on the stat penalty as there are still seven more shards out there.<br />
If you do not retrieve your spirit shard:<br />
You automatically absorb your spirit shard after three real-time days have passed, whether you're online or not.<br />
This will restore the stats and pools lost from that shard, but will not reduce your experience debt at all<br />
Maximum shards per character:<br />
A character may only have up to 10 shards in the world at a time. If the player dies with 10 shards in the world, they don't leave additional shards. This means they don't take an additional stat penalty, but they also don't have a shard to recover to help with experience death. Essentially, dying this many times means taking full experience debt with each death.<br />
If you die and are resurrected:<br />
You can only be resurrected if you haven't released and are still lying on the ground dead.<br />
Spirit shards cannot be resurrected.<br />
If you get resurrected, you do not leave a shard on the ground - you immediately regain your stats and reduce your experience debt the normal amount, just as if you'd picked up a shard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Groups share debt <br />
<br />
Group sharing is a new system that reinforces grouping by allowing groups to share risk as well as reward. Certain classes are at higher risk of dying due to their role, even if they play well. A lot of times, the player who died didn't do anything wrong - they just weren't healed in time, helped out on a bad pull, or had some bad luck. This system lets the group share the penalty for dying, just as they would've shared the reward if they'd won. <br />
<br />
Group sharing greatly lowers the penalty for the occasional group member dying. If your group is playing pretty well and someone dies once in awhile, you won't feel much of a penalty at all. If you have members dying frequently, or if your whole group wipes out, then you may want to reconsider what you're fighting or work on refining your strategies. <br />
<br />
Here's how this works - If any member of a group dies, their experience debt is split evenly amongst the group members. The shard recovery debt* is not split and is applied only to the player who dies. (*This is the portion that is fully refunded when a player retrieves their shard.) <br />
<br />
If you're in a two-person group, each person gets about half of a normal debt if one of them dies. If you're in a six-person group, each person gets about 1/6th of a normal death if one person dies. Because the debt each person gets is much smaller than a normal death, and because all group members are paying off the debt at the same time, it is much faster to get out of debt than it used to be. Joining groups will lower your risk more than they used to, and help you pay off your debt that much faster. Group sharing should lower large debts being racked up by higher risk classes. <br />
<br />
This system encourages you to keep your group members alive and healthy. If you end up in a bad situation, it's worthwhile for one person to die if it will let the rest of the group escape. Because of the way sharing works, it won't help you if your whole group wipes out - so think twice before going into situations that are likely to kill the whole group.<br />
*************<br />
<br />
Because, you know, I used to watch my group die while laughing maniacally - then gate.  This will change that, though.  NOW I'll actually care if they live.  /boggle<br />
<br />
The fact that they think this is a GOOD idea scares me about EQ2, a LOT.  How could they not realize that if someone gets lost, falls down a hole, or looks like they're going to die - unscrupulous group leaders will just boot them.  Or then there's the griefer who offs himself a half dozen times - racking up a serious debt chunk for his group - before they get wise to the fact that he's laughing fit to soak his drawers.<br />
<br />
This is the kind of solution you come up with after playing a warrior up to level 10, and then turning your expert hand to game design.</div></div><hr />

Because in two sentences, you sarcastically note that Sony is saying we don't care about our groupmates, but then say this content is a bad idea because there are unscrupulous people out there who don't care about their groupmates.<br />
<br />
You kinda have to make up your mind which one it is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The best answer to your question is one answered by the devs not too long ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
AlGhouti - *Optik* Is there anything to prevent player griefing with the group debt penalty?<br />
<br />
[SOE]Waters - It should be pretty easy to avoid griefing, or at least easier than it is now with the death penalty in EQ. First, if someone in your group dies to grief you, they're taking some debt too. Each of you only gets a fraction of a whole death, so it's a better deal for you than it would be if your cleric in EQ just decided not to heal you, or your warrior decided not to taunt.<br />
[SOE]Waters - Also, it won't take you too long to notice that there's an idiot in your group dying on purpose and you can boot him out of the group and tell your friends not to group with him. We've been playing with it for a bit on beta now, and overall the response is very positive.<br />
[SOE]Waters - (done)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Experience penalties for death are pointless and outdated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your note at the end kills me.  <br />
<br />

<br />
You kinda have to make up your mind which one it is...<br />
And this is a contradiction in which way? <br />
a) contrary to SoEs believes, we care about our groupmates.<br />
b) the system gives incentive to kick people from groups if they die.<br />
=&gt; the system is unnecessary and can lead to abuse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, it is not too bad in practice. If you or your group members die alot, you rack up debt so fast, you do not care anymore if its your personal debt or a group debt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Experience penalties for death are pointless and outdated.<br />
What would you suggest instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What would you suggest instead?<br />
<br />
I would suggest removing it. Getting rezzed and or getting back to your group is pain enough. <br />
<br />
I always felt exp debt was harsh. I limits your ability to explore and take chances. Why check out that unkown dungeon if there is a posibility to lose a weeks worth of exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Make the experience penalty optional - allow the player to make a choice.  A quick/easy rez solution costs experience.  A challenging or time consuming solution costs no experience penalty.  Go read the WoW boards - they have this balanced pretty well.<br />
<br />
Notice I'm not against a death penalty, just a mandatory experience penalty.</div></div><hr />
