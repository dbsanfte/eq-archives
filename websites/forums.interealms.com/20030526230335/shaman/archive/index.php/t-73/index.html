<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thought I would get some advice on my spellbook line-up at level 24:<br />
<br />
Swapable buff slot<br />
Sow<br />
Regen<br />
Affliction<br />
Envenomed breath<br />
Walking Sleep<br />
Root<br />
Canni<br />
<br />
This is my combat load-out for soloing/partnering where I am the primary damage dealer.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts or suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well it really depends what your situation is, lets take a look.<br />
<br />
This is what my spell gems look like back then when I was soloing.<br />
<br />
Frost Strike<br />
Envenomed breath <br />
Tainted Breath<br />
Root<br />
Walking Sleep<br />
Healing<br />
Regeneration<br />
Canni<br />
<br />
Now when I solo I pull with Walking sleep then cast EB as incoming and TB while meleeing, melee to dead and if its a tough mob throw in another dot.  If your going to DOT and ROT then mem Affliction but other wise I wouldnt use it.<br />
<br />
I never give sow in own slot but thats just me, I am sure some will disagree.<br />
<br />
If your safe with your pulls Healing isnt necessary either but if you have a partner or in a group you want to keep healing memmed.<br />
<br />
As far as Swap slots for buffing and such, well I just unmem some slots do my buffing and mem the original spells back in, no need to give buffing and such a seperate slot.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lacka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 24 I'm surprised you don't have sow and gate up. There is nothing worse than trying to solo a critter and then have sow fade and have no way to get it back in a hurry.<br />
<br />
Likewise gate. When all else fails I love having gate there as a last resort, even now at 52.  I hate being surrounded with no escape route. Sometimes you'll get interupted and won't be able to cast but many times you'll luck out and get it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I use the spell Innerfire as a timer for Sow before I got my clicky boots and the only time I have gate memmed is when I solo in a dugeon and even then thats once in awhile.  <br />
<br />
If I come into trouble (which does not happen often) I simply use a different method of escaping which only calls for the spell Root, which I always have memmed.<br />
<br />
What you do is just simply root the Mob(s), then run away and stop at a good distance, from here you now have the option of camping to kill agro or memming gate.  I usually camp to kill agro as gating will usually take me far away from where I am hunting (I always stay bound in EC).<br />
<br />
Their you have it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your lineup doesn't look that different from how mine did at Level 24:<br />
<br />
Heal<br />
SoW / Gate (outdoor / indoor)<br />
Cannibalize<br />
Regeneration<br />
Disease DoT<br />
Poison DoT<br />
Root<br />
Nuke<br />
<br />
The only thing I'd question is your not having a healing spell memorized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sivilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Apparently, you don't heal much, hence the lack of your Healing spell. However, I think it is important to have. Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />
