<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>projectshrike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all. I was searching around here and on allakhazam, and I couldn't find any information about a Newbie Armor quest for Iksar Shaman. I thought all races/classes got one, and I know Iksar Beastlords have one, so I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Iksar Shaman have the Cudgel quests, rather than a set of armor. The end result is much better in the long run, trust me. You can also work on getting Scaled Mystic armor, which is comparable to Totemic and can be obtained between levels 20-35 or so.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For low level newbie quested armor, hail the merchant inside the Haggle Baron (can't remember his name) and follow the textual clues.  He'll give you a satchel that needs to be filled with scaled curskins.  Fill it, click combine and give it back and you get a random piece of curskin armor (not too good) and some coin.<br />
<br />
Or.<br />
<br />
Hit the bazaar and buy some cheap armor.  You want AC and HP above all else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No no no.  Iksar Shaman DO get newbie armor, and it can last you into your 40's.  As you zone into Cabilis from Field of Bone, run like you are heading to the Shaman guild.  Instead of turning right (at the new tailoring merchant) go straight to the next house on the left.  Might be 1 house farther to the left, but it is right there.<br />
<br />
You are looking for Zazlan Furscale and Shezlie Furscale.  The armor is called Scaled Mystic.<br />
<br />
Have fun and good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What Zatriz said.  Except it's not really newbie armor, it's low-mid armor, comaprable to the Totemic of the other races.  Most of it is soloable between level 20 and 30.  We don't have any armor sets for the first 10 levels like they added in for some races, but there is the curscale quests (mentioned above) which can fill out a few slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I might even have some of it still in my bank.  Can't seem to get rid of anything.  I'm a pack rat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Iksar Shaman don't get &quot;newbie&quot; armor like other race/class combos. They get curscale which is sort of like patchwork armor.<br />
<br />
They do get an equivalent to Totemic but that won't help you at level 10 and, really, Ry'Gorr is better and probably a lot cheaper to get in the long run.</div></div><hr />
