<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont think this is working for me, I nit mgb, thn stab Ancestral Aid and only see the message applied to myself....is this normal?<br />
<br />
Those people in the raid I asked said they had no Ancestral Aid buff :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It only shows up on me when I use it in group, too. As far as I know, when MGB, it works on everyone, because I often see a few &quot;would not take hold&quot; on people who have too many buffs or something blocking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah thats the confusing part, in a raid off 55 people, including numerous druids I expected to see some 'did not hold' messages and saw none...that coupled with the fact that no one I asked recalled seeing it has me suspicious.<br />
<br />
Note I do only have rank one though.....is that my problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It now stacks with Druid MGB, so that's why you're not getting reject messages from them.  You may still get them from bufflocked people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have not been able to mgb ancestral aid either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It MGBs, you just only get the message on yourself. It definitely hits the whole raid, I checked it with people out of group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>beverlyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I tried this as MGB with another shaman and it did work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I haven't had issues with Ancestral Aid and MGB.  Sometimes I get the &quot;could not hold&quot; message, but this is the result of people having max buffs on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ancestral Aid (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5933&amp;source=Live) works fine, you just dont see it landing on others because they forgot to include a &quot;Cast on other:&quot; message in the spell data. Nothing special about MGB, you don't see those messages on your group either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've only played with it a few times, but I've had mixed results with AE'ing this skill. So far the only consistent way to get it to properly AE is if I have myself on target when I cast it. If I have a mob on target, no target, or someone in another group on target it seems to just cast the spell on my group and then eat my MGB for 72 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zaniza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just a curiosity but...<br />
<br />
I was in raid the other day and did MGB Fo7 while on my mount and although it used the MGB and all went normally, I was the only one that got hit with Fo7.  Not even my group.  I asked the other Shaman and found that it has happened to them as well IF they are on a mount.<br />
<br />
So I always dismount first before casting... even if this is not the reason :)</div></div><hr />
