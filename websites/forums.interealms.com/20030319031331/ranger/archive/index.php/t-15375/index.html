<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soreil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently a level 50 wood elf ranger and was wondering what zones are easy to find pick up groups?  I don't have POP so that's ruled out for now but I have all the other expansions.  I've done quite a bit of hack and slash in DL and Karnors but was wondering if there are any new hunting grounds I could check out.   Currently I'm doing some farming in OOT poor Gorn :) for some upgrades but want some options when I'm finished.  I would usually be flying solo since I'm in a relatively small guild.  I get bored really quick with soloing things so I need some company.  Thanks!:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You might give Maidens Eye a try.Since PoP came out its been a lot less crowded and lfg people usually get invites to whatever groups might be there.Also some no drop gear that might be upgrades for you drop in there.<br />
<br />
Get PoP if you can, the transport system alone is well worth it.You will be able to cover a lot of ground looking for groups or get to your groups a lot faster no matter where they may be.<br />
<br />
Lastly dont be afraid to start your own groups. The command /who all 47 53 will tell you where people your lvl are hanging out, add a lfg on to that and you can usually find people to start a group with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soreil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks a lot for the help Medain.  I didn't know you could do a search by who all and level=cool and the lfg even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can also do a /who all ranger 47 53 lfg search  /who all cleric 47 53 lfg search to look for specific classes.</div></div><hr />
