<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Strata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the importance of the 3 books of Lord Ghoisk?  I see that when you turn them in the spirits tell you to locate the high scale icon and then go see Kirn.  If one already has the high scale icon, and is on their way to see Kirn, then why do they need the 3 books?<br />
<br />
Thank you <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) Story line.  The Shaman epic has an extremely well laid out story behind it, even to research into Native American shamanism for some terminology (Heyoka).  As you go through the quest, you find out the story behind the entire thing - if you just raced through your epic, find a detailed walkthrough with the conversations, and have a read.<br />
<br />
2) Faction.  Every step of our epic increases faction with Truespirit.  Don't have enough faction, and you can't progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, if you have skill in Lizardman, you can read the 3 books.  <br />
<br />
Basically, you need to turn in the books because the shaman eqic quest is ultimately designed as a series of turn-ins, each turn in giving a faction boost leading to the next step.  Ideally, completing each step in order produces the correct faction to obtain the Spear of Fate at the final step.<br />
<br />
In addition, the shaman epic quest is just a really good story, including romance and betrayal.  I'd recommend getting lizardman to 100 so you can read the books and the pages recovered from CoM, it definitely adds to the quest to know the motivations of the principle characters.</div></div><hr />
