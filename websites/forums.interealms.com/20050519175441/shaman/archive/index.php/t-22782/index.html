<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zzasrix00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there everyone,<br />
<br />
In a couple of months me and my wife will most likely be getting back into Everquest after a VERY long break.  She is pretty much a newbie and im not too much better. J  She will most likely play a shaman, and im leaning towards bard.  Also, neither of us wants to play easy/boring characters, so these seem to fit the bill.<br />
<br />
I keep hearing how good the Shaman/Bard combo is but could someone be a little more specific?  <br />
Where do you go at lower levels?  <br />
Who tanks and why?  <br />
What equipment choices are more important, which stats?  <br />
When neither of the classes can tank then how do you kill mobs?  <br />
Are there zones that would be friendly to this duo?  <br />
How easy would it be to get a group with these two classes?<br />
<br />
And any other information you think would be useful is defiantly appreciated.<br />
<br />
TYVM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where do you go at lower levels?  <br />
<br />
Tutorial, Newbie area, (May be race dependant), Kurn's, Paludal, Unrest, MM.<br />
<br />
Who tanks and why?  <br />
<br />
Initially you trade off to keep defense up.  Later - neither.<br />
<br />
What equipment choices are more important, which stats?  <br />
<br />
I'm preferential to HP items, a Bard has some use for Charisma (see the Bard board for more info)<br />
<br />
When neither of the classes can tank then how do you kill mobs?  <br />
<br />
Kiting.<br />
<br />
Are there zones that would be friendly to this duo?  <br />
<br />
Any outdoor up to and including Nightmare.  Basically anywhere you can kite.<br />
<br />
How easy would it be to get a group with these two classes?<br />
<br />
Very.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">shamans, Hp &gt; all. remember, we can eat ourselves alive for mana, and im not saying we are the best tanks, but i can definitely tank some things with Q... go with HP gear, even when i was low level soon as velious came out it was the velium fire wedding rings for me.</div></div><hr />

Bards are masters at soloing with AE kiting, swarmkiting and chant kiting. Frankly, there's not much a shaman can add to a skilled bard when it comes to xp.<br />
<br />
A bard's biggest problem in a duo is holding aggro, so you will most often either tank or kite with the shaman. From levels 30-45 or so you can also do well with fear kiting (bard snares and fears whilst meleeing, shaman can use DoTs). From about lvl 30+ the bard can charm mobs, which can be used in numerous inventive ways.<br />
<br />
Bard works well with shaman as their health/mana regen song is doubly effective with shaman canni. Shaman buffs help the bard (dex, hp, cha, haste) a lot too. Shaman provides slowing and healing ability, bard can pull very well, snare, fear, mezz, charm (at later levels) - between the pair of you you can do just about all things except rezz and teleport - but with selos you will have few problems moving about anyway<br />
<br />
What equipment choices are more important, which stats? <br />
<br />
Shaman: Focus items (mana preservation, burning affliction, spell haste). HP, Regen, FT (mana regen)<br />
<br />
Bard: HP, Instrument modifiers, Weapons (up to level 30 at least), Dex, Cha (moreso at higher levels). At very high levels, int/mana and FT are also important. See www.eqdiva.com, they are very helpul there if you post in Nillipus's Newbies section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I were going to start two characters from scratch to duo with, I'd start a beastlord/necro duo.  Very, very powerful duo at high levels.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">isnt a sham + sk combo good too? ive about that here.. u could search for it too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zzasrix00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My wife is pretty set on the Shaman, and i have no intentions of playing an SK.<br />
<br />
I did a search on partners and duo's for the last three days and only asked the questions i didnt specifically find answered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i think u can swarm kite with the bard and have some help with the shaman.. and i think i read they can fear kite.. but u can also aggro kite with ur bard + shaman. basically what that is, the bard gets the aggro and backs away while the shaman adds some DoTs and sicks her pet on the mob. all i can think of for right now.. my shaman isnt a high lvl right now, ud have to get one of the other people to give u info bout that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i think u can swarm kite with the bard and have some help with the shaman..<br />
<br />
Yes, DEX and CHA help with missed notes, more HP is always a good thing and SOW can help with the number of songs you will be twisting.<br />
<br />
and i think i read they can fear kite..<br />
<br />
Yes, fear/snare kiting is an option from the high 20s on. Bards have a lot of ways to kill mobs and they get more choices as they level up.<br />
<br />
but u can also aggro kite with ur bard + shaman. basically what that is, the bard gets the aggro and backs away while the shaman adds some DoTs and sicks her pet on the mob.<br />
<br />
I can't think of any way for the Bard to out-agro Shaman DOTs. When my Shaman groups with my Bard friend, the Shaman tanks even though the Bard has LR4 and the Shaman doesn't have any defensive AAs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the OP's biggest problem will be song twisting. If he finds that he doesn't like it or if his wrists can't take it, then he may have to play a different class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I duo with a bard friend of mine all the time and we do a decent job.  You just have to know when to dot.  I let him tank and add dots in later or nuke depending on the mob.  Its really more efficient with cani and such not to have a shaman tanking, atleast I think it is as hps = mana. There are a few songs that a bard can twist in to grab a decent amount of aggro, not to mention if you can get a blade of carnage or something like that it shouldn't be a big deal.  Though if I were to actually pick a duo partner a bard wouldn't be high on the priority list, though it is definitely workable.  Oh figured I should mention a little bit about what we duo.  We have done most of the things in BoT, minus the named as my healing doesn't seem to keep up long enough for that, because we don't have enough dps.  We have trioed servitor of luclin and quite a few other named like that, while not the most &quot;uber&quot; mobs its still a good time, which I assume is what your looking for.  The bard sure does make pulling and such nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well since its your wife I guess you could do this. AE Kite lake of ill omen from like 16/18-24 right by the lake and FV zone. 24-36 ae kite cougars in iceclad. 36-50 kite spirocs in timorous. 50-55 kite armory in Dulak. If you bring your wife with you to leech exp don't let her help coz if she draws agro your next tick of AEs will most likely draw it back to you and then you have a bunch of tightly packed mobs and a random stray and the stray may get in your path and get you killed. LoIO is a great place to work on AE kiting esp at lower levels. Dont worry if you die, your next kite will compensate. Any questions ;tell stromm.rtugok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Kiting is obviously fast XP (consider the beach in Gunthak in the 30s), but make sure to keep both the Bard's and the Shaman's Defense up - you'll thank yourself later :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think the Bard/Shaman combo will be a very fun duo, so don't give up on it until you've tried it. Once you get a good drum and chant songs you two can aggro kite, you twisting four chants, while she is laying on the dots and sending Jaboner on the mob. <br />
<br />
Also, if you want fast leveling, learn to AE kite. My god... I did this with my bard when I was leveling, incredibly fun (at least for me, dancing on the edge of instant death was fun) and insane xp. There isn't much that she could do to contribute though. If the mobs run when low HP she could finish them off, or she could just pull mobs and solo them while you do your thing. That probably isn't what you're looking for, but if you want to make fast xp then it is the way to go. Just invest in good instruments.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck, hope you guys have fun.<br />
<br />
*edit* If you've never seen a bard AE kite before, here is the aftermath of one I did on Gunthak beach (by the way, that place is insanely good for AE Kiting from 30ish on up to about 44)<br />
<br />

<br />
I was half way to 42 before I did that kite, and I was grouped with another person at the time too, heh.<br />
<br />
*edit again* You have to copy/paste the link in a new window if you want to see it. Damn 20megsfree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I did a search on partners and duo's for the last three days and only asked the questions i didnt specifically find answered.<br />
<br />
Someone get this guy a cigar! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Learn to AE kite when while you're still low level and don't have to worry about losing xp or dealing with a CR.<br />
<br />
At level 5 when you get Selo's Accelerando, go to Crushbone.  Twist Selo's and chords of dissonance as you run around the top of trainer hill, aggroing everything.  Start with a big circle and slowly close it in until all the mobs are bunched together. Keep the circle tight, but not so tight as they're pounding you.  Work on the timing of your CoD twist and try to have it fire off when the majority are in the range of the AE.  After an hour, maybe less, you should have the hang of it.<br />
<br />
As a bard, you'll want good instruments, preferably ones that go in your primary hand.  Look for weapons and armor with instrument mods.  Save up for a Trueborn Drum of Dark Rites (or whatever it's called) or if you really have enough scratch, a Thundrous Drum of Karana, as later in life you'll be kiting with your chants (which use the percussion skill).<br />
<br />
Once you and your lady hit the 20s, I'd recommend doing the needlites in Echo Caverns since they hit fast and not too hard, and are great for defense skill ups.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and get a Combine Lute from Katta (or the bazaar) as it's cheap and has a decent mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">^ Agreed about learning how to AE kite early. I'd suggest the Field of Bone Excavators. They are social, and have the ideal AE kiting AI (Don't run when low hp, will add if an aggroed one passes by one, etc). You can do them as low as level 6, even if they are deep red to you. I did a run of them at level 6 or so, it took about twenty minutes, but I went up to about level 11 from that single pull (I got all of the excavator mobs in the area). <br />
<br />
Anyway, a suggestion about AE kiting, you need to play conservatively ever since they put in the new collision system. What you do is collect all the mobs, then I roll them into a nice ball by running in wide circles. After that I run in a straight line, start my DoT song, once the wind-up time has gone down about two bubbles I make a turn backwards at about a fourty-five degree angle. That is a base of where to start, and from there you adjust when you turn during the song's wind-up, and what degree you turn at. Chords of Dissonance has a low radius so you have to cut it pretty close, but start out far and slowly make your way closer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As said before, the strength of the bard solo comes from kiting and charm kiting.  Its hard to do this in a duo, we draw a lot of aggro.<br />
<br />
I duoed from 20s to 50s for a decent amount with a bard and it was a lot of fun though there where times when i wasnt doing much besides buffing healing and finishing off the straglers.  It felt kinda silly for me to bethere but bard was a friend so we grouped a lot.<br />
<br />
it would be a challenging duo but defintly feasiable, but then again almost any duo can be done if the people know how to play there class</div></div><hr />
