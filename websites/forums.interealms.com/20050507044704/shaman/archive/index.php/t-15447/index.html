<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tanarok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">leveled to 14 today in EC(yay). Im on a 7 day come back to EQ free trial, and I haven't played in 2 years. Went all the way to innothule only to find it ruled by the frogloks. :( Went all the way back to neriak, to buy the spells. Could only find 3 shaman spell dealers, and NONE of them had my spells. They were all 4,9,19 level spells! Where are the shaman spells? I could only find 3 dealers in that area on the first floor. The second floor has the shaman guild master, which you can't buy anything from like eqshaman.com says. Ended up accidently pressing A when talking to a NPC, lost level respawned in West Freeport. Got pissed off and uninstalled EQ, but I'm goin to reinstall tomorrow *sigh* where do I buy the 14 spells in Neriak? I've been literally waiting years to use em. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Belaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If i remember correctly they are sold there, just near the bottom of the merchants list</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman spell selection in Neriak is pathetic for the Troll Shaman.  So you'll have to do one of the following:<br />
<br />
Run to Oggok and browse their wonderful spell selection.<br />
<br />
Make a Barbie Shaman Mule and transfer the spells through shared banking.<br />
<br />
Buy PoP.<br />
<br />
<br />
So far, I'm still running with just Kunark and Velious, but it seems to stay ahead in today's competitive Norrath, one must adapt or die.  Besides, Neriak blows and I'd much rather be able to just pop on in to POK and take care of all of my business there.  Once I hit level thirty sometime tomorrow and put a single point into all of my specializations, Neriak will officially become useless to me.  I spend more time banking in Oggok and JPF, and I flat out just don't like the zone.  My advice is to save some grief and get PoP.  And move your attack command to ~.<br />
<br />
Also, check the necro/sk guild for a dot or two you might can use in later levels.  And there are cleric spells you can nab in Neriak also.  But once you hit thirty and have your Regent Symbol (assuming you're an Innoruuk worshipping Troll) the place really no longer has a point, as it's just out of the way (unless you're leveling in SolA).<br />
<br />
That's just my two cents.  I may be wrong about some of these things though, as I am a stupid noob.<br />
<br />
Another thing I remembered.  In one of the Karanas (either North or West) There's a barb village along the southern shore that has a friendly shaman spell vendor that deals out an animal charm for 29 and quite a few pet spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tanarok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bah, thats what I thought... Can I still get to Ogguk through Innothule? This isn't making goin back to EQ very tempting :( I wasted about 10pp buying spells that I *thought* were the right ones after I got fustrated :( Thats a lot of money considering I only had 60pp total :( Anyone know the way to ogguk? Running Kunark/Velious as well with no intention of buying PoP since I'm not even sure I'm back for good. Being troll sux now, damn frogloks, I used to own them even when I was level 1 :( I would create a barb shaman, but I have no friends anymore, and it would be a PITA to learn the barb zones and figure out how to get to EC, and at level 1 some parts of EC are a bizatch. Bah, screw reinstallin.<br />
<br />
I play Terris Thule if anyone wants to hook a brotha up (I'll pay though). :D<br />
<br />
btw, how do I get the screen that shows item stats. This new interface with everything transparent doesnt show item stats when you click it or hover over your equipment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, you can safely reach Oggok by zoning into Innothule from South Ro and following the right wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">level 14 spells are found at the gipsies in oasis only one of them (the female) will deal with you. She has all our divination spells as well as a few others.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shaman Spell Vendors (http://www.nytmare.org/eq/shamanspellvendors.htm)<br />
<br />
If you have the Luclin expansion, you can buy all the standard guild spells as well as poison and disease spells in Shar Vahl without having to use any mules.<br />
<br />
You are right, they completely ****ed up the Troll Shaman vendors in Neriak and correcting their own mistakes is not a priority with Sony.</div></div><hr />
