It took VI 20 full-time GMs on one server to see the problem.  Clearly they need a radar crew to find their butt with both hands.<br />
<br />
Now if only they'd put the system up on all the servers :p<br />

Goodness sake VI, just up the spawn time on your precious mobs and when everyone on Legends has stopped bitching because they've got something to do - do it on the pleb servers too.</div></div><hr />

Of course after some guild on legends released the sleeper, that brought the other 10% back =p</div></div><hr />

haha and haha<br />

Try working your own problems out, don't even suggest that VI should do it for you.<br />
<br />
Ya I got a pretty good laugh about the tier system myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know people whine about lost &quot;freedoms&quot; but I agree on this stance.  There are too many guilds i have delt with in my 3 years in this game that got the kill on a mob my guild could have taken if it were not for ksing.  Yes we do move on but that doesnt mean it is not aggrivating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Enforced Calendar?  <br />
Could work, have to wait and see.  <br />
I read the article, sounds like they have most of the angles covered.  Also sounds like they aren't gonna list the smaller ****, just cause it's too picky.  The planes are not included for one, but is CT and Inny?  <br />
<br />
I think VI is setting their GMs up for a giant headache.  I'd also hate to be a guild leader/officer on Legends right now.  In addition to RPP/recruiting/server politics/raid leading you also now have to deal with GMs and calendar camping having some officer up at whatever ungodly hour to spam the calendar with reservations.  <br />
<br />
I foresee some guilds reserving like almost everything at first, and the rest getting screwed.  <br />
Then again that's not to different from how it works now.  The guild/s with the best players and organization and mobilization speed get 80-90% of the good mobs.  The rest get the leavings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you think we are all laughing? Most of the guild that are capable of killing these mobs usually work it out b/w themselves. There is no reason to have to pass some &quot;tier level&quot; crap just so you can have a shot then be given 4 DAYS to do it. That is stupid and hurts the game IMO.  If mob is up and you can take it down how you gonna feel if you have to wait 4 days to kill it b/c anothe guild is screwing around doing something else... oops emergency patch guess X does not get dropped this cycle.</div></div><hr />
