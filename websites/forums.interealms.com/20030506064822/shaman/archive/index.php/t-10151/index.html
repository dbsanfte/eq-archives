<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>saze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My brother went into the navy and has given me his shaman to play (level 60) I'm use to playing a monk and a cleric, but have never played a shaman. I understand that they are very good to solo with, and have read over the forums and have learned a little but want to know the best way to solo. His character has topor and a host of other high level spells. I would ask my brother, but unreachable at this time....i don't want to get him killed or anything silly like that but would like to have some fun with this class. Thanks for any advice in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best advice I can offer is to start a level 1 shaman (same race as your brothers) and level him up (untwinked) to the bare minimum of level 24. That might not even be high enough to fully understand how to play the class as our role changes significantly at several places throughout our career.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty simple really, debuff and slow the thing first (root helps), then use your epic + jbb + dots to kill said creature.<br />
<br />
Keep your buffs up at all times, mainly your HP buff (Focus) + stamina, and sow always.  Probably just use the boots for sow as I do.<br />
<br />
Torpor + canni = unlimited mana, and you can tank stuff for a bit if you have good AC/HP.  Or just root and dot it.<br />
<br />
good luck don't make us look bad ;)</div></div><hr />
