<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A poster or two on www.monkly-business.com asserts that they have done(which I assume also means broken) the fungi king camp with only a 60 shaman and a 60 monk, both of whom have very uber equipment.<br />
<br />
What do you think?  <br />
<br />
I would think getting resists on spells even occasionally would turn the situation around too much, too often, for even people with the most uber gear to duo fungi king camp without absorbing more deaths than anyone would like to bother with, much less break the camp in the first place.  I've gotten quite a few resists down there at level 60.<br />
<br />
One monk who says she's done it says she can't comment any further on it without insulting other people, I am guessing without insulting their skill levels or game knowledge or what have you.  <br />
<br />
Anybody here ever try to do that, or have any thoughts on it?</div></div><hr />
