<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">CAN'T YOU PEOPLE SEE THE CONSPIRACY??<br />
<br />
PoP is released. After uberguilds reach HoH, BoT, CoD, they nerf the xp rate. By this time, they are all 65 and have most of the PoP aa's. <br />
<br />
After Uberguilds reach elemental planes and gear up, they nerf the drop rates on ornate and elemental armour. <br />
<br />
After Uberguilds reach PoTime and &quot;win the game&quot;, SoE decides to open it all up to everyone. <br />
<br />
Stagger the guild levels a bit, make sure the uber on each server has their personal playground until the end, so they can farm in peace, then let the rest of the poor slobs in, calling it &quot;a necessary change that was overdue&quot;. <br />
<br />
This is high-guild catering! They stall everyone else deleiberately, nerfing xp and drop rates after the ubers are done to make sure we cannot catch up in any foreseeable time frame! All this while locking others out until the Ubers are done with it!<br />
<br />
I will let you decide is this is a legit rant, or sarcastic humour. Either way, someone, somewhere is laughing his arse off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think it is intentional, but yes, it does appear to work that way<br />
Its absolutely intentional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I guess as someone in an uberguild, I and most of my guild see it the exact opposite.  We feel like a beta test for the game, used and abused in terms of pop.<br />
<br />
And I really fail to see how removing the flag requirements is catering to uberguilds, in fact its the exact opposite.  We worked hard for our flags, now everyone and their brother who powerlevels their way up can get in.<br />
<br />
My experience with pop, if you think its catering to uberguilds.<br />
<br />
First two months, flagging and reflagging the same bull**** day in and day out, HAD to every flag in order or you get none, there was no unlocking memmories. no raid feature to get you in.  That's for everysingle person.  Also had high attrition, and the need to recruit to replace, see step 1 again.  Endless cycle. And there was no good loot at this stage.<br />
<br />
Step two, unlocking memmories comes into play, but not the raid feature, still stuck into an endless cycle of repeating flags, only know we have more flexiability at this stage, this would benefit those not so uber, who started pop a little later to gear up, not those of us who'd been there dealing with the screwed up system since day 1.  Altnerate key quests are made easier at this point, but guess what?  They mean jack and **** if you're in raiding guild, as you still need every flag to progress regardless.<br />
<br />
Step 3, raid feature is introduced, this is nice.  Allows us to bring newer members to a kill when its up, and not have to wait out repopping of old flags first.  But this also benefits the less uber guilds who are behind in that they can field a raid force as soon as most of their members are flagged, unlike like those of us who spent MONTHS repeating flagging ad nauseum.<br />
<br />
Step 4, finally Welcome to the elemental planes!  Guess what?  They are buggy, pathing is atrocious, you can blow events in an xp group.  Rings get bugged until patch, rings that you need to advance.  Risk vs reward is way out of wack, and lots of rot loot in air and earth.  Fire is a gold mine however, but how long can you farm a single zone without losing your mind?  After a few months of dealing with this crap, they decide to fix it?  Does that benefit those of us who had been there dealing with broken content from get go?  Or does it benefit those who are slower and now dont have to waste time dealing with broken content in order to progress?<br />
<br />
Step 5, retuning of the elemental planes and the bosses.  Fire and water were virtual free loot zones at first, but after spending months farming these events due to the the cockblock of the rathe encounter being impossible, they are made harder, and guess what you still have to clear all the mini named to get to the gods.  Grats on harder mobs that take longer to kill for loot that is now mostly rotting.  Some of these events are ridiculous for the loot you get out of them, an extreme opposite in terms of risk vs reward.<br />
<br />
Step 6, change to poeb key.  After spending months on buggy rings, bugged Mystical Arbitor spawns, we finally get the key.  Used to a key could bring an entire group into poeb, now each individual has to have one.  So congratulations, you were in poeb, now you have to go back and repeat poe to get everyone keyed.  Hope you dont miss that raid, becuse this fight sucks.<br />
<br />
Step 7, at this point this is where my entire guild is ready to throw in the towell and cancel our accounts.  The stinking rathe encounter.  This is NOT FUN, it was impossible for months, now they new retuned version requires a minimum of 70 people.  We've tried it over and over with mid 50s in attentence and we always fall short just when we are about to beat it, just due to lack of sheer manpower, despite flawless play.  OH and guess what?  All that work our guild put in over the months, we need to recruit to get by this one encounter, to get into time, and TIME IS FREAKING LIMITED TO 18 people events.<br />
<br />
You may think the grass is greener for the uberguilds, but I assure it is not.  You can thank every uberguild in this game who beta tested the content for you, so that verant could make it balanced and working properly for YOU the non-uber guild player.  Because we had to deal with the crap when it didn't work, which far outweighed the fact that we got a few benefits of  loot being more common for a couple weeks.<br />
<br />
In fact, in terms of loot being more common off trash in the first couple of weeks, luclin was the same way.  Its the bait to reel you into the expansion, the lure of phat lewts.  However, once they get you in, they scale it back to keep you coming back for more,because if we all got everything we wanted on a silver platter, how long would people continue playing?<br />
<br />
Food for thought, next time you think the uber guilds have it so easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And Bozarkia's post didn't even address some of the problem that the real frontrunners had - and talked about on their respective guild sites.  Just like the Rather was/is a nightmare, Rallos was retuned repeatedly (and is still kinda buggy at times).  The PoE-B key was a disaster in and of itself.  <br />
<br />
The original flagging system was so bad that anyone who waddled through it (and I didn't, by the way) *deserves* more loot.  As the worst case example ... you do the PoN Hedge Maze.  Check.  You kill Terris Thule (giving you access to Torment).  Check.  You do the stomach event and get a tower key (no flag there).  You kill Saryrn ... no flag.  That's because a prerequisite flag for Saryrn is Bertox.  Where'd Bertox come from in this progression?  Good question - and he's a noxious 2 hour event that is way harder than Saryrn to boot.  So - its off to kill Grummus, Carpin, and Bertox, then go kill Saryrn again for your flag.  What, no flag?  Ah ... you forgot to tell some NPC in PoTranquility the keyphrase &quot;I will go&quot; before you killed her ... sorry.  And now your guild is just tired of doing Saryrn, because her loot cloaks have pretty much the same stats as Heirophant's Cloaks, and Torment as a zone is the opposite of fun?  Hmm ... well, guess you'll be sitting out on later raids, huh?<br />
<br />
Yeah, the frontrunners have some stuff made easier for them.  Fire was a candyland when people got there.  But everything that is made easier for the top guilds is balanced by something that is either 1) made easier for other people, too or 2) made much, much harder for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I told you someone was laughing......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And now the uberguilds shall either <br />
<br />
A.) Quit EQ because they have won the game, and therefore Ebay their characters so everyone with a couple bucks can become &quot;uber&quot;.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
B.) Pharm Time till the next expansion where they get to do all that **** over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh.. big long posts about how the Ubers deserve loot candyland and private playground zones. Gee thats a suprise on the crucible =p<br />
<br />
Oh yes. all of our hearts bleed for you because all of that fat elemental planes loot is rotting =(<br />
<br />
I still dont understand the logic that can support run of the mill xp zones being hidden behind gigantic timesinks(alt quests) or large raid mobs. Its a crime against anyone who bought the expansion and trusted SOE to not bend us over.. again. It aint like these zones are a loot pinata like ST, VT or elemental planes.. they are just run of the mill XP zones for 60+.<br />
<br />
Funny though how ornate and windblades and girdles and spectrals and runes dropped like candy in all these tier 3 zones while only 1 guild on each server was in them. And once some others manage to work up and get it.. woops.. no more loot now that the top tier got SOE to nerf it to keep everyone else down.<br />
<br />
It is merely Sebilis and Blade of the Black Dragon Eye redux, it is merely the Gem Encrusted Ring all over again. VI and SOE always always ALWAYS nerf drops and XP.. but ONLY after the Ubers are done with the content and have squeezed it dry.<br />
<br />
It has happened in every expansion. It is happening this one. Eventually more people will work up to the elemental planes.. and finally when more then 1% of each servers pops finally manages to get into the elementals.. they will be nerfed so hard as to be destroyed and made utterly worthless. Mark my words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">a few weeks of windblades and girdles and other rot loot is reward for spending 6 months on bugged content?  Please no one the uber guilds even used that crap.<br />
<br />
Did you even read the post, or did you just glaze over when you saw that we were posting an opposite viewpoint?<br />
<br />
Oh NO!! I can't get easy loot because of the evil uber guilds!  Well, guy, its not our doing, and I'd gladly give up a freaking pos windblade for the last 6 months of bullcrap back.<br />
<br />
As I said, you may think the grass is greener, but its really not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny, I seem to recall the fact that Vex Thal now drops MORE loot per mob AFTER the &quot;Ubers&quot; left it.  And lets not forget how much easier mobs in Luclin/NToV became after the level increase giving those non-&quot;uber&quot; guilds better debuffs, buffs, nukes, heals, more AA skills, etc.  Emporer and Seru are 40% slowable now, a single enchanter can keep all the snakes mez'd on Emp/HP, and so on.  <br />
<br />
Yes, those of us that were ahead of the curve did get some benefits at times, but those behind the curve got just as many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zorshaaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Pro's and Con's to both sides of this but I for one know how sick I felt seeing the screen shot an Uber guild posted on their site with 30 odd Runes stacked up after one raid.

Hate to break it to you, but runes don't drop in torment, and they are only on lvl 66+ mobs in hoh, and rare at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We all know how the runes used to drop in FoZ, though ;)<br />
<br />
Yes, this is a standard occurence with new expansions. The first people there betatest it, Verant/Sony tweaks it. Most of the time it is tweaked for the worse, obviously. Uberguilds are in the position to be there pre-tweak, for better or worse.<br />
<br />
Agenda to support Uberguilds and screw over casuals? More likely a sign of bad in-company testing and poor quality control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Amen Bazorkia, same deal here man, Rathe is a 70+ event and we field 55-65 tops with everyone doubling. How is this balanced?<br />
Encounters should be fun to do and encourage people to come back. If it was meant to be a one time event, why bother even adding loot at all? subpar loot at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I read this thread and laugh my ass off. It reminds me of the world's social castes. <br />
<br />
It seems pretty simple to me. Uber Guilds have the man power to pioneer the efforts that others can not. Where do you think all the information on how to do all the keys and quests come from? Yes they get awesome equipment before we do, so what. If you want it go join or make an uber guild and go get it!<br />
<br />
I've never been in a large guild, but I know plenty that are. Yes, most of them are elitist *******s that walk around with uber items stuck up the uber bung hole. But many are  people who are out to have some fun. Some of the uber guilds are actually quite nice and are more than willing to take people not in the guild along with them just so you can experience the game from a different perspective.<br />
<br />
The content of the game and who gets to see it first is not the issue. It is what they do with it.<br />
<br />
What I can't stand is sitting back and looking at spell prices for 65th level spells. Blood of Saryn (12) 50000. Guild mules piss me off! They have everyone in there guild stacked with these and are charging enormous rates to those who can't get to mobs that drop runes on a regular basis. I mean come on can you say MONOPOLY? Why? Do uber guilds need large sums of plat to horde in thier Cave? Is the money made off of dropable items not enough? They can't knock it down to 30K ir even 20K?<br />
<br />
I guess I am one of the few people that think everyone should have as many of thier spells as possible. Yes, I realize guild and friends first and I agree with that. But once that is covered, give it away! Or at least don't charge outragous pricess for spells! Did we learn nothing from Kunark Spells? Oh wait! If you have 12 copies sitting around on a mule, I guess it isn't exactly a rare drop.<br />
<br />
Bah maybe I'm just crazy to think people should help others, but until someone convinces me otherwise...<br />
I guess there will be poeple that consider themselves luck when I come around handing out the candy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">First ones in = greater risk.  No websites to help them.  Nobody's personal experience to give them a clue.  Figure it all out on their own, including the bugs.<br />

My guild actually gives away 1 rune for each member/applicant another smaller guild flags if they do stuff we stopped doing. They have done that for a long time now. And the prices on your server seems a bit high imo as Fo7 goes for 25-30k on AB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ok folks, the joke is over. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">/Salute Salorm, wish there were more guilds like yours around. Unfortunately at least on my server, there appears to be no such generosity<br />
<br />
On Inny Fo7, when you can find it is upwards of 100k. <br />
<br />
MQ of Spectrals average 10k, MQ of runes average 140k<br />
<br />
And the ornate molds are out of sight all together, the gouging and the greed really gets to me.<br />
<br />
Can't there be another way, or at the very least a time frame in which these higher tier guilds are allowed to be compensated for their hard work getting there first?<br />
<br />
Oh wait there is a time limit...Sony is just staying true to form by opening these planes to the masses.<br />
<br />
If sony had set the levels up in a progressive manner such as:<br />
<br />
You cannot even level to 63 unless you first achieve access (flags) to zones that drop spectrals, or you must achieve flaggs for the rune dropping zones before you can level to 65, I would have no problem with this.<br />
<br />
But, since they just made the overall level limit 65, that is what we are stuck with. <br />
<br />
I know there are lvl 60 spells I will never see in this game, but that is 1 or 2 spells, and I know there are some 63+ spells I may never see, but at least I want and deserve a shot at most of them.<br />
<br />
Has anyone met the 65 Shaman that leveled up when PoP came out but doesn't have one spell over level 63 just because he doesnt hang with right folks in game?  I won't be that shaman and have been on hold working on AA's at 63 for a few months. Now I can finally level and seek my spells.<br />
<br />
Those that paved the way should be rewarded and rewarded well for their efforts, it was a slap in the face to them after all their hard work.<br />

The different &quot;classes&quot; in EQ and how it affects our game.  You grey people need to lighten up.<br />

One thing that I find rather interesting is the way the rules change as the game progresses, making people at varying levels of gameplay seem like they are actually playing a different game altogether than the majority of gameplayers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">This doesn't belong in the Grey. It contains valid view points from both sides regarding EQ game play in &quot;general&quot;.<br />

Mods...my vote is leave it here and let the debates continue.<br />
<br />
Good thread in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">So basically the uber side of the arguement has come up with the arguement that hey.. we got there first.. so when every other mob drops a rune and a windblade(no **** you didnt use them.. but you all sure sold them for ~60k each) or a girdle of mithaniel.. hey thats your just due for zerging your way in first, and its right and good that they destroy the drop rates of anything valuable at all once other people then you all get in there. Nice =p<br />
<br />
I just dont buy into the logic that the first people into a pop zone deserve a rune off every mob and a blowjob to boot, and it should all be nerfed to hell by the time others work their way in. Which is basically what people have said. Some encounters were buggy.. so as payment you got free 60k gimme items and 65th spells off every other trash mob.. /snicker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Zorshaaka put it the best. There are pros and cons of both sides of things.<br />
<br />
Sure the fore runners may sometimes get bugged drops, get to things where they are more common or the occational mob that is too easy. On the other hand they have to deal with some incredibly bugged mobs/encounters, No spoiler info to work with, and the amazing cloth cap drops from time to time. Usually being first also gives exclusive access to the content such as it is for some period of time till someone else can kill it.<br />
<br />
Want some examples? How bout cursed death touching. How bout the Dting emp. How bout mr arch litch I got changed so many times I lost count. Or rallos zek being buggy as heck originally or the whole rathe screw job.<br />
<br />
People on the other end have other advantages. Well known strategies. Already knowing what drops the worth while loot and what doesn't. Often times loot thats gotten upgraded to be in line with RvR. Often times simply easier enoucters just because the game continues to progress. PoP release pretty much gimp the emp encounter. PoP spells alone added an extra 800-1k hps for tanks. 40% slow instead of 25. Messes made signifincantly easier. What are the down sides? more competition for the mobs sometimes dealing with harder mobs, lowered drop rates etc.<br />
<br />
If you think everythings so great being in the front runners guild. Get off your ass, get into said guild on your server and try it out for yourself. Otherwise just accept that there are advantages and disadvantages to both ends.</div></div><hr />
