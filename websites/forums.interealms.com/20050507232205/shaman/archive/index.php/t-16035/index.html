<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I need help here.  I just hit 55th, if that helps, and have something of a quandry.<br />
<br />
A lot of times I will be the groups only healer and slower and buffer and haster.<br />
<br />
Now I do have Canni III, Stoicism, and a Drogmor.  Although admittedly I still have trouble keeping my mana up at times.  Between buffing and continuously hasting 3-5 tanks, healing, and slowing the mobs I just cant seem to keep up.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but in Planes I am having some trouble keeping up with the action.<br />
<br />
I will usually lead off with Malosi especially in the planes, so Turgurs will stick, since resisted slow typically equals dead Shaman.  However in the meantime the tank is getting smacked on and needs a heal.  <br />
<br />
Usually it goes Malosi mob, switch to an S Heal on the tank if needed, then go back to Turgur's mob.  Does this seem right to the more experienced Shaman out there?  Today in PoV we pulled a crystaline golem and the Bard and SK dropped before I could even Malosi it.  I tried to chloroblast the but even that proved to be too slow in the end.  What was I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
Miraciously I managed to Malaise and Turgurs it while the Paladin seemed to have better luck, and we managed to kill it.  Still after that we moved to PoN.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I am humbly asking for some advice from the more experienced folk out there, it seems I am falling behind somehow and keeping the group back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You cannot do everything.<br />
<br />
You cannot haste, buff, slow, heal, debuff and keep up on mana. Something has to give somewhere. You cannot do it in pre-PoP zones, and it only gets worse there since the mobs hit so much harder.<br />
<br />
Get a cleric. Or a 58+ druid. They have enough healing that they can generally keep the healing under control, while you worry about the rest of it.<br />
<br />
And this wont change even after you get your 62 heal. Shaman can do so many things, but we cannot do all of it at once, and we kinda suck at healing. Our heal spells are our weak point. They consume far too much mana for way too little healing.<br />
<br />
You appear to be doing things right. There are just limits to how fast you can cast your spells, and how fast you can regen the mana you have used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It depends on the group (level / equipment / defensive AAs of the tank, backup healer, someone else for CC or to debuff the mob, duration of the fight) how much you can do. At lvl 55 I can't see you doing it all alone. May be in Karnors / HS / Sebilis but not in PoP zones.<br />
<br />
When you get quies, canni5, few FT items you can do much better. I duoed with an SK in BoT, had fun with 2 pallies in CoD, was puller / slower / healer (had pally and sk in group who healed too) in PoV (with NToV gear). Well, I'm not good enough to be slower AND healer in EP zones yet. As you can see there is a light at the end of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
BTW Stay in tear 1 zones (PoD LCY / RCY or PoN gargoyl castle / spiders are good spots) for few more level (till 58/59). XP should come faster there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I got into PoV at 60-61 it was a handful because I completely lacked the healing power or speed to even save the cleric if things got bad fast.  At 55, you really can't be effective and definitely can't act as the main healer for a group in PoV.<br />
<br />
Level up to 62, pick up a copy of Tnarg's Mending, grab at least one extra healer, and head back to PoV.  It will be a much more managable experience and your group will prolly be happy dying less. :p<br />
<br />
Just keep in mind PoV was originally intended for people who had passed a trail in PoJ...something that was pretty rough at L60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A shaman trying to heal a tank in tier 1/2 with only Chloro/Stoi is like trying to fill an olympic size swimming pool with a garden hose.  It CAN be done, but expect it to take a really really long time.<br />
<br />
At 58 it gets a little better with out incomplete heal.  We can heal 2K for 400 mana.  Its a sucky sucky heal compared to the other priests, but its the best one we get for a long time.  Ive regularly been duoing with a SK in PoV at the undead since 58.  Its not terribly effective but its good enough to make it worth the effort.<br />
<br />
Id say if you are really dying to be the main healer, Id say go to Droga.  Exp there isnt as fast as PoP but you can work a little more effectivly as healer there because things arent going ot be hitting for 300+ a swing. The cash is also good in Droga (sometimes 19plat on a regular kill) and loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Usually it goes Malosi mob, switch to an S Heal on the tank if needed, then go back to Turgur's mob.

I tried to chloroblast the but even that proved to be too slow in the end.  What was I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
What you were doing wrong was expecting to be healer in PoV at 55. I first went to PoV at 61, and wouldn't have coped as healer then, even using Torpor. At 55 I wouldn't advise being group healer/slower in even tier 1 planes, though you can do it. (I remember doing it - I could keep up healing in tier 1 typically until it came to an unslowable mob or a multiple pull which took most of my mana).<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be elitist or anything, but at 55 you have Stoicism and Chloroblast as your main heals, and they just don't cut it against PoP mobs, especially not tier 2 ones.<br />
<br />
Honestly, even just as slower, you'll be hard pressed in PoV at 55. You'll want to debuff before slowing because of agro on a slow resist, and because without excellent gear you'll drop very fast against an unslowed mob. The mobs will mostly be 60/61 and may well take a few casts of Malosi to hit and the 5 second cast + 6 second recast on that will be a killer.<br />
<br />
At 55, I did just fine as main healer in LoY, or similar, but not against PoP mobs. Even at 65 with Tnargs and Quiescence, I'd rather have a cleric in a tier 2+ group, since although I can do the job, clerics can do it better and I can stick to things I'm good at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if you cant do everything in the group, including tanking.. you are a poop shaman.  oh wait, thats not a group, thats soloing.. go solo instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't think it's elitist at all to tell someone that they're in a zone that's too high level for what they're trying to accomplish.<br />
<br />
When I was 61 in PoV, for example, it was pretty much a given that I could malo as soon as the critter was in range, and have slow on after it'd hit the tank for maybe one round.  There still wasn't any point in my healing (tanks) before slow landed, because my heal doesn't keep up with the damage they're dealing.  Which means that no matter how many times I healed, I'd still be losing ground...  And that's going to be the case, it seems, in any zone I'm in a full group with anymore.<br />
<br />
But even later on, I gotta agree with those above - you can play slower and healer, but the kills will be slow, and you'll have downtime.  Far far better to try to find a primary healer so you can stick to things bears do better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If i get a tell from someone I don't know to join a tier 2+ group I generally ask who is healing. If they say I am, I say no thanks get a cleric or even a druid. I'm lvl 65 with tons of AA but there's only so much one person can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dunno.  At 65 with the proper AAs you can do some sick stuff.  If I have VoQ or KEI, I can play healer, slower, haste, buff, and frankly still tank okay.<br />
<br />
At 55, you shouldn't even be trying that.  Your mana pool is smaller, you don't have canna4 or canna5, you are missing malo/malos, torpor/quiesence, all of the healing AAs, probably the majority of the good focus effects, and are probably in a group that is too low for the zone you're in (at least in regards to defensive AAs for the tanks).  Your level will also make landing the slows that much harder.  You're gonna get creamed.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I have to agree with an earlier poster.  Not to be elitist, but you are probably in a zone that's too high for you right now.  With the changes in exp, you might want to take your group to Sebilis.  Those should all be dark blue, have a good exp bonus, and you guys should be able to mow through them like nobody's business.  They also hit for a hell of a lot less.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I said I won't join certain groups without the group having another healer it's not because I can't, it's because I don't want to. I generally don't have much trouble getting a group so I can afford to be choosy. I've always felt that I was a back up healer and I never really enjoyed being primary healer. If I wanted to do that I'd make a cleric (yuk, heh).<br />
Ya I have close to 180 aa's and some really nice elemental gear so I can do alot of neat stuff. As primary healer I don't usually get to do much interesting stuff though. It's just a play style preference, not that I don't think I could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't think it's elitiest at all to say I'm simply over my head.  That's why I asked for advice after all.<br />
<br />
My guild asked me to go with them, because they needed a healer is all, and I was about the only one availble at the time.<br />
<br />
So I guess it wasn't so much me as being in a place a bit too high, which is a relief.<br />
<br />
Incidentally with a KEI I can usually keep up in PoI and PoJ groups in the same role.  I just guess PoV is another thing all together heh.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone, this believe it or not is a bit of a relief.  Good to know I'm just in a place too high for me, and not screwing up somewhere else instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If worse comes to worse any you are stuck as the only heal just make buffing your last priority.  I used to buff HPs and regen and that was it.  Then I got IoS and that helped with the tank stat complaints.  What I would do then is gauge the fight and use Soic as often as possible between the fights to save mana.  It also helps if you get all of the tanks to bandage and get one of the rangers (I think that's a class with a crappy heal) to patch you while you canni.  This makes the med time go by faster.  You are in control of the group when you are in that situation.  &quot;Hold pulls, pull one...screw you and your agi buff.&quot;  I actually kind of like it sometimes as it is a break from the slow canni grind.</div></div><hr />

Two things about this. One, I never needed to bother with Malosi in PoV at 55, try it without. And 2, if you are dying merely because of a resisted slow, I would seriously suggest more hp gear.<br />
<br />
Usually it goes Malosi mob, switch to an S Heal on the tank if needed, then go back to Turgur's mob.  Does this seem right to the more experienced Shaman out there?  Today in PoV we pulled a crystaline golem and the Bard and SK dropped before I could even Malosi it.  I tried to chloroblast the but even that proved to be too slow in the end.  What was I doing wrong? Slow before the mob gets there, and why are you using sup heal of the MT if you have stoicism. Stoicism is extremely mana-efficent, sup heal is not.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, that's my advice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Two things about this. One, I never needed to bother with Malosi in PoV at 55, try it without. And 2, if you are dying merely because of a resisted slow, I would seriously suggest more hp gear.<br />
<br />
You must be the luckiest shaman in the world. Were you grouped with an enchanter who was casting Tash? When I got into PoV at 60, I still had resist issues if I didn't lead off with Malo. Malosi has the same resist check as Turgur's Insects - so if he's having trouble landing Malosi, he's going to have trouble landing slow. Crystalline Golems are level 62, if memory serves... 7 levels above a 55. The rest of the wasteland mobs are 58 or so. I find it hard to believe that you weren't having some serious resists on slow, unless someone else was debuffing the mob's MR.<br />
<br />
<br />
Slow before the mob gets there, and why are you using sup heal of the MT if you have stoicism. Stoicism is extremely mana-efficent, sup heal is not.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, that's my advice :)<br />
<br />
Stoicism heals only 160 hp/tick, or 26.7 dps (not accounting for cast time). A mob that hits in the 500s and has a DD proc is likely to be pumping out considerably more damage than this, even slowed. Not to mention he was having trouble slowing in the first place. Slowing your melees is generally not a great idea during a fight, either.<br />
<br />
The advice given earlier in this thread was good. PoV is going to be rather difficult for a level 55 shaman. If you're grouped with an enchanter, life gets easier since they can Tash the mobs. Having some sort of unresistable MR debuff really helps. There are plenty of great spots where your group can rake in xp on mobs that are a bit closer to your level. There are fantastic dungeons with coin and decent drops: Droga, Chardok, and Sebilis spring to mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I wouldn't take this advice. Keep using Mal before you slow, especially in a zone that's this tough for your level. I have good gear and wouldn't dream of not debuffing a pull before attempting a slow. My group would kill me too.<br />
<br />
Also, Stoicism on the MT? Stoicism? Concentrate on getting the slow in, then chloroblasr or sup heal the tank. Don't feed the tank a spell that stops him attacking (effectively). Save stoicism for between fights and emergencies. Healing for 160 per tick in a zone where the mobs hit for double that is junk. At least Chloroblast/Sup actually heal the tank some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You are doing quite well. Generally, if you need a malo-line spell to make sure Turgurs sticks, mobs are too tough for you to be main healer. <br />
<br />
In a PoP exp group, with melees of same level hitting yellow to group mobs, and no other preists, shaman do not cut it as healer. You may do ok on a mob or two, especially with a higher level tank slumming it, but you are not going to be efficient as main healer. Groups with a cleric prosper, groups without a cleric spend a lot of timing begging for clicky rezzes and rebuffing. Wait for a cleric based group, get the highest tank who will join you, and jump into it--you will rock. If the tank is a paladin or a shadowknight with good mana regen, you can layer on a lot of dps without getting aggro. (You just need to know when they run out of mana for their best aggro spells). <br />
<br />
My thoughts are this: If it is slowable, you need to slow asap. Period. Your slow will equal more than you can ever heal. So, at 57 in POV, Malosinia til it sticks, then Turgurs, then gap heal secondary tanks that have gotten hit, or help druid with chloroblast, or catch mt while in 10 second wait for complete heal to land. When mob hits 80% or less, hit with a Bane of Nife. If group dps is a bit shallow, add an envenomed bolt at about 50% health.<br />
<br />
On enchanter tash, they cannot cast it right away. With decent puller, Malosinia never seems to get me aggro, even on multiple casts. You want to make sure it lands before trying Turgurs imho. Multiple Turgurs almost always earns me a visit. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>zyzygy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">actually, my dream xp group goes something like this:<br />
<br />
Me (healer/slower/buffer/haster)<br />
Hybrid Tank (Paladin is nicer because he also has a few buffs)<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
<br />
for the dps, i prefer noncasters, since my dream group has no form of mana regen, so am3 rangers and rogues work nicely.  i've done this in BoT a couple times before (usually people don't like the idea of me doing everything) and it works out fine.  the kills are insanely quick (especially if u got 2-3 am3 rangers) and the xp flows.  given, u need malos and quiescence and if u don't have kei, then can5, (ToA is nice too) but once u get there, it just plain feels good to be able to do so much for a group.  if i ever took this group to tier 1, i'd replace my hybrid tank with a monk for even MORE dps.  :D.  <br />
<br />
but..on to the actual subject.  yeah, i think you're in over your head.  i would never imagine going to tier2 and expect to be healer with out kragg's, and even with kragg's, i would not want to be healer in tier2.  i remember tier1 hitting fairly hard too, and would not want to be the healer of tier1 at 58 either.  i say XP in the old world.  money actually drops there, and the xp is actually pretty good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">at 55 it'll be rough .. it'll get better at 58 with kragg's .. and when you get Q at 65, you will be able to keep up with all those tasks. Hasting, buffing, slowing, debuffing and healing are all quite possible and you won't even run OOM, but .. you'll feel like a bard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Bigmeeno Said it all I think in the first respons to your post.  We can do a lot but we can't do everything.  I personally tend to leave healing up to another class better suited to the role, I can backup/filler heal np but main healing w/ my normal fuctions/responsibilties is a bit much.  When I do sometimes play main healer, my group better not expect me to be primary slower/haster as well.  First step to the road of playing any class well is know your limits, sure you can work to an extent beond them but some things just can't be helped we only got so much mana hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I just hit 55th ... in Planes I am having some trouble keeping up with the action.<br />

<br />
The only thing wrong here is your level.  I am assuming that the rest of the group was of similar level... That zone is balanced for a low 60s group, and golems can eat you if they get a few lucky procs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Between buffing and continuously hasting 3-5 tanks, healing, and slowing the mobs I just cant seem to keep up.<br />

<br />
Its hard to keep up when you are the only caster in the group.  Nigh impossible at that level.  Get a druid or cleric to join as primary healer and you will be fine.  You may be able to pull it off in non-pop zones now, and when you have all your spells and a good amount of aa you may be able to do it in PoP.</div></div><hr />

The root broke with the First at 2%, so I just Torpored and Ignored him till the melee came and peeled it off me. Sometimes being able to do it all is a fun thing.

Now at 65 and with the right AAs and all spells I can be the only healer, buffer, CCer with my ornate pants to some degree and slower in zones like PoV or BoT.<br />

Unless I have a headache I twobox my 65sk aswell and he is the MT, its nice to have a clr in the grp then since that takes away alot of the stress but I have still managed to do it all and being MT in BoT, taking out the krigers and the minimininameds :)<br />

<br />
Just wanted to add a couple things.  Last night I was with a group in PoV again, still 55, but this time we had a cleric.<br />
<br />
Worked without a hitch.  Cleric kept the tank healed, I Malosied, Turgur's, Crippled...and if mana permitted while I had KEI, stick a EB on the golem as well.<br />
<br />
So yeah Tier 2 its likely to be a while before I can do it all, if ever.<br />
<br />
However later last night I was doing buffs/heals/slows/hastes for a group in PoI zone in just fine.  Big difference there between the two zones.</div></div><hr />

Can your run of the mill shaman be main healer in the planes at the apropriate level to group there, and slow/buff/etc at the same time? not a chance. My gear is pretty good, I group with guildies who have good gear and lots of AAs, and I can do those things just fine in places like Sol Ro's tower (basically anywhere stuff doesn't mitigate). In the elementals, if the cleric goes linkdead, I can usually pick up the slack for a few minutes at least. When you hit 65, get quiescence, malos, and a bunch of other goodies it gets a lot easier. Plus, healing a 9k tank with a Blade of war is a lot different than trying to keep someone alive who's wearing mixed cobalt and has a frosty/fleshgrinder (or worse) combo.</div></div><hr />

I AM NOT A HEALER!<br />
<br />
Kraggs is the suck.   A lot of mana, slow cast minimal heal in planes.  I Q the puller and get ready to slow, spot healing as fight goes on to help out cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Bendarin: I can see not being healer on raids/etc, just tossing Q/Torp in where it will help, but do you actually refuse to be healer in groups? you'd rather sacrifice dps so you have to do less work? I was managing to be main healer in t2 and t3 groups without even having Q or torpor, in fact i prefered it that way, otherwise i'd get bored and start ****ing up, and i didnt even have the best gear considering i wasnt even guilded, had a bit of NToV pieces, and most of the rest was the best things i could find in bazaar aside from elemental playermades.. considering i quit just after people on 7th got into elementals. <br />
<br />
we ARE healers. we just do other things at the same time, if you refuse to heal you obviously like to get by without doing any work, in which case i pity you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Shaman are piss-weak healers. 2K on a not yet slowed mob is barely enough to cover the damage done in casting. Attempting to match PoP DPS with any other heal is either too slow (Torpor/Q) or too draining (chloro/sup). In any case you can't be concentraing on healing when you are trying to get a slow to stick (without being killed). Slower and healer are seperate roles in PoP (IMHO), even if only so you split the agro and have someone to cover your back.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Shaman can do everything, I was soloing in time with my pet ranger tanking!&quot; grognards are so familiar and tedious =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">/nod Yes seventh.Tikoko we are healers, though at the same time no we can not under all situations do everything and even if we can it's not always the most efficent thing either.<br />
I do agree folks that absolutely refuse to heal are the suk and the group if it has an ounce of sense will likely rep them before the poor ranger dies again =p /chuckle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ok I need help here.  I just hit 55th, if that helps<br />
<br />
A 55th level group simply isn't equipped to XP in PoV/PoStorms.  The mobs there are too tough for you, they are too high level.  Golems are low 60's with good resists, you only have a small chance of landing debuffs on them.  They are serious damage output (trippling for 600's).  <br />
<br />
You don't have the tools (Kraggs, Tnargs, Torpor/Quiesence) to deal with them. at your current level.  <br />
<br />
You CAN kill there, but it's not efficient or fast.  The individual XP is a bunch, but because they are so tough the killing and recovery time is long.  <br />
<br />
Go back to Tier1 zones which are the right level for you.  <br />
<br />
Get to 60th, with Malo, then you are fine for Tier 2.<br />
<br />
If you must go to tier2, then the shaman should be the puller, you pull with sini, and kite the mob until you stick sini and turgors then you bring it to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">First off, I concur with the majority opinion here that you were a bit light on levels/HPs/etc. to really be pulling this off, but once you hit 60...<br />
<br />
You can mitigate this crummy situation by using Torpor on yourself and then the tank just as the pull comes in (have someone besides the MA do the pulling) and then malo/slow'ing the mob.<br />
<br />
Time it so that Torpor lands on the MA a second or two before the mob is into malo range, and then hammer on the malo key until it starts casting and then follow with slow ASAP.  Stand right beside the MA when you do this, so that when you get aggro with malo, the MA can pull it right off you without moving around.  When slow lands, you will get aggro again, but then the MA can safely click off torpor to get aggro.<br />
<br />
You can also use root to force the mob onto the MA after the slow.  Since aggro is based only on proximity when a mob is rooted, you can accomplish a target switch by rooting the mob and then taking a step back while the MA steps forward.  With practice, you can even spread damage out amongst group members this way.<br />
<br />
Also consider using a pally or SK for MA duty in these situations, since their aggro generation is not as dependant on attack speed as a warrior's.  (Paladins are especially handy here because they can both cast root and hold aggro really well.)<br />
<br />
Other:<br />
<br />
(1) don't ever use the fast heal (or even the big heal) in these groups unless someone absolutely will die otherwise.  Its not as mana-efficient as torpor, and forcing your group to stand around just a few seconds between pulls will give you the time necessary to cann back that mana. The only person that should ever be getting a % or fast heal is the MA.<br />
<br />
(2) absolutely keep regen up on everyone; there is no more efficient heal than regen.  Also, leaving the 2nd or 3rd damage dealer at 1/2 or 2/3 health between battles tends to really encourage them to control aggro the way they should be and won't be a big deal if everyone is on the ball.  Rogues, monks, and rangers all have ways of avoiding unwanted attention (at the cost of some DPS), and wizards/mages at this level should know better than to get aggro.<br />
<br />
This may seem like a sub-optimal setup, but I have been in full groups with just me and 5 melees and have had it work out really well, even though nobody in the group was at full health for hours at a time.  Its all about maxing out mana efficiency and being with other players that understand aggro management.  Oh, and if you aren't currently a HP shammie, a group like this will rapidly make you a believer.<br />
<br />
Shaman, unfortunately, are a class that really dramatically rises in power later in their careers; the difference between a 55 and 60 shaman is night and day, compared to many classes.  Our healing abilities never get that good, but they are particularly weak throughout the 50s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is very much possible to play all of those roles, and keep the group going at a fast enough pace.  I've done it on a number of occasions, and the groups have done fine.  The only key is to have KEI, and make sure the group only gets single pulls (a good puller can pull this off), and Malo helps a ton.  <br />
<br />
Take 5-10 mins to get everyone buffed (Extended Enhancement comes in real handy in sitations like these).  Once you get the main buffs, the only buffs you gotta keep on them are regen and haste.<br />
<br />
Malo when the mob is in casting range, slow right when the mob gets to camp, you might take a few hits, but the tank will get agro fast enough.  Stoicism/Torpor yourself up, and make sure dogdog has been sent the command.  Then canni until the tank is at 60% or so, throw Kragg's on him, and keep canni'ing.  Eventually the mob dies, the tank is full health and you are near full mana from canni'ing and stoicism/torpor.  Remember, you're a shaman --- you regen mana faster than anything on the planet ;)<br />
<br />
My gear is in my sig, and you can see I'm far from uber, gear-wise.  Just takes some work, but you can keep a group going non-stop if you keep at it.  I might have to take a 1 min med break once every 5 pulls.  Still not bad.  I fight mainly in PoV, where mobs hit in excess of 500+, so doing all those tasks in higher-level PoP zones is totally feasible.<br />
<br />
You're a little lower level, so you prob wouldn't be able to do the same in PoV, hehe... but I think I used to duo with a 61 SK in the PoD courtyard when I hit 58, so you could prob keep a group healed with spam-heals pre-58 in lesser PoP areas, like the PoD flies and PoJ, etc....<br />
<br />
The 2000-heal at 58 helps you greatly in the healing department, and once you ding 60, I'd highly recommend getting Malo quickly... this one spell reduces your resist-rate by a massive margin.... and we all know 1 resist of slow in PoP can mean life-or-death in PoP zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I f I sat in boring ass XP camps I would say I could be main healer, which I have.  Fortunately my crew likes to challenge themselves and frankly I have a choice, I either slow the mob and let the tank die or I spam Q/Kraggs until I am OOM and we all die.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could read the rest of the message where I say I spot heal during fight, and oh yeah, I am responsible for CC until the enchanter can grab the 3rd or 4th add we have.  Yeah I am busy enough<br />
<br />
If you get bored in a group while not being a healer, perhaps you should see all a Shaman brings to a fight.  Oh, your retired and ebayed, wonderful a clueless 65 shaman is loose on your server.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah, I am a SHAMAN not A Sharuid or a Draman.  ANd, I am not a healer.  I am a Force Multipler!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">the only thing you are doing wrong is not telling your folks to back off until you have the mob slowed.  when we hit PoN everyone in my guild knew not to attack until i had it fully slowed.  our ranger would pull, root and nobody attacks till i give the word.   just tell them to back off and if they die, they know who's fault it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Actually you can do everything in PoV, but provided you have a lvl 65 tank who has enough defensive AA, hold aggro and can take beating while you slow.  A pally who can root and stun would be very good for this job.<br />
<br />
If a pally root the golem, you would have ample time to slow it.  Since you may get resisted once or twice and get high on the aggro list, you really need a tank who can stun the golem or better still, root the golem fast.  Otherwise, your life is in danger.<br />
<br />
I sometimes two box with my alt pally and he doesn't need a lot of healing once golem is slowed.</div></div><hr />

65 levels under my belt as a Shaman, thxinfo :)   What spell do I use to slow again?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">We certainly are healers. Just because your group of friends tries crazy stuff doesn't mean you still can't heal. If when a mob comes you have to choose between healing the tank or slowing the mob, get new tanks yours suck. The only time the tank gets a heal before slow is if the mob is malo'ed but unslowed and turgur's will be grayed out for more than a second or two. Otherwise the tank is still fine.<br />
<br />
At 55 we really can't due much, our major abilities except slow are all gotten at higher levels than that. At higher levels however, you can do it all. I've never had a problem healing and slowing for a group in Tactics pit or Teir 2.<br />
<br />
We can do alot of different things. its nice to say 'O ****!', then a few seconds later, 'It's cool I got it.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Well, I'll try to answer this without being called an elitist snob, lol.<br />
<br />
I say that pretty much you can't do it all at 55.  I couldn't and I consider myself a very hard working and smart player.  You just don't have the mana.<br />
<br />
I couldn't do this at 60 unless in easy zones with crowd control.<br />
<br />
I couldn't do this at 65 and light aa's in tier 2+unless with crowd control and good players.<br />
<br />
I do this in my sleep without any crowd control at 65 and 195aa's.  Why?<br />
<br />
In order of importance it's the aa's, then my skill level and lastly the equipment.<br />
<br />
But really friends, the shaman power curve explodes at 65 with all spells and about 100aa's and maybe some nice focus items.  Also, you are often blessed with a great tank with big aa's also which makes life a lot easier.  Don't think of it as unfair, think of it as something to look forward to and don't sweat it at 55, just grab another healer and have fun.<br />
<br />
So, if I may be so bold...if you find yourself in a group at 55 where they are expecting you to do &quot;it all&quot; let them know that it is not possible and do something about it - whether thats adding a healer or leaving.<br />

To be honest, the person who has my account has played, and understands high end shamans, and he has several friends/former guild members who are high end shms to ask if he needs help with anything. But hes still a clueless monk at heart ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I personally can't stand healing, I will backup heal and keep everyone alive when the cleric dies (happens occasionally =P) I'd rather have a cleric or druid in the group so I can malo/slow and then nuke til theres no tomorrow =)<br />
For the most part of my 50s up to 65 I grouped with people in my guild and our cleric was always 2boxed, which meant I did do more healing than I'd have liked, but I had to make up for the fact that our cleric would sometimes fall asleep =P<br />
I have the pleasure of playing with my boyfriend a lot now, who plays a cleric and is very strict about hes the only healer =P I practically have to tie him down when hes lom to let me take over for a few mobs<br />
I have to agree with the majority of the other people, with levels and the right spell its much much easier to do it all in a group. I only recently got Malo, and without it I wasn't comfortable being the main healer (no Q) in a tier3 group because a resist would mean me playing catch up</div></div><hr />
