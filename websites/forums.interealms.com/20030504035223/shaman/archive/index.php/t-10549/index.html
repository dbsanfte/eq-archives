<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">LoY site states that this expansion will have new spells.  Taking into account that Shaman's will get ~New~ spell (s) most likely spread across the range of levels ( akin to the Velious expansion) ... what are these new spells?    I've wandered through Lucy looking for clues ... but much of what's going on now seems to be the basis of NPC spells.    <br />
<br />
So the question is ... what if anything can we take from Lucy concerning new LoY spells.  ARE there clues within the current list of Lucy spells, which could be applied to LoY and our class?  If not, then what new direction of SPELLS (only) could the Dev's dabbling with on test?   <br />
<br />
Let me state upfront that there is a nice thread talking about direction for the Shaman class right now ... so go there in regard to changes in AA, Old spells, or abilities.  I'm only curious as to what's coming down the pike with LoY.   Here is the thread for debating the direction:<br />
<br />
Improving the Shaman<br />
<br />
Just as a update, here are the spells from Velious expansion listed from casters realm:<br />
<br />
1.   Lvl 34 - Shock of the Tainted - Single Target Poison Based Direct - Damage (Max: 230hp)  - Con. - Vendor bought - Mana 130 <br />
2.   Lvl 39 - Tumultuous Strength - Group Strength Buff (34) - Alt. - NPC Drop.  - Mana 150 <br />
3.   Lvl 44 - Blast of Poison - Single Target Poison Based Direct Damage (Max: 400hp) - Con. - NPC Drop. - Mana 200 <br />
4.   Lvl 44 - Summon Companion - Summon Your Pet to Your Location - Con. - E. Com. - Mana 50 <br />
5.   Lvl 50 - Spirit Quickening - Pet Only AC, Strength &amp; Haste Buff - Alt. - NPC Drop. - Mana 50 <br />
6.   Lvl 55 - Form of the Great Bear - Illusion Bear (Regen and Wisdom Buff) -  Alt. - NPC Drop. - Mana 135 <br />
7.   Lvl 60 - Focus of the Spirit - Single Target Health, Strength and Dexterity Buff. - Alt. - NPC Drop. - Mana 500 <br />
8.   Lvl 60 - Primal Avatar - The Ultimate Melee Stat Buff (No Component) - Alt. - NPC Drop. - Mana 325 <br />
<br />
To close things up ... each expansion has had a theme (so to speak).  What is going to be the theme for LoY?  <br />
<br />
To me most of the expansion are repeating themes ... adding some toys and buffs ~or~ level expansion with spells to support them ( with lots of Shaman grp and single buffs thrown into the mix as well).   Thus:<br />
<br />
* Kunark theme was based on expansion (50-60).  <br />
* Velious was based on toys and buffs (single and grp).  <br />
* Luclin was based on toys and buffs (single and grp) <br />
* NOTE: To me - Kragg's mending was a knee jerk reaction to the Druid petition only.   <br />
* PoP's theme is based on expansion again (61-65).    <br />
* LoY theme (if the Dev's keep to form) most likely is going to be toys and buffs (single and grp).   <br />
<br />
Will our community stand for a few minor toy type spells (Luclin Grow or Lvl 29 Form of Bear - anyone?) AND more buff type spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would love:<br />
<br />
* Group primal essence<br />
* Upgraded form of the great bear - more wis, acumen,<br />
more hitpoint regen, maybe a tiny bit of mana regen? (that might be asking too much)<br />
* Mob debuff that affects mob spell casting speed (slow for spells!) This would be cool, but probably too much to ask<br />
<br />
After our boring POP spell line up of rehashed old spells, it will be interesting to see if we get anything &quot;new&quot; like the cleric spell haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Group Primal Essence.... That would be nice.  Course, I can't seem to get the single target version.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spell caster slow is totally in line with something shaman's should get. Long overdue actually,they should have put it in when they buffed up all the caster mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have group primal essance right click on a hammer but it is self group only.  Still quite nice considering I don't have the single target spell.<br />
<br />
I bet the new mini torpor will be included with LoY and this will be very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spirit of Cheetah AA for shamans and druids would be pretty neat. I still like to use this spell in PvP, but I have found that I dont mem it as much from 1 - 58.<br />
<br />
Do you think replacing spells with AAs would be good or overpowering? So you can buy certain spells that you just hotkey and not have to memorize? For example, buy Bane of Nife in AA. Costs you maybe more mana to use but you dont  ever have to mem it?<br />
<br />
Just a thought I had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">we can expect not a shedload of spells... similar to Velious, I'm guessing 1 or 2 spells each at lvls 34, 39, 44, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63 &amp; 65, with an additional spell at lvl 65 being 'Obscene Avatar' and adding an additional +1 to all stats compared to the other 65 Avatar Variant.<br />
<br />
Though seriously. We can sit here bitching about spells, or we can be happy that we are getting more spells to our arsenal. I'm sure we'll be able to find a good use for them all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hear you Hrothgar but it's only a lvl 44 spell ... AGES after Infectious Cloud.    I would think what would get more wiztard's upset would be a Lure based slow spell.   But for me it makes sense that we should be able to partly slow a incoming group of mobs with lowered aggro by lvl 65.    If our class hasn't figured out how to correctly cast Slow by 65 ... Sheezzzz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You said forgive the names, Fascaser, but I really like a few of them...especially your pbae &quot;Miasmic Mist&quot;. Treacherous Infirmity is really creative as well.<br />
<br />
I've seen it posted recently and I agree 100%, that we should have an improved invisibility. I mean at -least- at level 60 or so, Id say is fair.<br />
<br />
<br />
....that, and I want &quot;Winged Courier&quot; please haha, actually though Ive always though as a shaman- some type of Eye of Zomm would be 'neat'. Now, Im not seriously suggesting we should get this type spell, but Ive always pictured it as working as Zomm yet it would summon a transparent version of ourselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bring back winged courier!<br />
<br />
PS I also really like some of the spell names you came up with, Fascaser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You can bet a few of those new spells on Test are indeed player spells for LoY (and probably more will start creeping in over the next few weeks).<br />
<br />
Why else would this spell (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3753&amp;source=Test) have aggro mods?<br />
<br />
In this case the spell was marked as Shadowknight/65 and they stripped the class/level listing off of it today.  Oops?  Didn't mean to show that as a new SK spell just yet didja?<br />
<br />
Or this one. (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3494&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
I kind of doubt a spell that summons an item and costs HP is an NPC spell. <br />
<br />
They know we parse those files so it makes sense they'd not tag the class/level on them just yet.   I'm betting their spells work for anyone unless they have a restriction set on them (meaning they could just bypass the scrolls and apply the spell directly to a character for testing).<br />
<br />
So I bet we'll start seeing some interesting spells pop up there over the next couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
In regards to what we get, I bet it's just more variations on a theme like mini-torpor.  If we're lucky we'll get group primal but I'm betting more group stat combo buffs that don't stack with Focus.  <br />
<br />
If I had a wish list it'd be Debuffs or buffs that go straight to AC and ATK, group Primal or better yet group Carnage, proc buffs for our pet like Beast Lords get or just general pet buffs (hopefully that last alot longer than spirit quickening).  Spell Slows would be damn nifty too as Glori mentioned.  When I saw that Luggald Blood spell on Lucy I thought it'd be cool if we could summon up globs of utility poisons to hand to Rogues but I doubt we'd see that because it would compete with their trade skill.<br />
<br />
What I don't really want are more heals unless it's regen oriented... I say more power to Clerics and Druids and their big heals... we're offensive priests and that's the way I like it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Reeannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If they are going to have any encounters simliar to PoP where multiple mobs spawn that are extremely resistant to Slow,  I would like to see an AE Malos.  It takes soo much time to individual cast this on 4-6 mob at a time; knowing that I could cast an AE version, and have it land on at least 4 mobs would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd love to see shamans get some nice Curse spells to cast. These could reduce spell casting speed of the mob, combat stats, HP and mana regen.. You know, all the curse goodness.<br />
<br />
Buffs which would really matter - skill buffs. Stats are worthless and stat buffs even moreso. Buffs which would boost the skills directly would be much more useful, as if boosting the &quot;level&quot;.<br />
<br />
Shamans should also finally receive a group haste spell. It could be combined spell, i.e. Haste + ATK, like chanters have, maybe would also have Acumen in it. And have less stacking issues then Bih'Li.<br />
<br />
Group invis would also be good. Dang, sucks to have to cast it single on every person in the group, when the group is you, cleric and 4 melee types. Group Levi spell. Group EB spell.<br />
<br />
Upgraded SoW spell - no need to make it levitate, but faster speed, stacking ATK buff, maybe also built-in Acumen. Improved Bih'Li, if you want.<br />
<br />
And so on. Oh, and put the damn OLD world spells on NPC VENDORS!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You brought up a point concerning the worth of any new spells to a lvl 65 person much less my feeble effort.  I struggled with what to do for the lvl 61 - 65 folks given that PoP expansion is so recent to LoY.   Yes - there should be spells for the 61-65 folks in LoY but I personnelly would not expect to see any major changes in this area.   The Dev's tend to be conservative concerning next expansion updates over content/encounters that they just finished.   So I tried to take that approach for the 61-65 spells.   Maybe we will be surprised here ... but I'm not counting on it.<br />
<br />
As to Charm ... I really thought hard about a lvl 60 something Animal Charm with a level base of 55.   But I know that the Druid community would rise up in Howls and Screaming over taking class defining skills.   Funny that it's not a two-way street in regard to class skills.   But in the end, I could not think up a Charm type spell that was useful that didn't step on some other classes toes.  IMHO - Shaman's should get the AA ability like Necro's to Raise the Dead - since we are a SPIRIT based class ... but to be honest Necro's get so few worthwhile AA's it would not be fair to them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Ok - it's on my thread so if I take a little side trip - don't shoot me.<br />
<br />
In addition to adding spells with LoY (For those that stick with LoY after the Foci nerfage outrage) I would like to see the Dev's bring more quests into the game.  The Druid quest for Potc is a great example of what they COULD do if they took the time and effort.  <br />
<br />
Plus, LoY could add a new wrinkle to getting spells ... spell flags.    Yep, flags for content such as gear, spells, etc.    IF I was doing some of the expansion work ... I would wrap some of the spells into quests/flags given by the Frog trainers.   By god trainers should have a expanded role in the game other than dealing out the first 100 or so training points and then everything else is just about useless.   <br />
<br />
Here's what I'm thinking ... you get into LoY and start talking to the trainers.  They will not talk to you about certain spells other than to drop hints that they exist.   After doing key events in LoY the trainers start telling you steps needed to get your spells thus flagging you.   BUT here is where I would make it interesting.   I would force people to go do things in the old world and return items as keys.  <br />
<br />
There are tons of weird, off the wall, hardly completed events in the game that these frog trainers could require before allowing you to continue to the next steps.    Easy Places like Kerra Island for lower level spells working up to higher level spells which require things from places like Veeshan's Peak or Sleeper's Tomb.   This serves Two (2) purposes ... 1. forces people across the board to use these under used zones  2.  Add a sense of purpose to getting new spells rather than some random Mob drop for a Random spell drop.   If you don't want the spell ... you don't do the quests.    <br />
<br />
Add the quests and spell flagging ... along with Potc type events that offer All/All gear pieces of value ... into LoY expansion could make it very interesting for all classes lvl 1 - 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Canabalize 6: Level 65/or AA: 3k hp to 1700 mana. (if aa: uses cana5 counter so you can use one or the other every 3min not both).  (if spell: 4-5min recast).<br />
<br />
ANY PBAE spell!  my god doing faction for sham just really blows.  A nice disease DD pbae would rock. But Fascaser's mana usage is way off. PBAE spells (almost) always have higher mana than damage.. like 900 mana for 850dd is the 49 wizard pbae.<br />
<br />
AE malo would be one of the most usefull spells I could ever have.<br />
<br />
<br />
We can always talk about the old idea of an &quot;out-of-body&quot; spell.  This has been hashed on ever since I joined the Crucible and would be so nice for sham role-play wise.  Basically you would FD but still able to move around. While under this spell effect you could not cast, attack, zone etc.  You would be a &quot;spirit&quot; and unable to interact with the world.  Good for scouting and wipe outs and as a parlor trick but not much else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Gurog<br />
<br />
Which one?<br />
But Fascaser's mana usage is way off. PBAE spells (almost) always have higher mana than damage.. like 900 mana for 850dd is the 49 wizard pbae. <br />
<br />
Miasmic Mist - Level: 44 - Mana: 250 - Con. – Vendor - Disease Based PB Area Effect - Casting Time: 5.75 seconds - Recast Time: 3.0 seconds - Area Effect: Disease Direct Damage (250) <br />
<br />
~Or~<br />
<br />
4. Taint of Infection - Level: 49 - Mana: 275 - Con. – Vendor: Yes - Disease Based Area Effect Direct Damage - Max Duration: Instant - Casting Time: 5 seconds <br />
Recast Time: 12 seconds - Actual Effects: Area Effect: Disease Based Rain Damage Spell (350) <br />
<br />
<br />
The Miasmic Mist is a PBAE - and the damage rate ( and ratio) IS way off ... it's way too low compared to any other classes PBAE near it's level.  I did that on purpose so all the other classes with castable PBAE's could NOT complain about Shaman's coming anywhere close to their power.   Quite frankly I would not mind a lvl 49 PBAE that was closer to the Wizards spell ( say a 900 mana for 650 DD ) but a nice Point Blank spell with a usable recast at ANY reasonable DD value would work for me.    The Taint of Infection is a Rain spell ... and it's Mana to Damage ratio is within reason of our other rain spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Yup an improved bear form would be good.. Form of the Cave Bear?   How about Form of the Wolverine (well it's kind of like a bear)?  Higher stats, higher atk, higher hp regen AND mana regen and raid shrinks you at the same time :)<br />
<br />
I really want to see a mana regen buff.  I don't really give a damn about losing Kragg's Mending because I have no desire to be bossed around by clerics in a cheal rotation (heh) but more mana would be a wonderful thing.  If mana doesn't come from the spirit realm (i.e. the shaman area of expertise), I don't know what does.<br />
<br />
In light of SCR and SCRM I doubt we'll see a buff that extends our buffs over and above that.  Just more focus items.<br />
<br />
I would very much like it if the shaman heal over time spells were made to stack with druid and cleric versions.  <br />
<br />
I wonder if we would ever see a group RGC.  Maybe not given Radiant Cure.<br />
<br />
My bet with those stupid str/dex buffs they threw into our spell list in PoP was because they couldn't think of anything else to give us.  They need to be thinking about it, seriously.  If they were more daring, they'd give us a new spell called &quot;Cutaneous Vision&quot;... target gains the ability to see all PCs without any clothing whatsoever.  It would be about as useful as.... well you know :)<br />
