<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jestice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently dinged 49 and proceeded to rush right off to Halas for my new spells highly anticipating my new dot.  Having purchased all available except for HOS I figured I would try my hand at an ice giant - make that my first kill with my new spells.  So out I ran and finding the entrace to Perma empty (due to a patch in about 15 minutes) I brought up my new dog - hit him with JB buffs and alarcity (no need to regen him - only using him for one kill), buffed myself and happily replace Scourge with Plague and Envenomed Breath with E-Bolt.  Switching my gear around to give myself my solo wisdom vs AC level that I feel comfortable with and checking my mana (80%) I faced my new foe and rooted him.<br />
<br />
Ok have one rooted ice giant - through a slow on him and send in the dog.  Canning a couple of times I cast Plauge - hmm there goes one bub of mana.  Root breaks - no problem melee a round while I cast root.  Back off and cast E-bolt - hmm resisted and I check another bub of mana gone. Cast again and it sticks breaking root (now down to maybe 1.5 bubs with canni going) - np I'll melee/canni him til E-bolt wears and then reroot and recast.  <br />
E-Bolt wears off - np root back up cast a quick heal on myself (guy hits a little harder than I am used to) and cast another E-Bolt and rush in to finish him off.  Ok he's dead but I think to myself gosh it seems like I used up a lot of mana - hmm new spells - didn't research it so well - zone going down so no time to look into this further.<br />
<br />
Next afternoon - I find myself back in the Dreadlands (I love this zone for soloing - just turn off ooc and shout) and I figure I will see how my mana seems to be this time. So I do all the preparations - dog/buffs/gear and run out to find my favorite foe - the drovlog.  Pulling with E-bolt (love the dot doing full damage as I run him back to my dog) and bring him back go Goner or who ever my pet of the day is.  Dog runs to give him a hug and I root him and apply Plaugue and another E-Bolt - dead drov and I am down bubs of mana.  OK he will die fast enough without Plague so I will switch that one over to Envenomed Breath.  Ah down time is much less. <br />
<br />
So I found myself evalutating the efficiently of my new spells.  Using the dot damage calculator for EQshaman and spell info from CastersRealm I find this<br />
<br />
E-Bolt  110/146/7 for 320 mana for a total of 1125 damage with MOBS regen built in	1125/320 = 3.51 dam/mana<br />
Breath	40/59/7 for 160 mana for a total of 446 damage with MOBS regen built in		446/160 = 2.78 dam/mana<br />
<br />
OK definitly seems to be more efficient to use E-Bolt but this just doesnt' seem so in practice. Hmm I log back in and decide on combining both E-bolt and Venom and this seems to work well.  During a minute of Down time I look over my gear thinking how nice a JBB would be and I clicked on my wrist piece - Chipped Bone Bracer and there is the answer right in front of me Affliction Efficincy II. On my other arm is a Serpintine Bracer with Extended Affliction II.  This changed the above equation to read like this.<br />
<br />
E-Bolt  110/146/7 for 320 mana for a total of 1125 damage with MOBS regen built in	1125/320 = 3.51 dam/mana<br />
Breath	40/59/8for 120 mana for a total of 504 damage with MOBS regen built in		504/120 = 4.20 dam/mana<br />
<br />
Now I know that time is not factored in here and speed is a very important factor in xp killing but I had so totally underestimated the power of focus items. To me a focus item is now something to be actively sought out instead of a nice addition to an item. Depending on the situation it may even factor in a bit higher on the HP/AC/Mana/Wis scale I look at when seeking out new gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I love the new focus effects.  My shaman is only lv 37 but I notice a big improvement from his focus items, especially the extended affliction bracer.  Improved healing is also very nice, have seen greater heals up to 358 so far.<br />
<br />
Currently saving pp for an ODS, and have started questing for a Circlet of Falinkan for him.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is there an on-line list of all the different types of focus types and descriptions?  I have a few items that have Mana Preservation or whatever and have no idea exactly what that means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a lvl 29 wizzy decked out in Damage Increase I (can't find an affordable lvl 2 or 3 one), Range Increase 2 and Mana Preservation 2 item.  The boost that gave him alone was quite surprising so yeah, I can bet it'll make a big difference.<br />
<br />
I've got Bane waiting to be scribed, I'll have to borrow the dot focus items &amp; try it both with &amp; without just to see how it goes :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hrendra An'ei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hrett's fairly decked out in focus items--ironically, pre-patch, I happened to have 5 or 6 items they changed already on her. One of the most amazing ones is Spell Haste; considering her lack of defensive ability, it is critical she be able to land spells at times, and cutting off the casting speed not only assists in that, but in overall damage output over time..<br />
<br />
A lot of people underestimated focus items, and complained about how the Improved Damage and Spell Haste ones were so difficult to attain. Seeing how effective they are first hand, however, I'm not surprised..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spells stick tons better a few levels after you get them.That's rule #1..<br />
<br />
Getting a fungi tunic and olbus death shroud (10% mana savings) will get you where you need to be on mana.  Also, proper canny dancing helps also.<br />
<br />
If you can't afford the former items, group, level, save.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Go get a coldain military wristguard and a crystalline torque or ODS and your equation for Ebolt becomes:<br />
1271/288 = 4.41 dam/mana</div></div><hr />

Never ever use C realm for spell data, they are wrong 99.9 % of the time.</div></div><hr />
