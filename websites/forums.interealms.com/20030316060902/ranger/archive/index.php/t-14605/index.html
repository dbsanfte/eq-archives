<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eldakka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just when they fix the BMB overwriting WP problem, I stop using WP and start using SoT which is overwritten by BMB :mad: <br />
<br />
SoT+CoP+CotR &gt; WP<br />
<br />
I wish they would change buff stacking so that a spell NEVER overwrites another buff of equal or higher level. It's not that hard to click off a buff so another can use its spot if you want it. I have to do that with BMB so I can use SoT, but having BMB overwrite it is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
The only time a buff should overwrite another is if it is a higher buff of the same line, or if it is significantly higher (e.g. 10 lvls). Aego should overwite symbols, but it should not overwrite druid skins (unless skin is below lvl50). If you want aego, click off skin. simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On a raid, advise the paladins to cast BMB first so that you can buff with SoT for those that want it afterwards.  Explain that if they want to ninjabuff you 'because it's funny' you will be casting Annul Magic on them while they're tanking and removing their Aegolism, 'because it's funny'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eldakka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh i like that...starts to mem annul magic</div></div><hr />
