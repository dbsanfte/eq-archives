<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have faithfully tried to max my combat skills, and now at lev 27 am ALMOST maxed in Offense/Defense and Piercing.  I need to work on my 2h blunt though and am wondering, with all the expansions, what would be a cost effective (I am poor) 2h blunt be at my level.  In the old days I would have said Observer Staff, but there got to be better gear out there now.  I am looking forward to all your imput.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you need to train 2hb, get yourself a Ketchata Koro Mis (spelling?) for like 25p or thereabouts.  7/30 2hb, shaman usable.  You could also get an abandoned orc shovel from Rathe (its slightly faster) but the Ketchata is much better looking.  :)</div></div><hr />

From more expensive to less, <br />
<br />
Granite face grinder 29/36 +10 Wis/Int/Str <br />
Brawl Stick, from 30/40 to 32/37 <br />
Fungus covered tarmok staff 30/45 +7 disease bane, effective 37/45 if target fails disease save<br />
Drakkel Icegrinder 27/45, procs 30dd<br />
<br />
If you want to get your skill up, use a fast crappy weapon.  If you want to do damage, get your skill up and use one of the above or something like it.  Good ratio doesn't do much if your skill is in the toilet, and something with a speed of 30 or less will get your skill up quite a bit faster than something with 40+.  GL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't forget Blight, Hammer of the Scourge.  Only casts its dot at level 45, but it casts it often, and it has an initial DD component that is nice.  28/45 I think, something like that.  About 5k on my server.<br />
<br />
Drakkell Icegrinder is a great way to go.  I think it starts proccing at like level 1 or something, and it procs sometimes five times a fight.  It puts out plenty of melee damage, is dirt cheap, swings relatively quickly, and has that nice frequent DD.  I'd suggest getting it and keeping it for a long time.  Only 200 or 300 plat on my server, and well worth it.  <br />
<br />
A tip on improving your skill levels with weapons -- start each level with your one-hand weapon that you have the most skill in or your fastest one-hander weapon.  Now go max skill in offense first so you at least have one reliable weapon, but more importantly so that your offense is maxed.  You get 5 skill raises in offensive per level, and being even a couple or a few behind can make a big difference.<br />
<br />
Once your offense is maxed per your level, bust out the two-hander.  It will now be more effective in your fights, and that matters a lot if you are soaking up hits with no shield on because you're using a two-hander.  You want to be overcoming your vulnerability when using no shield by racking up the hits as much as possible.  It's hard enough surviving with no shield in melee without having a crappy offensive skill too.<br />
<br />
So max offense first, worry about lagging weapons skills after.</div></div><hr />
