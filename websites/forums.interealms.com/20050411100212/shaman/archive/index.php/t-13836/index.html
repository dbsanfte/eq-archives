<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nygaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello everyone<br />
<br />
I am looking into connecting to everquest with the help of a http-tunnel but for it to work i have to get everquest to connect to the IP 127.0.0.1 and I was wondering if anyone here know the sollution.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try editing the hosts.txt file?  Just a guess... Even if it works you'd have to redo it every time you run the patcher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are trying to have it connect to the localhost?<br />
<br />
127.0.0.1 is defaulted to localhost.localdomain localhost.  <br />
<br />
I don't see how you could get this to work unless you are running an EQ server on the local box.<br />
<br />
Even so you'd need to specify port 80 and from what I had read EQ uses random ports.  <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm misunderstanding you but what makes you think you need to connect to 127.0.0.1?  Is there a specific error you are getting?</div></div><hr />
