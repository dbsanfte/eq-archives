<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a little bit of math. Some people call it theoretical &quot;bullhonkey&quot; but nevertheless here it is. I did some investigation of how loot drops actually happen in LDoN.<br />
<br />
-Class 1 Items: These items are mediocre at best. The best one we have found so far was a 25 HP Vengeance 2 item, with a few stats and resists here and there. These items are characterized by a very infrequent drop rate off of total trash mobs. The best comparison I can draw is with Spectral Parchments in BoT. An infrequent drop valued at a decent cost, dropping off of a trash mob. These aren't a problem<br />
<br />
-Class 2 Items: These are the best and worst items. Best in the sense of reward to effort, worst in the sense of being poorly thought out. These items drop off of &quot;named&quot; mobs in dungeons. When a named is killed, a Class 2 item is guarenteed to drop. Not only are they a guarenteed drop, but they are exceptional items. Most over 50 hitpoints/mana, some with focus or special effects and riddled with stats and resistances. The problem with these items is not their statistics but drop rates. And it's a big problem. The number of named mobs on a map varies widely, and the average I have seen is about 2 on a typical assigned adventure, and 4 if the entire dungeon is torn through. That means one can expect 3 pieces of very decent loot per 90 minute run. 30 minutes per piece of loot.<br />
<br />
Second problem with these items is they are not NODROP. The vast majority are droppable, meaning sellable. Meaning inflation. Meaning disruption of economy. <br />
<br />
-Class 3 Items: I have little experience with these items. They drop in LDoN raids. I do not know how difficult they are to obtain but I do know they have incredible stats on them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It takes about 1000 points to break the magic mark - when you really see truely exceptional items available on the adventure merchants. Do some division and that comes out to 20 adventures for one of these items. Let us just assume that the average adventure, when considering linkdeaths, bad groups, unlucky failures, etc takes 70 minutes to complete. Do a little more math and that comes out to about 23 hours of your time for a vex thal quality item. Considering these are single groupable adventures, doable with a group of friends, 23 man hours for a piece of loot of such a calibur sounds a good enough deal alone.<br />
<br />
Maybe my server is unique in this behavior, but at this moment there are 10 people in Bastion of Thunder. The zone that previously was plagued with overpopulation problems. The zone that couldn't go 15 minutes with under 80 in the zone. Everyone is playing LDoN for the reasons above: its free loot for anyone who participates at this point. Free, limitless, effortless loot that can be resaled for boundless money.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I wont go further into my own opinion about this, but I will say if Sony stumbles across the reality of the situation as I have (and they undoubtedly will, although they have a habit of doing it in the wrong place at the wrong time) You can expect a whoppin' nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi there,<br />
<br />
I think your post has lots of merit.  But, I think that you are overstating the quality of the loot and the resale value of the stuff.  You are 100% correct that it will trash the existing loot economy, but every expansion does that.<br />
<br />
Now, if the stuff was 100mana 100 hit point stuff it's a different story.<br />
<br />
I think it is a good idea to raise the average level of equipment for everyone.  The folks in strong guilds still have much better stuff and the non-guilded or newer players will be happier and less gimpy.  Heck, that's a good thing, right?<br />
<br />
Respectfully yours,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually, as u said urself, folk are leaving OTHER zones to do ldon ones; therefore the rate of items from the other expansions flowing into the economy drops.<br />
<br />
So it is less disruptive as a whole, than the scenario that u have stated.<br />
<br />
However each expansion so far has beed candy land for a few weeks foloowed by a wackaday time with the heavy nerf bat.  SO ldon will no doubt follow that course too:(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Now I have little experience in LDON as I have only gone on 2 adventures so far but in the 2 adventures I went on I only saw 2 good items drop... both in your ranking class would be class 1... One was an augmentation that was of the &quot;everyday&quot; (for lack of a better term) variety and the other was a fist from a named mob in Mistmore.  I also only have a lev 49 Sham as my main so I haven't even begun to think about Vex Thal type equipment and the time it takes to get it, but I do have to say that it is nice for the casual player like myself(would love to play more, but my wife would kill me) to see stuff with stats on it drop.  I am used to being excited when I see a fine steel weapon drop because I know I can sell it for 5PP let alone what I might be able to sell one of these items for.  <br />
<br />
I know its hard for the people that have put in the time to get their uber stuff to see these items drop, but its nice for someone like me.   In all the stuff I have read, LDON is for the casual player, like myself and the 2 adventures I have gone on have been some of the best times I have had in EQ... even though my first adventure I died 3 times, I felt urged to run back in and see if I could get that crucial heal off in time to save one of my group members from dying.  Unfortunately I think it will be nerfed because the uber guild farmer types will do just that.  But for the time being I am enjoying it while I can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont think its anything to get worked up about.<br />
<br />
So what if it takes 23 hours to get an item that you say is equal to Vex Thall loot? How long does it take for a raid guild to clear Vex Thall?<br />
<br />
And to me your estimate of 23 hours needed to make 1000 points seems awfully optimistic. And the people that might be able to pull this off probably have very little use for any of the loot that drops except the agumentations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From your classifications, in completely clearing 7 dungeons, I've seen 1 class 1 item drop, and no class 2 items.  Perhaps I've been unlucky, or you've been overly lucky?<br />
<br />
And is 23 hours for a decent upgrade really that bad?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">People aren't doing LDoN adventures because they're after specific loot; it's a new expansion and everyone is checking it out. Even LoY was packed the first week it came out, and nothing of value dropped there. So far the biggest problem with LDoN is that the experience sucks. People who want AA's will eventually go back to PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And is 23 hours for a decent upgrade really that bad?<br />
<br />
Farm the mobs for the emp key / VT shards for your whole guild and then ask this question again.<br />
<br />
I don't mind if you can buy ssra / VT quality gear. But the price should be ca. 5000 points. 10k+ for EP quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">God forbid should someone who's not in an uber guild be getting decent gear!  Sounds like serious sour grapes to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think its great that all kind of people can get upgrades.. The thing I'd like to nerf tho is the droprate of Words of Apparition.. That word are dropping like gnoll tooths in bb..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">First of all I agree with what some others have said; Sony always takes a giant nerf bat and beats a new expansion silly after the general population has had a chance to get hooked on it.  Its like many new restaurants do with their portions.  They give large portions when they first open and then cut back once they’re established.  <br />
<br />
But I feel some people’s “panic” over the quality of some items is silly in the extreme.  So what if I, a member of a small guild, can finally get decent gear upgrades without going to the elemental planes?  How is that hurting, or even affecting anyone else?  Perhaps I’m naive, but I thought the reason we were all playing this game was to have fun.  Okay, so giant, monster guild X worked their way to the elemental planes and has super duper gear.  I would seriously hope the reason those guild members did this was to have fun.  If the only reason these people played this game was the end and not the means, then I feel they are in need of a reality check.  If playing EQ is work and not fun, then that time could be put to better use in the real world.  If they’ve spent their time in EQ having fun then isn’t that a reward in and of itself?  So if these people are having fun in the planes and I’m having fun in LDoN, what’s the problem?  We’re all having fun and getting cool stuff.  I would think this is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">These kind of posts piss me off. When the devs read this crap, they think, &quot;wow, they think its too good, guess we should cut it back a bit&quot;. I think we deserve some decent loot, and none of the stuff that I have seen yet is going to be game changing. Hell, the betabuff shaman on beta server had 1k more hp, 100ac, and resists 100+ above my characters stats, yet wasn't half as good as some of the magelos i see from here on a daily basis. Don't you think a 65 character deserves to see some half way decent loot drop??<br />
<br />
I think we should be complaining that the stuff isn't as good as it should be, and doesn't drop enough!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think the math is wrong and the analysis is equally wrong.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen anything like this dropping, and frankly it probably should.  <br />
<br />
LDoN should be addressing the disparity in gear between those who raid in large herds and those who don't.  There ought to be a disparity, but it's too large at present.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I've only seen crap twink items drop so far.  Not a single thing I'd actually use.  I guess I'll horde my points up and see, but folks are stupid if they say &quot;it only takes an hour&quot;.  In ideal situations, from when you zone to when you leave, sure.  We did that twice last night.  But our TOTAL time was more like 4 hours getting grouped, waiting for our friend, dicking around, etc.  And it was totally normal stuff, just like you'd see anyway in any situation.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I think PennyAntics is about as wrong as possible based on what I've seen so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You are seeing this from the perspective of a level 60+ and are seeing tons of good loot drops. My level 35 SK saw 3 augments drop in 4 adventures. That's right--&gt; 3 &lt;--. The first was +6 SvD, the second and third were both +2 STA. The group made an average of 25pp per adventure and a few new foraged items were found. Is that uber for level 35? Will those +2 STA augs unballance the game? I seriously doubt it. Sony can bring out the nerf bat for the upper levels, but leave the lower level stuff alone. Or beef it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've done 7 L 65 adventures so far, all normal difficulty. For perspective: I've been in two VT capable guilds, but never gotten into the elemental planes. I quit my first heavy-raiding guild (and EQ for about 6 months) a few months after PoP came out, and the new guild is just starting to swing at Bertox and such. So I don't have any elemental items, but have a lot of VT gear (8 VT drops so far, and none of them junk). So my stuff is pretty darn good. I do still have a couple mediocre slots - and some lousy salubrious heraldic boots (crafted: 30 ac and 30 hp). Oh, this is on my bard. My shaman's only L 56 at present. <br />
<br />
Haven't seen anything I want drop in LDoN yet. Haven't seen anything I'd want on a vendor yet, except for augments. Haven't seen anyone POST anything I'd want yet, except for augments. So to say that uber loot is dropping like rain is silly. <br />
<br />
I have seen a couple nice items drop. A 14/21 ranger-only axe, a 20/22 pal/sk hammer, and a belt with Improved Damage IV. But the belt has 25 hp/mana on it, not 100 or even 75. The stats are quite weak, except for the ID4, which certainly makes it a nice item. The weapons are also low hp... about 40 I think. <br />
<br />
I don't have the slightest problem with non-uber L 65's being able to get ToV-quality weaponry. How old is the Velious expansion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In 4 adventures, I've seen 3 augments drop, each with +6 to a single stat, I think they were: +6 sv fire, +6 sta, +6 cha.<br />
<br />
I've also killed a few minibosses, and seen 2 Crypt Robber's Chestplate (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=44282) and a Lupine Frenzy Earring (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=43403) drop. The BP is similar to a Tae Ew, the earring was better for me than my Silver Hammer Earring, (and wasn't an upgrade for anyone else) so I'm wearing it now.<br />
<br />
From my limited experience and from links going over guildchat, seems that there's some loot dropping which is reasonable for the level and difficulty, and the quantity doesn't seem too far out of whack either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">20 successful missions in 23 hours?  Ok on Normal I can see it, but you're not accounting for travel time, time to get the groups together, and recovery time.  Not to mention that people don't do more than 2 missions end to end usually, so you'd have to be getting new people all the time, who may or may not be competent enuf to contribute.  I do agree that some people with uber equipment and lots of playtime and lots of friends who are like themselves are gonna blaze right thru this expansion and get some kinda kewl item real fast.  But the vast majority, this will be a struggle.  <br />
<br />
I didn't know the better augs weren't no drop . . . that will change I'm sure.  But honestly, shouldn't a group that succeeds be entitled to seeing at least one piece of lewt for their efforts?  <br />
So far I think the lewt part is balanced.  <br />
Remarkably balanced expansion actually.<br />
<br />
So far I've done only two missions, one hard and one normal.  Success at both, and I spent my points on two of the three 60-point spells that unlock chests.  I figured those would be important to have for adventuring purposes.</div></div><hr />

These all look might fine to me but they are 760 points each - thats 5320 points for the full set. This means more than 100 successful adventures  in the same zones and since this isnt anything you can do solo it bet there will be guildmates that have similar interests in other dungeons. So this means it gonna take an aaaawwwful long time to get those points collected. Unless I have misunderstood how you can spend points gathered in other dungeons.<br />
<br />
But the keywords there for SoE is &quot;aaaawwwful long time&quot; which means more cash in their pockets. So I dont seen any big nerfs of these things in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Done 4 adventures so far, at level 63-65 and not seen one named mob yet. I have seen 3 +6 augments drop, and not a SINGLE piece of loot. Plenty of cash drops, but no decent loot at all.<br />
<br />
Please tell me how the hell you have seen so much loot Penny :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Soulcraver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You're either incredibly exaggerating or incredibly lucky with the RNG.  I've not seen drop rates like you say in the least.  Heck yesterday I went through an adventure without anything dropping.<br />
<br />
A VERY small percentage of the player base is going to be able to maintain a rapid kill rate over several adventures per day--due to many factors--not the least of which is player swapping, afks, travel, gathering groups, logging due to RL stuff, LDs (which I've seen a couple so far), unforseen failures (due to a LDs)..... Those people always get the most and the best which is fine.<br />
<br />
However, for the determined casual player I would guesstimate that from start to finish (i.e. gathering group, buffing, moving and finishing adventure) the time is more like 2-3 hours (that's a full days play for most).  Now looking at the points required to buy things and augment them properly you're looking at one months time per item--maybe slightly less.  AND that item still is only 60-70% of VT quality when you consider its totality.  Hardly overpowered.<br />
<br />
The ONLY thing this expansion does is close the gap between those that raid and those that don't.  It also adds back some fun.  And as mentioned, if you're not getting any fun why are you even playing.</div></div><hr />

Second problem with these items is they are not NODROP. The vast majority are droppable, meaning sellable. Meaning inflation. Meaning disruption of economy. <br />
<br />
[QUOTE]<br />
<br />
I don't think this is how inflation works.  Inflation is an increase in prices or a decrease in purchasing power of currency.  Inflation occurs when there is a lot of puchasing power (i.e. cash) and no increase in the supply of goods available.  Vendors will set their prices higher because demand will be up due to more disposible cash.  Now, a lot of platinum drops in these dungeons (200pp per person split for an hour is pretty nice for a level 60-65 group), but it's nothing to change the economy of the game.  I can make more money per hour by soloing for tradeskill drops in EPs.  If you say this fantastic loot drop commonly off named dungeon mobs, then there should be an abundance of them.  An increase in the amount of goods does not lead to inflation unless the amount of purchasing power increases faster.  (Note: I've only done two adventures so far and the dungeon boss dropped nothing but platinum or research words.)<br />
<br />
In general, when expansions with new items come out, people try to &quot;cash in&quot; on other players' stupidity by charging outrageous prices for gear that is similar to items already out there that sell for a fraction of the price.  The EQ economy will be fairly unaffected by LDoN after the &quot;oh wow, shiny, new things&quot; phase wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Now looking at the points required to buy things and augment them properly you're looking at one months time per item--maybe slightly less.  AND that item still is only 60-70% of VT quality when you consider its totality.  Hardly overpowered.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd say more like 40-50% of VT quality.  When augmentations of FT5, Preservation of the Akheva and +X% to *insert skill* come out, then I would be scared.  Many VT items have resists between 12-20 to all resists, and those with fewer than all resists have even more on the ones they do cover (e.g. Crown of Ambivalence, Ring of Resistance, etc).<br />
<br />
Also, I'd rather spend the 5 hours it takes to do the AHR cycle and pretty much be assured an upgrade than spend dozens of hours in LDoN hoping to buy a so-so item that I would then have to buy augmentations for.  In the time it would take a VT-enabled person to buy and upgrade a single LDoN item they could have gotten 4-5 drops from the AHR cycle.  My guild has only done AHR five times and most of the loot up to her is in danger of rotting; applicants usually get it because members pass on it.  The only loot that doesn't rot (and will never, probably) is from AHR herself.<br />
<br />
LDoN was released to satisfy the people who can't get into end-game guilds (either because they're jerks or they don't have the correct playing times) and the casual players wanting a little more out of the game than getting trained in BoT because someone wants an ornate drop.  Raiding (for equipment) is fun, but not every gets to do it and benefit from it.  It's nice to know you can spend a maximum of 90 minutes and get closer to the goal of better equipment.</div></div><hr />

Jzak made a good point here, and it highlights one of the real, and positive, changes in EQ due to LDoN. It is now possible to make incremental progress toward getting new gear. This didn't use to be possible, except indirectly in some guilds due to their loot systems. Now, if you want something specific, you can work toward it, and keep making incremental progress over your play sessions. I vastly prefer this to the rare spawn - rare drop system of getting decent loot, where you can spend ten hours sitting there trying to get an item, not getting it, and having absolutely no progress to show for your effort, when you're done. It's much more enjoyable to know you've accomplished something when you log out at the end of an evening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>eyeball</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">This is totally wrong and you're just freaking out over nothing.  Here is an item thats even better than the ones you think are dropping.  It takes 1500 points to get loot equal to ornate armors (minus the clicky):<br />
<br />
Immortal's bloodied Robe 18ac, 13str, 11dex, 10int, 90hp, 110mana, 12sv f d m with 3 slots (2 type 2, 1 type 3). pure casters only but I assume there will be a set in different camps for different classes.<br />
<br />
Now should that be nerfed?  I don't think so.  Your calculation of the man hours required is totally flawed, theres just no way to get even a 1k piece in 23 hours of play time.  Correction, if your whole group is Time enabled and is a bunch of crazy mofos, then yes, yes you can get those VT level items thats totally useless to you within 23 hours.  Your  assumption of each mission taking only 70 minutes with linkdeaths, bad groups, unlucky failures, and etc...total BS.  I'm sure you might get one or two mission within 70 minutes but on average, at least 90 minutes.  You have to consider time for finding/getting a group ready, finding a mission and buffings before going in.  And bad luck can screw up your mission totally, not just take more time.  Even if you have a full group of friends playing, do you expect everyone to be on and having enough people to cycle through for replacements?<br />
<br />
In my mind, those class 2 items you listed are going to be useless to a 65 character and everyone is going to be going for the class 3 stuff like the robe.  So you would really need 1500 points which equals to 30 missions at level 65.  For those 30 mission, lets say the shaman armors drops in Rujarkian Hills, do you really expect all your friend/guild mates to give up points they need in other camps just so you can farm points for your own armor?  No one is going to sit through 30 missions for weeks just in 1 camp, you'll be cycling through a bunch of different ones.  Thats not even considering the high level augments you need to slot those armors...another 1.5k each for the high level +50hp/mana ones.  Or how about this...there are even better armors than those, stuff equal to element armors for 5k, what are you going to do then?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I've successfully done 6 of these dungeons now, and I would hardly say that I've been overwhelmed by the loot drops.<br />
<br />
Basically, we saw a fairly nice face piece (whose name I cannot remember, but it was slightly better than my honorary faceplate from PoV) and a planar lance of torment (a so/so weapon that nobody wanted) and an ancient tome of necromantic snazziness which is not even close to being as good as my enchanter's blood bladed dagger or tacticians bulwark (both easy to obtain drops in Tactics or bazaar for that matter).<br />
<br />
Now, all that being said, some of the stuff I have seen on the adventure merchants is pretty nice.  Will it turn out to be as good as VT gear?  I doubt it.  Some of the VT stuff is incredibly nice, considering the various focus effects it has and so forth.   Even if it DOES turn out to be that good, though, why is that necessarily wrong?  Some poeple do not want to play the uber-guild game, but they still deserve to have a good time.  If they get a nice breastplate, who is really hurt?  You?  Not really, these are people that aren't competing with you for raids anyway.  Are they hurting themselves?  That doesn't seem likely; they are working toward a reward that is reasonable for the time invested.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the time invested, I did find some of the estimates to be somewhat interesting.  My experience has been a minimum (from start to finsih) of 2 hours per dungeon (that includes group forming, travel time, buffing time, doing the dungeon, and loot distribution afterward).  If the so-called VT loot starts at 1200 points (picking a number out of the air here) you would need to spend around 46 hours doing just one set of dungeons.  That hardly seems unreasonable.  Perhaps people who have done their VT key have a valid complaint, but heh, guess what?  Luclin sucked and had lots of annoying time sinks.  Deal with it.  If you did your VT key, you got great loot 2 years before everyone else.  That's all good and stuff, but to hold it against the other players who arent into that seems sort of mean-spirited.</div></div><hr />

I have only seen 1 mob that I consider a &quot;boss&quot; that dropped something. The rest of it seemed to be random. I have also only seen more than 2 augmentations drop in the same dungeon on one occasion. That was the final one that I did last night (that we failed by 2 minutes).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">These items drop off of &quot;named&quot; mobs in dungeons. When a named is killed, a Class 2 item is guarenteed to drop. Not only are they a guarenteed drop, but they are exceptional items. Most over 50 hitpoints/mana, some with focus or special effects and riddled with stats and resistances. The problem with these items is not their statistics but drop rates. And it's a big problem. The number of named mobs on a map varies widely, and the average I have seen is about 2 on a typical assigned adventure, and 4 if the entire dungeon is torn through. That means one can expect 3 pieces of very decent loot per 90 minute run. 30 minutes per piece of loot.<br />
<br />
The statement about named mobs always dropping loot are FALSE.  My first adventure on the first night, we were asked to kill a named.  We did and when I looted him (I was ML) he didn't have anything on him.  Not even pp.  So that takes away a big factor of your arguement.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone is in an uber guild with time/elemental gear. LDoN made better stuff, obtainable to the casual gamer, while still being challenging. It's a nice thing not having to camp for a huge amount of time to get a nice drop. Or not having to moan about stealing another camps mobs etc. LDoN is good. It isnt overpowered. It's not gonna get nerfed.</div></div><hr />

There's a difference between named and the Assassination mobs.  The Assassination mobs in my experience are not supposed to have loot.  They are your goal.  The named mobs are the ones that are just slightly harder than the normal mobs and slightly easier than the named.  They will have loot and are scattered in random places throughout the dungeon sometimes.

That of course is winning each time. <br />
<br />
    Think people have to remember they can only scale it so much to keep people from looting up to quick. If somoene has lots and lots of playing time and they try to make it take longer for that person how long is the more normal player going to take?<br />
<br />
 600 points taking 24 hrs is over a week or so for the normal player. Heck 3 hrs a night monday through friday is only 15 hrs and 9 on the weekend thats still playing quite a bit and even than would have to win each adventure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">To get stuff that is VT quality or better you have to do a lot of adventures.<br />
Math time:<br />
<br />
1492 for VT quality item with say 3 slots in it.<br />
1150? for each of 3 +40 HP or +40 mana augments or a FT augment or something<br />
= 4942 points<br />
<br />
51 points for a victory on normal.<br />
<br />
You are looking at doing 97 adventures in order to get a super high end item.<br />
<br />
In comparison:<br />
You can get a VT key completed in about 2 days of hard work.<br />
Side effect of VT key is a good ring that is worth the effort in itself really.<br />
<br />
Now, once your guild is keyed, it takes about 7 hours to clear 10 named in VT.<br />
Include travel time to VT and you are looking at about 9 hours start to finish.<br />
In that 9 hours, you will get about 30 items to drop.<br />
If you have a raid of say 60 people, that means you have to raid VT twice on average for every person on the raid to get an item.<br />
So you are looking at about 18 hours of work for a new item if you raid VT.<br />
<br />
The average adventure will take about 90 minutes with travel time if you are really cruising through all your adventures and finding reps quickly.<br />
1.5 hours * 97 adventures = 145.5 hours of work to get a VT quality item.<br />
<br />
If your guild raids VT, you'll have to work about 8 times less for a single piece of gear to upgrade.<br />
<br />
Why LDoN is really nice is you can upgrade a specific slot that you haven't seen an upgrade for.  You can pick and choose all your gear upgrades.<br />
It's also nice in that you can eventually get an upgrade for yourself through xping.  It may take a hell of a lot longer to obtain than by raiding, but you'll eventually get it.</div></div><hr />

The fact you can get decent gear by xping and accumulating points instead of racing to 65 by chasing zone xp modifiers and grinding wherever it's highest makes this the saving grace for any fun family guild out there as well as making the actual process of levelling up fun again. All that and the possibility of doing one groupable dungeons with no farmers hogging camps or noobies training you makes this the best expansion ever.....  <br />
<br />
And I wouldn't worry too much about the drops... unless you're on hard setting they seem to be pretty equivalent to what drops in veksar. Worst case they'll become the standard minimum weapons for their classes the same way entwood mace, waning light katar and windblade did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.5 hours * 97 adventures = 145.5 hours of work to get a VT quality item.<br />
<br />
While I think these numbers are fairly accurate, you are forgetting a couple important factors.<br />
<br />
XP gained during your 18 hours of VT = minimal<br />
XP gained during 18 hours of LDoN = 9 aa (lvl 65, 100% to aa)<br />
<br />
Fun had while killing in VT 18 hours = minimal<br />
Fun had while doing LDoN raids = tons (for me anyway, 30 adventures or so and STILL having a blast)<br />
<br />
Consecutive time committment to do VT run = 4-8 hours, and thats according to your guilds schedule, not yours. <br />
Consecutive time committment for LDoN = 2 hours at a time, your choice or when and how long. <br />
<br />
VT is great, loot heavan for sure. But LDoN is fun, challanging, and not horrible XP (sure there is better XP spots, but not with the rewards of LDoN IMHO). Also you can only do VT once a week, and thats if you arent sharing it with another guild. LDoN is open all the time. <br />
<br />
As a member of a raiding guild, we are doing both, raids and LDoN. Its working great so far (although raid attendance is down a bit). Earning points for that slot or two that I need to upgrade and probably won't be able to until deep Elemental's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Oh, I certainly think it's much more fun doing LDoN to acquire points to buy items than it is to slog through hour after hour of VT.<br />
<br />
My post was basicly to show the total time investment in order to get new gear though.  If you want to outfit yourself, as well as your entire guild, as fast as possible, going through VT is one of the fastest ways.  LDoN is certainly an alternative, albeit a MUCH slower one (nearly a magnitude of 10 depending on how fast you spend going through VT vs how fast you go through LDoN adventures including some failures and slow process)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">You're ignoring the fact that for each item you get, theoretically 5 other people are getting an equal strength item at the same time.  Also, on terris at least, emperor remained a VERY high priority target for lots of guilds for a long time.  I'm not really sure how often he's killed now or by how many guilds, but I imagine people still farm him regularly.  It took nearly two months to find him up during our prime raid hours when we first started going after him.  <br />
<br />
VT key in 2 days is a little unrealistic.  Also keep in mind you're going to need to key 50ish people, kill emperor at least twice to get rifts for your entire guild, and EVERYONE in the guild needs a key as well.</div></div><hr />
