<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looks like the new spells from Omens are on Alla.  Check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like they took all the lvl61-65 spells and copied them into the lvl66-70 range as place holders for the new Omen's spells.<br />
<br />
Proof, compare these:<br />
<br />
Level: 66 <br />
Omen-Shaman-Pet p; None   1: Summon Pet: SpiritWolf242 650 Conjuration Self <br />
<br />
And:<br />
Level 61<br />
True Spirit SHM/61 1: Summon Pet: SpiritWolf242 650 Conjuration Self</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Look at the descriptions, they are new spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wonder if it will have the same model as its graphic in game, prolly will, but would be cool if it appeared more, fierce, kinda like how the necro pet goes from skelly to Specter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tensor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">those look like the same spells to me. just different descriptions.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They will just be placeholders for the new spells at this stage, not the actual spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looks like they are listening after all - the new Focus spell's lost its STR and DEX, gained a goodly number of HPs and a new damage modifier!<br />

They've been tinkering with the other Omens shaman spells too:<br />

Avatar's had its stats removed, instead becoming a 10% damage modifier buff (which stacks with FA etc). The new Canni's been beefed up - but also been marked as an Ancient.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Malos clone now does... nothing at all, the stat buffs and heals have generally been boosted slightly, haste is unchanged as is the pet.<br />
<br />
Oh, and this should cheer a lot of people up! ;)<br />
<br />
Omen-Shaman-Agi <br />
Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Increase AGI by 60&quot; to &quot;Increase Chance to Avoid Melee by 10%&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grammaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok...if this trend keeps up, I can see myself actually looking forward to OoW.<br />
<br />
If I am reading Lucy right, our new buffs will add a precentage to melee damage, and another will reduce incoming damage.  Useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Looks promising indeed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, this is very cool.  Kind of what we asked for, even.  /gasp! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Someone else mentioned this previously but I'd like to point out that on the new FA if they actually take away the 140attack and give 10% damage that is actually a LOWER buff overall. :/<br />
<br />
With FA on the Safehouse folks have clocked in at 10-20% dps increase.  By dropping the Attack and just giving the damage bonus that will actually result in less dps overall.  They need to make it in addition to the attack bonus.<br />
<br />
OH and I'm going to choke people if we later see BL get their upgrade of Fero to be 150attack + 100all resists + 15% damage increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It also looks like they stack...<br />
<br />
2 9 minute buffs... I sware i'm going to feel like a bard..</div></div><hr />
