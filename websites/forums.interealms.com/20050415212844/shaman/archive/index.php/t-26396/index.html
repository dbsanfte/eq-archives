<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shawn280</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently i have taken over the Raid Leadership duties of a small guild on Quellious. This guild has a majority of its members in the 50 - 65 range and i am now trying to figure out some worth while targets for a group of folks that have NEVER Raided before.<br />
<br />
So far we have hit:<br />
<br />
Rhag 1 - No wipes yet<br />
Rhag 2 - No wins...all wipes (Lol)<br />
Venril Sathir (in KC)<br />
<br />
The plan i have in place, unless you guys think i am NUTS, is the following (In Order):<br />
<br />
Kael - For learning the ropes on Raiding<br />
PoGrowth - For plentiful Armor drops<br />
WToV - Always nice to kill a dragon and the damn place is always empty on Quell<br />
Griegs - Never got a chance to hit these due to previous period of retirement, but told that they are a good idea<br />
Umbral Plains - When we got armor and know what we are doing<br />
<br />
ANY advice would be welcomed!</div></div><hr />

Pay special attention to posts 11 and 13, although bear in mind that those were written before Gates came out, with different Level and AA limits in mind, with fewer zones to choose from.</div></div><hr />

I was in a somewhat similar situation at one point. We had a two guild alliance of very casual, family folks who did a bit of raiding on the side. I wasn't the RL, but I was the main puller on the Monk and/or the main slower on the Shaman. And yes, occasionally two boxing my duo on raids was as demanding as you would think, but we managed. Not that it necessarily applies to your situation.<br />
<br />
With that in mind:<br />
<br />
1. A solid high level tank (65+, hopefully) is a big plus. A good puller is another plus.<br />
<br />
2. Establish a CH chain channel and let them practice, practice and practice. Do NOT add people to the CH chain channel unless they have practiced enough, or else you will wipe.<br />
<br />
3. A few &quot;test runs&quot; are OK, but try to concentrate on mobs that drop items which would be noticeable upgrades for your crew. If the stuff that drops at the end of the evening is worse than today's Bazaar gear, it tends to depress people and discourage raid participation. Some low level Luclin mobs still drop gear that is good for the level, e.g. that 100 HP necklace in AR.<br />
<br />
4. Raid specific gear. Make sure you know what your people have and what they don't, especially considering the fact that Bazaar equipment is light on effects. If a Druid gets rezzed deep inside a dungeon and can't snare runners because he is OOM, tell him how to get a clicky Snare item. Compile and post lists for clicky invis items, potion vendor locs, gate items, insta junk buffs, etc.<br />
<br />
Kael - For learning the ropes on Raiding<br />
<br />
Depending on how deep you want to go (Vindi?) your only challenges will be getting past the see invis mobs during CRs (use pets or chanter charm since summoning corpses in Kael in 2005 is just plain embarrassing) and handling the triplets at the door. Everything else should be single pullable and one-groupable even by a group of 50s. The gear is obsolete, but it does have a few useful clickies for non-raiders in their 50s.<br />
<br />
Griegs - Never got a chance to hit these due to previous period of retirement, but told that they are a good idea<br />
<br />
Regular mobs will not be much of a problem. They are up to 55 at the entrance (hit for 160ish and nuke for 600ish), a little higher deeper in (hit for 210), have 10K HP. However, there are a few level 70ish (red to 68) mobs there that were recently added. They will be, presumably, your targets, and I hear they have a few tricks up they sleeves. Read up on them on Alla and decide if you can realistically handle them.<br />
<br />
Umbral Plains - When we got armor and know what we are doing<br />
<br />
The minis in UP are not particularly challenging these days, but their loot is nothing special. Doom and RC are a different story for a group of Bazaar geared 50s-low 60s, though. You'll want a solid tank for them and an experienced kiter or two for Doom. Keep in mind that the Dark Masters are slower than UP trash mobs and Doom is faster than them and that she is a corpse camper and plan accordingly. FD and CotH are your friends :)<br />
<br />
ANY advice would be welcomed!<br />
<br />
One test of your raiders' skills will be the mini events in PoN. The Hedge event, the horseman overlooking the forest (Vazid?), Mura -- that kind of stuff. They hit for 1Kish and require a modicum of coordination and result either in gear upgrades or flags or both. They hit pretty hard, but I have done it with a Bazzar geared (high level gear, 1+ million pp) well AA'd warrior. I think he had under 8K HP buffed at the time, i.e. pre-OoW.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, how is your Epic situation, especially Cleric Epics? The Royals in Chardok (Chanter/Warrior/Cleric Epic) are a good test of basic raiding skills because of the adds, the trapped bridge, the hole in the library and the big fights there, especially the Queen with her AE.<br />
<br />
On a similar note, are you thinking about the Sky for Mage/Warrior/Pally epics? Granted, Pallies have much better stuff now, but the Warrior Epic is still nice to have and it will teach you about positioning and DTs. Epics are generally good because they build up team spirit. Do the Hole for the Shaman Epic if you can, because it's a relatively easy under-utilized zone that not many people have been to.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't recommend Fear until you have you sea legs since it's still unforgiving, especially with that Berserker Epic mob. On the Other hand, Hate is highly controllable, but it's not much of a rading zone any more unless you go for Inny/Maestro. It's more like a place for a few friends to sit and chat while waiting for minis to drop their Epic stuff.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's all that comes to mind right now, have fun raiding! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if your trying to get your guys up to speed, timing CHrots, pulling, tank/off tanking/ CC; hit some of the smaller targets you listed...kael, Akeva (the guy with the bard sword, toetwister), griegs (like servitor or something) and maybe some in chardok.  try to take on something that you havent beaten, or drops nice upgrades in there though, like hit kael for a couple hours then move the whole raid to UP and get that big cow to pop.  once eveyone is starting to get some drops, pick up the pace and try out some challenging stuff, Grieg himself is just plain fun. i think a nice balance between practice ad ending the night with a challenge would be rwearding, win or lose...if you play it off right, some of the most fun times ive had was after a crazy event that we wiped horribly at.  strong bonds are forged that way.  and once the strats are ironed out, and you kill it, the gear and morale boost will really get things rolling.<br />
<br />
i would also suggest folks group ALOT on off time. Ldon, wos/rcod what ever.  get them working together</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I suggested to my guild that, since some of us just aren't geared/AAd to single group MPG, we take a raid there for a few hours while everyone else is doing DoN/Fableds. Everyone liked it, but nobody did it. Might be worth a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guardian of the Seal in The Hole is another good &quot;warmup&quot; target. The gear drops are not too bad ( not great now ) and a CH-Rot is essential. A big bonus is if you have at least one cliky cleric he's super easy to get to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">NToV is a good place to get that raid thing down. Actually may still have a couple ok drops for some of the lower level folks.<br />
<br />
Luclin mobs usually have alot of hp but do not hit too hard. There is a lady in Katta that I remember. Shei in Akheva is probably too hard yet but also a good practice target.<br />
<br />
Kael sounds nice too. Vindi raids have most of what future raids have as well, like clean pulling, positioning, CH rotations. If it is to easy there is always statue and avatar to kill as well :)</div></div><hr />
