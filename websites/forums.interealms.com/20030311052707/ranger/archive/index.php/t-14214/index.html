<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeera Edhel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its called Harmony of Nature. Single target instead of AoE.<br />
<br />
Can be purchased in the Plane of Knowledge in the Library from the Ranger Vendors. (not hard to find)<br />
<br />
Haven't tried it yet. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, I looked many times and never found it in PoK. Where it is found is from one of the druid spell vendors in Shadowhaven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>liferedes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i have use the new harmony to split level 60 spiders in PoN it works well... without a mnk we can be verry effective pullers with this spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Narreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll confirm that Harmony of Nature is sold in Shadowhaven, off a druid spell merchant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>makrus quintius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, <br />
Get new Harmony of Nature spell from the druid merchant in Shadow Haven, got mine there....about 14p as I recall</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arynduil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was a basher of this when it came out, but I must say, it's great. Makes pullling a breeze in any PoP zones i've been in (only 1st tier), far more effective than a FD puller in my opinion. Works particularly well in the Green Mile in PoJ and the Werewoof rocks in PoN. I've never seen a resist on this spell and only had it fail due to pathing (read: user error).<br />
<br />
With c3 you hardly notice the mana cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toshiden Satori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It does get resisted on a really rare basis, and when it does quite often you will get aggro with it. But I've seen it resist under 10 times since I've had it, and i pull a lot for my groups in PoP because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It only failed once for me, splitting the level 65 foreboding guardians in PoN (oops).  It worked fine about a dozen times with a high-level group, but when I was there with a bunch of 54-58 people it decided to get resisted and aggro both at once, causing deaths of half the group (me first of course, I didn't get healed once while I was kiting and getting summoned).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I failed a total of 3 times pulling the guardians in PoN. Those were the only times I have used it so far. One of those 3 times I did not fail the resist check, and I was able to cast again and split the pull.<br />
<br />
The other 2 times it failed were...messy. I had my group stay back so I could take the hits and go down without all of us having to zone/die. I may have had bad luck. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valorindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I forget when, but it was said that CHA plays a role in what happens on a faile casting of HoN. Apparently a higher charisma may not cause aggro on  a resist. I have never had mine fail since scribing it, but then I have used it a handful of times since so that isn't a very good example. Would be interesting to find out what CHA score is required to not get aggored on a resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kundow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hate this stupid thing.  I always get aggroed when it wears off.  I haven't had it fail yet though.  Whooo, but it sure got me jumped in Karnors the other day....it was ugly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never had this happen in many pulls in PoP using the spell.  Are you fighting the mobs while still in the pre-harmony aggro radius?  New harmony only lasts about 2 and a half minutes from what I gather on Lucy's (7 mins for pacification /rude).  Maybe you just aren't getting far enough away and you're getting aggro because of that.<br />
<br />
I've never seen something aggo me from out of it's normal range after a harmony of nature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The only way you will get agro &quot;once it wears off&quot; is if you are close enough to get agro if it were not cast.  Meaning you cant cast it, stand next to the mob, wait for it to wear off and not expect it to get agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Traxxus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">but it sure got me jumped in Karnors the other day....it was ugly. <br />
I haven't had the opportunity to use the new harmony spell yet, but my understanding is that it's outdoor only.  Isn't Karnors an indoor zone?  That may have been the root of your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dividian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">no karnors is an outdoor zone (want proof it rains there :D)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Araya Le'Bon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Cast it on the high guardians of justice to split the 5 spawn the other day.  Went fine for the first 2.  Resist on the third and aggro...smoosh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tellos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So how does this effect the original Harmony?  I still have it, and still use it (not on POP yet).<br />
<br />
Tellos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Amigalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The old harmony works only on mobs up to a certain level.  Anyone know which level?  For some reason I want to say level 39, but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
The new harmony, gets resisted about 1 in 10 or 1 in 15 times in the Bastion of Thunder.  But charisma helps a lot!<br />
<br />
With a charisma of 155, I've never gotten agro on a resist.<br />
With a charisma of 130, I get agro on resists about 1 in 3 times.<br />
With a charisma of 80, I get agro on every resist.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Ok, on the 2nd floor of BoT, it seem I get a harmony resist on 1 out of 2 or 3 casts!  I'm level 63 atm.  I had 205 charisma, the first resist did not agro, but the 2nd one did :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Auldian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">More discussion on the CHA check here http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13569<br />
I've had rare failures in PoV and BoT, maybe 1 in 20. All failures have resulted in aggro, but I'm not surprised with 85 CHA. Overall, a great spell I like very much. The faster refresh rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>ElvenWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have only recieved one resist so far.   It was on a red con - Sambata tribal advisor in DSP - She aggroed big time.</div></div><hr />
