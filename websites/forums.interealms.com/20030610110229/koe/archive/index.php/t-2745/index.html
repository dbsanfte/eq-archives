<br />
I just wanted to say thank you for your support.  Despite Verina not showing her ugly mug for a beatdown, I truly appreciate all the support given to me.<br />
<br />
Every tell, and every query in /gu meant a lot to me.  I want to specially thank a few people.<br />
<br />
Venomblood, Bemidian, Nekky, Anuin: Thanks for spending hours in that dang hole just sitting, chatting, doing nothing.<br />
<br />
Grinic, Lokes, Drolgin, Anuin, Knarlz: Thanks for stopping in with a lil bit of humor to lighten in up for me.  Had it not been for you I surely would have killed everyone on my block. =)<br />
<br />
Moebeus, Cshae, Rizz:  Thank you for watching the spawn while I rested, and also forcing me to do so.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the whole crew who came down for a show of force, when I thought she would pop the first time.  There were many so I can't recall all the names, but I do remember Zelfani, Hammerstalker, Mawafu as names not yet mentioned.<br />
<br />
And finally, special special thanks to Rizz, for supporting me through /guild /tells and even over the phone.  (First time I talked to Rizzo in person.. and he said &quot;Nindalf got munched...&quot; !!!!)<br />
<br />
I have one other thing I want to say.  Just consider my level of commitment to Verina this long weekend... That is what is in my heart for KoE (Minus the loathing for not spawning).  You guys truly are my second family.<br />
<br />
THank you.<br />

<br />
I wish I had been online at any time during this.  Your /hugz are something iIwish I had more of these days, and remember them fondly.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I will wisk you away to Sky someday when you aren't looking ;)</div></div><hr />

Now that I've dusted off Kria the retired necro, I'll keep her there and check the spawn on log in and log offs.</div></div><hr />
