<br />
I'm at 29 now and I am very sick of lvl'ing in Marus Seru. I'm just so tired of people powerlvl'ing by taking like 10 mobs dying, then all the mobs run on us, not to mention all the people who just don't know what they're doing. I haven't solo'ed very much, actually not at all, but I think I'd like to try it now. I was thinking of heading to Iceclad and killing coguars, but I'm unsure what the best way to solo is. <br />
<br />
should I just root the mobs, dot them, root again when root breaks? <br />
<br />
Is there a better way? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can play however you desire, but if you are going to stick to this character for a while then I'd suggest learning to tank stuff in the face (you are going to need every defense skill you can find).<br />
<br />
some strategies-<br />
1. tank it in the face. pull with your best slow, tank a bub, nail it with your best poison dot (optional), root, back up med and canni until root breaks, cast best str/ac debuffer or blind it (lowers atk) (optional) and tank it down. Sometimes all you will need on a mob is a good slow however.<br />
<br />
2. root n rot/rot 'n dot. pull with slow (optional) and land every dot you have on the mob, root it and med/canni. re-root/re-dot until dead.<br />
<br />
3. fast nuke. pull with slow and nuke it to death while the mobs whackin on you.<br />
<br />
4. blind kiting. load up a mob with dots and root it. move far enough away that you have plenty of time to cast on it with it running at you full speed. blind it, move away and watch the mob run away, re blind/re dot as necessary. (this tatic is tough to pull off successfully).<br />
<br />
good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would suggest to keep grouping at least until you get your first pet.  The ability to solo improves greatly at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did goblins in solA at 29 until i got the pet and did the clockworks. Easy to solo 3 at a time cause there's a ton of room in front of the solB zone in (you have from pos. C on the eqatlas map all the way to pos. 13 to park mobs (you normally 2 pull initially until everything is broken).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been doing em solo or grouped since 27. <br />
<br />
Pull w/ Mala, root em on the way to ya. Walking sleep followed by Envenomed breath. Affliction or whatnot if ya feel. You can tank these easily (HPs allowing, my shammie is a little twinked) If it gets a little close, root again, reapply DoT/s possibly a nuke or two. <br />
<br />
Very easy, had one double pull cause I set off a recently respawned trap, they also run at 20% remaining. Great exp for level, even for an Ikky.<br />
