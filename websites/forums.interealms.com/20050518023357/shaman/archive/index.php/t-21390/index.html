Yep I've definitely noticed an increase in fizzle rate recently (*any guesses what a new omens aa ability will be*)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not just you, fizzled 5 times in a row yesterday on slow....280 Wis, KEI, SCM, maxed skills...been noticing an increase in fizzle rates for some time now, getting 2-3 times in a row sometimes...thats just sick for a level 65 to fizzle that often on a spell that old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same here and I was with two other friends once complaining about it and they said they were experiencing the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've noticed an increased fizzle rate too and several times getting 2 or 3 fizzles in a row. That's just plain ridiculous and frustrating. Get a grip SOE, 65 shamans with 500+ AA's should not be fizzling!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I fizzled Focus 5 strait times.  That was rather embarrassing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">then stop buying those ebayed chars HAHAHA...<br />
<br />
But the thing i hate the most is when i fizzle canni4 more then once, when should but happen</div></div><hr />
