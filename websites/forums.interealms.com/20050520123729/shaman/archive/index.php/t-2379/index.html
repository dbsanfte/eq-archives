<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hate cragwyrms.  Every time I've almost got something dead one shows up to ruin my fun.  I even tried hiring a hobbit to keep watch and at least let me know when one was coming, but he fell asleep at the wheel.<br />
<br />
Anyhooz, got him this far:<br />
<br />
http://www.the-mad.net/eq/bratavar.jpg - Got him to the &quot;Brata&quot;<br />
<br />
http://www.the-mad.net/eq/bratavar.txt - log here if you're bored =)<br />
<br />
I'm gonna try again tonight, and just pray to the cragwyrm gods that they leave me the hell alone.  I don't have any useful aa skills, just run/regen 3, and i think mc2.  Would be cake if I had quickbuff 3 or canni5 =)  No focus items either, if you don't count my useless shadel bandit ring effect.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any decent pull spots I can try to get him to?  Is gonna be a really long fight, Malo wore off in that one.<br />
<br />
*Edit*  Started the log 2-3 mins in, forgot to turn it on at the beginning.  Got 2 interrupted and 1 resisted slow off the start, I thought it was gonna be a quick fight =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've killed him where he stands, but I've been in groups killing him and had wyvern after wyvern path through, so I've got no doubt as to how lucky I was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure what is safe are to pull to now. Pathing in WW was totally screwed up 2 patches ago from what I can tell. Normal 'safe spots' of near ledge/ship , in valley across from ToV and that hill to left of SG zone all seem to have new wanderere paths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haven't checked it out since the so called &quot;changes&quot; but north of Yeldema there is an area near a very large spire type statue sitting in a small valley.  That area has very very few roamers, or did every time I've hunted WW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do wyerms, cragwurms assist a dragon if your pro CoV?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cragwyrms do (note my screenshot &gt;&lt;).  I *think* the wyvern hunters do as well.  Brontotherium and gravid drakes do not add (i've had both walk over me while fighting yeldema).<br />
<br />
I'll look around up there Jaradis, spent a little time scouting today and didn't find too much.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ahaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I was soloing Gafala, wyvern didn't assist. Can't recall which type of wyvern. <br />
<br />
Bratavar spot is bad for solo, I have seen 3 named dragon pathing there at same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The place Yeldema spawns is fairly good for not getting adds, but then this was about 2 months ago that I last farmed him.  If you are standing at Yeldema, face the white dragon on the nest that's nearby so that the ToV rift is to your right front side.  If you run out about 10 seconds towards the white dragon, you'll have virtually no roamers come through camp.  There's mobs that path nearby, but for the most part, they veer off away from you.  The only issues I've had are with a buggy Von that warped on top of me no matter where I pulled Yeldema one day, having Rak Sappara path through there once in about 20 kills, and the very occasional velium hound run through.  Keep on the constant lookout for potential adds, and kite your dragon away from the add if you see one coming.<br />
<br />
The place Jaradis mentioned is good too.  If you are facing that white dragon from Yeldema's spawn location, aim left at about a 45% angle and you'll find the spot.  Not very many wanderers used to go through there.</div></div><hr />
