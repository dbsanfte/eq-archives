<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Badmorta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay hehe my RL husband (who plays a Bard) and I (Shaman) have this ongoing disagreement about AA vs. levels.  Right now I am 62nd level (and 2 yellows) and I don't have much in the way of AA.  I have run 3, regen, MC1 and SCM1.  I have most, but not all, of the BoT key, so that is not much of an option yet.  My spell book for levels 61 and 62 is full, but I have nothing else in the way of spells for 63+ (except the root at 64... JOY lol) <br />
<br />
It is my opinion and desire that while I am in PoS/PoV still that I finish out MC and SCM before doing much more in the way of real XPing.  My husband on the other hand is all about levels... levels levels levels levels!  Says I should get 65 in PoV/PoS before I do another AA point! <br />
<br />
My feeling here is that the higher I go in real levels the slower my AA will be gained in this tier!  I may as well stay at level 62 while the XP is still pretty decent and AA comes a bit quicker.  Once I have my BoT and/or my PoT key THEN real XP makes more sense! <br />
<br />
What do you all think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For him, as a bard, I agree levels levels levels, although I might take time out for IM and Fading Memories. <br />
<br />
For you as a shaman, I would go straight for MC3 and Canni V before getting any more levels. Extra levels will help with resists, but I think the benefit of canni V far outweighs that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im with your logic and agree with the above poster, finish MC then get CannV first before anything else.  I followed the same path, working on AA's till I at least had a few spells for the next level (and access to get them as drops, not purchase them).  I even had time to finish up SCR before getting 64 and am close to 65 (had to purchase the 65 spells I have though).  <br />
<br />
There should be no hurry, we dont gain all that much from 63 to 65 except spells, so not having them is the biggest deal imo.  In other words, a 65 shaman with no spells is about equivalent to a 62 without any 63+ spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 65 you will get a LOT less resists.  And exp in pov moves pretty well at 65.  You can chew thru mobs at an amazing rate, and rack up the aa.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I agree.. canni 5 will be the biggest boost to your power that you will see.  I would get that first, then level to 65, then farm all the aa you want.<br />
<br />
My guild has formed the opinion that for casters and priests level 65 is more important than AA points.  Higher level = less resists, more mana, and the chance to use better spells (if you have them).  For Melee the AA is more important.  A 62 melee character with all their offensive/defensive aa skills is more powerful than a 65 without the aa.<br />
<br />
Its a generalization, and there are exceptions (like canni 5 and mgb) but overall it does seem to fit.. at least for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All arguments on the logic of which path is best aside, the point of this game is to have fun.  I stopped leveling at 52 to get run three.  It could be argued that leveling to 60 and then getting run three would have been a better strategy.  But I wanted run three now and I&#8217;ve enjoyed having it.  So, in my opinion, the best AA/XP path to take is the one you want to follow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Badmorta,<br />
<br />
I know how you feel, I'm under the same pressure to level up instead of getting AA.  Here is my current AA plan:<br />
<br />
Get last point for Cannabilize.<br />
Switch AA to 20-50%<br />
Get RC1<br />
Get ND1<br />
Get VP1<br />
Put AAxp to 10-20% and head for 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only advantage of being 63-65 is the spells really.  If you have access to zones where specs and glyphed runes drop, then it would makes sense to level up so you have the opportunity to get them.  Or if you can afford to buy them, level on up.  <br />
<br />
However, AA xp is significantly slower at 65 as there are fewer mobs that offer the &quot;close to or above your own level&quot; bonus.   If you have malo, the difference in slow resists from 62 to 65 is negligible.<br />
<br />
I currently 2 box a 60 monk and a 65 shaman and on blue mobs the monk gets half again to double the aa xp that the shaman does per mob.<br />
<br />
I stayed 61 until I got Cann5, then went to 65.  (You can get to 65 in a couple of days in tier 2-3)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">While you will get aa faster at 62 in the planes you have available, you will also have to deal with grouping with others.  Personally I do not like grouping with someone who is not leveling on purpose unless they are a friend of mine.  They can ding aa 2 times before I do one time while fighting in the same group.  Really chaps my hide when they brag about it too, so I have confined myself to grouping with level 65 only unless they are friends of mine otherwise I feel as if I am being taken advantage of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd say get 61, get canni5, get PoJ trail done (for poV/poS) then decide.<br />
<br />
Also, don't split aa/levelling. If you want to level, go 100% in level, if you want to aa, go 100% in aa ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Groz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you are killing Wasteland mobs (Golems, Crawlers and stuff) or Razorfiends, you'll still be within the level 5 bonus in PoV at 65.  The exp is still very good.  <br />
<br />
However, frogs and undead skeletons are lousy experience since you don't get the exp bonus.  I duo'd a fair amount at east frogs in PoV, but the exp has definitely tailored off at 65.  <br />
<br />
Especially If you are the primary slower for your guild, after you get Cann V, it's best to shoot for 65.  As I got higher level, frogs seemed to resist less often.  Nothing worse than try to trying to slow bounce , both on a Raid Mob and on exp'ing mobs.  With adds, you don't have time to malo and slow.  And some mobs are immune to root.  Having slow land may save you from a wipe. <br />
<br />
I didn't see a big change in spell power from 63 to 64. (Only  have velium strike, blood of ultor, talisman of alacrity and malicious decay).  However, having Quiesence and Ferine Avatar was a huge difference. <br />
<br />
I was tempted to de-level initially after ding 65 since i couldn't duo at my favorite spot in PoV.  But playing without those 2 spells, it would just be too painful.  <br />
<br />
However, at 65 you really are restricted to tier 2+ planes for exp.   I basically have 3 types of playing sessions.  Grinding for AAs in the tier 2+ planes, Questing or farming for stuff (pretty much don't expect the exp bar to move for that time), or go raiding  with the guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would go along with what most people have said, get MC3 and Canni5 and then move on.  I really didn't notice a huge difference in slows between 63-65 when raiding.  I went from 63-65 within about the last 2-3 months and in that time we've stayed pretty much in NToV and BoT towers so it could very well be different in other zones.  I did however notice a huge difference in valor experience groups.  Before 65 it seemed I'd bounce about 60-70% of my slows if I didn't malo first but at 65 I'd say that dropped to more like 30%.  I still malo on incoming but if we have adds and I'm in a hurry just to get agro to park if nothing else I'll slow first and VP.<br />
<br />
So anyway, personally I would go with MC3, Canni5 and then 65.  The difference in slows just wasn't as huge as I thought it would be but it is still obviously noticeable and it sounds like others have had different experiences.  I guess I just used to be very lucky with slows at 62-63 or I'm just very unlucky at 65.  Also, the rate of AA between 62-65 isn't that huge.  At 65 I started to pay more attention to what other people in the group were getting AA exp wise and it seems to be about 6% per level down to 62.  So basically in the time it took me to get 100% AA if I were 64 I would have gotten 106%, if I were 62 I would have gotten 118%.  Either way 18% is about 20-30 minutes in a decent group so not a huge deal in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Badmorta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thank you all very much for your input.  This helps me in knowing I am going in the right direction!  :) I am already flagged for Pov/PoS and that is where I have been getting the bulk of my XP!  Hehe I am cheap and HATE to buy spells... so I am waiting for parchments for my 63+ ones, which will have to wait until I finish my BoT key.  I will be working that MC and SCM so that I can get to Cann 5, can't wait!  I will also need MGB since our guild raids rather often.  Its funny, I couldn't WAIT for group buffs and now even THEY are a pain in the butt! Will be AWESOME to get that focus done in one cast!!!  Thank you all again! SHAMMY POWER!!!</div></div><hr />

Splitting exp is a bad plan, all it does is delay progress in both areas.  You'd be far better off to go 100% AA or Exp since you gain the skill faster then can use it to advance yourself in the other area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree with exp going faster at 62 than at 65, my opinion is to get all the AA abilities out of the way before you start leveling again. As far as getting a group at level 62 in PoP zones, as a Shaman, I personally don't have problems getting a group unless there is already one there.</div></div><hr />
