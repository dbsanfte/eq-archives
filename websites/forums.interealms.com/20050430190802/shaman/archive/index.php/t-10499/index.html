<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gumdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone had any luck slowing him with Turgur or other magic slows ? We've only been able to land Grummus on him, yet wizards say Magic nukes like Agnarr's Thunder land (even if partially). <br />
<br />
The few times I tried slowing him from standing right under, he resisted multiple times which resulted in me going splat :p . <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gradukk Gravelbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have not been able to land Turgur's on him as of yet. I have slowed him with Grummus but with the message of slightly effective or something. I am of the opinion that you are just better off nuking, healing, DoTing or pretty much anything other than bothering to slow this guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He is mr slowable but I've only been able to do so with all the lvl 65 mr debuffs and even then its difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">About 30ish turgurs casts in total vs Rydda'dar, all standing right underneath him. Both tash/malo and tash/malo/oos situations. All resisted.<br />
<br />
Grummus usually lands under three tries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">one fight i figured id give it a try to continually spam malosinia to see if it was possible to land. i think i got about 120 casts between the kills my guild has on him, and ive never landed anything but malos malicious decay and grummus. as far as debuffs go that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's a waste of time to slow him with Turgurs.  It *might* and I stress *MIGHT* be possible to do, but it's not a valid tactic for that fight.  You are better off getting him slowed with Grummus and contributing by spamming Tnargs on rampage tanks or Abolish Disease on rampage tanks.  Or even nuking.  He really doesn't have that many hps.  Probably Vindyish hps.  <br />
You will need to get a very very tight CH rotation down on your MA with a flawless start in order to win this fight.  <br />
We just won it this weekend, go us!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">MR slowing Rydda'dar absolutely requires Harmony of Sound and Malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With his dps, that guy slowed or not need to die fast.<br />
We tried to slow him a few times (tugur and grummus) and always ended getting aggro because of resist (and aggro or rampage from that guy = death most of the time).<br />
Now, I just ferine rangers while they use TS on the dwagon, ferine all the rogue / monk I can find then load a nuke and nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Have slowed him with turgurs once... it isn't worth the effort. Just get grummus on him then help heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">after multiple attempts and many deaths, my guild decided best to just have the shamans abolish/heal the mt.  you get a &quot;Your spell was only slightly effective&quot; msg with Cloud of Grummus.  It's not even worth having the high risk of dying/getting on rampage over.  Hell we didnt even bother having rampage tank the last time, it wasn't worth streching the healers over (we seem to bring the bare minimum for PoP encounters).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">heh with no rampage tank thats just a zerg fest, kill him before he eats all your melee. and pray that your cheal doesnt get on ramp list. also its been a while since last kill, but i dont recall any resists on grummus after MD lands -ever-. are you using a dr debuffer or just going for straight grummus. we usually had 3 shaman there for this guy and one of us offered up to sacrifice to get MD in fast. then it was all about curing/healing/n00king after that.</div></div><hr />
