<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taldaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone knew How i could get from 41 to 50 in a week.  I am at the the New LoY zones 'cause soloing in DSP is to crowded I am going to try Tenebrous Mtns. for the Ore so i ican upgrade some items. And does anyone know  were the Jbb drops of is it quest only (Bazaar is last resort).</div></div><hr />

41 to 50  try echo caverns gnomes/beetles.  <br />
<br />
Are you being PL ?  Unless ur twinked u wont make 9 lvls in one week.<br />
<br />
eeek not twinked....get some more bloody ac.   get rid of that shield and bracer;  aim to have min 9 ac in each slot, otherwise ur acting like a confused tree hugger.   if u want pp  try farming sola or hhk(guards) for finesteel, hill giants are too tough at ur lvl.</div></div><hr />

I amin the process of throwing out Ac and farming Wisdom Items since i am to low to camp or Raid ssra Temple. I am not twinked but there are post of going 3 lvls oin 3days. I do have pop so my main goal is to get  46 so i can go to PoJ. I am a Tribual Shaman. I plan to hit a Exp grind zone and Grind till no exp is left. I ahve also heard of Bst and Shamans Duo in Sol B to the best of exp ever seen. And the closest to a Pl I can get is maybe a 50bst or a 64 dru. ANd sometimes u may see me in higher zones with the highers lvl ( Dat don't work ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sol b is great xp, go to window room and pull everything from there and beyond the pool room.<br />
<br />
I usually camp the room between pool and window and pull one from window and the rest from pool and to the zones. money is good and the xp is great. I am 46 with a 44 warrior, and the levels go by quick. just drop a dog feed it finesteel and pull away. it may be slower if you are solo, but if you can get your hands on that druid you will be in and out in no time. I am going to try and push it all the way to 49 here, but I may have to move to bats and bugs, not sure on that though, as I am treading in uncharted territory for myself here :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
ur too low to camp a jbb&gt;  crypt in sebilis  (lvl 55+ job)<br />
 if u want pp  try farming sola or hhk(guards) for finesteel, hill giants are too tough at ur lvl.<br />
<br />
<br />
id disagree...im 41 and been doing hill giants off and on between DL since 36...sure at 36 there were pretty tough, but once i hit 39 and got new pet, with kei piece of cake. toss in hp buff, and id finish one off with about 75% health and mana. just pull with dot (at 41 i find they dont resist much), run back to pet thats guarding your safe spot, slow and listless power them (root first if pet dont get aggro), tank a bit, root and back off, med a little, then toss a dot to break root and go back to tanking. very crowded place, but if you hunt in off peak times (as i do) its really nice loot. just logged off about an hour ago, in about an hour and a half, i made about 250plat and more than half a level - so i definitely suggest it ( if i go there and see more than 20 in zone i dont even bother - with 10-15 the pickings are nice)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I soloed on the beach in Gunthak until lvl 44. not bad for loot, you get the occasional gem/jewelry drop, words/runes/pages, and up to 5p per mob.<br />
but seriously is that magelo for real? I'm not trying to be rude but that stuff is junk. you definatly need to upgrade. If you are seriously hurting for cash go to DSP and solo the tribals for acrylia and set yourself up in the bazaar to sell them, you can get 25-75p average for small-brick. and buy yourself some gear....</div></div><hr />

thats my gear<br />
<br />
what you need as a shammy is ac and hp items over wisdom<br />
cause you can always canno<br />
<br />
great place to get some decent ac gear with alright wis on it is dulaks and gunthak<br />

But you wanna get as much AC and HP possible , WIS is important too , but your not a druid, or a wizard or a enchanter , you basicly a tank that casts and has a pet or atleast thats what you wanna work toward</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK, I repeat, do NOT go to pop at 46 in that gear. Really dont go to pop at 46... dont think you will be useful in PoJ at 46, unless your group likes fighting constant hordes of rats pulled from hells half acre by your low level aggro radius. In a night of farming HHK guards, you can easily quadruple your power as a shaman. Kill guards, loot swords, sell swords, repeat. 1-2k an hour. If you dont upgrade, dont complain. You may think its boring to farm cash, but its a lot more boring to have bad gear dragging you and mroe importantly, your group down.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be rude, but your gear is bad man, really really bad, and is a good indication of why kei hurt people, by far outleveling their gear and sucking away all their cash. Heres some cheap alternatives.<br />
<br />
Arms: Giant Scalemail (200pp). they have 20hp on em<br />
Gloves: LEaf Scale (100pp tops)<br />
Rings: Velium Fire opal rings (300pp each)<br />
Mask: Crystal Spider eyes/stained cloth veil (4-800pp)<br />
Neck: Large Smoothmetal Torque 500pp<br />
<br />
Aim for hit points on every slot. Right now, you are a liability if you dont upgrade your gear... the other healers will be spending a lot of time healing and rezzing you. Dont worry about levels, get enough gear to do your bare minimum duty. Anything less is sponging off the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wasqa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I saw you mention killing HHK guards for cash. Could you give more info like if 41 Shaman with very bad geer could solo them? What their level? What tactics are used, and what should I be avoiding while hunting them?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">first, starlite said he was too low to camp the jbb in seb, not to earn it by making cash farming hg's.  <br />
<br />
second, talador before you even bother with 51, do farm cash.  many good spots have been mentioned, but i'd probably go with hhk or misty if i was you.  in hhk, dogdog will be able to take out the majority of the guards for you once you buff him.  if the guard cons blue, just toss a slow on him for good measure.  zone in with invis on.  go to the main hall (room right before flamespinner that high lvl wizzy - has a lot of pillars in it).  find the erudite merchant who sells enchanter pet spells and bind there.  he is on neutral faction so he won't attack you no matter your race/religion/faction.  you will sell to him.  next, buff the hell out of your pet and yourself.  then walk out the door, and attack all the guards one by one.  they drop fine steel weapons, which you will collect and then sell to the erudite merchant.  after a while, you will become kos to the banker, so do be careful banking.  (if you happen to be a necro, you can just st her and gate back to your bind, np)  you should be able to pull in at the very least 500 pp per hour.  once you get better gear, you'll be able to kill more guards more quickly, and make more $$.  seriously though, don't try 51 until you upgrade.  not only will it be hellish for you, but it will be painful for whatever group you're in.<br />

those are all cheap upgrades, things i would buy if i was in your position.  your focus should be on hp-sta/ac/wisdom/mana, pretty much in that order.  we're not ragging on you, just concerned :)  hope all goes well for you, and if you need any more help, please do ask.  i think we all want to see you come out on top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah, HHK is pretty much as he said it. I fought the goblins there in my mid 20's, and those are pretty decent cash as well. However, nothing beats the guards, who have about 1000hp and drop a 6pp sword, and good coin every single kill. I think at 51 when camping the noble room, my partner and I would kill all guards as well, and rake in about 1500 an hour while getting some of the best exp imaginable.</div></div><hr />

I left Sola at 39 because the EXP dropped off so much from 38, it was still good, but I get bored doign the same thing for so many lvl's. <br />

How ever  I think you still get about 1% exp. It's good and easy at that lvl.</div></div><hr />

I started soloing them and the guards and they have given me good xp and some nice loot (occasional gems, up to 5p, weapons).<br />
<br />
I have doued with an SK in Velks, did real well with xp, but Velks on my server is just dead anymore. LDoN is a nice option for drops and xp, and you can get a decent split if the ML is not skimming, and that could be a good source of income that way.<br />
<br />
Lay of KEI man, biggest crutch in the game, think of how many times you payed (if you did) for KEI, then add that up. Think of the gear you could have bought if you did it under your own steam. On my server, its 100p a shot, so if you got KEI ten times before the nerf, well, there went 1k. /shrug<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp<br />
<br />
And yeah, your gear is not cool, but if its all you have, then cruise the bazaar for deals, they are out there regardless of the server. I kinda twinked my shammy as its an alt of mine, but I still think his gears sucks, but I can't spare the plat as the spells on my main is way too expensive anymore.<br />

TM was nice.  I would park myself at the GF zone in, and I would pull bats and sonic wolves to Rover.  Every 90 minutes, the runner will spawn, and I would kill him for the pouch.  I would run to Katta to get the pattern, and at the end of my session, I would end up selling a few Rallic Packs.  At the time, they were worth over 1k when I was soloing there.

not too shabby. id suggest getting &quot;moss covered handwraps&quot; and trading in that giant white drum for a normal or even small sized one.  the drog is nice, but shouldnt be using it for transportation (we can sow ourselves) and the mana regen is the same for all sizes if i am not mistaken.  the size thing is all about &quot;rep&quot; for the pure casters, plus the plat from trading down could definitely help you upgrade yourself. also, think about a tacticians bulwark or a shield of bane charming, the stats on those are both impressive... as a lvl 56 shammy, your wis should be maxxed, and the +20 wis on the bane shield would pretty much do it. you seem to be doing pretty well for yourself. one last thing- obulus death shroud or rotting murkglider drape. mana pres items OWN.</div></div><hr />
