<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello<br />
is there a chance for me to get a right click item like the JBB?<br />
i had see a nodrop item in 1 post here, but is in uber zone, on uber mob ...<br />
any other?<br />
thx and good hunt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that I have found yet..... Nope</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do a search on JBB or for that matter just pop on over to General and look at some of the flamewars on the topic.  <br />
<br />
Leezards were not born with a Jaundiced Bone and the chance of VI letting another 263pt DD clicky item entering the game en mass is VERY UNLIKELY.  I really doubt VI will make an alternative item just for Iksar in response to whine petitions etc seeing as how they can't even get the frikkin cudgel to work properly.<br />
<br />
I would gladly see the JBB opened up to all shammies just to get rid of all the new troll twinks out there.  Iksar could resume their place as &quot;The Race to Be&quot; and everyone could move on to more interesting topics :)</div></div><hr />
