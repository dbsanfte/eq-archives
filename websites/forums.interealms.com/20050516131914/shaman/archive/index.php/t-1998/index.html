<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maladroit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Cazic thule or innooruuk (SP)<br />
what are the pros and cons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Innoruuk all the way, IMHO.   The advantage of Innoruuk is that you can get a nice snare necklace.  I did the quest at 25 and I am absolutely loving this thing.  Snare &gt; fear any day.<br />

<br />
Innoruuk-<br />
<br />
PROS<br />
<br />
 You can do an easy quest at 25 or so for a neclace that right clicks the low level necro snare dot. long casting time but gives a shaman the ability to slow, pretty nice<br />
<br />
can cast Imbue Sapphire ( i think)<br />
<br />
Your faction in Neriak will be a little bit better<br />
<br />
CONS- well, Innoruuk looks like a dork...<br />

see what I meen, try praying to HIM without laughing<br />
<br />
Cazzy <br />
<br />
PROS<br />
<br />
Cazic-Thule shamen can get 2 nifty amulets from Paineel<br />
one is fear undead one is fear animal<br />
less useful in general then the snare neck but in certain niche situations being able to fear is nice<br />
<br />
can cast imbue amber<br />
<br />
the Golden CT idol rocks, and is better then the Inno one for shammies (see you local master potter)<br />
<br />
Have better faction in  Cabilis, still KoS to start but starts off in less of a faction hole<br />
<br />
Better paineel faction too, but paineel faction is easy to get anyway cause keeling about 10 Erudite guards can take you from dubi to kindly<br />
<br />
Cazic thule is cooler then Innoruuk<br />
<br />
CONS<br />
<br />
really only the inability to get the snare necklace, its a nice item, but barb/vah shir/iksar shamans cant get it either so its not a make or break item<br />
<br />
and your neriak faction isnt as good, but still can sell, and you can do the wine quest if your want better merchant faction<br />
<br />
bottom line<br />
<br />
doesnt really matter IMHO<br />
<br />
MOST trollie shamen are Innoruuk in my experince, wheather by chance or because the want the snare neck, I dont know.<br />
<br />
I am CT shaman, not sure why I am, as I created this char 3 years ago, probably was just what the default on the religion screen was :)<br />
<br />
hope that helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ok I have no idea what this is, but I would assume that it is a CT only shaman spear. So what's it called and where do you get it? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im not a troll, but if i did i would worship CT, inny just looks like a giant nerd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bankster, it is called a cudgel (Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients) and it requires some cabilis faction and questing :)<br />
<br />
The lesser item is 10/24 Sta+5 Cha+5 Wis+10 Int+5 Hp+30 Mana+20 DR/MR/PR+10.</div></div><hr />
