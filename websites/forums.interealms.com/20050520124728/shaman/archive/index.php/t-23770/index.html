and WE still get that  B_ _ L      S_ _ T  xp penalty?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MLE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't see this as being Sony's fault - it was a choice you made.  You got a rather large benefit from the day your character was born, and that's probably why you selected Troll in the first place.  But, the law of diminishing returns has kicked in now, and you've passed the point were the benefit outweighs the offset.  Did you not realize this would happen?</div></div><hr />

Guess what?  A lot of people who chose to be a good race back when faction and getting into cities mattered - now REGRET having chosen that race.  Make sure you support a quest for them to *switch* to a troll, iksar, or ogre at level 70 because they, too realized they made the wrong choice.  Unfair?  Why yes, yes it is.  So is what you're suggesting.</div></div><hr />

Never seen it put so well before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The point of paying a penalty is that you get something in return. If the return is lessened. If you're going to change the rules, then it makes sense to adjust whatever has been affected by those changes. And just saying Boo hoo, you chose that of your own accord, live with it knowing that the people who made that choice had the rules changed right out from under them without having a say in the matter is akin to pointing at someone who had their wallet stolen and saying &quot;HAH ! you got screwed !&quot; While laughing. <br />
<br />
The real question is was the return lessened. Personally I think it was because what I have now isn't what I agreed to pay an xp penalty for when I created the character.<br />
<br />
The changes to sitting regen have negated many of the advantages iksar and troll regen provide both in between fights and during them. In fact the last time I tested it on my shaman my sitting regen had actually been lessened to the point of uselessness because of the inertia built into sitting regen. This has a direct impact on canni dance. It also means all the races who didn't have to spend 20 % more xp getting to 65th are getting practically the same benefits for jack squat. Of course you're going to say &quot;Neener neener it's your decision and don't whine&quot; while dancing a jig if you're one of the people who benefited from the changes.<br />
<br />
I find it funny that some of the same people who champion the shaman cause on the basis that times have changed, beastlords, short fights and mitigation weren't part of the deal when they created their shaman.. those same people will turn around and tell the trolls and iksars that they have no reason to complain despite the rules having been changed under them.<br />
<br />
PS: Bullsh** on your law of diminishing returns, if it had been a fixed xp price that you pay and then never have to worry about again then that would be fine. We're still paying for it. We'll be paying more xp for it post 65 than in the first 50 levels in which it actually had an impact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you ask me the regen should continue to scale post 60 to 70 while the other races don't get anything. So maybe 1 hp/tick regen per level for a total of 10hp/tick more at 70 etc.<br />
<br />
But then again u have to look at it the other way too. Is it really that hard to level when u got the insane xp in the planes and the insane LDON xp? Anyone can level up quickly enough. Sure u will lag behind a little bit. But extra regen for the soloing shaman is invaluable.<br />

I think this is a grass is greener situation.  I know as a 58 shaman, i would love to be a 60 barb, but if i was max level, would I wish to have the regen back. I don't know.. I don't think so, i hate grinding regular xp.<br />

<br />
Aww crap, you reminded me that I still have an xp pentaly lol.  Barbarians were always a race that didn't make much sense to have an xp penalty.<br />
<br />
Ok, so they start out with good faction - just like HE, Human, WE, Gnome, Dwarf...<br />
<br />
Ok, so they start out with pretty good starting stats for the races they can be (str, dex, sta...not so much wis, but not terrible).  Wish it would have mattered where I put those stats that I pay for in every kill now though.<br />
<br />
Ok, so...uh...so...well those are the only two benefits.  Oh, wait, I can bash with a max skill of 1.  Yay.<br />
<br />
Although for that penalty I did get to start *really* far away from any wizard or druid ports in Halas.  Ooooh, also I was blind for several levels too.  Nothing cool as far as dieties or race items go either, but back in the day the barb spirit hammer was kinda neat :)  However, not fitting into half the buildings in the elven cities was a pain.<br />
<br />
Considering hybrid xp penalties were removed, Sony really should adjust the race xp modifiers or the race innate abilities as well.  I'm not saying remove the modifiers, but adjust them because the effectiveness of what the original % changes were based on has been altered.</div></div><hr />

Halfings get what 2% bonus, humans are even, and trolls/iksar are 18-20% and ogres are 16%, everyone else is what 5%? I think this is why most ppl say you have none, as most races have the same as you. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No hehe...<br />
<br />
Iksars/Trolls 20% penalty<br />
Ogres 15% penalty<br />
Barbarian's 5% penalty<br />
Halflings 5% BONUS<br />
<br />
Warriors as a class have a 10% bonus I believe... was kinda a way to get people to play warriors back when warriors really sucked... rogues have a 5% bonus, I believe, but not sure on that.<br />
<br />
They used to have a hybrid penalty that some people still think exists, but it's not true.  They removed hybrid penalties a long time ago, it was one of the major reasons I created my ranger back in the day.<br />
<br />
The penalties do not apply to AAs, as far as anyone knows.<br />
<br />
***********<br />
As for the xp penalty, i think it's rather rubbish.  Regen helps at level 1, but I'm not level 1.  I'm approaching level 70.  Regen at my level honestly doesn't help a whole lot, so now I feel ripped off for having to get 20% more xp more than everyone around me.  I chose troll because I liked the races characteristics.  Had I liked barbarians, i woulda chose barbarian.  A matter of preference, but my preference had a 20% penalty tagged to it.<br />
<br />
Now they go and up EVERYONE's sitting regen by huge amounts, which negates whatever bonus trolls and iksars had.<br />
<br />
I'm a 65+ shaman --- I cast slow, I cast buffs, I nuke, just like that Vah'Shir standing over there, except when I'm 4 yellows into a level, he's dinging.  <br />
<br />
A tank at our level doesn't need regen... the mobs we fight against hit so hard that health regen is managed by another class.  A shaman has regen spells and items....  so there really isn't a ton of difference in their regen capabilities.  Health and mana regen is not a prob for a shaman of any race.<br />
<br />
Penalize a troll/iksar some other way other than a time sink... I've made it through 66 levels with it, but there is major drawbacks.. there is no telling how many AAs I coulda got instead of xp, and my regen in no way counters what a good # of AAs can provide.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heres my perspective.<br />
<br />
1. I dont mind paying the XP penalty when the benefit was reasonable. In fact, I made my choice consciously. It was 99, before Kunark, and I chose the wrong God (CT). But I paid my XP penalty 1-60 gladdly, I did get a nice benefit from it.<br />
<br />
2. NOW, the benefit is NOT there. My regen is only percentage poinsts better than anyone elses. Every race and class's sitting regen was upped, but mine. Mine stayed the same, but my XP penalty wasnt lowered. <br />
<br />
3. A few extra regen points a tic isn't worth anywhere CLOSE to 20%. Anyone who says it is is talking out of their ass and they know it. <br />
<br />
4. When I chose, the max level was 50, and the XP required to get there was a known quantity. 20 levels later, I should NOT be forced to &quot;live with&quot; this choice. Don't get me wrong, I love being a troll, but I would LIKE the choice to turn the regen OFF now. I don't even get any more new regen than anyone else anyway. <br />
<br />
You people with your &quot;you chose it, now live with it&quot; bullcrap can save that line. The situation was FAR FAR different when that choice was made for most of us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ditto what Blazz said.  And this is one argument that I get pissed about since many non-penalty peeps throw in their super stupid 2c without thinking of whether the penalty fits the benefit and ignoring what EQ was like 5 years ago.<br />

<br />
PS: and this is the straw that broke the camels back for me with Sony.  It is very apparent that they don't care about what is fair (we all know they screw up class balance).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">2. NOW, the benefit is NOT there. My regen is only percentage poinsts better than anyone elses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking at our 2 magelos:<br />
(before regen on items are taken into account)<br />
As a barbarian, I have 12 base regen standing. <br />
You have base 21.  <br />
That is 9 difference.<br />
Or if you prefer a percentage, 21/12 = 175% of barbarian base regen.<br />
<br />
Now, understand that I am not trying to say that regen is worth the penalty, but don't you say that it is only &quot;percentage points&quot; either.  It is damned near double.  This gap closes quickly with itemization and AA's however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Do I think that the penalty for Trolls and Iksar is still fair? No. The benefits have become minor. On the other hand I have these benefits all the time and so the might add up. <br />
<br />
If I could trade, I would take Ogre unstunnability from the front in trade for 5% less exp penalty right away. Neither the regneration, nor the AC bonus is worth it anymore. Ohh, I ll take Slam as well, so maybe Barbarian penalty would be approprate, screw the stun thing ....<br />
<br />
I think the main thing you all should remember is that it is going to be a topic for the next two weeks and then we are all lvl 70. Just remember to go ALL AA when not leveling so you do not pay the penalty for your AA as well.<br />

But you see, I didn't get the benefit of it from 1 to 60.  If you were to STOP paying the penalty now, but having had the benefit, do you see how I'd feel cheated?

<br />
Let's ignore the fact that when sitting regen was upgraded for everyone (for FREE) that races which had regular regen got their's nerfed through crappy programming (did I mention that I regen less than I did untill the modified regen kicks in when I sit down ? Yeah, I did. It's a pain in the arse.). Let's also ignore the fact regen was upgraded for everybody... FOR FREE. Basically what I'm seeing here is that if you're a race not concerned by this then it's fine ... sounds like a lot of replies to shaman concerns from other classes, doesn't it.... <br />
<br />
Bottom line is that this isn't what I agreed to when I created my character. If you're going to change the regen, then adjust the penalty that goes with it. If I buy a monthly subscription to a magasine and 2 years later they decide to reduce the magasine's content by half, then there better be a price adjustment to go with that decision. It's just common sense. <br />
<br />
<br />
Horrible analogy and you made a bad choice, move on.<br />
<br />
Oh and Hurrah for my first negative rep bump.... Now will the person please step up and defend that point of view instead of making a pronouncement from on high ? This, if nothing else convinces me just how useless the rep system is if people are using it to anonymously &quot;punish&quot; opinions they disagree with instead of saying so out loud where everyone can see and judge for themselves. (let's see how many rep bumps I get for this paragraphe) <br />
<br />
And no, it wasn't a bad choice. I wouldn't change race if I could. That doesn't make me wrong in thinking the penalty deserves to be adjusted to reflect changed circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I love arguments that boil down to: I made my decision, but I no longer think it was a wise one, and now I don't want to live with the consequences of my choice.<br />

<br />
But you see, you do get the benefit of it from 1 to 60 - NOW. If SOE were to STOP allowing every race/class to incrementally increase their regen rate when sitting that might be one thing. If SOE were to compensate those penalized in the area of XP gain by changing the regen rate to match the value factor presumed to exist previously then the penalty would have a foundation. <br />
<br />
I suggest giving 60+ troll and iksar shaman a base regen rate of ... 1/20th the amount of your total hitpoints. For a shaman with 2k hitpoints that would work out to 100 hitpoints per tick. What the hell, since SOE is determined to make players happy, lets remove the sitting tick requirement. Troll and iksar shaman inherently, standing or sitting regen 1/20th of their total hitpoints each tick.<br />
<br />
1/20th balances out a 20% xp penalty. Kind of a 1 for 1 swap.<br />
<br />
Totally fair solution, IMO. And for those of you non-troll/iksar shaman ... tough. You picked your race. Live with the consequences. You also picked your class. Its not the same class you started years ago. But, hey, SHUT THE HELL UP and live with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Here is my take.   <br />
<br />
As a Troll, I have worked harder for my levels than any other race save Iksars (and old school hybrids).   So the rest of you have had it easy IMHO.   <br />
<br />
I am proud to be a Shaman but just as proud to be a Troll.  I would not give up being a Troll to be any other race whatever the nice bennie's that SOE could think to throw my way.   <br />
<br />
It's not just the Regen that makes up being a Troll but unless you have leveled one to 65 (now 70) ... you don't know what it's like.   <br />
<br />
Trolls - least played race in EQ - and loving it.</div></div><hr />

My roomate and I have been leveling together almost exclusively over the last couple days. When we started I was 23% in 66 and he was 12% into 66. He is a Barabrian Warrior and I am a Troll Shaman.<br />
<br />
When we logged off last night he was 96% into 67 and I was 60% into 67.<br />
<br />
Aside from the odd death neither of us had been getting xp the other was not. Already he has gone from being 11% behind me to being 36% ahead of me, and neither of us has hit even level 68 yet. At this rate he will have max xp into level 70 while I'm still level 69. This is just utter crap if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Yes being a Troll had it's benefits when I started out. The upped regen was a very handy and useful thing. However these days in the 65+ world it's not even worth mentioning. We won't even comment on how SoE marginalized this skill when they pumped up everyone elses sitting regeneration for the levels where it was MOST useful, ie levels 1-50.<br />
<br />
When you have 7k+ Hitpoints buffed my Hitpoints bar (Even Buffed with Replenishment) rarely moves more than a percentage point each tick. The racial bonus for being a Troll is a VERY small part of my regeneration sitting or standing these days. So small a part that it makes no NOTICEABLE difference at all. Paying a 20% Xp penalty for an effect that I cannot even notice is so stupid that it's not even funny.<br />
<br />
I had no problems paying the XP penalty when the increased regeneration was a USEFUL benifit. These days though I have a serious problem with it for a number of reasons. First off as a said before the upped regeneration provides no noticable benifit anymore, and secondly perhaps even more importantly as I level up I pay an even bigger penatly than I did before as 20% of a level becomes a bigger and bigger amount of xp. Paying an increasing amount of xp, for a dimishing benifit makes me want to scream. <br />
<br />
SoE PLEASE Fix this problem~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">barbarian faction also needs to scale up better with lvl to be worth the penalty. by lvl 70 we should be so beloved and admired that a percentage of monsters won't even attack us back after we attacked them. a good ratio for would be based off the percent of towns we can enter safely at lvl 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Don't forget that the scaly ones get forage, only to a cap of 50.  This is still very useful.<br />
<br />
And as for the Barbarian penalty, Barbarians were a great choice due to thier good primary stats and the fact that they were one of the only good races that had good stats for the choices in class availible to them.<br />
<br />
IMO, the XP penalty should cost a lot in the early levels and scale down as we progress through the levels.   I agree that the bonuses should be paid for in one way or another, but as the benifit begins to become less of a benifit, the price should be reduced OR the benifit should be increased.  ( I dunno how they would increase for the Barbarian though. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Now, understand that I am not trying to say that regen is worth the penalty, but don't you say that it is only &quot;percentage points&quot; either.  It is damned near double.  This gap closes quickly with itemization and AA's however.<br />
What I meant was any NEW benefit I am getting is only percentage points over what someone has. I paid the XP penalty for 65 levels, but enough is enough, the return is trivial now, and the penalty is even MORE debilitating. I watched a Halfling Warrior, same level as me, start with 55% into 66, I was 72. By the time I got to 94 or 96, he dinged. Gime a break.<br />
But you see, I didn't get the benefit of it from 1 to 60.  If you were to STOP paying the penalty now, but having had the benefit, do you see how I'd feel cheated?  <br />
No, I dont. I paid the equilivant of something in the area of 11-15 extra AA's worth of XP to get to 65. I PAID this price already. As I said, I DO NOT want the XP penalty removed for level 1-60. But at 60, there should be SOME sort of adjustment made, based on the benefit of the ability at that point. Maybe just a diminished penalty, I cold live with that. Each level past 60, the penalty is reduced 2%, until at lvl 69, I pay 1.02 to get to 70. I love arguments that boil down to:  I made my decision, but I no longer think it was a wise one, and now I don't want to live with the consequences of my choice.<br />
Wrong. It WAS a wise choice when the decision was made. However, the circumstances surrounding the decision are TOTALLY different now than they were then. Your saying 2 + 2 = 4, but then, in the middle of the equation, they add another factor, so its 2 + 2 + 1, and your telling me its STILL 4. <br />
Guess what?  A lot of people who chose to be a good race back when faction and getting into cities mattered - now REGRET having chosen that race.  Make sure you support a quest for them to *switch* to a troll, iksar, or ogre at level 70 because they, too realized they made the wrong choice.  Unfair?  Why yes, yes it is.  So is what you're suggesting.<br />
Deal. Remember though, if you want that extra 9 hps a tic regen I get, you gotta give back some Xp, lots of it. OK? We roll back all the XP it would have taken to get where you are, and then you get the regen. <br />
<br />
Come on guys, this is a TOTAL no brainer, and I am, quite frankly, SHOCKED that some of my fellow shaman are being SO obtuse about this topic. As a class we watched our abilities go from insanely good (say, troll regen for a lvl 40) to barely influentual (troll regen at lvl 65). We are not talking about trivial amounts of XP here. I am willing to BET that it is taking me something like 1 or 2 FULL AA points to get to 67, compared to someone with no penalty. The sheer AMOUNT of XP being paid is what is pissing us off, not the fact that we have to pay it. I am WILLING to pay, but at LEAST lock it down, maybe put the amount &quot;extra&quot; per level at a set number, like 20% of lvl 60 for every level after 60, or reduce the % the higher level we get, like 20-18-15-12-10-7-5 and leave it at 5 or something. I will pay 5% for my trivial extra regen I get now. <br />
<br />
Please look at it with an open mind. For every 10 mobs a Kitty shaman kills, I have to kill 12, and for that, I get . . . nothing extra now when I level. If I was gaining 5+ extra tics of regen per level for my 20%, I wouldnt be bitching. But I am not getting ANY extra anymore (I might net 2 extra points of regen for the next 5 levels, but I doubt it). I already paid for the extra I have, in the form of 10-15 AA's worth of XP. You want a +9 regen AA to make up for it? Fine. Calculate the amount of XP I have paid extra, thats what it costs. Would you pay 15 AA points for +10 regen? I dunno, but dont make me keep paying a penalty when I am no longer getting any return for it, and even if I do get 2 extra points of regen for leveling from 65 to 70, no WAY thats worth the additional 10-15 AA extra its costing me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Gonna run some rough numbers, based on that post on Steel Warriors about the group that ground their way to lvl 70 in PoFire, and counted the mobs. Here is the post, first of all:<br />
<br />
A group of Altera Vita guildmates and myself just completed a 21.5 hour exp grind to ding us all level 70. So i thought i'd post and share some data with everyone that's interested in what they can expect.<br />
<br />
First, the entire grind was done in PoFire in teh second castle. All mobs were level 68. The exact time of the grind took 21:38:40 (rounded to the nearest :05). We killed 1255 mobs. That averages to 0.3195% reg exp/mob and 0.30877%exp/minute.<br />
<br />
here's teh breakdown in # of mobs it took to ding each level.<br />
<br />
67 - 261<br />
68 - 291<br />
69 - 332<br />
70 - 371<br />
<br />
Additionally, AA exp on these mobs at lvl 70 was right at 4%/mob as compared to 5%/mob at 65.<br />
<br />
I hope this information proves useful and informative to those heading out this week to grind it out.<br />
<br />
Kakgumu<br />
<br />
So, assuming the poster was a no-penalty class/race, for the sake of ease. The 261 mobs it took for him to get to 67, x 1.2 = 313 mobs for me, a Troll Shaman to go to 67. At 5% AA XP per mob, thats 2.6 AA's worth of XP EXTRA it costed me. 67 to 68 is 2.9 AA worth. 68 to 69 is 3.3 AA extra. 69 to 70 is 3.7 extra. Lets add it up. <br />
<br />
It will cost me the equilivant of TWELVE AA POINTS to get from 65 to 70. If there is a SINGLE person in this ENTIRE game that thinks this is even REMOTELY fair, then I would be totally flabergasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Can't ditch the exp penalty for races. There's still bonuses.<br />
<br />
If you removed the 20% penalty, why would anyone ever roll a Human Monk? Or a non-Iksar Necro? Or a non-Ogre anything? If you wanna ditch the penalty, you gotta lose the bonuses... and some classes are going to be REALLY pissy about losing their innate whatevers.<br />
<br />
12AA points isn't anything worth getting your knickers in a twist over anyway. I've gotten more than that in a single day. In a week you'll be maxed and won't care anymore.<br />
<br />
This is pretty much the reason that no race has a bonus in EQ2, and one of the reasons 80-90% of the Horde population in WoW are Undead (immune to almost all CC (sleep/poly/fear/sap) and perm EB).<br />
<br />
If anyone has a case to complain it's dwarves. Their racial ability got farmed out to every single char in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Good post Blazz.  At this stage in the game the penalties are ridiculous (someone earlier mentioned that hybrid penalties, which were also ridiculous, were removed long ago and I thought I'd bring it up again because it's very relevant).  This information pretty much disgusts me.  I still remember what a *nightmare* grinding to 60 is.  It was NOT FUN!!!  Anyone from SOE listening?  Mindless exp. grinding has nothing to offer in the fun department about 95% of the time.  Add to that that if I want to level now from 65-70 as an Iksar I have to spend 20% more time *not* having fun...  well it's a logical choice, and it involves me not signing on for OoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Bascially you want it coded that once @ 65, the penalties and bonuses go away. Not sure if it can be done (definetly won't be) but that sounds fair.<br />
<br />
However most of the logic leads me to believe you guys would also be ok with me changing from Shaman to another class. I mean I signed up to be able to tank mobs in the face while dogdog chewed it's ass.. And I don't mean 2year? old expansions like POP Elementals either..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">The biggest problem, as usual is that the system wasn't thought out to be scaleable past 60 (probably 50) which leads to a lot of things breaking down. Including racial penalties and bonuses. <br />
<br />
They made it so that Xp penalties don't apply to aa xp (tested and confirmed). Why not just cap racial xp penalties at 65 as well ? Any bonus has already been more than paid for in first 65 levels of grinding in which these abilities were originally implemented. Barring that, then at least scale the bonus accordingly. <br />
<br />
On a side note.... Humans are the ones that should have gotten the halfling xp bonus to compensate the lack of racial abilities and ordinary stats. It boggles the mind that something so obvious never occured to the designers.<br />
<br />
Ps: Thanks for the support, I appreciate it. You know who you are  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Well Kakgumu is an Ogre...Also lets think about your xp penalty in a way that might make sense to others.<br />
<br />
When you buy a house you pay 95% of your payment just to cover interest the other 5% goes to the principle.  As you pay off more and more of the principle you pay a lowering percentage to Interest.  In time you are paying very little to your interest and for the most part just pay on the Principle.  Kind of the reverse of what is happening for you trolls etc..<br />
<br />
So as a troll you pay 20% of your exp to the penalty and 80% to leveling.  As you lvl you pay the same amount it never goes down.  Lvl 1 = 20% - Lvl 70 = 20%.  At some point during your leveling you have decided that the benifit you recieved for that exp penalty was no longer worth paying.  Lets just say lvl 65 was the cut off.<br />
<br />
It wasn't a problem for you when you were already 65 AND there was no penalty for AA.  Now that there are more levels to get, you will again pay the penalty for leveling.  Here is the problem really.  You have collected the benefit for the cost for 65 levels.  There is no way to reimburse you for that in the way of lvls or AA.  Its not so much a Racial penalty as it is an abilities penalty.  <br />
<br />
Barbarians have no night vision, but can wear both medium and large sized armour.  So I paid a 5% penalty to be able to wear medium AND large armor...oh wait good faction too...<br />
<br />
Vah Shir have infravision and a high innate safe-falling skill also they have excellent base stats.  No penalty...<br />
<br />
Ogres have the advantage of not being able to be stunned from blows delivered to their front.* They can still be stunned if attacked from behind.* Ogres also have some basic night vision and very high Strength and Stamina.  15% Penalty for Not being stunned from the front, infravision, and the highest base STR and STA in game.<br />
<br />
Trolls have the added bonus of an increased health regeneration rate.* This amount increases as their level increases.* Also they have Infravision.  20% Penalty.<br />
<br />
Iksars can also forage.* Iksar's get a natural AC boost and start out with good skill in swimming.* Plus what a troll has as well for the same 20% Penalty.<br />
<br />
Frogloks have excellent night vision and start out with good skill in swimming.  Penalty = None.<br />
<br />
Seems to me the best Choice for a Shaman EXP Penalty vs Abilities is the Ogre until gear makes it a moot point, altho they still can't be stunned from the front.<br />
<br />
Stats aside because you can always max those 65+ lets go with the other abilities.  <br />
<br />
Regen, you can max it BUT Trolls will laways be higher, Nightvision, again moot, The ONLY thing I can see being a bonus after you max your stats is not being able to be stunned from the front.  Even safefall is marginal at best.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">When i chose Vah Shir,I chose the race for &quot;roleplay reasons&quot;. If I had been a powergamer I would have chosen troll for the nice regen + snare (OMG) neck clicky. I had (and have) no idea what the penalty or otherwise was (though i knew about penalities having played an Ogre SK in the past).<br />
<br />
Yes I would have paid an exp penalty for it. To whine about it later seems childish to me. <br />
<br />
I can hear your frustration, but if they fix the exp penalty i want to see all races get the same regen etc. and quests. But that would also be dull. Let's face it the differences  make the game more interesting.<br />
<br />
Back in the day evil races also had some real difficulties in travelling and banking etc which made another reason to make evils &quot;more powerful but harder life&quot;. This is now gone with the faction quests and of course PoK/Nexus Books etc etc along with Luclin + content not really caring about your race.<br />
<br />
Out of interest do Vah Shir have any penalty? <br />
<br />
We  get as innate for the race:<br />
<br />
50 Safefall<br />
50 sneak <br />
infravision<br />
eat twice as much food + regen STA twice as fast (the benefit now nerfed out due to endurance changes)<br />
<br />
Yes the nerf on the innate regen by upping other classes regens (as well as making regen items easier to get) was unfair on the regen races. I grant that.<br />
<br />
But if we go down that road lets think about the nerf of all &quot;good&quot; faction races after Luclin...<br />

If this were true, I wouldnt have any problem with the penalty, but is simply not the case. From level 65 to 70, I will probably get LESS THAN 2 extra hps of regen per-tic total. That is going to cost me 12 AAs worth of XP? Come on. If I got an extra couple tics of regen each level, then I wold have NO PROBLEM paying 20% for it. Even 1 per level, heck, I would pay 20% for half a point per level, if I got it EVERY level. That would make my standing regen 35 more points than yours at lvl 70. Thats not what I get though, I get 9 right now, and I will be shocked if it goes to 11 by lvl 70.<br />

12AA points isn't anything worth getting your knickers in a twist over anyway. I've gotten more than that in a single day. In a week you'll be maxed and won't care anymore.<br />
I am not asking for the penalty to be ditched entirely. I am asking for the penalty to be reduced as the return for the penalty is diminished. It should have been reduced to 15% the day they upped everyones sitting Regen to near-troll level, and didnt up ours. I payed HAPPILY from levels 1-60. 60-65 were a PITA, but I still paid. I got a big 1 extra hp per tic compared to my non-troll friends. <br />
<br />
And 12 AA points may not be a lot to you, but to some of us, its a pretty good amount. I raid during 90% of my online time. the other 10% is played during non-peak hours when my guild has very few on. I am not big on pick-up groups, but lately I have been forcing myself to find some groups to get XP. Remember also, this is 12 AA JUST for levels 66-70. I probably paid 9 for 60-65, and another 5 for 50-60. Thats over 25 TOTAL AAs extra I have paid, for night vision and 9 extra hps a tic of regen? NINE????? Come on.</div></div><hr />

You made a choice back in the day, penalty known or unknown, doesn't make a difference.  I will not be ignorant and say live with it, but I will ask you to understand that you did make a choice.  <br />
<br />
I don't remember if you said you picked troll for looks or for the regen.  If you choose for the ability then who's to say you didn't actually level faster then someone without regen like that.  So the penalty was to try and balance out that leveling.  Think... Fungi... I used that as a Barbarian Shaman and out leveled by far the other barb shaman who didn't have it.  Thats 15 regen if I am remembering correctly.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Smert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I think it is a question of scaling the benifit vs. the penalty. <br />
<br />
I started in May 1999. I chose troll knowing that it would be more difficult to level, be oversized, that NPCs would be hostile and in exchange I would regen, and bash- not sure if I knew of the nightvision. I quite truthfully didn't realise how much a wisdom deficit I was starting at compared to other races. <br />
<br />
I thought that I would work harder and suffer adversity but in the end would have a tangible benefit in exchange. <br />
<br />
I do not think that the racial benefits for a troll make them 20% better than a non-troll or the same level (past say 10th), class, gear and AAs. I think if it did I'd see calls for nerfing Troll/iskar regen as overpowered. <br />
<br />
But if it doesn't make us better in the end, makes us level slower than other members of our groups, only marginally helps soloing, and it's comparitive effectiveness has been eroded by greater HPS, the sitting Regen boost EVERYONE got, and more regen capability (In 1999 the sole gear alternative was the Rubicite BP )...why are we still charged 20%? Drop it to the advantage it gives. Say 5% or at worst even 10%.  OR simply add a trait to bring us back up- use a 2H weapon in the primary slot and leave the secondary free- still not 20%, but better. Or innate ability &quot;Summon Gnome-kebabs&quot; or something. <br />

How obtuse can you be. When I made that choice, there were 50 levels and NO AA. I picked Troll for the regen and the uniqueness of the race. The penalty was known. It was an acceptable payment for leveling a character from 1-50, with nothing to do with XP after 50. Even when Kunark came out, I didnt mind the penalty. I was still getting a decent return for it. But now I am not getting any return for it. None. OK, percentage points, litterally. For an ability that has made nearly obsolete in this day of 12K hp tanks and 9K hp Shaman. <br />
I don't remember if you said you picked troll for looks or for the regen.  If you choose for the ability then who's to say you didn't actually level faster then someone without regen like that.  So the penalty was to try and balance out that leveling.  Think... Fungi... I used that as a Barbarian Shaman and out leveled by far the other barb shaman who didn't have it.<br />
I did pick it for the regen. I think it did help me level. I had a Rubi BP, then a Fungi, and a Manastone, so the regen HELPED ME LEVEL. I ALREADY DID THOSE LEVELS, AND PAID THE PENALTY WHILE DOING THEM! <br />
<br />
I dont understand any of your points here Blud. You are saying that even if I dont get another single new additional point of regen more than a non-regen race, I should STILL pay for this &quot;benefit&quot;? One more time, and try to read slower so you understand it better. If I got additional regen for the penalty I am paying, I would be glad to continue to pay it. But I do not get any significant additional regen (maybe 1, maybe 2 points for 5 levels), certainly not enough to justify 20%. If you want to charge me 5% for my 2 pts of Regen and my Infravision, fine. I will suck it up and pay the 5%. But at 20% penalty, I should be getting a point a level, and so far, I am only averaging 13% of a point extra per level. <br />
<br />
Bottom line here. I paid for the regen I have. I have 15 less AA than everyone else because of it. At level 70 I will have another 12 less than everyone, and basically get nearly nothing in return for this.</div></div><hr />

Bouncing the barbs are blind, trolls get better vision argument is moot. DE, HIE, Wood Elf also get better vision FOR NO PENALTY.<br />
<br />
If you are going to point fingers about fairness, it is clear, SINCE LEVEL 50, the XP penalty for trolls and iksar dramatically overwrites the regen benefits of having that penalty. Now, along the same lines, Orges with only a 15% XP penalty have the benefit of frontal unstunnability ALWAYS. The can't be partially stunned, sorta stunned, made a little dizzy. There is no mitigation of benefit.<br />

If, as a barb shaman, you are having vision issues beyond level 9 ... buy this spell: Serpent Sight<br />

<br />
If you are a cat or a frog, my apologies. Nothing to suggest here except get therapy. If you are in therapy, change doctors.<br />
<br />
Seriously, the XP penalty post 60 in no way provides a balance. The XP loss paid by iksar, shaman, barbs and orges is just additional grinding time for a debt well paid full. That a troll/iksar regen faster is so moot to the game beyond level 60 that it makes all the points and counterpoints of this thread laughable.<br />
<br />
How often have you non-troll/iksar shaman reflected post-anytime, &quot;geeze, I really wish I could regen as fast as a troll or iksar!&quot;? Answer - NEVER.<br />
<br />
As for SOE changing inherent traits of classes. Well, if for no other reason, SOE needs to remove the XP penalty from both troll and orges for the simple reason that when models were changed, neither trolls or orges inherently scratch their butts. This alone is one of the biggest nerfs in the game! Ever! Where is the compensation?<br />
<br />
What I sense in the responses from non-troll/iksar is embarrassing as a shaman. Folks responding and yelling &quot;OMG NO!!!&quot; remind me of clerics who are so afraid of any change to other class healing they have no objective point of view that those changes will mean absolutely nothing to them personally or as a group. Same here. If troll, iksar, orge and barbs had no XP penalty it would mean NOTHING to any other race or class. Zippo. Nada.<br />
<br />
Stop making up justifications to feed your e-penis mentality that you are somehow either marginally better or worse based on something as irrelavant as this. The penalty is stupid. The end game benefits are non-existant in any context that is game defining or changing.<br />
<br />
Get rid of the XP penalties. Give back our butt scratching animation!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry, I do not support this petition. Racial xp penalties are in place due to certain races having certain benifits that other races do not. For example, Iksar have improved vision, higher natural ac, regen, and the inate ability to forage. Ogre's get improved vision, and the inability to be stunned from the front. I'm not going to list all the benifits that the races that have an xp penalty recieve, but I'm sure that you are all aware of them. The reason that I can not support your petition is that the penalty is how you pay for these advantages. Perhaps they are not as strong in the high end game as they were when you were a noobling, but you still have them. Think of it this way, you are paying for the advantage that you had when you were lower level. I don't know how many time i got lost in the dark tunnels when I was low lvl, trying to go from Everfrost to Black Burrow. You would have had no problem accomplishing such at low levels. Now you must pay for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Can't ditch the exp penalty for races. There's still bonuses.<br />
<br />
If you removed the 20% penalty, why would anyone ever roll a Human Monk? Or a non-Iksar Necro? Or a non-Ogre anything? If you wanna ditch the penalty, you gotta lose the bonuses... and some classes are going to be REALLY pissy about losing their innate whatevers.<br />
<br />
OK, Human monks do in fact have a bonus over the iksar that is small in comparison at lower levels, but much more useful at the top end.<br />
<br />
I am certain that removing the XP penalty entirely is not the intent of the post and the many supporters that have contributed to it.  From what I have read, it looks like the at some point, that the reward that costs the &quot;trivial&quot; 12-15AA extra between 66-70 alone, be re-evaluated to be sure that the cost is in tandem with the benefits.<br />
<br />
I personally agree that the penalty should not be removed, but also agree that it should be scaled back as the ability becomes more trivial OR the cost remains the same and the reward is scaled up accordingly.<br />
<br />
My analogy: <br />
1986 Hyundai Pony in 1986 = $6799.00 +/- Dealer may sell for less <br />
1986 Hyundai Pony in 2004 = $1250.00 +/- in new condition<br />
&gt;&gt; The Same car, the same condition is not equal to what it was in 1986 and niether are the racial penalties from level 1 to what they are level 50+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">IPerhaps they are not as strong in the high end game as they were when you were a noobling, but you still have them.<br />
You stated that you read the posts, but I find it hard to believe. At the risk of being redundant, let me list the argument again, in a simpler format, so you can read it more thoroughly.<br />
<br />
1. Not asking for the penalty to be removed, just scaled down AFTER level 60, when certain benefits cease to have any real value or stop scaling up accordingly (especially refferring to regen here).<br />
<br />
2. I PAID for having better vision and better regen by having to do extra XP every single level. Why do I have to pay for the benefit I recieved between levels 1-60 now, when I am pushing toward lvl 70? I am not getting any NEW regen for this penalty. If I was, I would gladdly pay. Would you support UPPING the regen bonus Trolls get to be more in line with the penalty we pay in XP? How much regen is 12 AA worth anyway? <br />
<br />
3. I am not even asking for it to be REMOVED completely, although I think that would be fair in some cases, like Barbs. I will pay an extra 5% as a Troll for the vision, slam, and the 1.5 extra hps/tic I will gain between 65 and 70. But 20% is WAY outta line. <br />
<br />
4. Each race would have to be evaluated seperately. Iskar continue to get a respectable AC bonus. Ogres get a nice ability to be immune to stun from the front. etc etc etc. Fine. Re-evaluation is what I am requesting, not blindly eliminating all racial penalties, as you seem to be inferring. <br />
<br />
Conclusion: Either reward me with an adequate benefit for all this extra XP I am being forced to do, or reduce the penalty to be more in line with the current reward I recieve. Keep in mind, I already paid well over 15 AA's worth of XP from 1 to 65 in order to have a measly 9 extra hps/tic vs a Barb, and thats only standing. Sitting we get MUCH closer together, becaus SOE changed the regen for ALL OTHER RACES a while back, but never bothered to adjust the penalty the regenning races were paying for that benefit. <br />
<br />
Its not rocket science. I really doubt there would be a huge uproar if SOE suddenly announced that the XP racial penalty was being set to 0% for barbs, 5% for trolls, and 10% for Ogres and Iskar (trolls dont get frontal stun immunity or an AC bonus) starting at level 65 through 70. In fact, I REALLY feel that most players of other races would nod their heads and mutter &quot;that seems fair&quot; to themselves. Because it is fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Can't ditch the exp penalty for races. There's still bonuses.<br />
<br />
Had you bothered to read the post, he said adjusted, not remove.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Think of it this way, you are paying for the advantage that you had when you were lower level. <br />
<br />
I was going to leave well enough alone since ultimately this thread will have no practical effect on the game even if everyone were to agree. But it's late and I'm bored.<br />
<br />
SOE justified removing the hybrid xp penalties by saying that at higher levels the classes were equivalent (that's the theorie anyways). The same now holds true for racial bonuses. Especially now that most of them are available as aa's or have since become common effects on easily available gear or augments while others like regen got blanket &quot;upgrades&quot; given (for free) to every race. (I don't see anyone volunteering to pay 12 aa's for their new fangled sitting regen... any volunteers ? Didn't think so.)<br />
<br />
It's not brain surgury people. This thread started because like so many other things in EQ, the game has evolved, new levels were added, abilities were farmed out, and the bonuses/costs weren't scaled accordingly or were outright trivialised. People feel that post 65 they're paying more xp then ever for racial bonuses that no longer provide a real tangible advantage to justify their rising xp cost. <br />
<br />
If people would drop the accusations of &quot;you want something for nothing&quot; about 5 minutes and use their heads they'd realise that what people want is to get what they're paying for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The penalty needs adjusting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Ok here's the problem... using previous peoples numbers...<br />
<br />
it cost me (as an Iksar) 20% extra xp to level to 62.  When I made my Iksar (July 2000) I knew about the exp. penalty, I was moving to a new server and wanted to play in the new land of Kunark - where xp was so much better it didn't matter so much.  I went through level 30, and 35 Hell levels before the change - I even remember the book until I hit 30 (and later when they removed it entirely.)  Going up through levels 1-35 (even with the hell levels they removed them before I hit level 40) I didn't once question wether or not my higher ac (50 at level 60 iirc) my higher regen, my infravision, and my ability to forage was worth extremely limited gear choices (which remained persistant all the way through velious, in pop got much better) and my incredibly bad faction (even worse before the huge faction overhaul if anyone remembers those days still.)  Even at level 50, and 52 it didn't bother me so much, cannibalize and regen as a shaman had always made a large deal of sense and worth the extra 20%.  About the time I hit 48, PoP came out (I'm a VERY VERY VERY slow leveler, I have NO other alts.)  and with it came the wonders of alternate advancement.  I again was very excited with my Iksar bonuses... new foraging quests and shaw quests made my forage very worth it.  and the new AA regens **worked double for me because of my race penalty**.  Making me feel the extra drudgery of leveling was worth it because I was reaping the rewards for the investment of the race I chose.<br />
<br />
Then they nerfed the aa regen bonus.  They added many more AAs which served to reduce the % of bonus and upped the levels again, and then again greatly increasing the amount of experience required again, and again.  That 20% which used to mean maybe an hour of extra leveling per level, was now 5 and 6 hours extra.  I can only imagine what its like post 65. (well 15 AA's as has been mentioned). <br />
<br />
Well... so in the end, I have the equivilant of and extra regen 9 standing.  I have innate infravision, and a 50AC bonus.<br />
<br />
What I'm gonna ignore are the things that can change with gear and faction work and quests.<br />
<br />
My poor faction, can be worked on.  Thus I don't really see it as a detrimate.  I can buff my stats and equip better stat equipment, so my lower melee stats than a barbarian aren't really a detrimate.  I can't use a JBB or any of the other JB items.  That is a detrimate, even at higher levels when those items may not be used as much, I might still take advantage of using them (and wish I could on a daily basis, a wintercall is prolly the one thing I've always wanted).  I won't count my skill in swiming, since that is available to anyone at level 40.  I don't swim better than anyone can swim at level 40... I just can swim that good at level 20 - where there's no real underwater levels to use that ability.<br />
<br />
So.. I'm paying for the ability to not use some plate items, some of which are incredible usefull to a shaman.  <br />
However I'm getting regen 9 (while standing) Innate infravision, and a forage skill of 50 (I get something about every 8 forages, though I can score rares), and 50 AC (at level 60)<br />
<br />
in the course of 70 levels I would estimate that it cost me around 30 AAs worth of additional XP.<br />
<br />
I'd pay 9 AAs for regen 9 (think that's fair and giving with the standard)<br />
I'd personally pay 5 AA's for the ability to forage with a skill of 50 (I'd pay more if it would skill up higher, but it doesn't)<br />
I wouldn't buy it... (like I would the other two) But I think infravision is worth 1 AA.<br />
I would pay 3 AA for the ability to use JB items (back in the day it was a LOT more equipment, Runed Miteral Bracer I remember paying 300 plat for before I found out I couldn't use it)<br />
I think 50 AC is worth 3 AAs.  Dunno if I would buy it, but I did make the choice.<br />
<br />
If you add those up (and subtract the JB stuff) it comes to 15 AA.<br />
<br />
To me that's saying there's 15 AA's worth of xp I paid for and by level 70 I've earned 30 AA's worth of skills.  That's 15 AA's that are unaccounted for at level 70.<br />
<br />
15 AA's is what is extra from level 65-70.<br />
<br />
To me there are two options here.  <br />
<br />
One: at level 65 eliminate the xp penalty for race.  By this time we've paid for the extra benefits of our bonuses and its time to get a little more fair with our xp.  We paid for them... we should keep them give credit where credits due.  But were paying more than is fair for that benefit.  I mean seriously level 66 - 67 prolly has more extra xp added to us that levels 1-50 combined.<br />
<br />
Two: scale up our abilities so they are worth another 15 AA's (this doesn't just go for Iksar, but for every race that pays xp for additional abilities, I've never played anything but an Iksar since I started playing my iksar so I can't speak to them on an in depth level)<br />
<br />
For example, at level 50 our infravision (1 point) could turn in to Ultra vision (add 3 points) and then to Plainsight at 65 (add 5 points) for another 8 points of ability.  At level 60 and Iksar's forage could be raised to skill level 100 (4 points).  And we could get another 50 AC at level 70 (3 points)<br />
<br />
That would add up to another 15 AA's and would make me feel better about having spent the xp.  Not necessarily where I'd choose to put those AA's but I didn't sign up to choose.  However, I didn't sign up to keep paying for abilities that would matter so little at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Here's some other racial abilities I'd pay for:<br />
<br />
Safefall to 75 (is it?) I'd pay 5 AAs<br />
Clicky snare I'd pay 7 AAs<br />
Slam I'd pay 5 AAs.<br />
Frontal Unstunability I'd pay 12 AAs<br />
innate sta of over 100 I'd have to pay 5 AAs (Iksar start with 75)<br />
Innate ultravision I'd pay 4 AAs (inline with above)<br />
Sneak! I'd pay 9 AAs (don't kitties get this?)<br />
<br />
Trolls and Ogres pay for their abilities with detrimates too, lower innate wis, only large armor (less of a problem now), (not touching faction issue as I said though they are MUCH better off than Iksar)  Kitties have to eat a lot more as well, which would suck (I love stat food and am too lazy to force feed myself).  Personally I think frogs are underpaying but not by much, Barbarians are prolly overpaying a little.  Though... I wish I had slam.  even in its max skill of 50(?) and wish I could use a JBB.<br />
<br />
I don't really want my xp back I'm only level 62 and think I'm still paying it off a little... but at level 65 - 70, its not worth it.<br />

As said before, when you created your character you got a huge bonus for being a troll (at this time it was huge). Unless they removed your regen, you still have this bonus.<br />
I mean, nothing changed, you have more regen, you have less xp per kill, you got it since the beginning. So for me it's fair to go on like that, you regen 2 to 3 times faster than me (I don't count your darkness necklace while I got a summon crappy hammer one as a barbarian ;)), you got an xp penalty.

Yes I have more regen than you. Bought and paid for as I went from lvl 1 to 65, including the hell levels I suffered through, since I was well beyond them when SOE smoothed out the process. So either give me MORE regen for the additional I am paying NOW, or ADJUST the penalty to something more in line with the reward, or remove the penalty and shut off any NEW gain in regen I get. <br />
<br />
I keep my 1-65 regen though. I ALREADY PAID FOR IT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Blazz....<br />
This is hard for you I think.  Let me explain in a way that even a young child would understand.<br />
<br />
If you get a tattoo it is there pretty much for life.  You can have it removed but it requires a rather expensive surgery and is fairly painful.  Most of the time you are left with a big pinkish scar in the shape of the original tattoo.<br />
<br />
Now think about that for a little bit, let it sink in...<br />
<br />
Ok now a question for you.<br />
<br />
Are you willing to pay a large price or do a quest to have the penalty removed?  I knew when I got my tat's that they would be there for life.  I knew what penalty they carried and was willing to accept that.<br />
<br />
In the time since I got my first that they have come out with newer inks, better needles, etc.  If I want my tats to be touched up with the new stuff I have to go thru the process all over again AND because of old scar tissue it may not really do to much as the new ink might not take.<br />
<br />
You made a troll for the benefits and the looks.  I chose the tattoo's I did for the benefits(some ladies really dig um) and the looks.  You want your penalty removed for the benefits that YOU feel you already paid for.  I already paid for my tat's too and if I wish to get rid of anymore of them I will pay again and suffer another penalty for having them removed.<br />
<br />
So again I ask, are you willing to pay some sort of additional fee, quest or other wise to have your penalty removed?<br />
<br />
Also Blazz after you make lvl 70 while still having this racial penalty will you still be championing this cause?</div></div><hr />

What people are failing to understand is it doesn't matter if YOU think you have paid enough for the penalty or not.  <br />
<br />
The real reason has already been hit right on by an earlier post here.  It would have upset more people to remove it then to just leave it in.  In 5 levels you will not see anyone here who is currently 65 complaining about the penalty until they raise the level cap again if they do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a clue folks. At the &quot;newbie&quot; levels, everyone regens the same. 50+, regen matters far less as things hit harder, you get more HP, and you start grouping more. At 60+, non-spell regeneration might as well not even be there.<br />
<br />
For this amazing boon, two races need to gain an extra yellow bar every single level. One of them gets a AC bump - Come on, people, we play Shaman. Of all the people in the game, you should KNOW that 25 - 50 AC makes zero difference unless it gets you to one of the &quot;magic numbers&quot;. Monks will tell you of the soft cap, as well. <br />
<br />
Beeg, you asked &quot;If all races had no penalty, who would play a human or an elf?&quot; - Here's your answer. Frogloks have Barbarian-level stats except in strength. They have better faction. They have ultravision. They have greatly increased lung capacity. They have 125 stamina. They have short stature, meaning they fit everywhere better than any other Shaman race. They have no exp penalty. How many people are ditching their 5% penalty slamming (*laugh*) Barbarians to make a Frog Shaman?</div></div><hr />

Sure it is. Both are issues of folks being penalized for something they no longer have. The big difference is that Nobody would compete for groups against all Ogres in the game if they lost the 15% penalty, while bumping all other classes up to 75% slow would be... Bad.<br />
<br />
Race is just a non-issue in game mechanics. And for the record, ogre stun immunity isn't a huge boon. As a barbarian, I almost never get stunned at all, when I do, it's almost always from something stupid (Was an iceboned skeleton last time it happened). I get knocked around, thus interrupting a spell. Ogres get knocked around too, not a huge deal.</div></div><hr />

How many people are ditching their 5% penalty slamming (*laugh*) Barbarians to make a Frog Shaman?How often do you see people rolling up newbie chars that aren't frogs? It's the superior choice. Without an exp penalty, Ogres would dominate. Anyone not an Ogre would be inferior (although some would say they already are because AA isn't penalized).<br />
<br />
To buy 10 points of regen (Regen1/1/1, Covalescence3/6, Health Aura3/?/?/?/?) costs probably 27AA. You have NOT already paid for your regen. The case could be made that before the level 70 increase non-regen classes were getting screwed because you were getting that 9extra regen for far far less than it would cost them.<br />
<br />
If you really really hate the exp penalty, Frogs and Cats don't have it... but an extra couple days grinding in 65-70 is probably more efficient than re-rolling don't you think?</div></div><hr />

The game has evolved into one where it is very benificial to group up, and most of the shaman I know of gain a very large magority of thier XP as part of a group.<br />

Actually, since necro mana regeneration is passive, they do sit. However, in situaitons where sitting could possibly cause aggro, they are more likely to FD. I am not sure if FD is considered &quot;sitting&quot; for the purpose of regening hps.</div></div><hr />

It is my understanding that while Fiegned, regeneration is at the same rate as when standing.  I assume that applys to both mana and hit points.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but this theory is just not in line with the spirit of the game. In this game, especially now, with AA abilities playing such a large roll in a characters development, abilities are bought and paid for ONCE. Sure, you will never be able to &quot;buy&quot; a trolls regen, but you cant &quot;buy&quot; a clerics Divine Arbitration AA either, or a BLs Paragon AA. This is a similar situation, except instead of a class difference, its a race difference. The game is made up of classes and races, not JUST races. <br />
<br />
I view my extra regen much like an on-going AA that increases itself as I level. I pay for it in much the same way. But you dont have to KEEP paying for the ability to Canni 5, do you? Of course not, and to even remotely insinuate something of this nature would be &quot;fair&quot; is ridiculous. Well, asking some races to CONTINUE to pay for their racial benefits is almost EXACTLY the same thing.</div></div><hr />

Sorry too, because it is not a theory, it is how it works presently, therefore is exactly in the spirit of the game which is defined by the game.<br />
<br />

<br />
There are no racial AA.  The AA have been divided by class.  Racial AA is exactly what I am asking for in exchange for nullification of the exp penalty, however whenever I suggest it, it gets ignored as if it was never stated.  Almost as if those who read it were an EQ Dev.<br />
<br />
I pay for it in much the same way. But you dont have to KEEP paying for the ability to Canni 5, do you?<br />
<br />
You are comparing a class AA with a skill that is not an AA.  This is not within the spirit of the game.<br />
<br />
If this benefit that you have over me is so small and so tiny that its not worth paying the penalty, why is there so much resistance to letting me earn it as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">It occurs to me that everyone had the same chance to choose a race when they started the game.  Some folks had more race choices (Iksar, Vahshir, Frogluk) than us old timers.<br />
<br />
Since EQ's inception many game mechanics have changed, many classes have evolved (the shaman much slower than others it seems) and the value of abilities (including racial) has changed too.<br />
<br />
And yet that 20% xp penalty has always been there for the troll.  So some of us chose the troll inspite of the xp penalty (not necessarily because of the regen).  I would guess that a large majority of folks chose other races just to avoid the XP penalty no matter what their class.  I think that it is reasonable to presume that a portion of those folks would find the grapes a little sour should the racial abilities actually be made worth something again.  Right now they seem to be feeling pretty smug.<br />

Yes, of course. working as intended.<br />
<br />
And its NOT exactly how it works. My aa xp is not affected by a racial penalty. I wonder why that is? Personally, I think the only reason the racial penaltys still exist in the exact same format since the dawn of time is that it would take too much work on the part of SOE to adjust it. Its completly logical to scale the penalty down as the benefit gets less useful, but in the end, there are two things it WON'T do. It WON'T keep people online longer (in fact, the penalty helps do just that, keeps us trolls logged in more if we wish to keep up levels with our mates) and two, it wont make us go get new gear (like the scaling of Focus item effects), which, in turn, keeps us on longer. <br />
<br />
People who say this will never be changed are probably right. SOE doesnt give people reasons to log on LESS and XP LESS, jsut doesnt happen. Except their reasons are completely different from the reasons you obtuse, selfish, close-minded people keep trying to spew. <br />
If this benefit that you have over me is so small and so tiny that its not worth paying the penalty, why is there so much resistance to letting me earn it as well?<br />

I have indeed read most of your thoughts on this exp penalty issue, although I can't claim that I have read them all.  I am pretty sure I got the gist of the argument.  I am sure you have the gist of mine, and I am not sure how you can discuss with someone ideas about it when if they don't agree with you it makes THEM close-minded, obtuse and selfish.<br />

I wasnt speaking specifically to you Ronax, but I am getting very fustrated here, as I watch Shaman, a class that was severely de-powered due to modifications in the game itself sit here and try and justify NOT changing this completely out-dated feature of Racial Penaltys. <br />
<br />
Again, 1-50 or 60, KEEP the penalty in there. It REALLY does help leveling up during those times (although that value has been decreased as well, but not enough to justfy complete removal of teh penalty)<br />
<br />
60+, scale it. Not eliminate. Scale.<br />
<br />
Those are my ideas, and they are extremely reasonable and fair. <br />
<br />
Barring that, how about my Regen be jacked up to +70 over every other non-regen race. 1 point extra per level. Seems fair, as well.</div></div><hr />

I think that you are missing the point a little.  <br />
<br />
You can't support a change, any change even though you know that the penalty is not in line with the benifit ??<br />
<br />
So there is no possible change to the system that would help to balance it out that you are willing to support?  None at all?  Even though, by your own words it isn't fair.<br />

<br />
At level 66 it is NOT a &quot;few&quot; mobs.....it is a LOT of mobs.  And its not just that the current level of regen is not worth 20% of our xp, it was NEVER worth 20%.  The xp penalty was applied because they ASSUMED we would level faster because of the extra regen.  But they were WRONG...they were wrong then, they are wrong now, and next expansion, if the xp penalty is still there, they will STILL be wrong.  And don't give me the crap about UV (and btw, its NOT UV, its infravision).  If you can't seen in the dark, go buy a torch.<br />
<br />
The FACT of the matter is:  regen has NEVER been worth it.  If you don't believe us why don't you guys take your OWN advice and go roll up a troll/iksar shm and go level it to 65+ and THEN you can tell us how great regen is and how it is worth 20% of your xp and how easy it is to just kill a &quot;FEW&quot; extra mobs.<br />
<br />
When you are new to the game, you don't know all these things.  I rolled a troll shaman because I started on TZ and wanted to play with my nephews who played DE.  I chose a troll shaman because I liked the look and roleplaying aspects of a troll.  NOWHERE did verant (yes, it was verant at the time) mention ANYTHING about my chosen race having a 20% xp penalty.  That would be like buying a house, making payment for a number of years, then having the mortgage company come along and tell you &quot;hey........we forgot to put this in the contract, but we are charging you an extra 20% interest because your house uses .00001% less electricity than the guy wearing the skirt uses next door.&quot;  Sorry, it just doesn't cut it.</div></div><hr />

For 27AA a non-regen race can buy 10 points of regen... do you think you've lost out on 27AA over the course of 1-70? If so, then you're square with the non-regeners. Anything less and you're getting a &quot;free&quot; bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First toon was a DE SK (cause I wanted to be Drizzt). I didn't make it out of Neriak after many hours of game play. <br />
<br />
Tried a HE Magician - got to level 12 after many, many hours. Quit him after I died fighting Wisps on Kerra Isle and respawned back and Felwithe - as I didn't know what 'bind' was.<br />
<br />
Level 9 Halfling Rogue - First time I grouped and talked with people... after playing casually for months. <br />
<br />
Morris-Thule kept crashing about this time. So, as a snap decision, I create a Barbie Shaman (Dazek) on Druzzil-Ro. While it took me a few hours to get out of Halas - and died a few times swimming - Everfrost and the Shaman were awesome. Met up with some great Swedes that taught me a lot about the game. Made it to my mid-20s.<br />
<br />
Then Kunark came out - For something new, tried an Iksar Monk. Loved it. Loved dealing out damage after playing the buffing shammy. <br />
<br />
Played both the Shaman and the Monk till my mid-40s very casually. Got bored - switched to SZ for a few years. Where I got my Necro topped out... <br />
<br />
To make a very long and boring story, even more long and boring --<br />
<br />
The point is - I didn't know anything about &quot;binding&quot; much less penalties. And there is so much misinformation - who knows what to believe?? But I do know this... I've split my Monk and Shaman onto 2 different accounts and 'bot' the Shaman. I play with my best friend who plays a DE SK... I'm just a casual player - just want to play with my buddy. But I am forced into soloing \ grouping without my best friend because he levels faster than I do... And that really sucks... 50-70 he has to gain 20 levels - I have to gain 24 levels. That is brutal... <br />
<br />
I've considered rerolling - but after SZ, I can't stomach any more of the low level game...<br />

Thats approx 2 hours in that group longer for you Blazz a troll shaman to lvl from 66 - 70.  So instead of 21.5 it took you 23.5.<br />
<br />
I can't see that as being the so called 12 AA's my friend.  I have never gotten 12 AA's in an Hour in ANY group.<br />
<br />
You based your argument on a flawed set of factors.  You assumed that the person had no penalty.  From that point on nothing you said mattered.<br />
<br />
Now Lets add in your extra regen more then I have and the fact that to get that same amount of regen I would have to spend approx 27 AA.  And you lost maybe 4 AA from 66 - 70.  So if you lost 23 AA from 1 - 65, I agree you have the right to be upset.<br />
<br />
You will always have more regen even if we both max out AA's for it.  If we have the best gear that a shaman can have, you will still have more.</div></div><hr />

it is something we just seem to get used to.</div></div><hr />

I agree 100%<br />
the game does not get fixed, it just gets expanded.<br />
I Disagree 100%<br />
it is something we just seem to get used to.<br />
I would have to disagree with this based on the above comment.<br />
<br />
The game has changed a ton this is not something that can be argued.  The game is fixed constantly, just maybe not it the way you think it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Seems pretty selfish to me. /shrug. <br />
<br />
Yes it does, and you can quote someone from the other side that will look just as selfish can't you?<br />
<br />
What is being asked for here is fairness.  Fair does not only count on one side of the equation, it counts on both sides.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, we will all be level 70.  If the penalty is removed, some races will have an advantage over others.  The thing we are discussing is if those with a penalty should have it removed at some point so that after we are all level 70, they will have an advantage and will have &quot;paid&quot; for that advantage while I do not have the option to pay for that advantage.<br />
<br />
You can't support a change, any change even though you know that the penalty is not in line with the benifit ??<br />
<br />
So there is no possible change to the system that would help to balance it out that you are willing to support? None at all? Even though, by your own words it isn't fair. <br />
<br />
If you read closer you might also see that I am saying it isn't fair for one race to have an advantage over another race.  An advantage that can NEVER be equalized.  I guess thats the side of the fence that I am looking from.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is I am not the one that needs to be convinced.  The people from Sony are.  And since this is a class board, rather than a race board you will see the issue from a shaman perspective.  I want the same perks other shaman have, in exchange for droppin the exp penalty sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
Here is what I see<br />
<br />
(Barbarian) = (Troll + -)<br />
<br />
Then I see that the Troll wants to get rid of the (-) so it will be<br />
<br />
(Barbarian) = (Troll +)<br />
<br />
To me that isn't fair.<br />
<br />
The other side of the argument sees this<br />
<br />
Regen (not equal to) Penalty (##AA) so lose the penalty.  <br />
<br />
I can't argue with that, but the first equation wouldn't be fair then.<br />
<br />
Theres just 2 different arguments going on here I guess.</div></div><hr />

Barbarian = Great starting stats, faction, Slam<br />
Iksar = Regen, AC, Nightvision<br />
<br />
My Shaman is Barbarian - because I wanted to. A friend who quit years ago picked an Iksar Shammy. <br />
<br />
Back then - for years - travel was via druids, SoW, and boats. Faction was huge!! Anybody remember this??<br />

Fair enough Ronax. Of all the &quot;anti&quot; arguements, you are being the most civil, and I thank you for it and apologize for my abrasiveness to you. The absolute idiocy of some of the other anti posters has gotten me rather fustrated. I have this same rant rolling on my servers Rant page (here (http://www.berthall.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=12512) if you care to read it) and some of those people are TRULY being obtuse, but that board is designed for this exact type of flaming, so its no bigggie. I can take it, heh (if you have seen some of my other threads, where I take on 10 people at a time, you would see, heh)<br />
<br />
I understand where you are coming from, but I still do not see it the way you do. I wish I had some exact numbers regarding how many AA I have already paid to get the regen bonus I have now. Regen IS an AA-able bonus effect, thats why I keep trying to convince you that I &quot;paid&quot; for it. Yes, I have more, but honeslty, all this means to me is I wont be spending my AA points on any extra regen anytime to soon. You might, but then, you ahve some additional AAs that I do not due to my penalty. In the end, if we both hit 800 AA, yeah, I will have 15 more base regen than you do. But lets be realistic, are you buying the regen AA? If not, why? Because it has a rather small value overall from levels 60-70, thats why. I am being FORCED to pay a HUGE price for mine, forced. Don't tell me it was my choice, when I made my choice, 50 levels and no AA was an aceptable price to pay for my style (I was a severe power gamer in those days, my Shaman had a Rubi BP and Manastone from level 1). When AA was added to the game, I began to regret my choice. When level 61-65 was added, I REALLY regretted it, but I sucked it up, and soloed my ass off to catch up to my friend. Now, the penalty is just brutally harsh. I spent 4 hours with a paladin friend today, he got 3 blue reg XP and 3 full yellow in an AA (he is 70-30, in support of my &quot;protest&quot; LOL, thats what he told me. He doesnt need AA much, BTW, he has over 600) and I got 3 blue reg XP. I am 100% regular. <br />
<br />
All in all, I realize that my rant probably wont do much good, at least to me personally. I am enough of a hardcore gamer that I will be 70 by the end of the month, latest. SOE certainly wont make any change before then. However, if enough people are made aware of the overwhelming number of AA the penalty truly is, then maybe I can help a fellow troll get a break when he starts his run to 70. This isnt designed to benefit the guys like me, who dinged 66 with 1 kill and had 30 AA banked when OoW went live, its designed to help the little guy, who is grinding it out a few hours a week and watching his friends blow by him level wise. <br />
<br />
Regen = a skill. An ability. Its not a maintenance ability. Its a bought-paid for one. And I just feel like I have paid. Charge me 5% for the new points I am getting. Heck charge me 10%. 6 AA is a few hours for me, a few days for a casual guy. But 20%, bro, you GOTTA be leaning a LITTLE toward &quot;Yeah, that is kinda extreme&quot;, aren't you?</div></div><hr />

Are you certain it was an Ogre Warrior? And even if it was, the warrior bonus offsets 10% of the racial penalty. Ogre = -15%, Warrior = +10%. I dont know how you can get to 128 mobs being ALL the extra either. But 128 mobs where those guys were is over 6 full AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">Trolls get UV, Barsh, and regen, in addition to being trolls.  I don't think an extra few mobs per level of the one week of grinding it's gonna take you to get 70 is worth talking about.  Honestly, if this is your biggest beef with EQ just quit now because you're NOT having fun.  I quit for other reasons.<br />
Land, its a topic to discuss. Its not even CLOSE to a game breaker for me. In case you havent noticed, I LIKE to argue. I ENJOY debating hot issues. This is one. Never did I say &quot;. . . and I am QUITTING if they dont fix it&quot;.<br />
<br />
BTW your logic is based on the theory that all of us are gonna be 70 in a week. Got some news for you, my friend. There is a LARGE chunk of this games population that wont be 70 by Halloween, much less a week. Its these folks I am fighting for, not myself. I will be there, because I play that way. Many many of my troll brothers will not.</div></div><hr />
