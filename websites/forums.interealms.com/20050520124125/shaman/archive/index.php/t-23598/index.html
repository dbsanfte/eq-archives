I am sure that if I was in the end game I would be just as bitter as you as*hol*s.  I had no idea this would get flamed so much and be taken so out of context.  Your right it is the end of the world.<br />

You are approaching the peak of your power as a shaman - enjoy it.  You will only get better for a while.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the task system will only go to level 50 at release - you have been hosed again by SOE - get used to it.<br />
<br />
I avoid discussing the problems with the end game because I am not there.  Unless this is meant to be flame-bait I would suggest you stick to subjects you are familiar with as well.  I already see limited usefulnes in our elemental raids (since we usually field 5 or more shamans).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can tank better then all other caster, I can regen mana faster then anyone<br />
<br />
While I am quite happy that you are happy, I do have some issue with these two statements.<br />
<br />
One, &quot;Tanking,&quot; is more of a combination of functions:one, doing enough damage to the MOB before you (the tanker) dies, two, holding aggro on said MOB so others can kill it and they themselves not get whacked.<br />
<br />
Wizzies have tanked PoP MOBs.  Enchanters chain casting Rune can tank MOBs, Druids mitigate better than Monks...<br />
<br />
Vis-a-vis regening mana - to do what? The heals aren't big enough or cast quite fast enough, the DOTs generate too much aggro and the Nukes are feeble.<br />
<br />
Being a Shaman is like being a Millionaire on a deserted island.  Yeah, you USED to be king dog, but now you're walking around with an American Express Titanium card and there's nothing to buy.<br />
<br />
Again, not trying to rain on your parade. But you are talking BOT and the problems many are talking about are beyond BOT. (Or tangential)<br />
<br />
Get to 65 and try healing in a Hard LDON. Then come talk to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sudamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's fairly simple to me:<br />
<br />
If you want to be a healer: Play a Cleric<br />
If you want have massive nukes: Play a Wiz<br />
If you want to be a pet class: Play a Mage/Beast<br />
If you Want to Melee: Play a Rogue/Ranger<br />
If you want to solo: Play a Necro<br />
If you want to do all of the above (minus pets where applicable): Play a Shaman, Druid, Bard<br />
<br />
It's extremely hard for me to believe that people thought that Shaman would be the end all, be all of every class.  Additionally, it's extremely hard for me to believe that people don't expect change through time (i.e., the longer the games goes the more balanced things will become).<br />
<br />
On another point: I don't see our class changing anytime soon.  We're made to be a middle-class that can do everything and, when we try to play this game of &quot;keeping up with the Jones'&quot; (ie, Clerics heal in OoW grew at a 10% rate and ours only grew at a 8% rate) is just silly - we're not supposed to be on par with the Cleric class so why expect the same growth ratio?<br />
<br />
Regarding MH Duties: There is content where we shouldn't be expected to be MH (ie., hard mode LDoN and high-end zones), thus the need for a Cleric class.<br />
<br />
I love playing my Shaman and I wouldn't change classes for anything.  Lastly, keep up the good work SoE.  I for one think you're taking the game in the right direction.<br />

--------------<br />
25) Lately there has been a lot of threads about<br />
solo-content. What sort of plans are there in the next 4-5 months for<br />
some sort of alternative for progression than grouping?<br />
<br />
The Task system! The system will be a fun alternative to grouping for<br />
players with short play times. The task system initially will be for players<br />
of 1st to 50th level, but wil be expanded to all levels after launch.<br />
<br />
Thanks again Brenlo!<br />

<br />
What an assumption.  I worked through all sewer trials, Vxed and Tipt without the help of a guild - 100% pick up group.  I completed Ikkinz1 earlier this week with another pickup group and we killed DD on the 3rd try.  The group consisted of a Warrior, Mage, Necro, Shaman, Cleric and Enchanter.<br />
<br />
It's really sad that some people think that Shaman are worthless in GoD.  Slows still land, even if partially.  Malos plays a hige roll in DD effectivness.  Healing, even at 2k for normal heals (4k with critical heals), is HUGE when you get the Clr/Shm rotation going on named mobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gimped&quot;.  I chuckle at the ignorance, and even nerve, of suggesting something like this when you've never even see me play the game.<br />
<br />
One other thing: How in the world would I get 300aa's if all I did was raid?  Are you kidding me?  What a joke.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am a 61 Shammy 14 AA and I 2 box a 65 Warrior with 96 AA.  I have read all about how underpowered we are, but the truth is I don't see it.  I realize that in the end game we have to deal with mitigation of slows and underpowered heals and ya, I have been frustrated several times when a chanter takes over slows so I can take over another role.<br />
<br />
I have always been able to solo content that only a few other classes can handle because I have a little bit of everything.  In a 2 box situation my Shammy way outperforms a cleric because of his utility.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, a shaman on a second box is one of the nicest pieces of gear a Warrior can have.<br />
<br />
EQ at high levels is a very simple, burst based game.  All that matters across all the content is burst DPS, burst healing, and burst damage mitigation  (there are other abilities that matter situationally).  The shaman class sucks at at all 3.  <br />
<br />
Old EQ was about slow and efficient DPS, slow and efficient healing, and slow and efficient damage mitigation.  The shaman class excels in all 3 areas.  The shaman was an extremely powerful (in fact overpowered) class in that game.  But that game is irrelevant now in contemporary EverRaid.  People thought Luclin was boring, so they changed from an efficiency game to a burst game.  <br />
<br />
2 boxing with a warrior in the Plane of Valor is ancient content and, with your extremely low-DPS set-up, designed to recreate some of old EQ.  It is not suprising that shamans are decent there.  However, 2-boxing in PoV is not what people are complaining about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;If the end game is all you care about roll a new character.&quot;<br />
<br />
Its not that all I care about is the endgame.  Its that I've played my shaman long enough that I find myself in the end game.   And after having devoted so much time to my shaman, re-rolling is not an option.  I'd have to quit my guild, not raid with friends I had and made, etc..<br />
<br />
I can't just magically re-time key a new character and get 15 slots of good gear and 200+AA's and somehow get caught backup with my guild.  Not going to happen.</div></div><hr />

If I am stupid because I am still having fun in zones you skipped, blew by or forgot then so be it.<br />
<br />
It is safe to say that the people who read these boards love - or at least loved - their shamans too, and raised 'em up from level 1 too.  In fact, they love them so much that they hate to see them become trivial at any level.<br />
<br />
I have no interest in starting over with another class just because I invested so much time and effort (and love) developing my shaman that he has reached a level of content where his skills are of little value.<br />
<br />
If you wade through the whining, you will see tons of ideas to keep shamans viable.  For the most part, frustration levels are high because few of these ideas are being implemented. <br />
<br />
As stated above, enjoy your shaman - I do.  But I appreciate that others are working to help insure that shamans evolve with the game, and sympathise with those who are already at the point where their usefulness to groups is limited.  I can already see this now.  So will you soon.</div></div><hr />

Don't tell me I shouldn't debate and discuss issues I'm having with the class I love.  Don't tell me I'm crying/whining when you have no clue about what higher end shaman are facing.

Utility is great till you get to the end game, a part of the game I will remind you, that you will eventually hit (progression is natural, notice, you are no longer lvl 1 or even lvl 11).  If when you've dumped hundreds of hours and loads of effort into your character and you reach the end game only to have someone whine about whining and belittle your efforts by telling you to re-roll your character when they have no idea what your issues are because they have yet to encounter them, I hope you get as upset as I am.  I'm happy that you're having fun, but pretending to comment on content related issue when you have yet to see that content is kinda lame.<br />
<br />
I thought I would post something positive here for a change of pace, clearly that is not what you want to hear.<br />
Actually, I thought it was a nice change to see something positive for a change, but you did sort of did a &quot;I don't know what the hell you're talking about, I'm OK.&quot; sort of thing which really puts a bunch of people out of joint here because you're seemingly attempting to apply your experiences to their issues which you are not currently capable of doing because you haven't fought the content.<br />

Might as well have been Warrior, snow bunny, snow bunny, snow bunny, Cleric and Enchanter.  You've got the big 3 in your group, the rest, although they contribute, are pretty much interchangable with any other classes.  Your group would have been better off had they replaced you with a druid or a bard (not a personal attack here, just some simple facts).  I disagree with the gimp comment, I don't know you.  You might be Norrath's answer to dirty harry, but this is a game that is quantifiable through available data and a shaman is by no means an important part of that group.  No offense intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">btw fellas - new info on the task system came out:<br />
<br />
*ChaosMagi* Question: As a future possible player of Everquest, does Omens of War add anything that improves the new player experience? After buying the gold pack, I was severely dissapointed at the lack of noob-friendlyness.<br />
The task system is aimed at levels 5-65, and should offer loads of content for a player just beginning their Everquest experience [tm].<br />
The task system will add tons of new content for levels 5 to 65. All of it soloable. So once you leave the tutorial you can go right into tasks.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how that is helping.<br />
If you get to the point that you want to quit, then the game has stopped being fun and you either need a break, fight for changes or to just leave.  It's a game you pay for on an ongoing basis, people who leave have every right to and sadly it wasn't until they started seeing people leave that they actually communicated to the player base ... well ... not effective communication, but at least it was something.  It's really pathetic that the only recourse many feel that SoE has left them is to quit and end billing.  That said, it's proven more effective.</div></div><hr />

Not to pile on but lately this board had gotten a of bunch of posts about whining or whining about whining.   Many of them from lurkers.  Rather than posting about whines ... why not post something about why you are having fun at the level you are rather than try to post about threadbare issues or indirect complaint's in Time/God Trials.     <br />

Sudamor response's are different in that he's posting from a position of prespective.   Quite frankly its hard to post about the high end of the game without being in the high end of the game.</div></div><hr />

I agree that &quot;middle players&quot; can be interchangable - that's one of the things that make EQ so much fun, overall game diversity.  However, I do disagree with the comment that replacing a shaman with a druid or bard would be &quot;better&quot;.  Malos is huge and IMHO &gt; than the druid heals when you consider that we can get extremely close to them in effeciency - ask any nuke class and I believe that you'll find that they would agree.  Bards are nice, but when you consider our ability to back heal the group and the MT shaman are better.  I guess what I'm getting at is this: we may not be better than those two classes in this situation, but I would say we are comparable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">/sigh.  I wouldn't worry about it too much Rugtuuk.  I'm lost past the point of caring about most people around here for most of the reasons that you've mentioned.  Just a complete whinefest.  Doesn't matter what you say, someone is always going to say that if you weren't there things wouldn't matter and that would be better off with another dps class (ignoring the fact that my timed slow or heal or cure might have saved 15 people every minute) because other classes can do it (and die doing it just as well as we can) but won't recover as quickly.  I know that I'm skilled, and i know that I haven't had anyone have to hold me up in a fight ever.  I'll put it in the books as saying that over the course of a raid every day.. I save at least 30 people from dying somehow.  Normally by getting the mobs off of the clerics, sometimes by slowing a mob the second before he dies (ask a beastlord or chanter to be the main slower in Txevu and see how much they like it).<br />
<br />
In all seriousness.. I do think that we aren't as bad off as people think we are.  We are the best curers around, and in alot of the Txevu fights, we are very very valuable.  In some of the fights, we show our stuff more so in the first minute of the fight, than we do maybe in the second half of it.  Just the way it goes.  Try being a chanter when there are no mobs to mezz or charm.  They do nothing but tash.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have always been able to solo content that only a few other classes can handle ...<br />
<br />
Bards, druids, necros, mages, wizards, enchanters, shadowknights, beastlords, rangers, paladins ... are those few classes that can effectively solo. Depending upon the class, including shaman, what can be soloed can be done more effectively by a particular class, but generally speaking there is a great deal of overlap.<br />
<br />
I have a friend that is a 65 Cleric and has problems with both of these area when duo.<br />
<br />
Being 65 isn't the end all/be all. Need a bit more information here to justify that statement - gear, aa, mana pool. Then again you are speaking of PoV and PoTactics and duoing with (assumed) your warrior. Slow makes those encounters trivial - lack of slow, which clerics can't do, requires the cleric to compensate by healing more with only passive mana regen (or yaulp, if not also tanking.) With a warrior/cleric duo and the warrior only having 90+ aa, that is a lot of damage to offset.<br />
<br />
We may not have one glowing outstanding feature that makes us critical at the higher levels, but we are more like a multi tool we can fill more rolls then any other class and if you need something then a Shammy can probably help you out. <br />
<br />
Here is where the point of the &quot;negative&quot; comments stem from. AT HIGHER LEVELS (not player level, but rather content level) those multiple tools you are proud of having are minimally contributory. Slows are mitigated or unusable. In both cases there are 2 other classes (3 if you count bards) that can take on the role of slower (as you noted, you already face times when the slowing role is passed to the enchanter) while providing other contributions or opening up a group slot to other classes that more than compensate for anything else a shaman brings to the group. Check the posts detailing shaman limitations on healing/buffs for all the details on what this means.<br />
<br />
If they give us some class defining ability someday then great, but if not hey I can still do it all right now.  If you can't then you are doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
You are level 61 in content that is now TRIVIAL. You can do it all right now ... where you are at. To say that, &quot;If you can't then ... &quot; is insulting to those who have and are doing everything they possibly can to compensate for not having the tools with the power needed to contribute at an equal level to other classes. It is not a condition based on player skill, but rather the brick wall of class limitiation. Those who have acheived in these areas are doing so not only because of their abilities, but also the superior player abilities of their groupmates who also have to compensate for bringing the shaman along.<br />
<br />
For all those quiting and not playing Shammy's anymore I am sorry that you have been unable to find content appropriate to you.  I have been playing for awhial and still have not seen everthing.  Of coarse my focus is not just geared at being in the highest level flagged or keyed zones in the game.<br />
<br />
Time flagged and geared shaman should find content appropriate where? Time zones and below? That is what is currently appropriate content since GoD essentially eliminates the functionality of shaman ... at least high end GoD content. Soloing or grouping in available GoD zones is an option as long as it isn't one of the cleric required zones ... which is to say, for the average shaman in an average group, any place that has a named.<br />
<br />
Basically, your suggestion is to tell shaman who have played for years to step back a few levels of game progression and enjoy how powerful they are. Well, Rug, while you were &quot;working your shaman up from level 1&quot; these shaman had already had the joy of being on the cutting edge of game progression - and contributing to developing and having a role in the strategies needed to take down the &quot;end game&quot; encounter mobs. These are the shaman who were in the raids that lead the way that allow you to 'click' on Allakhazam and Illiah links to find out what the mob hits for, what the encounter event steps are, who do you talk to for the pre-flags.<br />
<br />
These are the shaman who SHOULD be in those new zones because they earned it. They played the game to get there. They play the game at this level and intensity because, unlike you, they are focused on the best gear and at being in the highest level flagged or keyed zones in the game. You make your anti-uber comment as though it is something wrong ... under the guise of joining in a chorus of &quot;Be Happy.&quot; Get real. Where you are and what you are doing pleases you. Good for you, seriously. Not everyone has your desire to get into your defined version of the shaman happy boat. They have their own definitions of what pleases them in this game. That ranges from doing it your way and being on the cutting edge of the end game encounter, as well as everything inbetween.<br />
<br />
Until the new end game shaman who are motivated to be on that cutting edge are finding their game pleasure is not there - and ONLY because shaman cannot perform sufficiently and efficiently due to the limitations of the tools given them. Basically, the game progression is making shaman step back and wait until others have cleared the path for them. Then they can follow, once it is safe to do so. Here is the crux of both the frustation and the sadness.<br />
<br />
Go to PoV or PoTactics and duo with your warrior. Do it with the warrior not using weapons, just hand to hand. Can it be done? Add your cleric friend to the group for a trio. Can it be done easier? What is the problem? What is the difference?<br />
<br />
EQ game design has taken away the significant contributory effectiveness of shaman tools (weapons) from us. That you don't see it, haven't experienced it doesn't make what you are doing more fun or even an alternative for other shaman by any stretch of the imagination - it makes the class, at the top end, pathetically crippled for reasons out of the player's control.</div></div><hr />

While some posts were worthwhile, I agree this thread was getting out of hand - so I'm locking it. People should be able to post that they enjoy playing their shaman - good for them!</div></div><hr />
