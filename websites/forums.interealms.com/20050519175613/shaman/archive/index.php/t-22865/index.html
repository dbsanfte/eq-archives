<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We recieved this message from John Smedley, President of Sony Online Entertainment:<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello Norrath!<br />
 <br />
I wanted to announce that we've decided to push Omens of War back to Late August in order to give the EQ team time to respond to important issues that the EverQuest community is raising (specifically including the issues with Gates of Discord). We've heard some concerns from within the community that we feel are important enough to push back our next expansion and spend time fixing the problems you have brought to our attention. At the end of the day, we work for you and it's important for us to demonstrate that we both understand and appreciate that. We're also inviting many members of the community to join us here at SOE for a day to have a direct dialog with the development team about issues that are important to the EverQuest community as a whole. We've already sent out the invitations and are making all the arrangements. In addition, our EQ community managers will be coming up with a list of issues raised on the message boards so that we can come back to you with a specific list of things we're going to address.<br />
 <br />
I'm sorry if you feel we haven't been listening and reacting appropriately. We do our best to balance all of the needs and concerns you raise along with expanding Norrath and giving you new and wonderful things to do in EverQuest, but we do make mistakes. We've heard you loud and clear.<br />
 <br />
We have many things planned for EverQuest over the upcoming years, and our goal is to keep you happily playing EverQuest for a long time to come. The best way for us to do that is by first and foremost listening to you.<br />
 <br />
John Smedley<br />
President, Sony Online Entertainment<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So the Question of the Day is:<br />
<br />
&quot;Has SOE fixed YOUR issues?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warren</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With the last couple of expansions, you were better off buying the CD versions since they came with at least one minor perk. Unless there is something groundbreaking about OoW, I'll wait a little and see what it's like before ordering it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just like I said last time, don't preorder or buy directly from SoE at all (unless you have to because of overseas or middle of nowhere or something). Someone always has it cheaper retail the weekend after launch and preording just encourges them to keep pushing out the crap because they see how many people will buy it immediately without even knowing how good/bad it really is. <br />
<br />
Fry's Electronics had GoD for $22.99 and then I believe it was Circuit city had it for $17.99 or so. <br />
<br />
I also agree that spell distribution needs to be better to even consider buying it. Won't take me too much convincing to quit again for good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One other thing I was just thinking about... Omens is &quot;due&quot; on September 14. Today is August 2. They reactivated the pre-order screen (which my post above will disable until they work around that, as always).<br />
<br />
Have they started the beta yet? I know the open beta hasn't started and probably won't, like the last few expansions, until 2 weeks prior and then you'll have more people making 65s to slack off than to test anything.<br />
<br />
Have they corrected a number of the issues plaguing all the classes in regards to Gates, as well as in general? <br />
<br />
Have they even brought a passing thought towards the whole contradiction of &quot;Upgrading shaman/druid blast heals would trivialize old content, but next expansion you can be level 70!&quot;? <br />
<br />
I know the answer to those is &quot;Maybe&quot;, &quot;No, but working on it&quot;, and &quot;Probably not&quot;.<br />
<br />
The fact those who DO order Omens simply because &quot;The rest of my guild is...&quot;, if they all jumped off a bridge, would you do it too (to drive home a cliche)? You like spending $60 for 1 complete expansion (technically)? For $60, I'd rather go buy a whole new game than spend $30 for half, and $30 for the fixes and the other half.<br />
<br />
How do you justify spending $60 within 7 months for half-completed work? If you pre-ordered because of your guild, maybe you need to talk to them too and go &quot;You know, if we don't buy this, maybe they'll get the hint that we DO NOT want more half-completed expansions&quot;?<br />
<br />
That's the reason expansions are half-done, all these people say &quot;My guild is...&quot; and just follow suit. For once, you have the power to tell them to stick the half completed expansions where the sun doesn't shine, exercise it!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">People actually thought the day at &quot;where the magic happens (tm)&quot; was more than just smoke and mirrors and empty promises?<br />
<br />
I guess they did &quot;upgrade&quot; a few things, and they did add some raid utilities to better experience the broken raid content :p<br />
<br />
Come on, where are the five or so die-hards that always chime in about now about how they love SOE/EQ and are going to buy the next expansion even if pre-ordering returns them to level 50 with zero AA points??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
They've made a good amount of progress, but the core issues remain pending.<br />
<br />
I also have this eery feeling that Omens is not completely ready to be launched, everything else aside.  I do NOT want another expansion that isn't truly complete until it is patched three or four times after release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We've been had.  OoW is a guaranteed success.<br />
<br />
Read through the preorder box.  There's something new in there that I haven't seen mentioned anywhere that will make everyone buy it.<br />
<br />
They say that we can now earn a new spell slot!<br />
<br />
All our protests are wasted.  That in itself will sell OoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Extra spell gem? more buff slots? Still saving my $30, those should be patched in, not included in the other half of the previous incomplete expansion, nor as AA.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, it'll probably cost 30aa FOR that extra spell slot. Remember the last &quot;fix that went in as an AA&quot; (pet affinity) and the AA cost it was given.<br />
<br />
How many of you REALLY want to continue &quot;grinding&quot;? levels or AA? .... I didn't think so. Don't let the &quot;extra spell gem&quot; or &quot;more buff slots&quot; be a selling point, demand more for your $30 for &quot;Gates part 2&quot;.<br />
<br />
My 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've got a wait and see attitude. My main concern is spells. Are we going to quest for them? Will I be able to buy them from a vender, will I have to fork out 400kpp to buy them off of bazaar mules or are they going to be no drop and will take a well geared raid force to get them.<br />
<br />
Will this enlarge the gap between casual and raiding shaman that much more? I'm going to hold off buying this expansion for a little while till I see how badly soe screwed it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You like spending $60 for 1 complete expansion (technically)? For $60, I'd rather go buy a whole new game than spend $30 for half, and $30 for the fixes and the other half.<br />
Flawed logic.  There were always going to be two expansions, it just happened that GoD wound up being 2/3 of what they had intended so OoW should be 1 1/3 of an expansions.  $60 for 2 expansions as planed just got gipped on the 1st one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am going under the wait and see model.  Persoanlly I think that they should give us OoW for free since they shafted us with GoD.   But the access of spells is a very important issue.  If I can't get the spells why do i need 5 more lvls.  But, then again according to rtyan I don't need all of them, even when they are trying to balance the class through the spells.  Rtyan's logic always makes me laugh and cry in the same breath.</div></div><hr />

I would really like class balance issues and Shaman specific issues to be dealt with prior to Omens release.<br />

Friend of mine is in a guild that was tapped to beta the encounters. They havent started yet. Beta starts when you download the patch. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Personally, I am not going to preorder the expansion until SOE gives us a definitive answer to the question &quot;Will Level 4 Focus Effects Work on OoW Spells or Not?&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have been playing EQ forever, and I am not the ultimatum type. I hate all of the &quot;Fix XXX issue or I quit posts&quot;. However, losing all of the focus effects that I have spent the last 2 years acquiring would be a deal breaker for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Personally I loved GoD, so I had no hesitation ordering OoW. My only real concern is how the new graphics are going to perform on everyones computers. We need new content anyway. I can understand why some are frustrated with GoD though. It is (was) hard challenging stuff, and you needed your act together. Not only that, your group needed to be the same way, and I can see that people who operate with more informal group compositions would be intimidated by it. It's well worth the effort though, rewarding in the sense of achieving goals, upgrading gear and the sense of satisfaction when you beat what seemed like an impossible encounter for the first time. That's the feeling raiders get (those who have undergone the full proper progression that is, not the ones who get on board later) as they progress, the main difference being that groups got to share what was previously a raider only thing. Not anymore though, the truly tough encounters have been defanged, which is sad in my view, but I guess it's what the player base wanted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this completely.  This is a game, folks.  If you don't like it, stop playing, move on.  It really is that simple.  I've been playing a shaman for over 5 yrs now.  I still like my character, I still have fun.  Does GoD suck?  Yup, big hairy ones.  Have shaman been shafted?  Yup, and they didn't even use vasoline.  Am I staying up nights losing sleep over it or getting my blood pressure up over it?  Nope.  I log in when I can, I raid, game, joke around with friends and have a good time.  <br />
<br />
As long as I continue to enjoy my experience, I'll continue to log in.  I will buy OOW because my guild will for the progression. (Quarm farming, Uqua level guild).  I personally hate GoD and all the alien content ( where have all the dragons gone?  I miss the dragons !)  But I still love the game and the people I play with.<br />
<br />
Relax, enjoy yourselves.  It's only a game<br />

well... they *could* require that you have GoD, but because GoD wasn't a full expansion, and OoW contains 1/3 of GoD, just give GoD away to the people who buy OoW...<br />

<br />
I have been playing my Monk since 2000 and I certainly agree that the late-Luclin/early-PoP changes to Monk roles and abilities were drastic and in many ways misguided. The problem with Monkly Business, however, is not that its regulars complain about the nerf, but rather that any rational discussion there gets drowned in layers of &quot;I am useless!&quot;, &quot;Unnerf us!&quot; and &quot;SOE sucks!&quot; posts. And the sad thing is that it was a useful and informative board just 2 years ago. I would hate to see the Crucible go the same way :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not a question of being an inferior player or not, but rather how one deals with challenge. GoD was hard when released, no question about that, but how did most people react to that? In many cases they chose to do nothing and waited to be carried through the various flagging phases. How many people actually did the 4 sewer trials as opposed to waiting for their guild to flag them with Rondo? How many people figured out how to do the mountain trials by trial and error as opposed to waiting for others to figure out how it should be done? On my server right now there is a major guild 1 god short of Time access who apparently hasn't made it to KT yet. Rumour has it that their leader has decided that they aren't raiding GoD until they are in Time. Thats fine I guess, allthough personally I think that is not a wise decision if true. Whatever, but the interesting thing is that even now it is very rare to see anyone from that guild in KT (I have seen one once I believe). You would think that people in a raiding guild would make their own way through, but that doesnt seem to happen for the most part. It hasn't happened with them, it didnt happen with the other major pre-time guild before they beat Rondo, and it didnt happen for the majority of my own guild. All three of these guilds are &quot;friends and family&quot; style guilds that raid. On the other hand players from the two premier &quot;real&quot; raiding guilds sliced through this stuff, and that was in the days when everyone personally had to work through the KT flagging process to get into Qvic, so they all did it. These guys were sheparding people through IK before the next tier of raiding guilds even started working on progression.<br />

And the funny thing was that Henora's guild, who were a small group of friends who did pre-PoP raiding mostly, were in KT and working on IK before any of the first people from the second tier raiding guilds even got to the zone. And they didnt get there with a Rondo trial.<br />
<br />
Now why is this? It isnt gear, and it isnt skills. I think it has more to do with the approach people have to the game. <br />
<br />
On the little dig about being a warrior, you should know that my shaman was one of the first toons in my guild to be KT flagged, and he did that by completing 5 of the 6 flagging trials (one of the sewers was done through Rondo). In fairness though, We flagged Mok for mountains so that we could be sure that we would have a shaman available when we were working on IK. My warrior did 5 of the 6 as well, with one of the sewer trials being different from Mok's achievments (Mok got that one since we needed a slower, not another tank). We were working on IK trials before most of the guild even got into the zone. My shaman, who is not well equiped (and was less so at the time), had no difficulty in performing his function in any of that content. The only thing IMO that he wouldn't have been able to do (due to limited AA development and low mana pool) was to act as secondary healer on the IK nameds (guild shaman mains could and did though).<br />
<br />
We had a shaman main who was part of the core group who spearheaded the guild into IK. I asked him once jokingly when we were working on IK1 if he knew that he sucked. His response was &quot;huh?&quot;. He didnt know that shaman sucked, and he doesn't. The sort of player you want to be grouped with, with skills and the right kind of attitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Well, some people still refuse to believe anything cause others have said they couldn't do it.  In defense of you Tug, I myself was the very first person on my server to set foot into Kod'taz.  I was in the second group that beat Vxed.  I was in the first group that beat Tipt (paladin, sham, cleric, druid, bard, wiz).  I was in the second group that beat Ikk 1 (where we kited the named and I did 80% of the damage to him).  First group to beat Ikk 2 and second group to beat Ikk 3.  3rd person overall on my server to have their full icon of the altar made.  <br />
<br />
Guess the point is that I didn't have to be carried through these at all.  I performed just as well as someone else did and know that I did my part to finish the trials.  However, I still hear people say that they my groups must have taken pity on me cause shaman are sooooooo bad off right now.  Personally, I think that it's a server related problem.  Maybe some of your servers just have problems cause they've seen too many ****ty shaman.  My server I have never seen any problem with shaman getting groups, or shaman just getting the raw end of things.</div></div><hr />

Learn some people skills friend.  I doubt you're the shiznit, the new and true shaman god.  Please, put a sock in it.<br />
<br />
Tug, just one question.  What did you do that made you irreplaceable?  That's not worded quite right, but I'm trying to ask what you brought to the group that someone else couldn't do better?  Was it healing?  How much damage did your slow mitigate compared to cleric healing?  Did you have an optimal group and dealt with only single pulls?  Do you think someone else could have contributed more to your group than you did, like maybe a druid, a second cleric, or a necro?  Honestly, I just don't see (prior to the content &quot;fixes&quot;) why anyone would have brought a shaman over almost any other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Well, in the case of Ikkinz, except for one specific mob, you dont need a chanter for anything other than being a buff bot outside. A competent monk can single everything. A shaman is superior as a slower in that respect since they bring other abilities, such as secondary healing to the group while the chanter brings nothing, since for the most part there is no CC to be done [edit: well, in retrospect, they are useful for gaters if you dont have some other way of dealing with them]. Beastlords can slow of course as well, but they cant heal, which means that if you didnt take a shaman you would need another secondary healer. BL slows result in significantly higher mob dps, which, while not normally a problem, can be an issue if pre-clearing before the named is using significant healer mana. Shaman are not as good healers as clerics/druids though, so on high heal fights you are at greater risk.<br />
<br />
Now that nameds can be slowed, the superior slowing capabilities of shaman are probably valuable. The only trials I've done since the changes are IK1 and IK3. I think we had a chanter on IK1 and a shaman on IK3. From what I remember, the only slow that stuck on the IK3 named was the disease one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">There are 2 reasons I am holding off on purchasing OoW.  First is the same as most  - paying for an additional expansion to fully complete the GoD one and just knowing that I, as a shaman, would not truly benefit by anything this expansion has to offer.<br />
<br />
But second is more strong, whom would I go with?  There are currently 4 guilds that I am sure on Mith Marr will head there.. Spheara, Descendents, Illum and MMPU.  But on any given night right now, it is difficult to even get a GoD's farming spells group.  I have sat for hours in Barindu lfg,  and the only groups that come basically are full before they zone in.<br />
<br />
Unless SoE can turn around the tide of players leaving the game,  or find a way to repopulate the servers, I just feel it would be money wasted.  What good is an extra gem slot, an extra buff slot, more levels ... if I can't use them?<br />

That's a fair answer, although I dispute the shaman's value on gaters, shaman are no better equipped than most other classes for these.<br />
<br />
How long are your mobs alive for Tugela?  Have you compared the time/mana cost values for the life of your targets compared to damage mitigation from heals to even say druid classes?  Also, please correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't your regular guild group generally a low DPS group?  As you well know, lower DPS groups tend to allow a shaman to perform better.  If content took longer to kill, we wouldn't be arguing too much about the state of shamans.  In slow kills we can, even with our aged and out of date spell arsenal, easily make a significant contribution.</div></div><hr />

Would have to agree. I dont want new graphics. They make my 6box explode and I will like just quit. There are portion of GoD that are already horrible (for me with 3.4Ghz, 4GB, and bband) when the zone is empty, so....<br />

I was referring to chanters there.<br />
<br />
On your comments about healing v slowing, any competent slower in IK should usually be able to get stuff slowed within the first 10-20% or so of damage. Remember, if you are split tagging off a monk, they are not available for the intial part of the fight so dps is generally low to begin with. There are other issues beyond simple efficiency involved. The point of doing the trial is to win the trial. An unslowed mob does 2 things which are not in your best interests: (1) they drain healer mana - very bad when you are prepping for a named; and (2) they allow the mob the chance of killing your MT (or anyone else it might agro on). Of course if your healer isnt concerned with the state of their mana bar and/or there is no chance for the mob to kill the MT, then mass healing as opposed to slowing is viable, but that is by definition trivial content. We are talking about challenging content here - only a fool would heal through that rather than slow.</div></div><hr />

10-20% might be a valid timeframe for you in a slower group, but in 30 second fights 3-6 seconds is a little ambitious with no TA.  Perhaps not after the content turndown, but certainly before.  I'm not saying you're right or wrong, I'm saying you might be right for the way YOU do it.  6-12 seconds seems reasonable in a 1 minute fight.<br />
<br />
As a side note, hopefully, the monk is NOT contributing DPS towards the end, but is instead running off to set up the next victim, giving the shaman more time to become efficient.  A bard is better equipped to pull and offers some CC, minor slowing/debuffing, DS, overhaste and many other abilities.<br />
<br />

We are talking about challenging content here - only a fool would heal through that rather than slow.<br />
I'm very well aware of what slow does and it's benefits, but numbers have been posted on this board when GoD first came out that showed that healing instead of slowing was more efficient through to the tipt trials (granted, that's dated now since progression goes beyond that and content has been tuned, but still it's rather telling).  If you're pulling singles with a monk, it's possible to split heal aggro by rotating heals, any tank worth their weight should be able to hold interest on a single through split heal aggro.<br />
<br />
Lastly, you're not always preping for a named.  Thats again another situational comment that you are applying to a wider breath of content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I have been playing my Monk since 2000 and I certainly agree that the late-Luclin/early-PoP changes to Monk roles and abilities were drastic and in many ways misguided. The problem with Monkly Business, however, is not that its regulars complain about the nerf, but rather that any rational discussion there gets drowned in layers of &quot;I am useless!&quot;, &quot;Unnerf us!&quot; and &quot;SOE sucks!&quot; posts. And the sad thing is that it was a useful and informative board just 2 years ago. I would hate to see the Crucible go the same way :(<br />
<br />
I been drowning in sorrow for like, a month now.  I been rational, I been logical, and where has it gotten me?  Seems like people were rational, they upped Q from 300 to 350.  People whined harder and explained less, it got upgraded AGAIN.  I'd say, logically, the next step would be to powder my booty, strap on a diaper, and cry as loud as I can for a month until the diaper rash starts to bother me.<br />
<br />
They don't understand &quot;Well, a logical approach to your current situation is&quot;...<br />
<br />
What they DO understand is &quot;Unnerf us now or I will cancel billing, gee WoW sure does look nice, BEWARE OF CRUSTY PANTALOONS&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
The monk nerf was insane.  There was a logical fix... undo it.  Monkly Business died when monks died.  I may be putting it harshly, but I'm doing so for emphasis.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the Crucible has come a long way since the first few weeks of GoD.  I can honestly say I enjoy the intelligent suggestions and discussions that happen here, as opposed to the swamped out posts of shocked and dismayed people who went on their first trial before the re-tune and pages of people quitting.<br />
<br />
The future may not be bright, but it's not totally dark.  I'm not a monk... though I sure do like the slim britches they wear!  Think they have them in Barbarian size?<br />
<br />
P.S.  Some very good points, Tarthug.  Even if you got a Malo off on inc, you still got recovery and 2.5ish Turgur's time.  And that's on one mob... the recast on Turgurs makes me want a TA really, really badly!</div></div><hr />
