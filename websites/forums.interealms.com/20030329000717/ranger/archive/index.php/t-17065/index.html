<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Riudi Oaknoggin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need information on how to get into HoH.  I've done used the search engines with little luck, and am posting in hopes that someone will link me up with some info.<br />
<br />
We killed AD last night in PoV, but the mob we were supposed to hail depopped before we had a chance to hail it, which REALLY sucked.  I have heard that there is a quest to enter HoH, I was just wondering if anyone had info on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can do the quest to get into HoH, but then you can't go any further (Temple of Marr, etc)<br />
<br />
It requires a brick of Perilium from PoI, a Crystalline Spider Brain from PoV, and some spider drop in PoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tanares</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Isn't the projection suposed to stay up for about 30 minutes? Man I woulda petitioned that...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Riudi Oaknoggin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/bonk Rounlin  Damn dragon is DEAD, projection was up for less than five mins.  The tell from the GM was basicly &quot;We can't do anything, please /bug and report it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vlad, expound.  Can't go any further?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Aerin projection only stays up for a few minutes.<br />

For the hand-in quests that flag a single person (like the HoH or Tactics ones), supposedly you can't progress any further in the plotline.  So if you got to the trials in HoH, they wouldn't  flag you to get to Marr, or if you killed the ZekJr's, you wouldn't get the flags there either.<br />
<br />
Those quests are simply for the purpose of opening up a new hunt spot for you.</div></div><hr />

I can confirm that you can't advance without killing AD, I did the quest and had all 3 HoH trials done but when I tried to zone in Temple of Marr I'd get a message &quot;You have fought with honor but lack the valor to enter&quot;. After we killed AD I was able to go to Temple of Marr without having to redo the trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's a thread on The Safehouse explaining how to get the alternate key to HoH.  But as mentioned above, it just gets you inside the zone, you can't go any further unless you kill the dragon first.  I'd recommend just killing the dragon again, it's much faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ralence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can try dire charm on the projection, might fix the problem you ran into next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sadbast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">..thats weird. When my guild took Aerin we decided to clear the adds afterwards, which of course meant alot of running about snaring / rooting etc which took some time. The Projection stayed up through all of it and through the rezzes etc that needing doing. I would guess at least 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Was he hailed at all ? maybe the hailing ensures that he stays up? Or did you perhaps concentrate on rezzing etc / clearing adds (if you did it this way) ?</div></div><hr />
