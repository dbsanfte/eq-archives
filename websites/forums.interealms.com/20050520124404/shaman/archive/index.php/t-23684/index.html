 :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
LMAO.<br />
<br />
I've only been through the BAR, DEF, DWF ones so far.....but you'd really think they'd have the cash to pay more than 2 voice actors for all of these...<br />
<br />
They suck bigtime, and I think Sony know it lol.<br />
<br />
Good entertaniment for patch day tho  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any of you remember Dick van Dycke's superb Cockney accent in Mary Poppins?  ;) <br />
<br />
Check out the Dwarf Male &quot;Thanks Mate&quot; for much fun and laughter :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">omg the frogloks omg the frogloks....<br />
<br />
Looks like they could only afford 2 voice actors.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Gnome voices are alright. They sound like gnomes.<br />
<br />
But then, gnomes are SUPPOSED to sound like pathetic low-budget cartoons.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else wondering why two-foot amphibians shound like seven-foot heavily furred mountain men with a slight lisp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow.  That's horrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hoping they allow altering of these ... er customization.<br />
<br />
I really want a pull voice over panic message:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ... shiiiiiiiiiiit!!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not sure why we can't customize them, at least on own computers. Find a sound we like better, give it the name of one of the wav files in the folder and save over it. Wouldn't that work?<br />
<br />
(not technical)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From the patch message:<br />
<br />
To create your own voice macros, make a sound file using the same name as one of the existing voice macros, which can be found in your EverQuest&gt;Voice&gt;Default directory and place it in your EverQuest&gt;Voice&gt;User directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That's actually kind of neat. <br />
<br />
I might ask our normal raid leader to pick a special sound for &quot;follow me&quot; which all of us would install. That way, when the raid leader said move, we would actually 1) know it was the raid leader because his &quot;follow me&quot; is unique and 2) actually move for a change.<br />
<br />
On second thought, I guess that wouldn't work. It would be the same sound for all Human males (ie my raid leader is a monk).<br />
<br />
NM!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We hope you enjoy this new way to immerse yourself into the EverQuest experience.<br />
<br />
Nothing says immersive quite like bad voice acting.<br />
<br />
If they're going to implement something in a half-assed way, I wish they'd just not do it at all. Especially for something like this where nobody was asking for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;New player models and animations? No, sorry that takes too much effort. But, hey! We got Cindy from the mail room and Joe from reception to record these AMAZING voice macros!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Garais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not to mention a new way for loosers to annoy other players. I DO hope that you can mute this from certain players or else i guarantee that some players will find hours of amusment using this to annoy the living daylights out of other players. <br />
<br />
If you thought inspect spamming was annoying.....<br />
<br />
But knowing Sony... nah i dont count on it. Which means that 99.99% of all players will turn this off, as opposed to &quot;only&quot; 99% if it is possible to filter players. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This is completely lifted from FFXI, it's annoying as hell in that game too =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is anyone else wondering why two-foot amphibians shound like seven-foot heavily furred mountain men with a slight lisp?<br />
<br />
They have a frog in thier throat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">More like they're a frog with a barbarian in their throat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">haha!<br />
<br />
not to mention the Zsa Zsa Gabor'esque female Vah Shir &quot;come-to-bed&quot; voice.<br />
<br />
I start to wonder whether EQ is actually for 10 year olds and all my twenty-something EQ friends and I are seriously misguided...lol</div></div><hr />
