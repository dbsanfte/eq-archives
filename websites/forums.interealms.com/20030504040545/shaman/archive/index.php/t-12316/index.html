<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thyalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many spec's did ya'll turn in to get Tali of the Boar?  I've had about 25-30 spec's turned in for me over time, and I have yet to get it. I've been trying since about December.  I'm so sick of Str of Diaku, we're talking 6-8 copies of it by my own turn ins, not counting the other 10-12 people who are doing turn ins for me :(<br />
<br />
It sucks to be impotent on raids without Fo7th or Group Sta, but have MGB.  Yay me! I got to MGB Bih'Li for a RZ raid lol. Gosh I'm getting tired of it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats the only 63-64 spell that I am missing to. I also havent seen it for sell in the bazaar. Can anyone confirm that they have gotten it with in the last few weeks?</div></div><hr />

I see it for sale in the Bazaar all the time on Inny.  FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen it for asle a few times... but i refuse pay more then 2k for it so.. (on tholuxe the uba guild (MI-malus imperiam) is sellign all 63-4 spells for 2k and all 65 spells from 5 to 20k..<br />
<br />
so it's pretty sweet that they offer such a thing.. but on the down side once it hits the vendor half spells tend tio be sold with in 60 seconds of the vendor going up (typical to see a crown around waitign for it to go up)<br />
<br />
almsot to BoT so maybe i get some luck with rolls there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">anybody know if they do a shaman spell exchange somewhere for certain servers? might not be a bad idea, getting 5 of the same spell is a real bummer. maybe somewhere on this site we could start a thread with what spells we have extra of and list the server we are on and see about exchanging for other spells. does this sound lilke a good idea? is it being done on any other website ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've seen it for sale fairly often lately on Ayonae Ro. The price seems to be from 20k to 30k. Sadly, I had to pay closer to the 30k mark for it. Still, group buffs rule, so I guess it was worth it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Took me about 10 specs to get this spell, then got another about 2 days ago. I know your pain though, I got the single target agility 14 times before I finished up all my ethereals.....that was enough to make me not even want to turn in my spells anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">out of about 30 spec parchment hand in. I got 3 talisman of boar, and about half of them are str/dex buff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fayclopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I check bazaar for shaman spells almost every day and have never seen Talisman of the Boar for sale on Povar. I'll be stuck with swift like the wind as my only 63-65 spell for a while. Honestly, there isn't much that a shaman can do at 65 that they can't do at 62. Quiesence is the only spell I'd consider very useful, if I got that I'd get to lvl 65. I rarely use dots other than my epic. Soloing is just too boring for me...sure I'll kill a named mob if I get the chance but soloing for exp is too slow and repetitive. Guess I'm spoiled with my druid that can kill with charm much faster and actually have fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shere Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Checked everytime I went into the bazaar and never saw it for sale on Veeshan at any price. One day saw it on sale for the first time and was 1500pp. Naturally I ran as fast as I could and bought it... made me very happy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I never saw it either. Got many Diakus and Ulthors.  Was lucky enough to have someone in my BFs uberguild take pity on me and turn in his specs for me.  Combined...turning them in for myself and with others turning in for me....about 30 turn ins...1 TotB.<br />
<br />
Have yet to see Blessing of Replenishment, although I'm not too worried about it.<br />
