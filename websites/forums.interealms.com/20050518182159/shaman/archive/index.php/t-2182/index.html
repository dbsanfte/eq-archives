<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelshir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 57th lvl necro which I am really bored with and desided to start over and desided to join the ranks of shamans who look like they have alot of fun.<br />
<br />
I know this question has probably been ask many of many times, so I would like you to all bear one more time with me and help a new shaman out. <br />
<br />
What equipment (buyable) should I look for to start a shaman with. Plat may or may not be a issue since I have desided to sell some items that will get a good price (hopefully). If it helps I have deside to make a Barb. I know alot of shamans on my server tell to make a troll or a lizzy for the regen but I am not to sure I want to spend alot of time on faction. I like to get my hands dirty and do dealings with the players market and on our server its in nfp. And yes I know of the market channel but its not the same.<br />
<br />
Any help will do.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Luckily, the transition from necro to shaman is pretty easy, because you're already used to concentrating on hitpoints as a source of potential mana (it's a lot more difficult for druids to make the transition!)<br />
<br />
If you have the cash, buy a fungi, great investment for a shaman that you will wear until you reach level 60 and get torpor (ie. forever!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelshir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">But I do have a Torpor waiting for me to hit 60 :p <br />
<br />
And I do agree the transition for me might not be sooo bad<br />
<br />
All I need is a cool sig like yours Gloriana :)<br />

<br />
i think i'll go cry now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First off, I would really ... I mean REALLY encourage you to reconsider the choice of race. Faction work for NFP doesnt take that long, but you are stuck with your race for ever. Nothing 'bad' with barbs, but other shaman races have much more going for them. I play a barb, and if i could change to ogre or troll, well thats a no brainer.<br />
<br />
Gear wise... fungi definitely. Jaundiced bone bracer for using from lvl46 and up into your late 60's. Apart from that, just aim for ac/hp and get the wis as a bonus. Ive always found you can function perfectly well at 175wis even at higher levels. Its very seldom your manapool that is important, but rather your rate of manaregen.<br />
<br />
Dont be afraid to wade into the fray and play semitank, it's good for you as it lets you know how much you can handle and you also get your defense up.<br />
<br />
G'luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;Ive always found you can function perfectly well at 175wis&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh, 158 wis is the highest I've ever hit.  Soloing or in resist gear I'm at 127 *including* the +5 from lesser bear form.  Unless it's one truely grand train, it hasn't hampered me much.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You could always try a Cat shaman.<br />
<br />
I've played a troll and iksar...seem to like the cat better.<br />
<br />
But it's mostly because of my limited playing time.  With the vah shir, I'm not hampered with any exp penalty.<br />
<br />
They're all good choices.  Because the shaman class is good like that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mez played necro before shaman also, and mez think necro not as much fun.  Shaman be more dynamic then necro and more equipment dependant wich can be kind of interesting also.<br />
<br />
Mez hope yoo enjoy you new shaman.<br />
<br />
What race of necro did yoo paly?  Where you happy with one of da lesser necro races or did you play an iksar?<br />
<br />
If yoo can enjoy playing a lesser race then nothing wrong with playing a Barbarian shaman.  The shaman class is very nice regarless of da race joo chose but some people are just big min / max types and don't like the character they play unless it is the most powerfull  (frustraiting because dat be a moving target LoL).<br />
<br />
Perhaps da best shaman race is Troll.  Iksar is also very nice, and mez just love da Ogre.   Mez play troll to 35,  iksar to 52 and ogre to 58 and I like da Ogre da best.  Also best is kind of situational.  Ogre probably best raiding shaman with troll being best in exp group.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine has a little puny trollie also lvl 58 and he in love with his ugly green swamp stinking hide.  If yoo a min / max personality me advise joo play a troll.  Else joo play what joo like da best.<br />
<br />
Equipment.<br />
<br />
Some things are kind of important and the rest not matter that much.<br />
<br />
Only 3 things make joo get exp faster.<br />
<br />
Regen (health and mana) /  Damage Output / Damage Mitigation.<br />
<br />
Health regen is very nice and is why Troll and Iksar are such guud shaman.  <br />
<br />
Fungi Tunic<br />
Cerimonial Iksar Chestplate<br />
<br />
Damag output is Very nice and often overlooked and equipment varies depending on before or after lvl 45.<br />
<br />
After lvl 45<br />
JBB  Jaundiced Bone Bracer has right click 263 dd spell and is the most important lvling tool joo can get.  (no iksars thow)<br />
<br />
Pre lvl 45<br />
<br />
Get a hast item jike FBSS....  increases your mele damagae output buy 20% but overall impact is larger becuase yoo also take less damage because da mobs die faster.<br />
<br />
Guud Weapons:<br />
A nice 2hb like Granite Face Grinder kicks out some wonderfull dps.<br />
<br />
but also keep up your pierce and 1hb skills.<br />
<br />
Damage Mitigation:<br />
<br />
AC AC AC....  get lots of ac and not worry about wisdom much at all.  My standard working wisdom is only 141 at lvl 58.<br />
<br />
Defense skill....   solo every lvl to keep joo defense skill maxed.  This is just free AC and it be critical to keep maxed.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
A &quot;battle shaman&quot; as described above is an amazing lvling machine.  With high ac,  hast item,  and a nice hammer  (realy starts to kick in after lvl 20) a shaman can bash up to lvl 45 with ease.  Yoo can do the vast majority of joo damage with mele and just use mana for slow (damage mitigation),  hast (damage output) and regen spells.<br />
<br />
The &quot;soft shaman&quot; that go for wisdom have a much harder time grinding experance and have a much harder time maxing mele skills.<br />
<br />
Hope dis helps and have a blast whater ever shaman race joo decide to play.  It not make much differance joo already did the smartest thing in deciding to play a shaman in da first place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Depending on cash<br />
<br />
1) 2 x AC 6 + 65 HP rings<br />
2) Totemic or JB Legs, Arms, Helm, Bracer, Gaunts, Boots<br />
3) Tribunal Jewelry (Earrings)<br />
4) Fungal Tunic or Iksar Regen<br />
5) Charred Guardian Shield or Sarnak Battle Shield<br />
6) Ebon War Spear, Howling Harpoon, Jade Chokdai Prod<br />
<br />
Race:<br />
<br />
Troll &gt; Iksar = Ogre &gt; Vah Shir = Barbarian<br />
<br />
Trolls get all the toys. Snare Necklace, JBB, Regen.<br />
<br />
Faction? Laugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Fungi. JBB. Nab two +7 wis rings.  Full JB armor (legs if you can find/afford em).  CGS for your shield and a Jade Prod, Howling or Slimy Poon, and a Rune Etched Icewurm fang are all good choices for your range and primary weapon.  Earrings, Forest loops, Ivandyrs hoops or Tribunal Earrings (Imbued Ivory), depending on which race you pick.  Imbued Ivory Collar (Chardok drop) for the neck. Cloak I'd snuggle up to your local chanter and nab a Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak.<br />
<br />
Race?  Doesn't matter unless your a number cruncher. Pick a race you'd enjoy playing, not because it makes a 'better' shaman.  I play a barby with a nice rack.  I don't have infravision, and I don't have any kind of regen, or insane stamina to start with.  But I wouldn't trade her for all the regen in the world. :)</div></div><hr />

I'm having an identity crisis :)<br />
<br />
Thinking about going back to my troll<br />
