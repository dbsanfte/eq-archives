<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just funny that they were able to add another playable race and 2 illusions (froglok and scarecrow), neither of which were global when they originally said the tables were full.<br />
<br />
That's neither here nor there, though, as they'd not be adding more models, simply refining those already there.  C'mon, we have lip bear and nolip bear... they could actually drop one bear, improve the other, and likely still end up with slightly more room overall.  Yes, this means that generic bears would look better, too.<br />
<br />
Since they've developed an awesome new froglok model, we may see some changes, tho &quot;mob potions&quot; will likely never appear -- there are way too many of them.</div></div><hr />

The game has about hit the max that an engine that's 4 years old can sustain.  I doubt too much else will be forthcoming.<br />
<br />
Thats what they say. They are dead wrong. There have been a number of engine upgrades in the 4 years of EQ. the age of the game has nothing to do with its performance/max. Eq in reality has been completely re-writen engine wise at least 3 times that im aware of. As a programmer heres how it really works.<br />
<br />
You design a game around a minimum spec. In everquests case i think they require a card that can support 16 megs of textures on board. Well, 16 megs of ram, which breaks down to about 12-13 megs of textures, 3-4 megs of verticies and other geometric data.<br />
<br />
Ok, so now in that 12-13 megs of ram they gotta cram all the zone textures, and all the global textures. Welp, this is not exactly the case. They can fudge a bit and have some textures swap in and out depending on how often they are used. Presumably they keep the zone textures loaded at all times, along with the &quot;global&quot; textures. This is a bit of a misnomer though cause if you play with a low end vid card with alot of people in zone, the card with &quot;thrash&quot; (read textures from main ram, display them, get rid of some to make room for the next draw, read more, repeat) when it tries to display all the armor variations.<br />
<br />
I think what Sony is doing is keeping the main zone textures and the main player textures loaded in that minimum memory space, and swapping the others.<br />
<br />
Ok you say, but I have a Radeon 370000 with a gig of memory! Surely I can support and show more/faster textures. Yes you can. However if Sony ups the amount of textures in thier global texture file, on average it will up the &quot;thrash&quot; rate on a 16 meg card. The thrash rate does not slow the machine down linearly. Its more logrithmic or even exponential in slow down. The more you thrash, the much slower you go.<br />
<br />
So, the point is, sony has a TON of room to up the global textures. They wont becuae they are sticking to a minimum requirement, and upping it slows the average zone on a minimum card down beyond acceptable levels.<br />
<br />
As they upgrade the min spec, such as they did when they released the Direct X 8.1 engine, you will see a leap up in &quot;coolness&quot; as they have more room to play with textures.<br />
<br />
As the game ages they also &quot;cheat&quot; be slowly upping the global texture file by adding a few textures, like the frogs, scarecrow ect.<br />
<br />
The argument that there is not enough room for an updated bearform is purely bull for the above reasons. They could do it, but it would add more textures. The texture addition wouldnt be all that great. Why? You would rememve the current bearform textures saving some space. The addition of the newer textures would then take more  space (presumably you want a better bear which means better textures), but much less than say, the YoK frogs. YoK frogs need ALOT more textures because there are alot more animations (I'm slightly bluring the texture and verticies together here, but for the lay person its close enogh). Bears dont sit or jump, and they only animations they have are walk, run (same thing) and attack.<br />
<br />
So yes, there really is no good reason not to do it, besides the minimum levels, and they fact that they would rather add other stuff to the global file that they feel would get more &quot;bang for the buck&quot;<br />
<br />
I Hope this helps some people understand the situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sort of how it works, yes.  But it's not the whole story.<br />
<br />
EQ's graphics engine has been rewritten over the years, but every rewrite was subject to some constraints - notably, that every rewrite had to make do with the original file formats and data for zone geometry, textures, etc.<br />
<br />
New technology begets new data requirements.  You can't take full advantage of new features on a graphics card without having additional data available, or at least having your data reorganized to maximize the new stages in the newer pipelines.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that a new graphics engine designed from scratch with none of the old-EQ constraints would be far superior to the constrained rewrite we are living with.  But compatibility is the #1 most important feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again. Not true. When LoY came out 2 things happened. All the zones were re-texurized. (Er whas this Velious, cant remember)  Alot of verticie stuff changed in places too.. although not all. You were not allowed to use the old engine after a point, and a TON of files we patched. 100's of megs. The second thing is that decompressed texture files were enabled on disk which enabled faster texture swaping via direct dma transfer from ram to the card. No more decomressing to ram, then dma transfer.<br />
<br />
Its true that alot of nifty stuff like water bump mapping, shadow stencils, ect are not being used, But that is a limit of the engine NOT of the data set. For instance, if shadow stencils were used, and the game engine supported it, DirectX would simply strip the data out to cards that did not support it. Well, DirectX in combination owith the card drivers. All EQ would ahve to do is build it into the engine and have the data files available for use. DirectX and the card drivers would take care of culling it out for cards that didnt use it. Is it optimal? No. It'd be faster for the engine to have to paths and use the non stencil path on a machine that had stencils turned off, but on a game like EQ thats not overly optimized anyways, it wouldnt slow things down that much.<br />
<br />
I'm rambling. The point is its easy to add data. Adding new data doesnt &quot;break&quot; the old data or engine in any way. Its just imprioves things. And VI has done it in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually, it was Luclin.  All zones were given low, medium, and high resolution textures.<br />
<br />
Interesting that scarecrows were global rather than just the few zones that used them.  Considering how lightcrawler-happy the developers have gotten, (just count the # of lightcrawler-model populated zones) I'm surprised crawlers haven't gone global.<br />

OOOh... now THERE would be a mount!  Hi ho Slinky, awaaaaayyy!</div></div><hr />
