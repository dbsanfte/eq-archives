Advice. Dont waste your money. <br />
Id say that old saw about something sounding too good to be true applies here.<br />
Use the search tool here and you will find more than enough real info on how to level up and not end up being useless in the high levels.</div></div><hr />

The website does make some pretty big claims...might give it a go though since there's a money back thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eltai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't waste your time, most of these guides are based upon bugs with the plat making sections.  Often these are fixed, again, look at the testimonials, the last one was in 2003 :P that should give you a hint :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darhews</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just got a mage to level 41 in 18 hours played (includes 2-3 hours traveling and buying gear and spells) using a ds method.<br />
<br />
Basically I ds my shaman run around and gather as many mobs as I can handle (3-10 depending on zone and level) Let the mobs beat on the shaman and kill themselves (best to find non-running zones). <br />
<br />
With the mage it is easy, I just launch one rian or ae to put minor damage on all mobs, then sit down and make sure my shaman stays above 50 health.<br />
<br />
Some non running zones when you get higher levels=<br />
city of mist (went from 26 - 40 in 2 nights played maybe 6 hours)<br />
velks (40- xxxxx I should be able to stay there until 46 when my alt can group with my shaman and I can go solo in pov or bot)<br />
<br />
So if you are looking to get a toon to 65 in 7 days, it is possible. Just need to find the right zones. <br />
<br />
PS: i hope you ment 7 days played not playing 3 hours a day for 7 days</div></div><hr />

Doesn't have much info that I didn't already know. Looks like he put some effort into it but at this time, the leveling guide only goes to 30. That doesn't help me because my shammy is 39. The zones he lists aren't bad but some are ones I've been to and I think maybe some of his claims are a bit far-fetched. I didn't request a refund because I'd still like to check out some of his plat spots, although I noticed he doesn't have some spots that I know about listed, guess he was never at those places. Personally, I won't bother with any more of these so-called guides. I find the info I get from forums such as this, and other website to be more useful.</div></div><hr />
