<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a nosey person and I want to know all your secrets, so tell me why some of you have leveled a *insert race here* shaman to 60 and then leveled a *insert differernt race here* shaman. Why'd ya do it?<br />
<br />
For me, I don't think I could ever level the same class twice. I love Meku (although I would love some sort of bash), from starting as a little hatchling in Cabilis to the respected shaman I am today, but I don't think I would want to go through the same junk over again. To me there is no newness to that process. You already know what your spells are going to do before you scribe them. You know what things differ a poor played shaman to a great played.<br />
<br />
I dont think I could level a class again once I have spent so much time on it. I have played lots of classes:<br />
<br />
- Wood Elf Druid (played for 1.5 years) - Halfling Rogue (lots of fun) - Vah Shir Bard (Love as much as Meku, maybe a little bit more) - Vah Shir BL (fun class) - High Elf Druid (very first character) - Erudite Enchanter (a favorite) - Human Mage - Barbarian Warrior (Fargin Icehole :D )<br />
<br />
But I would never roll up, say, a Halfling Druid or Ogre Shaman. I have been there and done that.<br />
<br />
So I ask again, why? Tell me. TELL ME!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always play together with my husband and when we moved to a new server my intention was to go something different than a shaman. We tried out plentyful of new duo combinations but no combo of choice was as good as our old (troll shaman/sk) and it was always me that gave up and convinced him to try a new combo... heh. Anyway, no matter what he wanted to go I couldn't think of any better duo partner than a shaman so I made my second shaman, felt at home and stuck with her. At least I got to play a new race ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I might make a Frog Shaman when LoY comes out, not for replacing Jaeden, but just to experience my class from a new way to begin.<br />
<br />
Soon as I hit 10, I'd probably remake him as a wiz :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Played on Cazic Thule for a year and a half before The Nameless opened, then retired for a bit.  After I came back, most of my good friends had quit, and a few had switched to The Nameless.  After a few days they talked me into switching, and I tried a few other classes.  Got bored, rolled up an iksar shaman, and haven't made an alt since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">my main is a ogre shamanwho i started in oct 2000, didnt play her for about 4months in 2001, finally hit 50 about dec 2001.<br />
<br />
When Luclin came out i hated the ogre models, and got pissed off enough to make a katt shaman- pls the the falling damage ogres take while runnig has always irritated me.  Had alot more fun playing a twinked shamanup, than grinding thro the 50s.<br />
<br />
ogre is now 56 and katt 55.  Atmo i dont want to play them to 60, will still play  the ogre in guild raids, but i have a bit of eq burnout atmo.<br />
<br />
Yes i gonna play a frog shaman,  10 to 50 is easy after you donr it a couple of times.  Tho 45 is still a dreaded lvl even with the smooth out.<br />
<br />
guess i am curious aout how other races afect the shaman experience.<br />
<br />
yes i am an escaped patient.<br />
<br />
btw i have played ever class upto lvl 10...most of the tanks i deleted as they didnt inspire me;  tho sk i had alot of fun with.<br />
Thinki enjoyed wiz and rogue least; never got the hang of backstab )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I started off leveling a Barbarian Shaman to 50. I got burnt out from buffing (before HoS) and ended up making a Barbarian Rogue who got to lvl 53. <br />
Then the craving came back, had to play the Shaman class some more but I had a dilemna that was bothering me. <br />
<br />
When I first made my Shaman I didn't realise it would be primarily beneficial to put all starting points into wisdom. I had created my Barb 5 points short of what he could have had (5 omg!!). This coupled with the fact that I admired other races racial benefits I decided to re-roll and I haven't looke back since. <br />
<br />
Now at 62 my Ogre Shaman is all I could have hoped for. Having frontal immunity helps alot when soloing / duoing (I duobox a 60 Shadowknight) large mobs such as Lodizal, Phinigel, hunting in PoV etc. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which I'm glad I avoided conventional wisdom and didn't make a monk as a partner. I can't think of a better duo for a Shaman than a SK now. <br />
<br />
You mention slam, I rarely ever use it in recent memory except for killing Phinigel duo-ing with my friend, a 53 mage. Either your tanks should be stunning (go SK powah!), or else it just doesn't come in that handy for your average mob. <br />
<br />
At any rate I love playing Ogres, you'll see alot of Ogres 'brag' about their race and there is a reason for it . . . we rock! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got banned and restarted as vah :p Course, my old barb shaman was only 24 (not my main :p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just want slam because I play on a pvp server. I think wizards would fear me more if once in awhile I could stun that ManaBurn.<br />
<br />
Always thought tail strike should have been treated like slam, all iksar get it but monks only ones who can train. Be nice if they added a little stun to it.  :D</div></div><hr />

Why you ask? well for one I really diddnt know what I was doing till the mid 30's or so, sure buff here buff there slow this, but I am just curious to see what I could do better this time.   Its just a thought, not sure if I would go back to going through the same crap zones all over again, but ya never know?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I tend to do a lot of reading on the web....<br />
<br />
My first shaman was a inny troll complete with iksar bp and snare necklace.  Fun... but quite cookie cutter.<br />
<br />
To support a guild smith, we needed a rallos zek imbue mule.  I volunteered, made the ogre shaman in put all my points into STA first, and then into wis.  I've had fun playing him... he's different.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My first character was a troll shaman on Mith Marr. I moved to Lanys and restarted a new Barbarian Shaman that I got to 60. Then I quit and got rid of my account only to find I missed playing EQ so i came back and played my third shaman, again a Babarian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Siamese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I first made a shaman to go along with my wife's paladin.  We leveled those characters to low 50s.  Then she wanted to play a monk, so I made a lizard shaman to play with her.  We got about level 20 as an Iksar team, and I just decided that I really didn't like playing the Iksar shaman, so I made a barb shaman to play along with her (I leveled like mad to catch up to her too!).  We played those two characters for a while, but then she decided she wanted to make another alt.  Well, I like shaman, so I made a new one to play with her.  A troll this time.  We leveled up to around 20, and she decided she wanted to play the monk again, so I leveled up the troll to catch up to her, and I haven't looked back.  Love playing the troll.  I won't be making a frog shaman though.  I've already got too many shaman on one server as it is.  Basically comes down to the fact that I like shaman, and they are great duoing partners with just about any class, so I never could see playing another class to duo with her.<br />
<br />
I do have to agree about SKs though.  When she's not around, I've been working on a Shadowknight to eventually 2 box with the shaman.  They are ungodly slow compared to the monk (most likely just misperception on my part...or crappy equipment more likely) but I still love the character.  I think it will be a great combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Temuchin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">quit then came back<br />
<br />
was barb but went troll for the halfling illusion, snare and better regen<br />
<br />
most rerollers are either people on new accounts or who have moved servers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Barb shaman to 50 ... (Cap at that time... ) quit....<br />
<br />
Came back.... (still same account) to 55.... quit and gave account away... (he said... sure I will give it back if you return..) long story short , one lost friend and one lost shaman....<br />
<br />
Restarted Barb shaman....Im at 54 and climbing now....<br />
<br />
So not the same as the rest but hey... <br />
Fulgrim and Phorgrim are still played...<br />
<br />
Phorgrim is my current <br />
<br />
If you see Fulgrim online..... its some dork that fell in love with him and never returned him when I came back.... If you see Phorgrim.... Say hello <br />
<br />
Phorgrim.... Karana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I started over my shaman a few times to see which one I liked the best.  Did a barb first, hated having to cast serpent sight all the time, and seeing the birrage of barbs around I wanted something a little different.  Then I saw it!  The troll butt scratch.  I made a troll then and haven't looked back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Malone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just a part-time shaman player here.<br />
<br />
I levelled up a barb shaman to 30, then realized that it seems like they are pretty commonplace and the poor vision was getting more and more annoying -- so I re-rolled a kitty shaman and am at level 25 now.  Don't really see any downsides to a kitty shaman.  They are uncommon, look good, get good vision, sneak, safe fall, etc.  Yeah., they eat more...not a problem!<br />
<br />
Feel somewhat sentimental about retiring my barb shaman and it certainly is very painful using the same spells over and over again a second time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There are no downsides to kitty shamans.  Only upsides.  Only possible perceivable downside would be that it's harder to get a kitty fungi than a regular one.  The race is brokenly good in that respect, much like woodelves, . . . but better actually.  <br />
I'd kill for sneak . . or just being able to see in the dark.  Let alone no exp penalty.  <br />
O well, I'm a barbarian through and through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kudor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was in a large raiding guild. School and Personal life started to be taking more and more time so I gave up on my main and just started a fun shaman to mess around with when I wasnt to busy. I dont know after playing a shaman for so long it kinda just felt wrong to play anything else. I hated having to try and med or not solo. The shaman was the perfect fit to what I wanted to play and just always will be</div></div><hr />
