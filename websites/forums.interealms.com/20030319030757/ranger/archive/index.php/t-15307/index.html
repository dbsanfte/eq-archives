<br />
My Guild is not capable of mounting a force to reach Jaleil in The Hole for the next stage of my Epic. I have been trying to get there on a pickup raid or through friends in other Guilds, but nobody seems to be heading that way.<br />
<br />
Are there any Rangers here whose Guilds (or friends) are heading deep into The Hole either specifically to do the Jaliel encounter, or for some other reason, that would welcome an extra pair of swords? I am happy to either tag along keep out of the way and gate out afterwards, or to be a full member of the raid for the duration, at your discretion. <br />
<br />
Only slight hitch is that I am in the UK so need GMT-friendly hours - that said, I have been waiting long enough to do an all-nighter if necessary!</div></div><hr />
