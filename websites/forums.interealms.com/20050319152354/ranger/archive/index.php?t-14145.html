<br />
1) whats the point of this change?  I dont see this dmg/delay ratio change as any sort of &quot;upgrade&quot; its just sorta a sidegrade...i.e. not really making the bow alot better or worse, so huge confusion at why even the attempted &quot;upgrade&quot;. Not to mention this bow dropping off a higher level tier'd mob shouldnt be so similar to a bow off a easy mob thats 32/29.<br />
<br />
2)our bows suck. Plane and simple.  Compared to the items other classes are getting our bow upgrades are trivial.  Battle fists just got changed to 18/20 with a proc.  One of the best bows out of luclin was 37/35 from emperor seru,and now breaking into teir 3 and 4 mobs, the best we are seeing is a 3pnt dmg over delay?  WHy is that? there are 2hslashes now that are almost 10 points, over and 1h weapons within 2.  Im feeling a bit jipped here.<br />

<br />
No way else to look at it. 33/30 is pretty inferior to 40/37. <br />
<br />
The bow off Agnarr did get better though,  it went from 36/33 to 36/32  so a pure upgrade there.<br />
<br />
Too bad.  I was pretty happy about that bow, now I have to look elsewhere for a new one.</div></div><hr />

Metinks someones been overgrinding the planes a bit hmmm?<br />
<br />
Tee hee.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I think the developers are looking for any way they can to lower ranger damage output without making it look like a total nerf.  So instead of messing with our AAs, they are messing with the weapons we use them with.  I dont see why the warmaster bow of all bows was nerfed like that.  Considering the mob it comes off of, I think it was fairly well balanced.  If I were VI, id be looking more at the 2handers that are coming out of POP for SKs and Pallys than the few bows out there for rangers.  Primal/Ancient prismatic is still one of the top 5 (I think) of all bows and they are pretty old right now.  They should be upgrading bows, not downgrading them.  Or at the very least leave them be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
40/37 = 1,081 ratio<br />
<br />
33/30 = 1,1<br />
<br />
Now, keeping in mind that be lowest delay will statisticaly maximize your dmg, I would say that yes, the 33/30 ratio will offer more DPS. Just not the same impressive crits. So, if you were criting for 2300ish with the 40 dmg expect crits around 1900ish with the 33 dmg.</div></div><hr />

Ever since we got trueshot the best DPS was achieved with high dmg, high delay bows. Just the way the code works. If it was purely ratio (minus all crits just straight bow DPS) we'd all be using 11/17 bows.<br />
<br />
I'd be willing to bet a parse of 33/30 is a big loss of DPS over a 40/37 bow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It showed that a Primal Bow (33/35) came out ahead of a War Bow of Rallos Zek (43/45) in terms of DPS.<br />
<br />
I can't remember the exact numbers, but I believe when using Trueshot disc Primal performed a result around 300ish DPS, while the War Bow was only performing a 230ish DPS.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, the following statement is wrong.<br />
<br />
Ever since we got trueshot the best DPS was achieved with high dmg, high delay bows. <br />
<br />
40 / 37 vs 33 / 30 is similar ratios to War Bow and Primal, so I'm sure if it was parsed we'd get the same results this time to. The 33/30 bow would came out ahead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now the ratio on a 10/17 bow is on 0.588...which sucks..<br />
<br />
For MAX dmg, statistically what u need is better ratio + lowest delay possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raenewae</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh, After playing with it and parsing it out a bit, seems I spoke in haste regarding the damage potential of the new ratio.<br />
<br />
It isnt what I expected at first glance, but not what I had hoped either.  <br />
<br />
Oh well, in the end it's much better than the primal I upgraded from ratio wise so all is well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omodan</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The primal bow outdamaging the war bow also included avatar being up for primal over no avatar for war bow.  With avatar up, war bow outdamages the primal.  When taking bow ratios in account, you need to take in account am3 and TS.  These are modifiers that are based off the base damage of the bow.  With am3, you are looking at an archery modifier of +100% from base, then with TS your adding another 100% on top of that.  That skews the results away from just ratio.  You must take in account what the modifiers do to the base also.  Without the modifiers, yes, ratio is all you look at.  Moving the damage/delay to 33/30 effectively nerfed the bow if you have am3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pointie</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">also take into account nuke damage. with a 40 37 ratio you could put in your nukes wich helps dps and doesnt really effect to much on the bow damage dps alone.  if you nuke with a 33 30 you are hoping to have low hits in that time you took to cast a spell.  it does make a difference on overall dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relv</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">40/37 to a 33/30.<br />
<br />
You have to figure the arrows in, from our handy EQ ability that is a VILE ABOMBINATION UNTO GOD appearently in Verant's mind.<br />
<br />
40/37 with blessed champion's arrows is about 52/37.  (1.4)<br />
33/30 with blessed champion's arrows is about 45/30.  (1.5)<br />
<br />
So it is an upgrade, the reason being the faster bow takes better advantage of arrows, which is why Kitae's tests found primal to be the best when avatar was up for both.<br />
<br />
On a sidenote, I'd recommend using wolf form when possible with any non-primal bow, proc rate is too low to proc-n-swap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually that’s not true.  It’s never been true.  At least not the way you are calculating it.  A weapon with 1 dam 5 delay (0.2 ratio) would OWN a weapon that was 10 dam 20 delay (0.5 ratio).  You have to factor in the Damage bonus you get with your main hand.  It’s the reason they took the Moss Covered Twig out of the game (at least out of your main hand).<br />
<br />
Now of course we don’t get a damage bonus when using our bows, per say…….<br />
<br />
We Do however get a damage bonus due to the arrows we chose to use as Relv just posted.   Figuring DPS done by a bow really isn’t just as simple as looking at a ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valphoo</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">... actually.. is part neft part upgrade...<br />
<br />
IF we had autoattack on archery the new bow would outdamage the old one. HOWEVER, we don't have this luxory. Since archery is HIGHLY effected by lag 30 delay is just border line being too fast.  This bow's damage will go up for the people on the fastest connections and break even for those on east coast connects etc. Honestly, this is really a lateraly move more then an upgrade/downgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to figure some damage from the elemental part, altho not quite as much as normal damage due to resists.  The arrows are 11 damage +4 fire, and for most damage comparisons, it seems taking half the elemental damage is fairly accurate.<br />
<br />
<br />
relv didnt you say not to long ago that your primal bow couldnt outdamage your current weapon combo, but your bow of shadows could ? so then bow of shadows is 33 35 +5 bane/ and vallons bow is 40 37 right ? that means vallons bow will own a primal correct ?but it got nerfed so now its not really a huge upgrade.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bow of shadows also has an archery skill mod on it.  The combination of the two put the bow squarely ahead of primal, even without avatar.<br />
<br />
<br />
As Relv said, Avatar was included in the tests of both bows, and Primal still outdamaged War Bow even when Avatar was up with War Bow as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup, the War Bow's ratio is worse than primal after you consider the arrows.</div></div><hr />

Ryunzun, Sunmoon does not allow flash, javascript, etc in signatures.<br />
<br />
I now refer you to the ultimate explanation of why Bow of the Destroyer blows:<br />
Originally posted by Epiphany EQ <br />
One thing to remember here is that there is no auto-attack on archery. (Sorry if someone pointed this out, and I missed it.) <br />
<br />
&quot;What has that got to do with it?&quot; you ask. <br />
<br />
Simple. You can't actually press 5 (or whatever your hotkey is) in time to actually shoot the arrow exactly when it's ready. Taking network lag into account, you can't even do it with a gamepad trick. Even if everything is going really well, you might expect 0.5 sec delay on an average bow shot right? So a 10/17(0.588) bow is really more like a 10/23 (0.435) bow when you count the delay. And that 30/38 (0.789) is 30/43 (0.698). <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah you lose damage due to lag... so what's your point?&quot; you ask. <br />
<br />
Take a look at how much DPS you lose in each case. The 10/17 lost 26% of it's damage to lag while the 30/38 only lost 12%. <br />
<br />
So what you really need to do is add in the arrow damage. (Sure I shoot 3 damage arrows, but you might be shooting 12 damage arrows). Then you need to add a bit to your bow delay. (I estimated 5.) Then you can compare. <br />
<br />
So with those fancy 12 damage arrows: <br />
<br />
10/17 = 22/22 (1.000) <br />
30/38 = 42/43 (0.977) <br />
<br />
Isn't that interesting... <br />
<br />
With my lame 3 damage arrows: <br />
<br />
10/17 = 13/22 (0.591) <br />
30/38 = 33/43 (0.767) <br />

 In fact I just passed down my BoC when I got Bloodfrenzy and by the time I replaced my sapper it was obsolete. However you would have a very powerful argument if my Willsapper was a 100hp/mana range item that would be insanely useful to any other class and I replaced it with a very minor upgrade for myself because the upgrade was warrior only and pretty much forced upon me. Unfortunately passing down the Bow of Storms is not an option. So when one gets replaced after being used for a month or 3 there's a 100hp/mana range item that 40 other people would LOVE to have just rotting in the bank, while the ranger made to loot the new bow is getting a whopping 5dps boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corean</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grimmlokk, you are overlooking the fact that most rangers don't even go for any good range slot items other than bows because that's what they choose to put in their range slots. <br />
<br />
Let me give you an example.  A Shiny Trinket of Speed dropped the other day.  I didn't go for it even though I don't have any other haste item than my Swiftwiind.  Why?  I wouldn't be able to use my bow with a range slot haste item.  You should be glad you don't have that kind of limitations as a warrior instead of taking jabs at rangers in the manner you did.<br />
<br />
Your argument using BoC is flawed because you are making comparisons between droppable items and non-droppable items.  You don't think rangers would do the same thing you did with your BoC if  the Bow of Storms were droppable?  Let me see you passing down Bloodfrenzy when you get a better item for the slot. <br />

Get the sand out of your vagina and read it again. I dislike the itemization. The rangers didn't itemize the encounters.<br />
<br />
 And I won't be banking my BF because I won't be taking a replacement. If it was usable by 6 classes and great for all of them AND I was basically forced to bag it for a slight upgrade it would be the same.<br />
<br />
 You're so busy looking for something to be offended by you can't seem to grasp simple concepts. Frankly it baffles me. If I said I thought Golden Leaf armor was ugly would you go on a tirade about my horrible anti-ranger leanings? How about if I said I dislike lightning? Does that mean I feel rangers don't deserve their epics? Really, I want to know exactly what I am allowed to disparage that won't cause your panties to bunch up.<br />
<br />
 You want a good comparison that you may be able to understand? Let's see what I can come up with.<br />
<br />
 You kill Cursed. New leet bow drops. 40dmg 30dly 125mana 100hp. Rng/War/Pal/SK/Rog Blah blah blah you want it. But it has a 15% taunt mod on it or somesuch. It goes to warriors over and over for the taunt mod. PoP comes out. Half the boss mobs in PoP are dropping warrior only bows with 125hp and 15% taunt mod. All those warriors with way better bows than your 33/35 bow are banking it for 25 more HP. They don't WANT to make you watch them bank an item you'd kill for, but due to itemization they are forced to.<br />
<br />
 Now, I'm not allowed to swear here so not gonna be able to reply to you any more. I am very sorry if you still can't grasp what I'm getting at. Not really apologizing just sorry for the bus that will inevitably hit you some day when you forget they drive in the street and walk into traffic.</div></div><hr />

Seru's bow drops.  Are you seriously telling us that you would not give the bow to that Ranger because he might loot a better one at some unspecified  future time, so that some other fighter could get a crummy 100 HP?<br />

Grimm's point is valid in that VI does this to us by a) making so many good items no-drop, b) not being able to decide what they want to do in terms of itemizing for class-specalization or for general use...  they seem to change their thinking every year/expansion.  New developers/producers?  I don't know, but obviously some of the risk/reward in the game will show you that a few of the designers were smoking crack when they made their decisions.<br />
<br />
Take it at face value.  Everyone when given a chance to upgrade 50 hps or 3 dps on an item has to consider a few factors, and one of them is whether the upgrade is negligible enough that they ought to pass the item on to others so they're not upgrading it again in 2 months.  As someone trying to decide who in a guild should get loot, or as a person on a raid thinking of how to spend their dkp, it's annoying when Verant is not consistent and forces you to make a tough call that doesn't help everyone concerned.<br />
<br />
100hp ranged slot is 100hp ranged slot btw... That's good for all tanks, not just us.  It's too easy to have tunnel vision as a ranger and think anything item that has 'bow' in its title belongs to us.  I think in that case Venture it always depends on what everyone has.  Too many variables.  Hell, look at Allakhazam's and I'll bet you'll see that Bow of Storms and Mithaniel Marr's new bow are both obviously intended as Monk items.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: &quot;BFT or Nightmare or some other bit of fluff.&quot;  It's just sad that the mudflation has come to this now where some would think something like a BFT, nightmare, or doom bow is junk.  If you're all doing that well that everyone in your guild has such, warriors, paladins, shadowknights AND rangers then that's very cool and shouldn't be taken for granted.  We'd have all killed for any of those 3 just about 6 months ago, so try not to lose perspective amidst the riches of expansion.</div></div><hr />

Brain of Cazic Thule, a 100Hp item with FT1.  Should warriors get the first dibs on it instead of casters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinx</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">your argument isn't going anywhere at this point.<br />
there was never a discussion of who should 'get first dibs' on the bows, it was a question of whether more than our class should be considered, at least I think that's what the argument was about...I coulda sworn the first argument here was that they weren't really upgrading our bows enough comparable to other items in terms of relative power... and then the next argument was just verbal sparring about what makes a good analogy here...   you can't compare no-drop stuff to droppable and you can't compare bows to anything else because they're bows, a unique item with diverse advantages to multiple classes.<br />
<br />
and actually, even if we go with your argument, and the brain dropped, and it was war-usable, which I'm not sure it is, then it would depend on who can use it and has need, at least in my guild.  Since about everyone I know has an earring of solstice, FT1 on an item, isn't a big deal for anyone--it doesn't stack well.<br />
<br />
btw, this thread has officially drifted beyond off-topic and is now useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Therefore if Ranger (a) in the guild has a good bow already, and Ranger (b) has fluff, and you can't pass down Ranger (a)'s bow even tho he's top dog Ranger of the guild, I'd think you'd want to upgrade Ranger (b).<br />
<br />
That fact is that for the forseeable future, there are going to be periodic expansions and new &quot;l33t&quot; equipment coming into the game.  If you don't get the uberest item now you'll have a chance at the next uber item in a few months...</div></div><hr />

It's a miracle people as stupid as you live long enough to learn to type. Really it is. I'd think by now you'd at the very least have gotten into a fight with some maniac for blinking wrong. Either I'm the victim of a high quality trolling here, or you live under powerlines, that are painted with lead based paint, by your parents who are also 1st cousins. Please just tell me you are trolling, I will sleep easier. I hate to think option B is even possible, yet it seems to be the only other explanation.</div></div><hr />

Only real way to tell what's better unfortunately, normmally ratio wins with bows these days (+ arrow dmg, don't forget to add that into the ratio).<br />
<br />
Really fast bows suffer from lag though due to the client side calculations, unless you use a gamepad and you run a fast system your performance may suffer a bit more than you think.</div></div><hr />

Whining because rangers at the time were getiing best bows avaible and now they arent the best bows, so others should have gotten them, too bad so sad, tough titty said the kitty.<br />
  Bows are ranger's bread and butter. Our choices compared to other classes with prim/sec are a jok.e. anything useable for tanking weapons just aint going to a ranger first second or third. Ranged slot, bows the only choice. Higher end armor is going to tank classes etc,etc,etc. So ya know either deal with the fact that high end rangers are gonna get the high end bows( if things work as they should) or make a ranger and get the high end bows.<br />
 Every class has its advantages, and are not meant to be comparable with other classes in all respects. Bows=rangers end of story.</div></div><hr />

Go make a thread about how Ranger's shouldn't get Seru bows or whatever and don't post on threads about Ranger questions.</div></div><hr />

Cut old Grimm some slack, hes a grumpy barbarian.  The solution to this is simply....now there are crumbloads of nice stat bow rangeslots that not only drop, but are fletchable with 100/100 and stats etc.  Just keep the components from the ele planes and ask telon to whip up a few, problem solved :)  As it is, all our warriors want earth bows too, so it's really just a matter of xping the crap out of earth and everyone will have a 100 /100 rangeslot with AOB :P</div></div><hr />

Anyway, Vinx and Grimm have good points, but I'm late for work and don't have time to expound on them.  All I can say is go reread the first few posts, before people got their dander up and started insulting Grimm (and I guarantee you he doesn't stand for that crap).<br />
<br />
Btw, that first statement (while probably true for a few people) was tongue in cheek.</div></div><hr />

Guilds always have and always will use their own judgement and methods as to whom gets which item. To argue on it here is about as effective as saying every low weight all/all item should go to Monks on Alla's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and yeah, I'm of the &quot;too many variables&quot; group. sometimes it's right to not take a minor dps upgrade bow if it had a ton of hp on it for a tank or whatever. I can easily think of very realistic situations for both cases, so.. :p</div></div><hr />
