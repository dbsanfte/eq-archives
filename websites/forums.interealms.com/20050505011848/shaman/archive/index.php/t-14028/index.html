<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Given the increased controls over spellbooks, I wonder if SOE will ever implement the ability to convert an old spell back to a scroll?  Maybe charge 10k to bleed plat out of the economy.  <br />
<br />
A lot of other gear can be sold when upgrades arrive, it seems clear that this functionality could be added.  <br />
<br />
Maybe it would make spells too common.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.  But I got 3 guildmates who would love malo and torpor, and although we've killed Sev 8 times, and other Kunark dragons about 20, along with countless over prot/jumpy/emporer/overkings, they still aren't getting them.  I suppose we need to key up more for VP, where they definitely do drop.  <br />
<br />
I got Malos and Quiescence now, and it's a damn shame to send Malo and Torpor to the back of the book.  <br />
<br />
Quiescence, btw, is the shizzznit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The ability to re-scribe would cause a twinking rage that even Iksar, Vah Shir and Frogloks couldn't compare to. And nobody would ever play a mellee again, with an abundance of good spells laying around on high-level chars that have retired or don't use them anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd like to recommend sontalak to you then, he's on a pretty quick repop and always drops 7 spells.  4groups of 60+ can do him with some gear and AA.  Don't know what your guild is capable of but I highly recommend him for spell drops.<br />
<br />
The other option is to tell the lower level shamans to just get to 65 because it's easier to buy the 65 versions than it is to find the lvl 60 ones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wulfson Soulforger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Like Drinnar said, tis much easier to save your cash and buy the 61+ versions than it is to camp the 60 ones.  I got lucky and had a great guild for Torpor and ended up having to buy Malo.  Cost me a BBB and 10k :( but, I had to get it fore PoP came out.</div></div><hr />
