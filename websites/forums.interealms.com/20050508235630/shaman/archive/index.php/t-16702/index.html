<br />
It's still around.</div></div><hr />

It's also almost completely empty these days. A few patches ago the spawn rate for named (rabid chokadai, roamers in and out of the castle, etc) was greatly reduced. Our last trip there (a few weeks ago) we had the dungeon to ourselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since noone goes there anymore I dont see why they dont make it easier to get to. Then maybe a few more people would go there. I have very good sarnak faction so I have no problem getting there but it sucks that my guildmates cant get there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Greatly reduced is an understatement- the week after it was released we killed 4 or 5 named in 2 hours, and not just rabid chokidai but castle named and wandering named as well.  I've been back at least a half dozen times since then (when the patch must have gone in) and you're lucky to see 1 or 2 rabids mass slaughtering the entire tunnel, dog pens, castle entrance, etc... after hours of destruction.  And after you've watched your umpteenth jagged bone junk earring rot and still don't have the faction w/ chardok normal to walk out, it gets old fast.<br />
<br />
I have the turnins for the nice 90 hp/10 wis golem ring but can't get anyone to waste their time to go down and get it.  Honestly, was there a compelling need to nerf this zone that terribly?  Bleh.<br />
<br />

Here's the link to the rabid chokidai on alla's and its drops:<br />

<br />
Jagged bone earring drops like candy.  The see invis earring is nice (see my magelo) but rare and the really rare drop that isn't listed is a FT2 necklace (spiritmaster war beads).  The necklace is what most people are after, but I haven't had the luck esp. after the spawn nerf.<br />
<br />
Depending on your gear, there are two nice quests in cd-b for a range slot item and a ring, both with solid wis and lots of hp.<br />
<br />
Range slot (collect random junk and turnin, way easy):<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22628<br />
<br />
Ring (collect random junk and fight spawned mob deep in castle):<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22185<br />
<br />
My bad, I thought ring was 90 hp but it's only 70 according to alla's.<br />
<br />
Enjoy,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can easily just train to the zone entrance. Invis up and run to the first bridge, drop down, then run to 2nd bridge past captain and the guardian guy, drop down, then run/swim through waterfall and hop up at zone in clicker. I have done it being KOS and not even gotten hit. The drop downs really throw off the train and give you plenty of time to make it. Big thing is don't stop and wait around just go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We went there this past sunday, just to go try Korucust, since we had never fought him.  We had about 30, and like only three died before he did.  Then it was funny, just watching people die left and right from the dot's before they could get cure.  Kind of reminded me of a Grummus raid.  Over half the people that died on him, did so after he did.</div></div><hr />
