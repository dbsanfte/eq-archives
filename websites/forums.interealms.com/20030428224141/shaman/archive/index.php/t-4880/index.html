Anyone know a decent Paladin site with forums?  And I might as well ask my question here too, since people here know their stuff...<br />
<br />
Edit: Nevermind, I found a good forum...<br />
<br />
My GF and I set up a duo on Firiona Vie server where we kinda go if we want to get away from the same-ole same-o on our regular play server.  Considering it's a new server for us, where we have no resources and no contacts, we wanted a self-sufficient duo.  Well, we could do shaman/monk, but I already have one of each, and she already has a monk.  We wanted something different.  So we went with (asbestos pants on) Paladin and Druid.<br />
<br />
Okay I can hear the chuckles now. ;)  But this duo has almost everything... SoW, snare, ports, rezzes, adequate DPS, strong tanking, solid healing,Track, stuns, Invis *and* IVU, we can fear-kite animals and undead alike if we want, split pulls using Lull or Harmony, root park, paladin can self-haste... you name it, we can do it.  Only things we're missing are mana regen (we can buy clarities, but we'll probably never be 60's for POTG) and... slows.<br />
<br />
Okay, so I'm spoiled.  Every shaman knows when it comes to damage, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and slow is king of damage prevention.  Problem is, I can't find a Pally item that procs a slow except Wavecrasher, which I will likely never own on this server since we'll be playing on it very casually.<br />
<br />
I guess I can &quot;ghetto slow&quot; by chaining stuns, but does anyone know a reasonably obtainable Pally item that procs or clicks a slow?</div></div><hr />
