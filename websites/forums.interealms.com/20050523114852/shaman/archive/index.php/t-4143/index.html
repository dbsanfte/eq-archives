<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So after reading the top ten threads I've gotten this crazy idea to someday pursue the shamanistic shennanigan boots (did I spell that right?) in Plane of Mischief.  Hopefully with the upcoming changes, the entrance to this zone will be made more accessible, but even if they don't I can collect the DA idols or something.  Anyhow, what I wanted to know is how soloable is PoM, and what level/equipment is required?  Do I need to be 60 with torpor, malo, epic, fungi, horse, and JBB?  Also, how hard/ how long does it take to get those insane boots.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The trouble is, we don't know how much about the zone they are going to change.<br />
<br />
So any advice you get now could well be totally out of date when you get to the zone after the change.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the best place to ask is probably http://www.planeofmischief.com/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Even with the equpment you listed, you won't be able to solo the interiors of PoM.  You get to this zone by taking out some VERY hard dragons and frenzy'ing drakes, and it's to be taken very seriously.  If you're lucky, you might get your shammy boots in a year of grouping in PoM.  That's right, I said a YEAR.  The dolls that you produce take a serious amount of time to make and are produced completely at random.  Of course, you could buy or trade for a shammy doll, but that's well over 100K on my server atm.<br />
<br />
Bottom Line, PoM armor is godlike for a good reason.  You'll see few pieces of it around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In the current state PoM is in I would say you need to be 60.  Malo and Torpor are a must to solo the 4th Floor card droppers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm bound there currently.  I made a corpse (thanks rape drake) and dragged it along with me till our raid got to the PoM zone-in.  Then I zoned in, bound, and had a cleric rez my corpse back to finish up the raid.  That's the way to get there I'd recommend . . if yer guild does NTOV that is.  If not, there are other ways.  Not good options tho most of em . . . there's a drake that sits within aggro distance of POM zone so drag/rez techniques may not still work.  Not sure, if so the range is VERY tiny.  I had to banzai it in there past the dam drake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just curious but how many people do you know got any shannigens gear AFTER the first nerf of that zone. As I reacll,, the initial PoM was soloable and the exp ws insane and drops were plentiful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After the nerf on Brell most of the population left.  I rebound both my druid and shaman outside after about a month after the nerf.  There just wasn't much point to stay.  I had my boots already, only wanted the druid armor since its insane, but with the nerf there wasn't much hope.  *If* they change it I may go back.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, if you can't buy the shaman doll... you have 0 chance of getting boots anytime this year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I bought a doll and it has been about 4 weeks of regular (3-4 hours, 4+ times a week) farming and I am still lacking one of the four cards I need for boots.<br />
<br />
Need to be level 60 with torpor to solo mobs that drop thrones.<br />
the boots need 2 thrones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After noting how rare cards and especially good cards are, and how few mobs will drop them and their respawn . . . I'm considering changing my bind point back to timorous.  Seems like way too much work for way too small a chance of anything significant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A little while after the puppet nerf I gave up and rebound, a few people in the guild still bound up there, but I kept my bags, so if they get a white throne I'll get boots.<br />
<br />
It's a waste of time right now, especially with the 4th floor mobs timed to a minute and alts camped out right by them to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With the new bazaar it may be fairly easy to simply purchase the doll and cards needed to make the boots.  Of course, you still need to make one trip up to PoM to get the combine boxes.<br />
<br />
Forget about making a shaman doll yourself.  The boxes that make them are currently broken, and have been since February.  They are supposedly fixed on Test, but those of us who have been following PoM since before the nerf have learned that Verant is either completely ignorant or boldfaced liars about the plane of mischief.  They have made many statements in the past that are simply wrong, so I don't believe anything they say about it now.<br />
<br />
Die hard PoMers are the ugly step-children of EQ :)  VI could care less about us.  <br />
<br />
As far as the revamp goes, I'll believe it when I see it...and be completely shocked if it actually happens.<br />
<br />
P.S. Henora are you faithfully checking the bazaar for thrones for your boots?  I know I've heard of some being for sale on Terris on occasion.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Want to add that the 4th floor mobs are no longer timed by players.  Back in last october Verant changed the respawn rate from 13 hours to 72 minutes on most mobs, so there are plenty to go around....of course, with that change they nerfed the drop rate on thrones to almost nil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">naar - i have my bazaar mule up and check about every 15 mins as I play.  :(<br />
<br />
If you see a blue throne for sale on terris, send me a tell before acoloss buys it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think 50% of the shamans who got their boots got it after the puppet nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>raburr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ok sad sucky truth of PoM :(<br />
<br />
Boxes ARE BROKE atm...only one that will summon you a doll is the Wizzie box. At fan faire someone reported that &quot;boxes are fixed&quot; ...well last sat someone made a druid box and poof no doll made from it.<br />
<br />
I have been bound and playing in PoM for past few months. mainly farming cards for cash.<br />
<br />
BUT........if your smart you would go ahead and farm cards, words of wealth etc now and be ready for the fix. Well it helps me sleep batter anyway :P lol<br />
Plus its a fun zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vulgarr Disruptor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I didn't make it to PoM untill shortly after the first big nerf, when everything was on a 12 hour respawn. I cleared almost EVERYTHING solo at least once, sometimes twice a day for almost 3 months, then gave up and bought the cards and doll i needed. I was incredibly lucky just to find the doll back then, as I only know of about 6 pairs of boots on Brell. PoM was a nice place to visit, but a terrible place to live.... and If you want boots now; you'll be living there for a very long long long time. Unless of course your server's PoM was highly farmed pre-nerf and theres an abundance of shammy dolls in some guildvault. Bottom line is: if you can't buy the doll, don't even bother trying the hell camp for cards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A good friend gave me a doll that he acquired pre-nerf.  It sat in my bank for a year.  Finally, I buckled down and went in hopes to get the cards.  Well, two weeks and 55k later, I got my boots.</div></div><hr />
