<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello! My guild is finally about to head into NToV and a big question came to are attention. Someone said that there is a player rule amongst guilds that says you cant enter NToV if aary isnt up or somthing. Kinda like a respect thing? Has anyone heard of this or is this just some guilds cockblocking stunt. Im on the xev server and I have heard nothing about this until a member of my guild brought it up. I was curious if you guys have this rule.... on your server. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've never heard of something like that. However, I have heard of something similar.  There used to be rotation for NToV. If you wanted to get in the rotation you had to kill aary b/c he was the gatekeeper for NToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aary guards the only entrance to NToV. Its generally taken that you have no right to be in NToV until you can take Aary down. Some guilds ignore this, but the simple fact is that Aary is one of the tougher (but not the toughest) mob in NToV. Its kinda like a rite of passage.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if guilds drop Aary every time he pops and give you no shot at him, then I see no reason not to proceed if anything else is up. <br />
<br />
Respect is a two way street...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is the rule on Xev. If you didn't kill Aaryonar then you cannot enter NToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Redspeed-Valoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is the rule on Xev. If you didn't kill Aaryonar then you cannot enter NToV.<br />
<br />
OR ELSE.  What are you gonna do if they want to do NToV and Aaryonar isn't up?  Send them angry tells?<br />
<br />
Look, maybe a year or two ago it mattered, but it doesn't anymore.  Have fun in NToV, it's a big step for a guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Been ages since I've been in ToV but back when we did do it the rules where basically that you had to kill roy to get into the rotation and that once a guild had killed him they got to clear the rest of Ntov. Roy is the first really tough mob you hit in there and you have to get past him to get to most of the other dragons back so it is common to consider him an important mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Saryn still maintains a rotation.  Kill arry to get on it and kill him within 24 hours of spawn on your week to keep NToV from going FFA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Normally this is respect. If a guild killed Aary and some other dragons, but had to go one night (as clearing ntov would be a 2 day thing for some) then its respectful to let them finish clearing it the next day... although not a rule.<br />
<br />
However if a guild is just killing aary for loot or whatever i see NP with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seconds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, usually ntov is a 2 day thing, for my guild at least, because we are mostly a during the week raiding guild, so most times we dont start till late and by the time we get passed eashen/iki/aary we usually go one way, clear that side then the next day do the other side trips and nev. <br />
<br />
it is common courtsey to leave it alone, but we have had guilds come up behind us and do the other side =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Torv had been on rotation for a long time - NToV is now first come first serve for Aary - kill aary and ntov is yours for a couple days.  We only have about 3 or 4 guilds at this point that are really into the NToV thing - as a matter of fact Aary had been up almost a week when my guild killed her recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you are on Xev though then yes the rule is first to kill Aary gets N.ToV till Aary respawns. Generally effective for keeping the peace in there, but hasn't stopped a few people from poaching dragons occasionaly &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OR ELSE.  What are you gonna do if they want to do NToV and Aaryonar isn't up?  Send them angry tells?<br />

<br />
if you ask me, that is what makes high end guild raiding not fun, people doing what they want. let's say your guild is raiding potime and there are seven other guilds potime able, wouldn't you set up some sort of rotation to make sure everyone gets some raid time? i hope you wouldn't just charge forward whever you feel like it.<br />
<br />
call me crazy but i think people should learn some ettiquette before they leave crushbone/start raiding.<br />
<br />
oh and what could they do? well what do most guilds do, whine, bitch, complain, train, send nasty petitions and all around unpleasantry. look at RA and Triton, cockblocking and training just because of competition.<br />
<br />
Ntov may be a big step for a guild, but they should take a step towards decency if they want to do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">as most said.  aary is one of hte harder mobs in Ntov and the gatekeeper.  if you cant kill aary you cant get to the other dragons.  So basicly its respecting the other guilds and saying dont go to Ntov till you have earned it via killing aary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">On Xev, the &quot;gentleman's agreement&quot; is that if you're the guild to kill Aaryonar, you have NToV to yourself for 3 days. It's similar to the previous agreement about no-one ever killing all four warders in Sleeper's Tomb.<br />
<br />
Of course, the other guilds have no way of enforcing that really, (much as they had no way of stopping Hawkestone waking the Sleeper) but it's a respect thing. If you break the agreement you'll not be popular among guilds, and this *does* have consequences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">NToV is a free for all .... veeshan &gt; your server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Aary is a piece of cake compared to a bad flurry drake pull for most guilds I'd imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Roy is historically the gatekeeper for guilds that want to compete in NToV. For some, that zone may be old and passe, but for many up and comers it's still a major thing. I know it was for mine when we were there. My suggestion would be to send tell to an officer of a guild tha tyou know regularly does NToV and ask what the deal is. Charging in during someone else's turn, at least on CT, will result in every rotation guild motivating at light speed and stealing the whole place from you, along with them all being pissed at you to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aary is an intense learning exp for most guilds just going into NToV for the first time. <br />
<br />
However, once Aary is down, most of the rest of the mobs in NToV are pretty easy by comparison. And for guilds just getting there, the loot is nice.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is a game of bottlenecks. NToV in Velious. Ssra/VT in Luclin. And now Time in PoP. I dont know why SoE keeps making this same mistake over and over. They could easily make multiple zones with similar loot that are all limited to having passed some specific test(s) or mob kills, and open things up. And I am certain that they could also setup a system where you could only do one of the zones per week. But they dont. So you end up with guilds cockblocking, racing and training each other, and players hating each other for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks for all the feed back posting this thread to my guild and guess they will make the choice. .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Rodcet at least is a FFA server.  REALLY FFA.  It's down to &quot;First aggro gets the first shot at the mob&quot; at times.  There are guild-to-guild agreements, but nothing server wide.  <br />
<br />
About the only common rule is &quot;let the mob regen to 100% if the other guy wipes, if reasonably practical to do so, before killing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
If Aaryonar's dead, and whoever killed him left dragons up, go and kill them.  Accept that this is natural, and it will save you stress for the time you kill Aaryonar, and some other guild does it to you.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, we just did a pick up NTov raid last night.. and in there we killed Aary so I guess that means that we get the rest of NToV till the next rotation... WOOT.<br />
<br />
hehe.. anyways... it was fun, and I've never been to there so it was interesting.  Problem was that aary wasn't where she was supposed to be and ended up almost wiping us the first time.... and then after we recovered (somehow a cleric and a mage didn't keep agro with her and kept themselves alive) she decided to go over there and mate with Fesh... was pretty funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this happened to us about 2 weeks ago. Except Aary was w/ Lord Kriez.  We sent a monk to pull all the drakes to aarys pit that I tagged to pull down the stairs into the hall before the pit.  It ended up costing us about an extra 30-45 min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Teddey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you learn nothing else from this thread, you learned that each server is different.  Find out what, if any, the agreements are on your server and try your best to stick to them.  If you want to break them, feel free to do so, but just be aware of the consequences (they aren't 100% obvious, but your entire guild will have a slightly harder time LFG, for example).</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is why Rallos rules was probably the best idea for a server. The threat of losing an item and wasted time fighting would eventually end the training, sending nasty tells and otherwise ill mannered actions.  Pvp rules would either force people to play fairly or face the consequence of losing an item (which btw i think should include no drop items.. meaning if they had no drop items, you should be able to destroy them instead of looting one of their other items).  I think the threat of losing an uber bp/fungi etc would be enough for people to play nice, because who would want to lose an item that took days to get?<br />
<br />
I remember playing on Tarew Marr, which was my first server, and seeing monks train other groups in the kael arena and going ***? and its not like you can do anything about it.  Its not like the guy gets banned and if he does who cares? his friends powerlevel his new character to 60 in a week anyways.  Thats why its so much more fun on Sullon, because the only people to train u, you can attempt to kill =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">A couple months ago my guild was seriously stalled, couldn't kill RZ and many members decided to &quot;take breaks&quot; or quit EQ, dropping our numbers down to maybe 25-30 at peak times.  Obv it was impossible to consider PoP targets of any worth, so we messed around killing targets that we hadn't done in a long time.  Some ST key dragons got owned a few times, Sontalak went down to 19-20 people a few times and ppl got keys who didn't have em.  We recruited more folks and got them lower tier flags.  We raided NTOV on a limited basis, just for kicks and for cheap upgrades for recruits (from non-raid guilds).  All this was just to keep ourselves busy.  Far as I know, we didn't get much smack talked at us for slumming it.  It was interesting to see DtD go down with one (twink)cleric, one druid, and me for healers.  Wow, oh and a ranger as MA.  LOL that was a fun (but close) fight with 11 people.  Then Aary was whacked with 16 people, two of them clerics, and our 11th best warrior tanking.  <br />
<br />
I guess the point is, these mobs aren't that difficult since PoP came out.  They especially aren't hard with nice gear to lean on.  NToV is more of a FFA on my server, but I do believe the guilds that do it a lot figure it out between themselves.  If they squabble with each other over it, nobody cares/notices because for those of us in the elementals, it's funny to see people fight over gear our twinks wouldn't even loot. <br />
<br />
My guild was the third on server to enter NToV and kill Roy, after several failed attempts.  After that, we farmed it for some time, having won the right to be there.  We did have problems with the 4th best guild stepping on our toes a bit tho.  After we killed Roy a couple times, they would shadow us and go the way that we didn't go.  It pissed us off to see how cheesy they were acting.  But in the long run, whatever.  It's just a ****ing game.  <br />
<br />
O btw, my guild got it back together and now we own RZ anytime we want to.  And life is good with elemental access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">hah, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Its far from a matter of respect, its simply a matter of &quot;My guild can kill Aaryonar so all the loots are ours and nobody else's!&quot; Greed. Go into NToV if you want regardless of aary being despawned, its not like the Selfish Police are going to come stop you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">On my server, The Rathe, we have a rotation system for most raid-level targets.  There are some that are FFA, but the majority of raid-level targets require you to perform some action to get on the rotation.  <br />
<br />
In the case of NTOV, you need to kill Aaryonar.  Once you do, you are on the rotation and you have a certain amount of time to clear NTOV every time your turn comes up (my guild is not yet on that rotation; soon though).  <br />
<br />
The rotation system is quite nice, actually, in that it gives everyne a chance at the highly contested targets.  There are still enough FFA targets to fight, though, that you never have trouble finding something to raid.  At first I was not entirely sold on the idea, but I've since seen that the guilds on the rotation already are generally very nice about letting you attempt a rotation target (it is considered common courtesy on our server to ask permission of the guild that is currently up in the rotation -- you technically do not have to, but its a nice thing to do).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">At one point I'd imagine some sort of rules / agreements existed on a lot of servers.  Right now, it really doesn't matter that much, because there is buyable gear better than a lot of NToV drops, and things easier to obtain (bot / tactics minis, etc).  Not to mention 1-2 pickup groups walk in and kill things anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">We have a &quot;First to get there, buff and pull&quot; mentality on my server, highly competitive.

Not when Union of Power was in NToV on Rodcet, which was between six months and a year ago.  We respected other guilds' Aary kills and gave them NToV for 3 days and they did the same for us (mostly).</div></div><hr />

<br />
We do have some rather nice guilds - and I'll agree that UoP belongs in that list, at least I've never had any issues with you lot - we also have some guilds who will train through a prepping raid party to get to something.  I won't bring up one name or another because server drama doesn't belong here; the fact remains that we don't have any kind of calendar system that's followed by any significant percentage of guilds; ergo we're a first-to-mob server.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">As pointed out before, Xev has Aary on FiF, and then 2-3 days for you to clear the zone.  The agreement has been shaken lately when an elemental guild group decided to have fun and take out Aary without any intention to clear the rest, but it looks like that was an exception.<br />
My guild is one of the guilds currently taking NToV if we find Aary, even when a lot of the weapons go to bots and apps, some of the stuff is still decent (/rude Jorl, where is my sprinkler), especially for our newer members.  It's a lot of drops that can give you a quicker guild upgrade then killing yet another BoT tower boss.<br />
Plus I think the &quot;raid training&quot; you can do there is amazing, where else can you do a dozen different AoE mobs in a day? So I hope the &quot;NToV agreement&quot; will last a while longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">hah, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

<br />
Actually, it's called cooperation and it makes EQ a lot more enjoyable for most people.  Rotations on linear zones like NToV and VT is pretty common and benefits all guilds involved.  So long as the up and coming guilds are given a fair shot at entering the rotation, it's in their own best interest to abide by the rules for entry into that rotation.  Reason for that primarily is that if you piss off the rotation guilds that are obviously already capable of keeping the spawns dead, then you'll end up being cockblocked out of the zone.  <br />
<br />
NToV rotations are common because it's a pain in the ass to clear all the yard trash, or at least it was.  Clearing the entire zone within a 2 dayish timespan is also in the best interests of a rotation so that the respawn isn't spread over a week and the next guild can get in and get it done with on as few raid nights as necessary.  Clearing all the flurry drakes and other assorted trash to get to Jorlleag and Nev isn't something most guilds would want to do.  At least not when there should be several other dragons in between to break up the monotony.<br />
<br />
FFA on linear content just makes for massive headaches for everyone.</div></div><hr />
