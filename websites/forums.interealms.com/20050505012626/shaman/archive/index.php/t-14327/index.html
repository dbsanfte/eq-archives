<br />
No. Not a single spell is droping inside Veksar.<br />
<br />
I tried to petition on the test server before Veksar went live and asked for help in this board to all shamans... but you know.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have heard that the Malo/Torp research items have been dropping in Veskar though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No spells, but we've picked up 6 to 10 various research things from exploring there.  Not sure which ones are required for malo/torpor, but there's a good bet of it, some 60+ mobs in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you zone in... get to the first gobbies.. there's a fence, on the other side, there's nobles (blue to 62), Highborn (blue to 62, and my most intense solo yet... very hard), and Highborn Commanders (yellow to 62, didn't try soloing lol...).<br />
<br />
There's also animated fingers... Grandmaster golems with crystal looking staffs, and so forth around that area.  To get there, go the only path, and when you get to the golem area, hug wall to the right till you reach some undead Shop Keepers and Store Clerks... there's a named at the end of the building, and a hole that you can jump down, to get to the aforementioned area with ubah mobs.<br />
<br />
Helluvafun place imo... I like how there's ramps that lead right back to the ent, even if you're 45 min deep into exploring.</div></div><hr />

I can solo dragons, slay gods, but can't cut my way through a damn chickenwire fence to get to the other side in Veksar! <br />
<br />
Other than that, it's a nice place though. :) Veksar and some of the LoY zones have kinda restored my faith that SOE actually remembers how to design anythng but boring outdoor zones. Haven't seen a single spell drop there to answer the original question, and we've definitely killed some mobs over 60th lvl.</div></div><hr />
