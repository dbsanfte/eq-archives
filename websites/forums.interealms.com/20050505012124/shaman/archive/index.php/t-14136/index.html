<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finaly got the motivation to camp some shards, so i head down to AC thinking i can solo for 40 50 min before bed. I looked it up here and search brought up a thread saying that the skull crackers on the sliding white gate drop the shards. so i went right from zone and second left and just as i get there some friends showed up and tell me that the drop spot was revamped and bring me deeper in AC where we clicked on a statue and it warped us to another area. cleared the bottom floor and no shard, i didnt stay long, but...<br />
<br />
is this the right place? Honestly i thought it was past where the supposed skullcracker camp was and on the staircase leading up to the building in the next room.<br />
<br />
Any advice appreciated. Thnx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, just spent alot of time here ) <br />
<br />
Yes, you click on the statue into IA, where there are Sanctum mobs. The shard is fairly random, we had two drop in one clear of the warlords room, and then again in the hallway outside, but *after* close to three hours, then wham bam three. Tonight, went again and second mob after clickin statue, dropped shard. So your in right area, just takes a bit of time unless ya get lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just did this camp for my shaman a few weeks ago. I got the shard for my main prior to the changes to AC. The shard camp has indeed moved to Inner Acrylia. Kill &quot;A Sanctum Bloodguard,&quot; I've seen a few drop from them and don't recall seeing (or hearing about) them dropping from any other beast in the area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BTW, the zoneout in IA is upstairs in the Cauldron chamber.  Click the blue tapestry on the wall and you zone out to Grimling Forest, right outside the cave.  There's a zoneout downstairs too, but I don't remember where ATM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep.  That's the spot.  Once inside Inner Acrylia, we camped in a small room right next to the jail room.  It took about 3-4 hours to get three shards.<br />
<br />
I went there with a friend who duo boxes a cleric/warrior.  For the first pull, he was in between the 2 jail cell and when he pulled we ended up with 4 or 5 mobs total.  With the cleric and I root parking, we somehow survived with no deaths and killed all of them.  So, don't pull from right between the 2 jail cells unless you are ready to have a real fight on your hands.<br />

has some good info on the drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yup im using that in compilation with the safehouses thread.<br />
<br />
Going to try FG today i think, going to try to solo just for kicks then head to seru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So what's the deal with the Inner Acrylia part of that zone?  I haven't been there because I haven't got a key to it.  Is a key needed still?  What's the deal?  It worth going there to hunt at 65?  Blues still?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well, i didnt have a key , so if you and I are on the same page of where i was, then no, i guess you dont need a key. where i was there was a mix of dark blue and light blue, basicly me and my mage friend made 22% AA in about 3 clearings of the 1st floor where we were. I dont think we were there even 2 hours and it was most vertainly casual with alot of joking and goofing off followed by power slaughtering. With the Exp changes coming itll certinaly be a more rewarding camp for quiet soloing, though im quite sure itll not hold a candle to PoP. <br />
<br />
Ill say this, if you need to camp Ore then this might be the spot, got ALOT of ore drops and some no drop things that we couldnt find what they belonged to, could be some nice quests /shrug. If i had to farm Ore this would be a nice spot to hit up some AA while im doing it, kinda like now NG in seb was at 61ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No key needed anymore, altho SoE has said to keep the key if you had, for it *might* at some point serve a purpose but at this time they dont know what. Lol, SOE at their finest eh? And as for SS shard, or katta altho getting it in katta is a bit harder, I found that the OBS (observatory) in Sanctus is the best way to go (in my experience). We took a group up there  one day and did a circle, the mobs are fairly easy and you will notice less chealin/loh'in mobs there, and we had three drop in two hours.  If you don't know where it is, its easy. Go straight out from the DS zone till it opens up, follow the right wall a few feet and click on the little window looking thing, will take ya right up there. Also, very nice pp drops here unless they changed it, rng 4-19p a pop lol )</div></div><hr />

Ssra temple is annoying to get.  Best thing to do is get your whole guild out there and do AE pulls to clear the whole mine in minimal time.  Get the melees there too for banes.<br />
<br />
Deep is easy to get.  It's just getting there that's the annoying part.  Estimate a 30-60 minute crawl to get across the bridge to the good shard droppers based on whether you have a full group, or are just doing with a single melee.  With a full group clearing the horrors, estimate about 1 shard per half hour to an hour.<br />
<br />
FG can be easy or can be annoying.  If you've hunted in POP, going back to kill the bugs in FG will make you laugh at how sissy those level 60 mobs are.  I was there yesterday with a level 61 bard who needed the shard, and I brought along a level 51 shadowknight to tank for us and soak up xp.  LOL.  Estimate about 1-6 hours per shard here with a full group.  Quite variable time frame.<br />
<br />
Sseru shard is annoying to camp too.  I've seen people try for them down on main floor, but never seen a shard drop there ever.  I always camped them up on the 2nd floor.  Unfortunately the pathing up there is BAD and your pet is useless cuz he'll 32k too often unless you have summon companion memmed at all times.  Estimate hours of camping this solo.<br />
<br />
DSP is really easy to get.  What you might want to do is bind near the rockhopper caves, buff up all the noobs who are killing them anyway for xp, and ask if anyone can let you loot.  Do that while you are nearby in sseru doing that shard.  When a shard drops in dsp, you can gate out to loot up and reward the noobs with whatever you want for the help.  This shard drops often.  Estimate no more than about 2 or 3 hours to see one or more drop.<br />
<br />
Akheva is pretty easy to get as well.  Any rock or cloak mob can drop them.  They have a decent amount of hps, but are easy solos.  Bring some help for more dps if you can to save time.  Estimate about 1-3 hours per shard with a full group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A 65 sk, 65 shaman, and I (62 shaman) managed to get 2 luclin shards in 30 minutes just by clearing to the area where levitation is dropped.   Who knows, maybe we got lucky, but its proof that you dont have to go all the way across the bridge just to be able to get them</div></div><hr />
