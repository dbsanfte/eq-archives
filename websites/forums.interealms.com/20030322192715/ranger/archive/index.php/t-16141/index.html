<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aono</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sup, my first time posting so ill make it quick :p <br />
<br />
Im 33 and looking for some soloing spots, hopefully without having to fearkite, i prefer to straight melee fight.<br />
<br />
Is there any spots like this around or am i just asking for the impossible?</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the Glade!!<br />
<br />
Non fearkite eh? Hmm Marus Seru, Splitpaw, Highkeep?<br />
<br />
I did the fearkiting in Dawnshrouds route, took me thru a good number of levels quite fast, might be something to check into ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">South Karana is another option. You might be OK in Crystal Caverns, but it's tough until 35 or so.</div></div><hr />

33-40 group in Overthere or possibly solo Orcs in Crystal Caverns (more of a high 30's thing)<br />
40-50 group in Dreadlands or CC geo's<br />
50-55 group in Sebs or KC<br />
55+ group in Pop<br />
<br />
there my friend, is the fast grouping route<br />
<br />
oh, and<br />

<br />
And the only reason i dont do fear kiting is because i lag in zones like DSP, so it takes quite long with all the pauses and losing the mob, etc. I hope to get a new video card soon, so i may try fear kiting again when i dont lag quite as bad.<br />
<br />
Tryed CC orcs, but they hit far too hard for low 30s i think, maybe when im a bit higher.<br />
<br />
Ill try Mars Seru again and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wayrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For soloing options I would have to say go to Stonebrunt.  A nice out of the way place and easy to XP once you figure it out.  The animals in the upper peaks give great XP and drop minor gems as well from time to time.  Granted fear kiting will make this go much faster for you.  This will take you 40 if you really want to push it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would also have to say Stonebrunt would be my suggestion, for fear-kiting.  Tons of animals.  You could also try drakkel wolves in GD, but be wary of where you do your kiting as it's easy to get adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daeric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'll throw my 2 cents in for Stonebrunt.... never more than 5 people there and it's a huge zone. Easy access now with PoP. Tons of animals, and it's an old world zone, so lag isn't a problem at all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Morgani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think I did stone brunt  at this level.  Just know where to run to zone and you will be fine.</div></div><hr />
