<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I enjoy playing my shaman, or atleast I used to.He is still fairly powerfull in some aspects, but he has lost a lot of his luster due to recent events and such.. A lot of what has been posted here has spilled over into the game and I hear a lot of gripes moans and tons of bitching IC.  It even went so far as to cause seven of the high end shaman to leave my guild leaving us with only 2..Ack!..So, for the time being I have switched my attentions over to my Ogre SK, they have a few problems but are incredibly fun to play.  I may check back here from time to time to see whats up with any new info, but for the most part I think I will stick with my SK.. I remember the simple days as a up and comming Shaman when I had comparable DPS, nifty dots, cheesy nukes, and a helpfull slow... If shaman are going to get eventually relegated to being a healer then I will stick with my SK, maybe even dable with a Necro..I wont delete my toon, but he will probably gather some dust for a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What happens on the boards stays on the boards with me.  IG, I will always find something to do, even if it is tradeskilling.  Spraggon is always online when I play and that will never change (with the exception of alt trader on that account :D).  It sucks to see alot of veteran Shaman leaving good Guilds, but theres not much you can do.  If you are down to 2 Shaman, it would make sense to now be one of the 2 mains and stick with him now IMO.<br />
<br />
Although, even with the trend of soooo many leaving, Guilds aren't exactly lining up to take Shaman apps.  Here is something kinda interesting to try:  /who all Shaman 1 50<br />
<br />
Not many people making new Shaman on Bristlebane, can tell you that right now :(<br />

Have fun with your SK.  Loved mine; truly a fun class.</div></div><hr />
