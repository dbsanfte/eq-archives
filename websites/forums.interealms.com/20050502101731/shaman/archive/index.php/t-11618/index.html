<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in a guild that raids 7 days a week.  I log in after work to find a raid already forming almost every day.  We are at the ntov/sleepers/ssraa stage -we dont do much in PoP.  We have multiple shaman at every raid, most of us have mgb.  When I exp, frequently I am the only healer in the group -sometimes the only caster in the group.<br />
<br />
I dinged 60 the night before PoP release, with 1 aa (run 1).  I just hit 65 last night with run 3, metabolism 3 (I use a horse), mental clarity 3, canni V, MGB, radiant cure 1.<br />
<br />
Where should I go from here with my aa?</div></div><hr />

Prolly spell casting mastery to save you a lot of mana or maybe for natural durability if your  a hp freak or want to make your magelo look better. =p Oh yea spell casting reinforcement is an option too, it makes buffs last longer and can increase the healing power of torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">where ever you want, at this point you have the KEY ones and it all depends on your play time and what sounds like fun.  personaly i went ND3 then qb1-2 scr2 and now doing CA.... but SCM is very good also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the mana savings from getting scm are unreal, id recommend ya get that next. scr is great because all buffs last alot longer, and i hate rebuffing. natural durability is nice too, takes more beating to kill ya, anything that gives you more hps is good in my eyes. and quickbuff is great because you can cast torpor/quiesc much faster =&gt; saving your butt easier.</div></div><hr />
