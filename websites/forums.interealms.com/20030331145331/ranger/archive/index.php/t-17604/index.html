<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The issue is Brells Mountainous Barrier (&quot;BMB&quot;) vs. Strength of Tunare (&quot;SoT&quot;) vs. Spiritual Vigor (&quot;SV), three nice buffs that don't stack.  I am trying to get a definitive strategy worked out for my guild to incorporate SV (we have our first Beastlord applicant).<br />
<br />
My take is that ideal buffs would be the following:<br />
<br />
SoT (125HP, 60ATK, duration 1 hour) for those who want max ATK and don't care so much about max HP (rogues, rangers mostly... unless they are using Gob Earring as clicky, it won't stack.)<br />
<br />
Spiritual Vigor (225 HP, 40 ATK, duration 1 hour 12 mins) for everyone else (unless they are using Gob Earring as clicky, it won't stack.) (I guess monk's epic effect won't stack either)<br />
<br />
*except* <br />
<br />
BMB (225HP, duration 2 hours 30 min) for Clerics (YaulpV bounces off SV and SoT).<br />
<br />
BUT-- all are group buffs -- and (from what I have gathered):<br />
<br />
BMB overwrites SoT, SoT bounces off BMB<br />
BMB overwrites SV, SV overwrites BMB<br />
SOT overwrites SV, SV bounces off SoT<br />
<br />
At one point on a recent raid most of my group had BMB, which was overwritten by SV, which was overwritten by SoT... my entire group had SoT for a while, involuntarily. The difference in HP doesn't make or break the raid but it was irritating. <br />
<br />
For the life of me I cannot figure out a logical buff order that would satsify everyone.... including rebuffing when people die, and rebuffing when various buffs wear off (all have different durations). <br />
<br />
In practice, I usually try to get folks to ask for SV, and single-target the clerics with Divine Strength so as not to overwrite any SoT's in the group. But, with only one beastlord on the raid, and the relatively short duration of SV, folks do ask me for Brells, leading to annoyed SoT users :(<br />
<br />
Two questions:<br />
<br />
Is my interpretation of the overwrite/bounce order correct? I can't see a way to check this using Lucy.<br />
<br />
How do you folks handle it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my guild the way we handle it is to not bother buffing with Brells.  The tanks generally prefer the extra ATK from SoT, and the casters individually request Divine Strength if they really think they need it.  We don't have a beastlord.... yet!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Main tank, pure casters any anyone else who needs max hp (shaman, necros) should get Brells. ATK freaks (rogues, monks, rangers) get SoT. SV should be done on request.<br />
Make groups accordingly.<br />
This is just my OPINION. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ainozama</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guild does not have a high level BST so we have not had this issue often.<br />
Generally we let the Pally's do BMB on everyone and have the ones that want SOT just cancel BMB before we go down the raid list with SOT.<br />
<br />
I do wish they would make em all bounce though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">in my guild we just chatise the pallys and tell them to delete BMB from their books cause it's a useless buff, SV is the same hp + atk, and SoT is lower hp but even more atk, none of our pallies yet have the 65 brells yet.<br />
<br />
verant really needs to stop with all these stupid expantions (see LoY) and fix crap that needs to be right now like the spell stacking issues, brells, SV, and SoT should mutualy bounce off each other and never overwrite each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BMB is not totally useless. SV has some stacking issues, most notably with cleric's mana-regen YaulpV but also with the most commonly-owned instaclick item and the monk's epic effect, and it also has a relatively short duration.  <br />
<br />
Lots of people expressly ask me for Brells for those reasons, even though I try to encourage them to use SV.<br />
<br />
As Ainozama  noted, this wasn't an issue until we got a BST applicant. For the most part, the rangers and paladins in my guild were easily capable of taking care of SoT vs. Brells requests.  SV is where things get messy, because of overwriting issues.<br />
<br />
I agree with the last poster that a simple change (making all three hybrid buffs bounce off each other) would be most welcome. I intend to start /feedbacking it regularly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well clerics I could almost see, though i've never seen a cleric seriously use yalp cause it isn't usefull, they just use it when fooling around, all the ones in my guild just use SV, and any monk that would use their epic over SV/SoT + SoV should be smacked, they gain nothing from doing so and they lose a lot of atk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good luck,  I think I've been feedbacking that one for awhile.<br />
<br />
It will only get worse once your paladins get the 65 brells. That is alot of hitpoints to sacrifice in some of these insane aoe encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm slowly getting my guild to use SoT for ALL melee, and Brell's for only casters. Last NToV raid I got soo many tells for SoT, it was a real surprise. 2 months ago they were like 'SoT? What's that?' I even rarely got CoP requests. I'm not sure what changed, but i'm pleased.<br />
<br />
Ah, bliss...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was talking with Corean and Ojuillean (I think) the other day.  They were like &quot;Wish they'd give us a 2 hour long archery buff.&quot; and I looked through my AA list selections and told them &quot;Spell Casting Reinforcement 3 - Have your Strength of Tunare buffs last ten times as long as they normally would, but still get overwriten just as easily from paladins blindly casting BMB everywhere they see a person!&quot;<br />
<br />
On a side note, I'm for getting the EQ Devs to make buffs bounce off each other like this.  Especially when I'm asked by a monk or rogue for SoT, and a minute later they go &quot;STUPID PALADINS!!&quot; and as for it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rashgaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Um why not compair BMB to SoN huh?  Your compairing a level 62 spell to a level 60 spell.  How about BSS, which i think is like 400hp instead of compairing BMB.  That would be compairing the top in that line of spells instead the top in Strength of XXX versus bottom in Brells XXX XXX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Buffing made easy.<br />
<br />
Random_Paladin_01 tells the raid, 'MGB BSS inc now.'<br />
10 seconds later...<br />
Random_Ranger_01 tells the raid, 'MGB SoT inc now, click off BSS if you want SoT!'<br />
<br />
It's nice to have Mass Group Buff.<br />
<br />
Edited cause I was a dummy stupidhead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>luterin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Beastlords don't get MGB I thought...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nift Trailhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No BL do not get MGB and also the problem is even those that want BMB will lose it when they buff it since SV and BMB overwrite each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dalantia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">How we do buffing is I run through all the groups and buff away, putting the highest level ranger in the guild on /ignore for the next 10 minutes so I don't have to endure his screaming, and then anyone that dies/isn't there gets to live with it.<br />
<br />
I will not delete BMB, I will not memorize Divine Strength.  BMB lasts 3 hours, so I can fire and forget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The main problem with paladins is they don't often say anything.  If you do speak up before BMB/BSS, then god bless you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dalantia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oh, I do.<br />
<br />
10 seconds before I start casting it on group 1:  &quot;Brelling the rangers, be ready&quot;.  Yes, it's just a euphmism.  I go down every group leader and cast the spell; we use /raid, which makes it easy.<br />
<br />
The only SoT capable ranger in the guild lets loose a flow of invective about how badly BMB sucks, etc, after I call that I'm doing it.<br />
<br />
If he would group with only damage dealers, I'd overlook his group.  :p  But he's grouped with priests and casters, so I fire, once I have him on ignore.  10 minutes later, I take him off ^_^<br />
<br />
Works quite well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I hate paladins that cast BMB...Divine Strength is just as good...we've trained our guild paladins to use that instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dalantia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">grrr.<br />
<br />
NO, it is NOT.<br />
<br />
DS lasts an hour.  BMB lasts three.  DS is 200 HP.  BMB is 225.  Take what you can get.<br />
<br />
DS = suck.<br />
<br />
BMB = good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ueauvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">bmb or bss cast first<br />
then as someone says all the melee except mt sa click off and get sot, sv never in the equation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Celestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There isn't really a problem<br />
<br />
Paladins should BSS all groups that have classes that want it first. Then rangers will ask for /tells from the people that need SoT, they can click the evil pink heart off and the ranger can buff them while it bounces off the people in their group that want to keep BSS.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants the BST buff they can /disband, ask for the buff, and rejoin their group.<br />
<br />
But it is true that this buffing stuff is dumb, it should either ALL bounce off eachother, or BSS should just overwrite SoT and the BST buff both (that's what I would prefer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Samanthie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I am in the same boat as Hunter Ueauvan Steinfiller .  We do Pally BMB and then do SoT by exception</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think what everyone means to say.....SoT is THE buff to use....sure, you can get Brells and SV but SoT is the most universally used spell for raids and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dalantia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I know rangers that prefer BMB, CoTP, and CoE to WP ^_^</div></div><hr />
