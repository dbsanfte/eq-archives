<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goodbrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have 178 Wis, and using a pair of 6 Wis rings.<br />
<br />
Should I replace them with 6ac 65hp rings?<br />
<br />
Drops Wis down to 166.   :( <br />
<br />
Although, I melee quite heavily, and have gear more related to this.<br />
Using Iksar regen bp, REIF, and SCHW...so trying to decide which pair of rings is more important. <br />
<br />
Although when we get lvl 24, it seems that we should not worry so much about having a super high WIS, b/c we can regen our mana pool quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
See if you can pick up a Shadel Bandit Ring (6ac, 55 hp, 55 mana, 10 sv disease) if you're worried about mana pool.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At level 20 I had a total of 90 wis.  I didnt have 6ac 65hps rings or +6wis rings.  If I remember rightly I was wearing dervish cutthroat rings.  By level 24 I had upgraded to Jagged bands.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is I could solo well enough without them.  If you feel any concern about dropping your wisdom a bit, whilst you can afford the sort of gear you are referring to, I'd worry about your tactics not your gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goodbrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well...i've been playing for 2 years, and spent alot of time bartering in nFP.   :p <br />
<br />
i could never decide on a char until I played a shaman.  I love it!  So, that is the only reason I can afford this gear.<br />
<br />
I've read all about root/rot, canni dance, and other tactics....this board is invaluable for that type of info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At your level the hps will probably do you much more good then a the fairly small amount of mana you are getting from 12 wisdom (100ish?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">according to the mana calculator on casters realm, you have 752 mana with 178 wis and 708 mana with 166 wis.  48 mana?  vs 130 hit points?  130 hit points is good at level *60* let alone level 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">May I ask what you're going to do with a whopping 48 extra mana?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goodbrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">not much with 48 mana...an extra SoW.  hehe<br />
<br />
thanks for all the info, everyone!  (except taladaen)<br />
<br />
will stick to 6ac 65hp rings, for obvious reasons.</div></div><hr />
