<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I just got into Chardok for the first time and to my surprise a 57 Beastlord is taking pretty much all the dogs til the castle.  So I decide to see if there is anything else to kill so I invis up and run around being careful to /con everything.  I soon come upon another ramp with even more dogs.  Unfortunately there is only one spawn that won't aggro more dogs or sarnaks.  So I root slow and Ebolt and plague.  THen I sit and canni dance and repeat til dead.  I usually have about 60%-80% mana left over after the fight.  So I sit and med and I am fm, but unfortunately no other spawns for me to pull without being owned.<br />
<br />
So what I am asking is there a better area to solo in Chardok besides the zone in and this one lonesome zone out?  Have in mind that I am only level 51 without JBB or Epic so basically very un-uber.  Any help would be appreciated thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're a little low to be soloing there, to be honest. I would get a few more levels then try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm ok then.  I suppose I will try Temple in CoM I have been hearing good things about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah you can't single pull there until 57.<br />
<br />
at 56 i was able to single pull the two that are next down from the exit by pushing my bear butt into the corner opposite the exit and pulling with slow. <br />
<br />
you might try to pull with slow from long range but callir may be right that you are too low for singles there.<br />
<br />
com is a nice place though. another place that was good at 51 for me was echo caverns on the side that leads to the deep. both the dorfs (mmm tasty) and taskmaster spawn were pretty easy and the zone has an ok zem.<br />
<br />
good luck.</div></div><hr />
