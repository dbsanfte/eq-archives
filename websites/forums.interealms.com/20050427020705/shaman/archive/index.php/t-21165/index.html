<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if people have tried GoD at these levels and how is the exp if so.    Don't hear much about these levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinokenshin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GoD is meant for Time or near Time enabled people. Or just people who know what the hell they are doing. Or have alot of experience, or phat lewt.<br />
<br />
GoD = Level 65s+<br />
<br />

There are lots of Mobs in Nedaria's landing that were green to me at 59. I was curious about what level they are, how tough they are for their level and what the zem is. Anyone ever level there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kinokenshin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh.. that kind of stuff...<br />
/hide<br />
Don't know, sorry about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But for the stuff directly at the zone in into Natimbi most mobs hit for 300+ double.  Unless you are PLed by a couple of 65 clerics I would not try that at level 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i could see a well-geared traditional twink group getting some fun exp in natimbi.<br />
or a less geared group being just as successful agro kiting, i see sub-50 druids and wizards kiting at the natimbi port-in often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Eh...some of the stuff at the zone in to Natimbi does not hit that hard. At 46ish I was grouping with a 56 Druid friend of mine and hunting the reef crustacean (sp?), stonemites, and turepta cragwalkers. The crag walkers hit the hardest from what I remember and they only hit me max for 106 damage.<br />
<br />
Of course I was not tanking them...most root rotting with the Druid but I think I would have noticed that much damage at 46ish. But I also had no problem standing still for a moment to reapply a dot or root. In fact I do not think I ever got below 80% health even with some canning.<br />
<br />
One mistake alot of people make is that they pick on a named Cragwalker called a fierce cragwalker...it is much higher than the others....does double or quad for about 250 I think and summons.<br />
<br />
A lot of people face the fierce cragwalker do not know it is a named and figure all of them are that mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you avoid the named you can do well there, but not solo.<br />
I went there 55ish and could solo but it was long and tough.<br />
<br />
A group can take out Craigwalkers, stonemites and spirits but avoid spikey dog looking things, muramites and named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hynids?<br />
<br />
My friend and I took out a couple of those too.<br />
<br />
Maybe they nerfed them and made them easier with the Natimbi changes they made a couple of months ago.<br />
<br />
My Druid friend solo'ed the non-named in about 3-5 mins. And together a 45 Shaman (finally remember the level I was then) a 56 Druid took them down with ease in about 2mins...with the occasional stonemite add. They being Hynids, Turepta Cragwalkers, Reef Crustaeceans, and Stonemites at the Natimbi port in point.<br />
<br />
Personally given the difference between Druid and Shaman dots I am thinking I could solo one of the normal cragwalkers at 49. Was going to try in the next couple of days. Of course I would take the extra precaution of having KEI and V on but with those and self buffed I don't think there will be any problem.<br />
<br />
But I could be wrong. I will let you know.<br />
<br />
Once again I would not touch the fierce cragwalker that is just asking for trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK....did not have much time last night but went to Natimbi.<br />
<br />
Got a KEI and a MGBed Bot9 in PoK but no Kazad or V.<br />
<br />
Ran there...self buffed with IoS, Altuna, STR, STA, AGI, DEX, AC, etc...no rage though.<br />
<br />
Took a minute because the fierce was up so I pulled a stonemite instead. Was pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Slow, dot, dot, root, heal, heal (mainly got to 70% heath a couple of times) dot, root, slow, dot, dot, root...<br />
<br />
Took about 3-5 mins per kill...got about half a blue ot three quarter of a blue per kill...never went below 50m except when I pull a couple in a row because I was leaving.<br />
<br />
Looks like most of them have about 6k of hp from the looks of it.<br />
<br />
I would wait until 49 because you get EB and plague which help a lot.</div></div><hr />
