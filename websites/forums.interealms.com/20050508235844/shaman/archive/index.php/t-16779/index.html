<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yah it sucks<br />
<br />
I agree BL's should have slow, with any skill in the game there needs to be multiple classes who have the ability.<br />
<br />
The way forming groups work, it would suck if you could only rely on one class to give you slows. Especially if you had a full group, your rdy to go and you can't find a (tank, dps, mezzer, puller, healer, slower)<br />
(insert needed class)<br />
<br />
But I do agree, why BL's are given a faster casting slow boggles my mind.<br />
<br />
65% slow fine I'll live with it<br />
<br />
at 65 better - 65 takes a while to get to, 50% slow from 60-65 is still pretty dam good.<br />
<br />
Cast time better than ours on their best slow? hmmmm<br />
<br />
<br />
After all is said and done, I've never lost a group to a BL, anyone who knows how to play their Shaman properly can be main slower, back up healer, root parker and plus add dps.<br />
<br />
Something a BL can't do.<br />

I'm sure this topic has been beat to death.</div></div><hr />

Something a BL can't do.<br />
<br />
Sorry if my quote was taken out of context, I mean't the BL cannot bring ALL of those things to a group, while a shaman can.<br />
<br />
I mean't Shamans bring a very nice &quot;skill set&quot; to a group. <br />
<br />
And no I am not knocking BL's they bring a different skill set, it just depends what you need.<br />
<br />
Like I said its important to have a little class overlap, as you build a group from who's lfg you can mix and match as needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reasons why they are better then us..............<br />
<br />
-They have faster slows (which also seem to resist less then ours) <br />
-They put out alot more dps then us.<br />
-They have an awsome pet with innate duel wield.<br />
-They have great defensive skills (we have none)<br />
-They have a super hp/mana quick regen AA. (we have no healing type AA)<br />
-They have a form of clarity.<br />
<br />
Our small small advantages over Beastlords............<br />
<br />
-We have better heals (although our small 1300 heal really cannot do much to save anyone anyhow anymore)<br />
-We have upgrades to Beastlord buffs (although people would much rather have a mana/hp buff then an extra 100 hp)<br />
-Our dots put out more dmg then Beastlords (Dots are useless anyhow in a group, considering the agro, and the time it takes for our dots to work)<br />
-We have Cann5, to get back all the mana we lost when the mobs resist all our slows and dots.<br />
<br />
Although, you have probably figured this out anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hybrids all get innate spell haste on certain spells.<br />
<br />
Specifically, all Detrimental spells with a base cast time of 3.0 or higher.<br />

<br />
1300 point heal on its own isnt much, but get a ImpHeal4 item, add some Healing Adept AAs and ist now a 1600 to 1700 point heal.  Get some Healing Gift AAs and it becomes the 3k+ heal that happens to keep your tank alive when a cleric in your chain goes LD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't agree.<br />
<br />
There are countless times that I have been the glue that has kept the group alive or together. I have had people groan when I said that I had to log.<br />
<br />
Sorry people simply don't react that way when BL's leave groups.<br />
<br />
I am lvl 56 so maybe things are different at 65 when they get their infamous 65% slow.<br />
<br />
But I have found that when the crap hits the fan and 3-4 mobs are incoming, BL's can only handle 2 of them.<br />
<br />
I can root park, and I excell at it.<br />
<br />
I can throw heals around.<br />
<br />
Shamans save groups from wiping, BL's don't.</div></div><hr />

Well Beastlords rock the house but really they are a DPS class who can slow if need be and we are a utility class who can heal if need be. Certainly normal level LDON allows both classes to do either role much easier than previously so we are competing for group slots more and more.<br />
<br />
As someone posted above we stack together like peas and carrots (thank goodness or we might be in trouble getting groups in LDON normal to be honest).  I think the above list of shaman and beastlord pro's and cons is pretty good, but lets look at things in a bit greater detail assuming a main healer is in the group.<br />
<br />
Since shaman buffs can be purchased lets put that advantage aside for a minute. Shaman bring about 1/3 the dps of the beastlord - maybe 1/2 if shaman has full DD's aa's focus item and is nuking like a madman (me, lol).<br />
<br />
For arguments sake lets say FA, which is a 10% increase in melee damage is about equal to paragon and beasty crack (fair enough I think in melee heavy groups) but a bit light in other configs.<br />
<br />
That still leaves shaman with 1/2 less dps (at a minimum) and only emergency healing and slightly better slows to make up the difference.  Are these two things worth 1/2 less dps?<br />
<br />
Well, I think that a beastlord who can quickly slow everything, never run out of mana and who can get back to meleeing fast is probably bringing a bit more to normal LDON than even a high aa shaman.  But I would suggest that those beastlords who can do it all are few and far between.  I just don't think they have the same experience at multi-tasking as the long time shaman.<br />
<br />
Additionally, when a group has a druid healer our Q for the druid is huge and allows them to nuke.  That probably evens things up.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Beastlords are currently a better jackofalltrades than Shaman are, and the Shaman class was really made to be a jack...<br />
<br />
It's as simple as that.<br />
<br />
Luckily, if you go to randomzone001 and ask 100 people who they would rather have in a group, Shaman or Beastlord, I'd say about 90 of them will still say shaman. It isnt public news yet that beastlords work better alot of the time.<br />
<br />
I do agree that we need some AA's or spells to improve us. Maybe a lvl 65 upgrade to Turgurs, same slow % (75% is right on the buzzer) but with a resist modifier (not lure), or with a lesser casting time.</div></div><hr />

OK what the heck I have 10 minutes before I'm going out, I have to respond.<br />
<br />
- faster slows? who cares? If MA has agro don't matter to me, as a properly played shaman I wait until the mob is at roughly 90% health so I DON'T take agro. I start casting at 95% you start casting at 92% big deal - result is same.<br />
<br />
And if your taking agro from your MA, your playing your toon wrong.<br />
<br />
- yes they do put out more dps than us - and they should, because we mitigate damage much better than them, we have better slows, better heals - its called balance. <br />
<br />
But when I want to lay on the dots, mobs go down fast. <br />
<br />
- they get an awesome pet - yup they do, we get Spirit Call<br />
one of the COOLEST AA's in the game imo<br />
<br />
Woot - Release the Hounds! Freak I love this AA<br />
<br />
- they have awesome defensive aa skills - yup and they should their melee, we get root. Which I prefer, I simply love root. Root allows me to take on multiples of mobs, which allows me to actually enjoy playing.<br />
<br />
I like playing a class that can CC well. That's just me. When it hits the fan I'm indispensible. BL's cannot root park a mob and slow it to be killed later. <br />
<br />
- they have a super mana and hp regen<br />
<br />
Well you mentioned Canni, it's a superior mana regen because I can get alot back in a smaller portion of time. We get a 25 hp regen group buff in spell form. So why we need a regen aa? <br />
<br />
- they have a form of clarity - and yes I agree this buff rocks, but I buy kei and pot9 and I'm good to go. <br />
<br />
So as I said both classes different depending on what you need, but I would hardly say BL is better. Different and better in some situations. As we are different and better in other situations, like a previous poster said, we partner well, like peas and carrots.<br />
<br />
You mentioned canni 5 and needing it because of resists and running out of mana. yah that's exactly what it is for. Resists suck, all casters have to worry about resists, but we get malaise, and in general casters are stronger than melee. <br />
<br />
I'm not arguing BL's aren't good, I think BL's are great, shaman just aren't as bad as u make em out to be. And I think they are a very viable class. <br />
<br />
I don't enjoy playing BL's, everyone raves about them, but I have found them to be like cray paper without their pet. Almost like rangers.<br />
<br />
As a BL I found myself running if my pet bit it, as a shaman I just root it and kill it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">as a properly played shaman I wait until the mob is at roughly 90% health so I DON'T take agro<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't, I'm not made of glass and afraid of getting hit. I slow on incoming more often than not, and I can't remember the last time i died doing it. In spots where I need to slow multiples faster i simply mem the 39 slow and alternate between them to offset the recast times. Something which, incidentally, allows me to slow multiples faster and still(70% and 75%) better than a beastlord ever could.</div></div><hr />

Most (though not all of course) of us would rephrase your statements as follows :<br />

should be :<br />
as a Druman who has yet to get out of leather Wisdom gear and into something with some AC and HP on it, I wait until the mob is at roughly 90% health so I DON'T take agro.<br />
<br />
andAnd if your taking agro from your MA, your playing your toon wrong<br />
should read:<br />
And if your taking agro from your MA, your MA is a warrior without a Taunt weapon.</div></div><hr />

I can take anyone else and be a group a bst will still need a healer. Between Q and tnargs i'm always the healer for mine and my friends groups for exping and they run out of mana before i do. Anyway far as i'm debating the grass is always greener........think i like my own yard just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Most MA's don't like mobs running around.<br />
<br />
So most shaman typically wait til MA has established agro until they slow mobs.<br />
<br />
I'm saying most not all.<br />
<br />
Why you wouldnt wait for MA to establish agro is between you and your group/guild mates.<br />
<br />
I would think that after a while they would tend to think you have a rather large chip on your shoulder or that you don't know what your doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Mobs dont need to run around in an exp group. I stand right in the tanks pocket and can slow on inc if i want. Mob may hit me once it may not but it doesnt bounce around because of me. Now i say CAN i change my ways If i need too but slowing doesnt have to equal ping pong. Dont sit a block away and med and try to slow ( this isnt pointed at anyone) from a distance no reason for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Heh, stand next to the MA, slow on inc every time.  So what if it gets resisted, I have ~5000 HP and ~1160 AC group-buffed, and I'm in average gear.<br />
<br />
As far as beastlords...<br />
<br />
From what I see on this boards, people play up their advantages and play down their disadvantages a little much.  I'll probably end up doing the same thing myself:<br />
<br />
Slow, interestingly enough, is a non-issue between shamans and BLs.  65% slow *is* good enough in 99% of cases.  Most clerics in groups these days have the mana regen to melee at least some of the time anyway, or even nuke, so who cares if they have to heal an infinitesimal amount more.<br />
<br />
Regen is also a non-issue.  15 hp/tick, 25 hp/tick, who cares about the difference?  Only the shaman, because no one else has canni, so they're full health most of the time anyway.<br />
<br />
Defensive abilities - shamans and BLs are very very close to each other in defensive ability once LR5/ID5 is in play.  We mitigate better, they avoid better and have more damage avoidance abilities than us.<br />
<br />
DPS - this is one of the two primary issues between the two classes.  BLs outclass us in this category with both hands tied behind their backs, missing both legs, and oom.<br />
<br />
Healing - the second of the two primary issues.  Shamans are better at this.  A *lot* better.  Between Torpor/Q and Tnarg's, and the proper AAs, we can keep people alive as well as a cleric in many circumstances.  Remember how badly your healing sucked at level 55?  That's how BLs heal.  Not even a comparison here.<br />
<br />
Abilities added to the group - almost a non-issue, but in the BL's favor, because of SD.  Shamans have better stat buffs, but BL's have a huge HP/mana regen buff.  Really, in most cases, neither case makes much of a difference.<br />
<br />
Would I take a BL over a shaman if I was building a group with, say, my monk?  It depends on the class makeup.  If I have a druid for a healer, I'd probably prefer the shaman.  If I have a cleric, probably a beastlord.  Beastlords are a very good class, but, like another poster said, I haven't been losing any groups to them.<br />
<br />
One last thing to keep in mind:  the beastlord 65% slow is level 65.  That means glyphed rune word, which means you'll run across a fair number of level 65 BLs who don't have it (well, at least, you used to, but it's still prohibitively expensive).  Their 50% slow doesn't even compare to ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Bah Tiorr!<br />
&quot;I don't enjoy playing BL's, everyone raves about them, but I have found them to be like cray paper without their pet. Almost like rangers&quot;<br />
<br />
  ACTUALLY Beastlords can only wear leather, so they crumple much quicker then rangers.<br />
 Lets not bring ranger bashing into this now, my main is a ranger.  I also play a shaman and a beastlord.  I would not take my beastlord into a bad dungeon, I'd take my shaman.  It's true what Tiorr said there, Shamans can CC much much better then the BL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It seems as if there is a bit of a controversy here.  Some of you are talking about end game characters, and some of you are talking about people that just hit 65.  <br />
My guild is in plane of time, and have been in there for a long time.  My posts are about end game characters, so the way that people play are different.  Which means the usefullness of a class in a group are different.<br />
In all honesty, what most people look for in an end game group, especially for LDON, is a cleric and dps.  I have seen groups with out even a slower for LDON, although it is a little harder on the cleric, but has been done many times.<br />
So if you figure it, what would be better with a high dps class that has slow?<br />
<br />
And i dont know how much you have experianced end game players, but the BL can midigate more dmg then Shaman.  They also have more hp, and just as high AC as us, especially because leather drops the most in PoTime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sadly, I'd just give it some more time until beastlords are wanted over shaman. It's the way this game has progressed.<br />
<br />
Clerics are being over taken by druids.<br />
Monks and rogues being taken over by beasts and rangers.<br />
Wizards being contested by mages.<br />
Warriors by paladins and shadowknights.<br />
<br />
While right now shaman are preferred to be slower, just give it some time when more twinklords are in their mid 50s+ and more people are seeing how insanely overpowered the beastlord is.<br />
<br />
All in good time will the shaman be subordinate to a beast. 'Tis a sad way of life for EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The beastlord class has some strengths and some weaknesses.  It is meaningless to say that one class is overall better than another, or more desirable, since everything is so situational, but people should realize that on message boards everyone tends to focus on the good of their class and ignore the bad. <br />
<br />
So, Shaman strengths/weaknesses:<br />
<br />
1) slow = excellent<br />
2) healing = above average (quiessence, tnargs, kraggs, various healing AA abilities)<br />
3) crowd control = above average (various roots, including a disease based root with knockback)<br />
4) burst damage = average (poison and cold based nukes only; not very efficient, but offset by our mana regen)<br />
5) damage over times = excellent (poison, disease, and curse based damage over time spells)<br />
6) debufffing = excellent (unresistable debuffs for disease and for everything but disease)<br />
7) buffing = excellent (shaman buffs use very few buff slots, and generally do more for weaker characters than a beastlord can)<br />
<br />
So, Beastlord strengths/weaknesses:<br />
<br />
1) slow = excellent (at 65, with rune dropped spell) and average until then<br />
2) healing = average (chloroblast)<br />
3) crowd control = bad (pet can off-tank one mob, if it doesn't decide to just attack whatever is hitting the beastlord anyway)<br />
4) burst damage = above average (fast casting nukes, not very efficient, but if you have a mana bar you might as well use it)<br />
5) damage over times = average (beastlords get some of the poison based damage over time spells from shaman, and some of their own)<br />
6) debufffing = bad (no debuffs AT ALL except through randomly proccing weapons like the tash stick)<br />
7) sustained melee dps = excellent (the beastlord and the pet together both contribute excellent dps)<br />
8) bufing = above average (beastlords can contribute enough in the way of buffs to satisfy pretty much anyone, despite having to use alot of buff slots to do it)<br />
<br />
Now, looking at all that, can you say one is &quot;better&quot; than the other?  Only if you know the situation that you will find yourself in.<br />
<br />
For the moment, though, you can rest easy in the fact that beastlords have a HUGE public relations problem.  People a) have little idea what they can do and b) get really annoyed when beastlords are constantly talking about how good they are :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">In LDoN, I undoubtably lose groups to BLs.  Even amongst friends and the guild I'm recruiting with, the joke is constantly, &quot;Well, I guess since BL so and so went ld... we can get you.&quot;  Our lack of high sustained dps on successive multiple targets would be the reason why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Comparing shamans to BL's is just not a relevant comparison IMHO. They both have slow, and the similarity stops right there. Otherwise, the classes are radically different, whether BL's are a &quot;shaman hybrid&quot; or not. <br />
<br />
First, a sub L-65 comparison: My L 58 shaman is far more wanted for adventures than any BL his level, and will continue to be so regardless of however many BL twinks there are. Why? I can do two things BL's cannot - Heal, and CC. Those are both hugely important roles, far more important than DPS.  DPS is what you grab for your group when you already have all the classes that make it WORK. People want me in their groups to be the healer (especially now that I hit 58). They want me to be the CC, since there is almost never a LFG enchanter without a gorup.  Sure, if you have a cleric and an enchanter you might prefer a BL to a shaman, but most of my groups lack both of those classes. And they take me, and win their adventures. <br />
<br />
It's funny, I group with all these people who talk about how bad their won/loss ratio is on adventures - often below 50%. But my shaman only has one failure, and that when a faulty router was making me go LD every 10 minutes. <br />
<br />
Before the uber end game, shamans outshine beastlords clearly. DPS is something almost any class can do. We do much more important things than DPS. <br />
<br />
Now, if you want to talk about L 65's with hundreds of AA's and elemental/time gear doing normal adventures... then, yeah, maybe a BL is better. Because you are SLUMMING something seriously and fighting trivial monsters. You need little healing. You don't need CC. You don't care how many you pull at once.  You just mow through everything as fast as possible. When you're talking about the functional equivalent of farming greens, then, yes, a shaman is not an optimal class. Unless, of course, the shaman is in the healer role instead of a cleric. Why not take the shaman as healer and dump the irrelevant, even lower DPS cleric, since it's so easy? And when those people do hard adventures, they'll likely want the shaman over the BL again. <br />
<br />
Here's a thought, although it probably won't work well for the people in those PoTime-geared guilds. Find some friends to play with who don't care that they'll do a normal adventure in 34 minutes with you instead of 31 minutes with the beastlord. When you're finishing THAT FAST, it takes a special kind of powergamer to really care about the difference.</div></div><hr />

My main is a ranger as well,<br />

So I speak from personal experience. Sorry no bashing intended, just my personal feelings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The way I see it, a BL can substitute a Shaman for slow, but then you need to add a healer, druid (some dps ability), Cleric or maybe depend on paladin healing? In either case in my opinion (keeping in mind I am somewhat biased) wouldn't it be smarter to have the shaman as single healer/slower (or nuker, normal difficulty hardly demands slow, more likely need some nukes besides tossing Q around).<br />
Anyway lunch time, keep your BST fear, I am not scared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I don't really fear beastlords, it is just that a 1.9sec cast seems for me unjustified.<br />
They are hybrids, so in theory, they should be less specialized in magic than us ( in power and in casting ). Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">They get an innate spell haste, and the ability to cast between melee swings, but to counter that, they also get a hybrid mana penalty (spells cost them more mana to cast than their parent casting class), and typically have much less mana. We also have a much higher mana regen rate than them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">faster slows? who cares? If MA has agro don't matter to me, as a properly played shaman I wait until the mob is at roughly 90% health so I DON'T take agro. I start casting at 95% you start casting at 92% big deal - result is same.<br />
<br />
I disagree.  As a properly played shaman you should vary when you slow depending on situation: there's no golden rule.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
If a puller brings back 4 typical LDoN mobs I'll slow as quickly as I can.  If the puller is bringing back a raid boss mob Ill slow like I'm made of glass.<br />
<br />
In the first of these cases I'd say a 1.9 secs casting slow would be very nice to have.  In the second its almost irrelevent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The percentage might be 10%, but the actually percentage in damage taken is a lot higher keep in mind:<br />
<br />
(making the assumption that the slow has the same effect as reducing the amount of damage per hit)<br />
<br />
75% slow vs 1k hitting mob.....250 damage<br />
<br />
65% slow vs 1k hitting mob.....350 damage<br />
<br />
almost 30% difference in damage taken.<br />
<br />
This does add up, enough to change people's minds about bst slow? Probably not, it's still not THAT much different, just wanted to point that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">&quot;I disagree. As a properly played shaman you should vary when you slow depending on situation: there's no golden rule.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fact is your right, I didn't list out every circumstance that a shaman will slow.<br />
<br />
I simply don't have the time to write out 3 page responses to forum posts to cover every concieable situation that a shaman encounters.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is not every pull brings in multiple mobs. In fact most don't. Most pulls are controlled pulls.<br />
<br />
OR maybe my guild is different. We have a highly organized quild that is doing some tier 5 bosses. Perhaps other guilds work differently. I honestly don't know I have never raided with other guilds.<br />
<br />
I slow in groups the same way as I do in raids, well thought out and organized. I stand by the ma, cast debuff, let ma take agro and then slow. Usually the mob is around 90% by the time I do this.<br />
<br />
Rarely do I take agro because of this.<br />
<br />
I get compliments all the time on how well I slow and how well I play my shaman.<br />
<br />
I'm really in no rush to get my slow off. So a BL's cast time on his slow just doesn't seem to bother me. Maybe I'm missing something? Maybe I should start crying too?<br />
<br />
And yes you are 100% correct, when pulling multiples I will slow assist, switch, pull with slow and root park. I know I mentioned root parking in an earlier post, but maybe you didn't see it.<br />
<br />
Now having said all that...<br />
<br />
If you are zerging ldon adv's which seems to be standard fare for a melee's point of view. Hack and slash, bring em all in. <br />
<br />
I would prefer a shaman over anyone. <br />
<br />
In fact the first class to build a group from would be a shaman. <br />
And I would add from that.<br />
<br />
Since your zerging and bringing in multiples a shaman can take hits well.<br />
He can slow adds and root park them<br />
He can throw around heals as needed<br />
He can haste and buff the dps<br />
<br />
A druid can heal but not slow, he can root park<br />
A cleric can heal but not slow, he can root park<br />
A chanter cannot heal, but can slow, he can mez park<br />
A BL cannot heal well, can slow very well at 65 but can't root park more than one mob. BUT is an excellent dps class to compensate for this.<br />
A shaman can heal, slow and root park<br />
<br />
So I would prefer a shaman in a zerging group. And it would be the first class that I would look for.<br />
The BL would be one of the 5 that made up the dps.<br />
<br />
The BL could not and would not replace me. Because our function and utility is quite different. <br />
<br />
If it was up to me I would have both a BL and a Shaman in the group, but thats just because I'm a little bit smarter than the average bear.<br />
<br />
<br />
So there, not quite 3 pages but I've got to go to work now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Tiorr,<br />
 Im sorry but I think you play way to slow. If you are that worried about getting hit by anything less than a boss mob or maybe elemental mobs you might wanna relook your gear.<br />
<br />
Im running 170AA, HPs 5k plus self buff only, 1450 plus AC and well over a 5k mana pool unbuffed (I say this to give a point of refrence only).... I have zero trouble tanking anything short of an elemental mob for the whole fight and I can tank elemental  adequatly till someone else gets agro.<br />
<br />
More often than not its just outright easier to park the mob with my agro rather than watch it bounce all over waiting for a sub-time geared melee to get agro.<br />
<br />
Ok Im probably not representative of most shaman in the game &quot;gear wise&quot; but I cant believe that there is that big a diff from readily available &quot;Ornate&quot; lvl gear to &quot;Elemental&quot; lvl gear.<br />
<br />
Slow first ask questions later, but waiting till 90% to slow is a little over kill, to me regardless of your &quot;situations&quot;...<br />
<br />
And who ever was talking about &quot;End Game&quot; BST was dead on, they will replace a Shaman every time and twice on tuesday. Time lvl BST are exactly what thier name implies beasts... they will out DPS all but ele boss equiped monks and throw a pet in they can out DPS even them, they can heal without worry of mana cost, and tank better tan anyone but a plate class melee.<br />
<br />
Thank god there arent many bst at all, and an even smaller amount of Time lvl ones (for now)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find some of this hard to believe. First of all... you're implying that a time level BST can outdamage anyone but a monk - without their pet. I assume that this is just a severe exaggeration? How is BST damage good, if you don't count their pet? Seems like it'd be fairly lousy, due to their low Double attack skill (available through AA's). My impression of BST melee ability is that they get bard melee, with perhaps a bit better weapons (and maybe not even that, in a time-level guild). How is that wrong? Certainly, adding their pet in ups their damage into the high end DPS classes, but what's special about their damage without it? <br />
<br />
On their healing  - how much can they actually heal, and why don't they care about the mana cost? Or are you just referring to a group that is FAR outpowering its opponents, so virtually no healing is required anyway? I don't see how BSTS are capable healers. As far as I can tell they get a 9 mana/hp a tick regen spell and roughly ranger-level healing capability.  What changes when you get Time-level gear to let them heal worth a damn? <br />
<br />
Finally, why do they tank so well? Or are you just referring to their ability to slow, and assuming that, when you're comparing to other classes, the BST is tanking a 65% slowed mob and the other class is tanking an unslowed mob? <br />
<br />
It seems like all these claims are substantially exaggerated. If they're not, what changes to make BSTS so powerful in all these areas? Because in my experience they aren't, pre-elemental planes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The -Insert second melee class here- in your group COULD take the hits too, but oddly enough people get grumpy if they do so and are not the MT.<br />
<br />
Shaman get away with pulling aggro because they can heal themselves and they can &quot;hide&quot; behind the claim that slow has high aggro and they have no choice.<br />
<br />
So yay, bully for you, you can handle a mob beating on you ... you rock ... so can my enchanter ... but does it help or hinder the party for this to be happening to you?<br />
<br />
You wait an extra X secs on slowing for the MT to firmly establish aggro and what does it cost the group?  The cleric fires off their FIRST CH a few seconds earlier, essentially costing them a fraction of the cost of CH.  Hell, wait the extra X time on slowing the mob and drop a Quiescence on the MT instead of yourself.  It will have better bang for your buck on the MT and save the Cleric that initial fraction of a CH.<br />
<br />
The MT uses aggro for a variety of things, not the least of which is positioning the mob and when he does not have it because Shaman_01 refused to wait 3 more seconds before casting slow it is a hassle.<br />
<br />
The thing is most people do not realize that shaman actually do have a choice about pulling aggro or not ... perhaps if they did, things would be different.<br />
<br />
Always nice to group with a shaman that does not pull aggro on every mob, things are cleaner and easier.<br />

For LDoN, my BST is the primary and only slower in 95% of the groups I am in, which are typically all level 65 characters except my BST.  They want my BST even when I tell groups I can bring a 65 SHM if we need it.  I have asked several people why they want a BST as primary slower.  The answer is DPS.  The mobs don't hit that hard in LDoN, and a 50% slow is sufficient (yes I don't even have the 65% slow yet since I am not yet level 65).  I can slow while my pet is beating on mobs and doing decent damage.  I rarely get resisted in LDoN even without a MaloX type debuff.  For me, my shaman is in semi-retirement because when I go LFG and list a 64 BST or 65 SHM, my BST gets the call the majority of time.  However, this pertains only to LDoN.  For PoP groups, my SHM wins out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Many of you are right, it all depends on the situation.  <br />
But in the end, what we are ALL looking for is just how much we can offer (our need) in groups.<br />
Ever since Beasts have been introduced into EQ, shaman have been pushed aside even more just because of the similarities and what they offer to an end game group.  <br />
<br />
After talking to GMs in the Chicago FF,  it seems that they think Shaman are very balanced, have plenty to offer, and will NOT be changed.<br />
<br />
 :confused: I guess, its now time to decide, if you want to continue playing a class that will never get improved, or investing in another class.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Waiting to slow defeats the purpose of slowing.  You would be better off nuking.  The only thing a shaman should consider waiting to do is waiting to lay dots on that mez'd mob.  If you know where to stand when slowing and your tank knows where to pull the mobs to, there is no reason to avoid aggro.  Waiting to slow = more damage to the tank = more likelihood of cleric getting CH aggro = more likelihood that things go to pot in a hurry on big pulls.  Situations vary the tactics but, what else are you gong to do for those 10 seconds of cowering from aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">1. Malo the mob (If needed)<br />
2. Quiescence the MT<br />
3. Slow the mob<br />
<br />
Drop the Quiescence on the MT that you would be casting on yourself due to the slow aggro.  It is more efficient on the MT anyway since it will likely all get used and the MT will mitigate damage better than you will.<br />
<br />
Drop a malo on the mob to enable others to cast easier (if needed).<br />
<br />
Then slow.<br />
<br />
By the time you do this your slow will land without pulling aggro and it is really not that different from the:<br />
<br />
1. Slow the mob<br />
2. Quiescence the Shaman<br />
3. Malo the mob (If needed)<br />
<br />
Except of course only the MT gets hit which is more efficient for the group.<br />
<br />
If you are fighting a mob that absolutely has to be slowed or it will waste the MT then it will also absolutely waste the shaman even with slow up without assistance from the cleric.  Which places you right back at the situation where it is better to wait and not draw aggro if at all possible.<br />
<br />
There are times and places where you have to slow early but they are much rarer than the &quot;every pull&quot; scenario that many shamans follow.<br />
<br />
As for the question of what you should be doing for those first 10 seconds ... how about you do what everyone else is doing?  Waiting until the MT secures aggro before casting ... or of course you could Drop a HoT on the MT and Malo the mob or Canni IV.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Zanithar,<br />
<br />
Most people have their own playstyle, which variest from situation to situation, but in LDoN I generally:<br />
<br />
1.  Stand beside the MT and slow on inc. <br />
2.  Don't Q anyone.<br />
3.  Don't malos anything.<br />
<br />
If the MT is a PAL/SK I may not get hit at all.  If the MT is a warrior, I will get hit a few times but almost never will I get hit enough to make me actually feel the need to cast a heal on myself.  <br />
<br />
After a few repeats of this, my health may be at 80 percent or 70 percent -- and thats fine.  I'll cast a Q then, or Canni5 and then cast a Q.<br />
<br />
The mobs just dont hit hard enough to make me feel the need to go out of my way to avoid the 2 or 3 seconds of agro that I might get.  <br />
<br />
If I am grouped with a cleric that does not use his own HoTs, I'll cast Q on the bank every fight (after the mob is slowed) to help the cleric keep up on mana (or rather free them up for doing DPS, lol) but if they use their own HoTs then I'll just focus on slowing/DPS.<br />
<br />
All that being said, lately I've been using Tigir's Insects alot (the AE slow) and liking my results with that.  It casts slowly, but hitting 4 targets at once is pretty nice.  It has a built in hate reduction, as well, so I usually don't get agro (or if I do its not any worse than I'd normally get).<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying is that you need to roll with the punches.  There will never be a One True Way to play your shaman; you'll do what needs to be done in any given situation.</div></div><hr />

Now as an enchanter for sure I would not slow on incoming, that would be stupid.  But most shaman that post on these boards follow a few simple rules, one of which is to stand next to the MT when slowing on incoming.

I am debuffing the mob so other casters can land their spells easier, ie: dd's<br />
<br />
And please the &quot;cowering&quot; comment is not necessary, Shaman who wait for ma assist, are working within a well disciplined group. <br />
<br />

One or the other,<br />

Either the game is trivial in which case I should be able to have a valid opinion without playing the class or the game requires some skill/experience in which case your &quot;rocket scientist&quot; sarcasm fails.<br />

Fortunately for me, I duo box a 65 enchanter and a 65 shaman so suddenly I can have an opinion!  Yay Me!  I find playing 2 buffing/debuffing class keeps me awake :)<br />
