<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the past couple of days I have been trying to use the LDON merchants to no avail.  Every time I click on the merchant, it causes EQ to crash.  <br />
<br />
Troubleshooting so far:<br />
<br />
Restarted computer several times<br />
Tried EQ in:  EQwin, WinEQ, Regular EQ<br />
Tried all models on<br />
Tried all models off<br />
Full file scan<br />
Petition..no answer yet<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  The adventure recruiters work fine, just the merchants seem broken for me.<br />
<br />
I have the 1400gloves augmented that I want to sell back since I have better now and want to buy the HP augs.  <br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the tip, I'll try to load the default and give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">one of my guildees is having the same problems.  I'm honestly not sure how he's fixed that.. or got around it (or if he even has).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its more than custom UI's.  Ive tried with the default and it still happens to me.  For me its the Merchants in SRo, EC, and EF.  I can use BB and Nro without problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No seriously this is a problem ive had a couple of times but everytime its happened ive gone back into EQ and its been fine so i just assumed its one of this little EQ bugs we get now and then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's currently a post on the eqlive tech support about this, and I'm having the problem as well.  I never crash, ever.  Yet right clicking any ldon merchant instantly crashes me.<br />
<br />
I do use a custom UI, so I'll try the standard and see if its better, but I'm doubtful.  The only changes I have are 4 specific windows, not a full UI makeover.<br />
<br />
edit:  Loaded the default and it worked fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For now, mine seems to be my UI.  I loaded the default one and could trade with the LDON merchants.  Then could load up the regular one.  Slight pain, but nothing too bad.  Whatever it is, is something recent.  I have used this UI for a long time and have never had a problem.  I think this last patch broke it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've been having the same problem. I use Aruman's UI with a different set of buff windows and a different target ring,<br />
<br />
Everytime I click on an LDON merchant I crash. However if I load up the defualt UI it works fine. I have no idea what is causing it so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This happened to me 2 times this morning, I use a custom UI also.  I'll go back later and see if changing to default will help.</div></div><hr />
