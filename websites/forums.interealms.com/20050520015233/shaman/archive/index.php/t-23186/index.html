We had a ranger in our group and were doing fine, but we inevitably started killing wolves..He got serriously miffed and threatened to log, said it was a faction thing.. Is this true..Should rangers not kill wolves, and if so, what other sorts of animals shouls I avoid killing when grouping with a ranger?</div></div><hr />

If they dont give a faction hit message when you off a couple, then he has nothing to worry about. Unless hes doing it for RP reasons, thats a whole other issue LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rangers (and beastlords, druids etc) aren't KOS to the wolves in DSP.  Don't think there's a faction hit.<br />
<br />
If he's doing it to RP more power to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Been a while here.  But as i recall the ranja's start off all nice nice with the animals. But you can skewer that by killin' the animals and therefor lose a very fav solo spot. ( JP ) My sister lived fer that zone ;)<br />
<br />
no clue if animal faction in dsp effects jp.  I'd assume it does though . .. &quot;makes sense&quot; to me.</div></div><hr />

AFAIK if there is no visible faction hit then there is no effect on any faction.  The &quot;Rangers/Druids may not kill animals&quot; thing is a urban myth, I believe.<br />
<br />
That does not not mean that I feel comfortable with killing animals when on my Ranger or Druid. But that is RP then and I have never experienced problems with animals even though I have killed alot of them for tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Even though there is no faction message, you will lose faction with the wolves if you kill them.  You will become KoS to them if you kill them, over time.  Seen it personally with my Beastlord in DSP.</div></div><hr />

This is the first I've seen of this.  Invisible faction hits?  I PL'ed my ranger in DPS on anything that moved.  I spent from 23 to 30ish there, and killed many, many wolves.  My shaman was always KoS (though they wouldnt attack unless I was sitting) and my ranger was amiable from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Jaggedpine is another story, but thats the only zone that I know of that wolves have a faction hit.</div></div><hr />

I heard they're making the centi longsword lore.</div></div><hr />

Thats true, and my wizard has noticed that his Jboots are slower than usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">fungis will be nodrop as of next patch.. better sell em now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">uhm, there is evidence i would have on animal faction hits without a faction message.<br />
<br />
first, when mobs jump in pvp fights to assist, if you have only killed skellys and get in a fight with someone that has killed wolves and bears, those wolves and bears will assit you.  ya, we are talking about lvl 4 here but it helps.<br />
<br />
also, if you go and kill a crap load of bears in the Karanas, you can lower your druid ring faction.  <br />
<br />
and that i know of there is no way to fix it.  killing the poachers and gobbos in JaggedPine does not fix basic 'animal' faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can kill wolves w/o getting faction hits.  I leveled there for quite some time and even now wolves will attack my shaman but not me when running through DSPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Western antonica tends to have animal factions, not necessarily all zones but in general it does.  This would include surefall and qeynos areas and maybe the karana's.  <br />
<br />
The rumors about animal faction in most other places are because people who rolled up characters over in the qeynos/surefall area were told by their guildmaster and the faction messages not to kill animals.   Most rangers/druids assume it applies everywhere but it doesn't.  <br />
<br />
How many druid tailors would you find if they couldn't kill animals?   Not very many! :-)</div></div><hr />
