<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this issue has been &quot;resolved&quot;, but I would like to humbly submit an interesting experience I had over the weekend.<br />
<br />
I'm in West TOV farming armor. I am one of 2 shamans on the raid. We are both lvl 60. The other shaman has Malo and I do not. So our strategy was, he casts/announces malo, we both cast Malosini till it sticks, then we both cast slow till it sticks, then we both cast cripple till it sticks. Throw a little delay in the casting to try to manage aggro  and let the other guy use his mana. Perhaps a little inefficient, but hey, that's why we have Canni/Torpor right?<br />
<br />
Here is how the first 20 dragons or so went:<br />
Garek: a fiery defender has MALO<br />
ME: Malosini resisted<br />
Me: Malosini resisted<br />
Me: Malosini resisted<br />
Garek: a fiery defender has MALOSINI<br />
Me: Turgurs resisted<br />
Me: Turgurs resisted<br />
Garek: a fiery defender is SLOWED<br />
Me: Cripple resisted<br />
Greak: a fiery defender is CRIPPLED<br />
Me: Sigh. <br />
<br />
It was rather remarkable. I would land spells from time to time, but I was getting resisted easily 75% of the time. Garek was not having that problem at all. Mob after mob came and went and the other shaman was basically debuffing them by himself. We compared notes and couldn't find any differences in what we were doing that would account for the difference. <br />
<br />
On a whim, I cast Charisma on me. My charisma in resist gear was 60. After buffing, it was over 110 or so. My resist rate dropped DRASTICALLY. My resist rate dropped to maybe 25%. I had little trouble getting spells to stick from there on.<br />
<br />
As a mathematician, I know full well that my unlogged impressions of my resists hardly constitutes proof. But it was more than enough to convince me. Against normal exp-grind mobs, I don't have trouble with resists anyway, but against these high-end mobs I will definitely be looking my shining lizardly best. <br />
<br />
Just something to think about,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You go through good and bad streaks, I really don't think it has anything to do with your charisma per se. Maybe just the fact that you had another buff threw the random generator in another direction and you got on a good streak. Trolls or Iksars would be the worst Shaman if Charisma mattered and that is patently not the case. I've been side by side with a troll slowing stuff in TOV and sometimes he would nail every one and other times he would end up green slime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Malo is unresistable.  It lowers all saves by 45.  Malosini is resistable, and lowers all saves by 60.  Cast unresistable debuff to lower, then the best debuff, to have a better chance of landing slow.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Sorry, both Malo and Malosini debuff fire/cold/magic/poison, NOT disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Malo is unresistable. It lowers all saves by 45. Malosini is resistable, and lowers all saves by 60.

<br />
right.....but since both malosini and slow are based on magic resistance check, you have the same chance of landing either one. i thought the common tactic is shaman malo, enc do tash, bard do occlud at about the same time, then mag do their malasini while shaman do slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">mages should be making rods and doing nothing else!!! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I generally will cast malosini after malo/tash/oos if I get more than 2 turgurs resists. I stay alive longer that way. After 3 turgurs resists, Generally the mob wants to have me for lunch, malosini doesnt have much agro to it even when resisted, as compared to turgurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As I've said before, my cha is around 60ish and one of my fellow shaman is a troll with a much lower base cha who is also wearing an eye of CT (what is that, minus 25 cha?)<br />
<br />
He consistently slows faster than I do, his luck with the RNG is so good, I want to take him to Vegas.<br />
<br />
Don't forget, the R in RNG stands for random.  Sometimes, you get good streaks, sometimes you get bad streaks, but it's random.<br />
<br />
But sure, if you have the buff space and the mana, buff cha, who cares?  Personally, I'm fighting for every bit of buff real estate, constantly clicking off Dance of the Blades or begging rangers for Force of Nature.</div></div><hr />

I brought cha up in the serverwide.crucible channel and everyone promptly shut up. :)   My logs show an 18% drop in resists once my cha is over 110.  On the otherhand, to quote Jemandar - 'My 49 charisma is a testament that its useless'.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">CHA is worthless for anything but lower vendor prices...<br />
<br />
or is it?  I know for the longest time, even Enchanters and Necros were having arguments that CHA was useless.<br />
<br />
I know I've always believed it, but this is posted over on the Druid's Grove  (shhh...don't tell them a shaman has been over there :) )<br />
<br />
<br />
Fan Faire discussion:<br />
It was confirmed that CHA plays a very important role in all Mezz spells... and necroes have their own CHA-mezz table which makes it easier for them to mezz despite their lower CHA than chanters/bards.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno what to think, and how this affects the current discussion, if at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would resist the notion simply on the principle that if it is found to be more than merely negligable, that's one more buff we have to worry about during raids.  Imagine having to put the casters on a buff timer as well, yuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Demann: &quot;hmmm why are you guys casting malosini before slow?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's called aggro management.<br />
<br />
I've found sini before turgur pretty wise in high resist places like Halls of Testing that call for a full debuff order. Plus, even if I don't sini first, if a slow is resisted after malo-tash, I often throw a sini in there so I'm not just spamming turgur since sini is practically non aggro. Non aggro = no penalty for chain casting it, tho it's kinda mana intensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Plus...considering our superior innate cha and flashy good looks in a kilt, if cha really has an effect on slowing, barbs would leap over iksars and trolls for consideration as the &quot;best shaman race.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm with jemandar, I've got a massive 54 cha and I have no more problems slowing mobs than the next shaman, even the ones who beleive cha helps and keep cha buffs up.<br />
<br />
Things are just like that sometimes and when your looking for something your alot more likely to find it.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine that even if it did make a difference the amount would be so minor anyway that it wouldn't be worth bothering. I play a lvl 59 enchanter also and have looked at alot of the testing done on meses and charms and while cha does seem to help out it's effect is so minor I wouldn't wear any gear just for cha or give up much in the way of other stats for it but that isn't really an issue since cha is a given on alot of enchanter gear, you just end up with it either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">dennman - I use Malosini in places like HoT.  Because:<br />
1.  Whats a mage?  I get no malosini help.<br />
<br />
2.  Whats an enchanter?  I get no reliable tash (I get procc'd tash from melees)<br />
<br />
3.  It is better for me to stay alive and slow a mob 30 seconds later than to get dead from resists and have a wipeout.  I can safely cast Malosini without getting any agro at all.  With malosini in, I know slow will land.  If I get 4 resists on Malosini I start alternating in turgurs.  It's fast casting so it doesnt take long.  <br />
<br />
When you have lots of people, lots of shaman and mages, etc then you can afford to cast slow directly after malo.  When you have 6-12 people, well I stay pretty high up there on the hate list.  I MUST manage my agro because I am required for many things other than slow for successful fights.  Not everyone has someone there to back them up if they die or other classes to help with debuffing and healing.  At least I don't, so I gotta take preventative measures.   Maybe someday I will get another oracle partner to help me with this business.  Obviously guilds that are doing the real high end stuff are gonna have more than 1 shaman, and support in the other classes as well.  :)<br />
<br />
Regarding Charisma - Show me some evidence, some real documented, well tested proof and I will happily believe that charisma has some effect on something other than prices from vendor.</div></div><hr />

serious note, i think cha is silly, guildy got CT brain and started alwasy getting resisted and now cha buffs herself and feels it works.  regarding malosini before slow.  i do it cause i like to live.  and it recasts a lot faster.  but i am also only active shaman, btw being only shaman in heavily raiding guild is very stressing :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
(Copy/paste from the mages)<br />
Charisma is the unknown mage stat - regarded as generally useless, it is actually the determinent as to the radius of pet commands such as /pet attack. If your charisma is low you can quickly test this by making pet in a newbie or safe zone and standing a fair distance away. Click /pet follow me from an impossible range and then get closer progressively until clicking brings the 'Following you, Master' message. This is the furthest possible distance for pet commands. Now back away. If the pet doesn't follow you, some added charisma wouldn't hurt. Good items to get include Creator dagger (the FT2 one is +10 cha) and Dragon Scaled Mask (+25 cha). Or any of the several hundred others. Don't bother with Bracelet of Beauty as this isn't vital, its just useful, particularly if you are controlling pets on the other side of a wall during a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>kiludan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm really sure CHA helps to slow.<br />
<br />
<br />
At level 51, in Kael Arena, with one group, with 75 CHA, i needed 4-6 casting to slow these giants.<br />
We didn't have any chanter or bard. Cleric had a hard time to heal. He ran oom and we all got killed.<br />
<br />
As i had read some post on CHA issue, i then decided to try.<br />
I equiped this +30 CHA crown i won on roll in velk the day before, and buffed.<br />
New CHA was about 135.<br />
Same place, same mobs, i then only needed 1 or 2 casting to slow mobs.<br />
<br />
so yes, according to me, CHA helps a lot!<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT.... don't forget that most important is level, CHA only helps.<br />
so every Oracle posting that they don't need CHA are right too: it's far more easy for them to slow a mob then for a 55 shaman trying to slow this same mob.<br />

<br />
When I am on raids and get alot af resists, I can buff up CHA and resists drop dramatically.<br />
<br />
I have been PL'ing my duo box ranger on Seafuries and he gets 1 to 3 resists on snare about 60% of the time with unbuffed CHA. If I JB Helm CHA buff him he gets 1 maybe 2 resisted snares 30% of the time.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, if the Mob &gt; Player then CHA can't hurt, especially free CHA from JB helm. Being over 100 appears to be all it takes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The supposed &quot;randomness&quot; in resist checks etc, APPEARS to work in such a way, that casters will tend to run in &quot;streaks&quot; of success.   NTOV is amazingly apparent for this.   Some nights, I could slow EVERYTHING before the other shamans (after Malo-Tash-Occlude was in) and I was only 59.    After I got 60 and caught up with the other two raiding shamans, I would notice a pattern that each shaman would have hot or cold nights, for no apparent reason. <br />
<br />
That night, you were cold, he was not.   Go back next week, and don't act too shocked when you're suddenly a debuffing machine and your partner is dragging along wondering why he can't land a spell.<br />
