Ban on electronic games applies to everyone, even tourists <br />
 <br />
<br />
Sept. 3 — In Greece, playing a shoot-’em up video game could land you in jail. The government there has banned all electronic games across the country, including those that run on home computers, on Game Boy-style portable consoles, and on mobile phones. Thousands of tourists in Greece are unknowingly facing heavy fines or long terms in prison for owning mobile phones or portable video games. <br />
<br />
That's right; something as innocent as playing computer chess on your laptop in a hotel lobby is now a crime with penalties of up to three months in stir and a fine of 10,000 euros.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's a shame that they have decided to ban all forms of electronic gaming to stamp out illegal gambling. I think that when this goes to the European courts it will get overturned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The probem with this law is it intrudes into people's lives for no good purpose.  Laws are enacted to protect the public weal or ensure public safety.  This does neither.  It's an attempt to stop something that does impact the public weal (out of control gambling) but its implementation is arbitrary and harms Greece's image internationally and the Grecian people will eventually lose confidence in their leadership because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Christabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is like the 5th post I've read on the topic. And I've gotta say, good for greece. I think a lot of talent and potential is thrown away through obsessive gaming. Even going back to the day of MUDs, there were no shortage of people flunking out of school, ruining their marriages, getting fired from their jobs, and blowing up like baloons as they phased out real life in exchange for virtual life. And as these online games become more refined, they'll only become more immersive.<br />
<br />
You can talk about various American ideals, like freedom of choice. But there are certain freedoms that cause more harm than good (salt, sugar, fat, tobacco, alcohol, etc). Nothing like this would ever happen in the US. And that's fine with me. But if the greeks can pull it off, more power to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think a lot of talent and potential is thrown away through obsessive gaming. <br />
<br />
It's hypocritical to laud this move and still keep your EQ account.  Sounds like the old drunk telling a bunch of 25-year olds that they shouldn't start drinking while swilling beer from a &quot;40.&quot;  If you feel that it's good to ban video games to prevent people from playing obsessively, how can you log inand still look in the mirror?  You're just contributing to the problem, not the solution.<br />
<br />
Myself, I think that people should be responsible for their own actions.  Video games haven't rotted my brain and I try to keep the fact that RL comes first to all my friends.  To be free is to be responsible for the choices you make, not to look to the goverment to take away all the bad choices for you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Christabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's hypocritical to laud this move and still keep your EQ account.<br />
<br />
I haven't owned an EQ account in nearly 6 months. And my point is not that all the things I listed are bad for every single individual. It's that each one of them, in the big picture, is detrimental.<br />
<br />
For example... some people can smoke occasionally and get away with it. But when you consider that 90% of lung cancer cases are caused exclusively by smoking, it puts the big picture of tobacco in perspective. For your casual drinkers you have your drunk drivers and alcoholics. And in contrast to your weekend diners you have morbidly obese walking time bombs coming down with diseases that would be virtually non-existant if it wasn't for their undisciplined habits.<br />
<br />
Online gaming is a thing that's entertaining at it's very best (and nothing more)... but very destructive at its worst. So like I say, if greece can pull this off, kudos to them. Some people need to be protected from their own stupidity... particularly in countries with socialized health care and entitlement programs. One person's problems are paid for out of the next person's wallet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So because 0.01% of the population is unable to control their gaming habits the whole population should suffer? I saw a friend of mine hit by a car.  Does this mean cars should be banned? Walking near roads should be banned?  <br />
<br />
To say that all forms of electronic games should be banned because there is a very very small minority of people who it affects badly is one of the most ridiculous statements I can recall ever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Christabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Online gaming includes online gambling. And the difference between a car and an online game is that a car is more than just a from of entertainment. Banning cars would be an absolute catastrophe since their good outweighs their harm by a mile. Banning online games wouldn't matter in the least by comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lets' get to the point Christabel ... you believe people can't control themselves and should be controlled for the general good of all.

<br />
Online gaming is a thing that's entertaining at it's very best (and nothing more)... but very destructive at its worst.<br />
<br />
Which means that the root cause of this problem is computers and the being ONLINE in general ... thus ... get the heck off the internet before you corrupt yourself and more of the innocent.</div></div><hr />

Do you enjoy eating chocolate? just imagine if your government outlawed them. Assuming that you enjoy the odd chocolate bar. How would you feel that this happened when you can obviously control your habit? Just because the government decided that the a small fraction of the population cant stop stuffing them down, so they need to ban them all.<br />
<br />
If you don't like chocolate think about something YOU enjoy, because you can guarantee that someone somewhere will be abusing it.<br />
<br />
I do find it Ironic that you applaud the Greek government banning all forms of electronic gaming (not just online gaming) and post it on a gaming form for a game that you no longer play. Why are you surfing this board? Are you addicted to it? maybe your governemt should ban this board so you don't lose your job/house/spouse etc...</div></div><hr />

No, don't bother arguing.  I will decide what's best for you.  Stop posting here.  Burn your computer while you're at it.  It has been decreed.  You get no say in the matter.  Now run along like a good little left-winger in training.  I think I hear a protest march forming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not quite but anyone who is convicted under a law such as this has this has the right to appeal to the European court of human rights. Every country that signed up to EEC (European Economic Community) agreed to this. <br />
<br />
I think it's similar to what happens with the states in North America. If one state decides to make a law and you are convicted because you broke this law. Is their not a court that you can appeal to, to see if the law is fair and just?<br />
<br />
If the court decideds that the law is fair then it stays, but if the court decides that it's not then the government have to change it. It's not uncommon for new laws to get &quot;tested&quot; in this way</div></div><hr />

<br />
Entertainment is good and desireable.  There's &quot;quality of life&quot;... we're not ants slaving away for the good of the hive here, drones who need no entertainment or pleasures.  Life, libert, and pursuit of happiness.<br />
<br />
Cars at best improve quality of life.  No, they are not 100% necessary.  At worst, they pollute the environment and can ruin someone's life if they have an accident which cripples or kills someone.  Ban cars.<br />
<br />
Sorry Christabel, but your logic has more holes in it than swiss cheese.  Or is it feta? :eek:<br />
<br />
Edit: I support the right of the greek government to ban electronic games.  I also support the right of human beings everywhere to decry it as totalitarian, invasive, and doing nothing to serve the public good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's right. But you've missed the entire point. Entertainment is not wrong. And frivolous entertainment is not wrong either. But if a thing can cause long term harm to people and offers nothing more than entertainment, then nobody is gonna suffer for losing it.<br />
<br />
Posting on this message board is frivolous. So is going out for a drive in your car. And so is listening to the radio. But there's no reason to prohibit people from doing any one of those things (no matter how compulsively they do them) since the public is served to a much greater extent by having them available.<br />
<br />
So to return to the dead horse... online gaming is in the first catgory and not the second.</div></div><hr />

What ever happened to being responsible for your own actions.  Even if that action ruins your life?  Where do we draw the line? Gaming lost you your job? McDonalds Fries made you fat?  Who is responsible for the lost job or the obesity? The company making the products or you indulging?<br />
<br />
People have to be responsible for their own actions.  End of story.  I personally think the Greek Government should just let the people &quot;ruin their lives&quot; with the gambling or gaming should just let them do it and in the end, NOT pick up their tab.  All they are doing is enabling people to become even more lazy and irresponsible by taking away their right to make the right choices.<br />
<br />
Personally I would rather be accountable for my choices and always have them rather then unaccountable and have no choices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You?  As a single person within a community?   <br />
The Greek government?     As the moral police for it's country as a whole?   Including the visitor/tourist?  It's population?    Controlling it's populist thoughts ... a very comforting idea.<br />
<br />
From Webster's on Draconian ... &quot;of, relating to, or characteristic of Draco or the severe code of laws held to have been framed by him&quot;.   Notice that doesn't interpret what is a severe code of laws ... just that they are severe.    Creating a sweeping set of laws without careful consideration of the scope ... is Draconian.    Interpreting &quot;Pacman&quot; to be as morally corrupt as &quot;Pacman does Dallas&quot; is illogical.  At it's best it's lazy lawmaking ... at it's worse it's government gone mad.    Can anyone say &quot;Big Brother&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Meeknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think this is all symptomatic of a root problem that as the major institutions which used to promote stability in communities fail (ie. family, education, religion), we turn more and more to those remaining institutions (ie. government) to solve our problems for us.  The point being that government -- as a manafestation of the social contract -- was only intended to allow each member of society to be productive by protecting a fundamental right to persue basic needs.  Anything beynd that is an attempt to provide direction for society which used to be handled by other institutions.<br />
<br />
For example, the state of Massachusetts has a law which forbids the sale of alcohol on Sundays.  It is no accident that Sunday was chosen for this (the Sabbath); however, there was a time when the vast majority of people participated in the institution of religion which had dictated that Sunday was a day of family and reflection -- there would not have been a need for such a law for people would have observed sobriety because their religion told them to.<br />
<br />
The less people are able to care for themselves through social institutions, the more government will intervene.  This will continue until you do have government deciding what is &quot;good&quot; for you and what is not. <br />

Like books (fiction), music, board games, card games, kids toys, plays, ballet, and movies, and anything else that provides a decent quality of life?  All these provide entertainment, should they all be banned?   Heck I sometimes think my dad is obsessed with his boat, but I certainly wouldn't want pleasure boats banned.<br />
<br />
I think people who don't share other people's hobbies are *way* too quick to slap them with an &quot;obsessed/addict&quot; tag.  <br />
<br />
I work, go to school *and* play Everquest, and I'd be vastly annoyed if Dubya attempted to ban Everquest because there are some people who have a problem with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one but a few addicts?  Please....you ignorant sh*t.  Don't speak unless you know.  I've lived in greece, and vacation there for months at a time every few years.  I have family all over and have been all over.  Alot of kids over there have playstations and what not.  None are addicts.  Most use it when they don't have work to do, and there's nothing else gonig on.  <br />
<br />
It's more rare to see kids sitting around in greece playing video games than it is here, but it doesn't mean those kids in greece aren't equally as pissed that they won't be able to play.  Sure it's not AS big of a deal as it would be here, but the little they play is still something.  Why should they be denied that.  Go*damn government can't understand the difference between Online Vegas type games, and Tetris.</div></div><hr />

Just because someone's a hypocrite doesn't mean they're not giving good advice. If an alcoholic tells me a sad tale of how he lost his job, wife and custody of his kids because of his problems, even though he might have scotch on his breath, I'll still take the lesson to heart.<br />
<br />
<br />
And as for banning games... I don't understand why playing a video game such as FIFA Soccer should be illegal even though you can step outside onto the street and play soccer. It's like saying the NYT on the web is illegal, but you can still read the print paper. It's really strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">On the list to get banned next...<br />
<br />
Soccer/Football/Baseball/other random sport...it's just entertainment, and look at the riots and damage games can cause, not to mention the fanatics that watch games for hours, wasting away their lives.<br />
<br />
Shopping...for many it's entertainment.  However, many people overspend way too much, going into debt which causes undue stress and may cause other people harm when you can't pay them what they are due.  Don't worry though, the government will take all your money and give you what you need instead to make sure this does not happen...for your safety, of course.<br />
<br />
Movies/Television/Radio...well, they won't be completely banned, but they will only show news that the government wants you to hear.  After all, the rest is just entertainment, that may cause undue stress, anger or other emotional feelings people shouldn't have.  Those people that obsess over the TV can now go to the gym or some other soon to be banned activity.<br />

Who says?  Firstly, my life experience may not be the same as the person who's giving it.  I.E. You could tell me the evils of video game additction, but if I'm not addicted or likely to become addicted, what's the advice worth?  secondly, how good could the advice be, if the person giving it isn't following it themselves?  Even the Bible says &quot;take the great plank out of your own eye before removing the splinter from your brother's.&quot;   And thirdly, if the advice hasn't been asked, it aint wanted.

That's probably my favorite quote of the thread. I was sorta being a goon this morning. But I think the issue of &quot;accountability&quot; is why I shruged at the greek government doing this, yet would object to our own government doing something similar. <br />

<br />
I don't think it's right for a person to to knowingly make costly and destructive choices when his neighbor shares the bill for it. But based on the feedback people have given, I think the lesser evil might be to re-evaluate some of the government safety nets that create an unfair situation... than to micro-manage everyone's personal life from above. Runningwolf's examples were really good (censorship, etc). I guess things would get kinda bleak if government cracked down on all things that were &quot;entertaining at best, but dangerous at worst.&quot;<br />

Anyway, if we're going to look at the human(not left wing or right wing) impulse to control other people and tell them what to do, we'll find it pretty universal on any side of any political divide. It's an expression of power.  And life is all about power.  <br />
<br />
Puts me in mind of an article I read in Harpers or The Atlantic this month, where someone is quoted as saying something like, &quot;Given absolute power over another person, the human mind turns to torture.&quot;  Torturing, for people who do it for pleasure rather than just as part of their daily job, is just an extension of control, after all, and an ultimate expression of power.  <br />
<br />
Power is a primal human need.  People will do the craziest things to no other purpose than to express their power -- harass their employees, rape, engage in pointless wars, redecorate a new mate's home, decorate and mutilate their own bodies or those of their enemies, abuse their pets and children, climb mountains, commit all sorts of wrongs or just do crazy things.<br />
<br />
It's unfortunate when people want to express power just to express power.  Making laws that control behavior that's really nobody's business is always a popular one -- religious laws or civil laws.  Most states in America have had laws about what kind of sex people can have with each other, and many still have them on the books.  There was the missionary way and the WRONG way, I guess.  Oral sex was prohibited all over the place, sometimes still is.  <br />
<br />
Then there are all the other victimless crimes, and different ways to describe victimhood, depending on what your perspective is.<br />
<br />
All of which are nobody's business.  The law isn't supposed to be there to tell you how to live; it's supposed to be there to organize the societal institutions you need to keep people living together without harming each other, and to defend the populace from aggression by other peoples and nations.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I could give a rat's ass about any legislator or president or religious figurehead's ideas about anything.  I just need them to make sure there are firemen and cops and sewer systems and electricity and water around when I need them, that kind of thing.<br />
<br />
The last thing you want is people &quot;only&quot; restricting video games.  The idea that it's anybody's business to tell you how to live your life or force you to act or not act accordingly is a horrible one, and always subject to the arbitrary whims of the mob of the minute or the king of the month.  <br />
<br />
When I want some nosy punk of a goober telling me how to live, I'll open up his stinking hole and feed him a fish.  Otherwise, he can mind his own goddamn business and just fix the potholes outside my house, please.</div></div><hr />
