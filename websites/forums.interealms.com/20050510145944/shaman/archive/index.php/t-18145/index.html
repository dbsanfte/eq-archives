<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been camping the boots of flowing slime and was hoping to also get a Heavy Rubicite Girdle while down here for my war.  However, I can't seem to find any info on the whereabouts of the ph for it and I can't clear all 5 rooms.  Any info is much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The first room with three spawns in the water and single spawn in the hall just before the room.  The placeholders are the three spawns in the water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, so it's the same room as the mob for boots of flowing slime?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, thats the room for the boots he is describing. Incidently the red ooze always pops on the left if i remember right.<br />
<br />
The Gridle drops from &quot;A Swirling Green Mass&quot;.<br />
It spawns in the first room to the left after the first T-intersection in the sewers, if you enter from the courtyard side instead of AoF room.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the info all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh yeah, I thought you were asking for boots.  Misread your post.<br />
<br />
And the red swirling mass used to pop in all 3 slots.  Matter of fact, I've seen it up twice.  That was a good day :D<br />
<br />
But yeah, from the boots room, it is the 2nd room, taking all lefts.  I've only seen the green swirling pop in the back left of the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok now got another related question.  Just how rare are the red and green mass spawns? I've spent 4 long days camping them without a single spawn, seen a diseased mosquito 4 times though. Thanks in advance again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's a random spawn on the masses (with a pretty low rate), and to make matters worse, I believe the FT3 boots you are looking for were coded to the rare drop off of the masses thanks to item farmers.  You're very likely in for a LONG camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">to get anything from CT you can count on settling in for a 3-5 hour session, but odds are you will walk away with something if you do though. <br />
<br />
Its too bad the xp sucks there for how difficult the zone is, its not that bad at all and has some really nice drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know the maps show him in that room to the left (from the 3rd room in) but we've seen and killed the green mass twice, and both times he was to the right -- from that 3rd room in go right, through that room, and then he was in the room to the left...<br />
<br />
On the map you are referring to, both times he was in the room that should pop the virulent mosquito (basically, 2 rooms before the old 'gator alley' underneath the pyramid north of the maze).<br />
<br />
So if you pull left room and don't get him to pop, try the spot I mentioned.  It's a shame, as a good group can clear from the red mass room to where that map shows green mass quite easily -- it's only a total of three rooms plus a couple halls.  YMMV :(</div></div><hr />
