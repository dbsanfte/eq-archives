<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antmf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question for you guys. I see alot of shaman carrying books and or other non melee items in their main hand as opposed to a spear or melee weapon cause of stats I would assume. My question is this: I know prepop we would go toe to toe with mob and melee with pet chewing at the mobs arse but now post pop that is a tad difficult to say the least so I was wondering do we A: carry a melee weapon or B: carry a non melee weapon with better stats? Please let me know. Thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In PoP the mobs hit to hard to melee even with lr5 imo. But if I ever get my hands on a hammer of hours I will melee again for the sake of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Meleeing is incredibly feeble damage compared to casting spells.<br />
For example, I think I can get about 20-25 dps meleeing mobs with haste and avatar and a 25/25 1h blunt.<br />
In comparison, I can cast Blood of Saryn and wince back the mana and do about 60 dps with just that one spell, and it's not hard to keep up 2 different dots at once, like Blood and Ancient Scourge or Blood and Bane of Nife.<br />
There's only 2 times I melee.<br />
1.  To proc my ToT mace to try and drain mana from a mob that might do annoying things like gate.<br />
2.  To proc my Spear of Constriction so that it ensnares the mob I'm fighting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Melee is really only worthwhile for entertainment on really gimp mobs, to proc something useful while in group, or for PvP with some classes.<br />
<br />
Those &quot;in teh face&quot; fights belong with the gimpy 200-300 max hitters of yesteryear and pretty much ended with PoP and the mitigated slow.  I fight like a druid anymore on most solo exp and don't even bother with Turgur's, but I just don't think I would live long getting hit for 900+. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are a FEW really really top-end weapons that make melee a reasonable alternative IF you're in Rabid Bear form, which reasonably requires you to put into hastened rabidity too.  And by the time you're putting points into bear, you've got a few hundred minimum.<br />
<br />
In other words, no.  And that's the sad bit.  In groups where I have a cleric and things are zipping along, I have the cleric melee while I heal because it's most efficient.<br />
<br />
Anyone else see something wrong with that?  I don't know what the answer is, but SOMETHING's gotta be able to make melee as least a situational option for shamans again.  maybe a double-attack AA for us, I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Melee is irrelevent.  Cann and nuke is more efficient.  I agree that this is sad, I'd like to be able to outdamage my JBB on POP-level mobs, but the &quot;whiff factor&quot; is so damned high that there's no chance.</div></div><hr />

So much for being a battle priest imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but JBB + melee is even better.  A nice 2HB that will swing once between each JBB blast is some nice added damage between levels 45 and 56.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Abani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I melee in experience groups mainly if I want to proc something.. snare, stun, a dd, etc.  On most PoP raids these days, my melee damage would barely make a scratch on the average target, but a couple of ripostes (or getting on the rampage list) could easily make me into roadkill (or at least suck up healing mana).   I'm infinitely more effective as a spell-caster in most situations.<br />

I have yet to meet a shaman being single boxed not carrying a weapon.  Most 2 boxers pump up their shamans with hp and wisdom gear since their only purpose is to heal, buff, slow, and pet attack for extra dps.  They will never tank and reach 65 with a defense of 10.</div></div><hr />

No this weapon isn't going to give you any reasonable damage but the utility of it is amazing. Consider what happens when you are fighting mobs that summon. Your slow is resisted. You get summoned. Your going to be in melee range for at least a round or two. Well just turn on auto-attack as soon as you get  the resist message. Regardless if you try and tank while slowing or run away and slow the result is the same you get a few swings off on the mob and a chance at a proc. Being we can buff our dex up to maximum without much effort procs occur quite regularly at least for me. Think of the mana it saves the groups on healing you and everyone else to have it slowed at that point after resist instead of you getting beat on by an unslowed mob. Cause lets face it not every tank is going to hold aggro through an early resist. Remember if your trying to channel a slow while being hit and you get interepted you get free swing at the mob and a chance for a proc. The utility is even more useful if you enjoy pulling or tanking for your group. Basically any situation where a mob is locked on you and your tryin to get a slow off having a chance at slow via melee how ever small is a has proven to be a life saver. <br />
<br />
Soloing it becomes even more crucial. Lets say you feel like killing some sand giants in BoT while waiting for a group. Its pretty safe to pull with malos and slow will usual stick. But in those rare cases it doesnt and you have an unslowed giant bearing down on you while you try to root it or slow it agian that auto attack proc might very well save your behind.<br />
<br />
Being the item sells for about 500pp I'd say give it a shot if your looking for something usefull in your primary slot besides stats.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There's any number of things to do than stand there and hope that togor might proc on the mob.  Procs go off about once every 30 seconds roughly on average of melee.  If you get a slow resist, the chancess of it going off in the 3 or 4 seconds you are waiting for Turgur to refresh is very unlikely.  And when mobs are hitting for 600+, riposte hurts like hell.  I'd rather just NOT melee and avoid the riposte damage.<br />
<br />
Better options are to:<br />
Try rooting.<br />
Stand there and take the hit and let the tank taunt off of you.<br />
Run out of melee range and try to reslow before it gets to you.<br />
You'll have a lot of time sitting at your bind point contemplating the futility of hoping for a proc off a weapon to save your ass in that situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually, my options in BoT are:<br />
<br />
stand and take hits while swinging my weapon innefectively and getting standing mana regen, or<br />
be mounted and take hits while meditating.<br />
<br />
There's no question -- the horse is what kills melee as an option (outdoors)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>kayen85</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well the point Juujuu wasn't to stand their and hope for a proc but that if your going to be in melee range while you try and recast slow or cast root then the proc could go off and help in addition to however else you handle resists and summons. My post wasn't a theory, I've been using the weapon for quite some time and it does in fact go off quite frequently during those 3-4 sec situations. Consider back in the days if you used JBB to solo mobs and had a proc weapon on and how inbetween casts you could often get a proc in that short period of time. <br />
<br />
Yes riposte damage potentialy can hurt, but doesn't hurt as much as an unslowed mob beating on you. On the same note what are you chances of getting a riposte in those 3-4 seconds of melee. Personally I can't recall the last time I took riposte damage from a few swings (or even in general to a noticable extent) and if it really was an issue I certainly wouldn't continue to use the weapon or recommend this tactic. I don't feel the potential for a riposte out weighs the potential for a slow.<br />
<br />
I agree with all your &quot;better options&quot; and agian the idea wasn't to melee instead, but to melee in addition while you try and root the mob off and while you stand their and let the tank get aggro. <br />

I never said I use it in PvE.<br />
<br />
I play on a PVP server. When I root a caster (another player like a wizard for example), send my dog army and use Rabid Bear it's a sight to see.    :p</div></div><hr />

Quite an incredible item, and might make melee very viable for a shaman.  Can you imagine smacking stuff for 300 while proccing for 400?  Might make melee worth it, dontcha think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Only time I melee is to help mobs die below 50% when I'm PLing someone :D<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with not meleeing though, when our spells are so much stronger.  I'm not sure the title &quot;battle-priest&quot; belongs to the shaman anymore...  I see more clerics melee with the Uber Hammers of Procingness than I do shamans.  Even so, I've parsed those clerics to still provide very wimpy DPS; it's more novelty than anything for really bored clerics.  <br />
<br />
Either way, there isn't a priest class designed to be a significant contributor of damage melee-wise... they have melee classes for that.  The fact that shamans were capable of standing toe-to-toe with mobs pre-PoP was more because of their debuffs rather than their tanking/meleeing ability --- a wizard could tank a mob after a shaman has debuffed/slowed/crippled it.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the majority of shamans who wish to melee are shamans who have never played a melee class, and they're itching to melee?  I'm not sure.  I've played a ranger to 61 and a monk to 53...  so now when I play my shaman, meleeing isn't a priority for me, 'cause I've seen how much better my ranger and monk are at meleeing, and it's a joke to think of my shaman as capable of meleeing anything with any efficiency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yeah Landragon I got one of them, its staff of eternal flames, theres also a 1hb from plane of water from a kinda rare mob called a sharp spine club which procs  450 dd or so. But I love staff of eternal flames, 210 is max hit I have got with it, and it really procs frequently. Coupled with Fury of magic 1 and the occasional 800 crit nuke, its actually ok melee. And rabid bear can slaughter somethings with it. Btw didn't know if people know but extended duration items and aa extend rabid bear, so I typically have a 10 min rabid bear or so.<br />
<br />
I need to get haste item, but its actually kinda viable to melee against say in Droga mobs there while you dot it and stuff.(lr5 and id5 also helps with this). However in general I guess meleeing really stops at around lvl 50.</div></div><hr />

Quite simply, no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rignack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think it is situational when to melee or not.  Some people do have the right weapons to melee as shaman and as stated if you have that 50/35 400 DD proc weapon i would be meleing all the time.  I currently have a 44/40 with 4 or 6 bane to undead with a 300 proc and if i'm fighting undead i'm fighting all the time hittng for 200 and procing alot (since you don't need to hit the mob to proc).</div></div><hr />

Top hit for me is 210. The DD on the other hand crits for me 666 one in 4 hits.  With rabid bear I get to wade in on a boss mob and have fun.  Still if you get on rampage list on some Pop mobs its bear steak in less then 2 secs  :D</div></div><hr />
