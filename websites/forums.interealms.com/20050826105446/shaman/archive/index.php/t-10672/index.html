To whom it may concern:<br />
<br />
	You may wish to stay up to date on the current issue and how it is affecting the shaman community across all servers as of the February 4, 2003 patch. The change I'm referring to is the removal of other detrimental spells from begin affected by the Affliction Haste/Efficiency Focus Items. It was stated in the forums for the Shaman's Crucible that this removal of this feature was intended all along, but merely not mentioned in the patch. To the shaman community, this seems absurd as the same patch message featured changes such as doors swinging open the wrong way, and an oven that was moved because the stack was visible from outside the building. To have made such a broad sweeping change, even if it was to correct an issue long overdue, and not mention it in the patch message is a mistake that only shows your lack of support to the playing community that willingly give you money every month in the hopes that you are creating a world that we'll want to come back to often.<br />
	This most recent patch and message that accompanied it do not reflect the attitude that we (the shaman community specifically, but the Everquest playerbase in general) expect a company such as yours to have towards its customers. Time and again you have stated that you are working for balance with the classes, pleasing players without chosing favorites, and other similar ideals. Clearly that is not the case. The shaman community, at the very least, has had enough of half-witted patches that do more harm than good in broad sweeping changes that in the final analysis do not make sense.<br />
	I would love to outline each and every reason that this &quot;correction&quot; should be reversed, changed, looked at, altered, done away with, etc, but it would seriously take a long time. We want this issue taken care of. We want AA that helps us in the end game abilities that we use the most (slow, malo) or focus affects that help us the way every other casting class gets a focus for their spells. We do not think we are being unreasonable. We do not expect change TODAY. But this must be addressed. It must be responded to in an intelligent, formal fashion. And it MUST be discussed. To let it lie is costing you money already.<br />
	Below I have given you 3 links to the 3 message threads that discuss this issue very clearly. Someone up in the chain of command desperately needs to read these through and get back with us. This change is not in the best interest of the Everquest community. I am posting this letter to the forums with a request that they send it in to you, and hopefully you will understand that this is a REAL issue with REAL consequences for your company should you decide to ignore us.<br />

For greater response, when pick what type of issue this is, pick Dr00d Class Related under the subtopic, sow me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why not voice your opinion where they appear to be reading and paying attention? Absor is post #2 asking for people to discuss the issue freely but &quot;keep it civil&quot;.<br />

I, for one, don't care enough either way about the issue. I'll keep playing for what enjoyment I can get out of the game. When it stops being fun I'll either take a break or move on. I refuse to let myself get as worked up as many I've seen posting on this topic because it's just not worth it. More important things in life to focus that energy into.</div></div><hr />
