<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I was just thinking about this and since it is early in the game I don't think that many people will run into this problem until later.<br />
<br />
From what I understand the Ethereal parchments give us our 62 spells (ya 61 also but all are vendor bought) and so once you get your two spells you are pretty much good to go.  I don't see Ethereal parchments as a big problem since most likely people will still let you roll on them even though you have a full spellbook for 62 level spells.  These parchments seem to drop off mobs that a pickup group could take down so no biggie there.<br />
<br />
Remember all spells will originally come from a fellow ranger that most likely has that spell already.<br />
<br />
Now when it comes to Spectral and Shadowed parchments I think we are going to run into a problem.   We get 5 new spells in the 63-64 range (hopefully we don't get Engulfing Roots as a random still) and 2 for 65. Once you have a full spellbook who is really going to let you loot a parchment unless the guild has all their pure casters/druids/shamans/clerics full of their 63-65 spells?  It even gets worse for the Shadowed parchments.<br />
<br />
Atleast in Velious, Luclin and Kunark the spells were random drop so you really had no choice in what was dropped.  You could get unlucky and have 10 Warders Protections drop (outfit 3-4 of the rangers in guild) but that just ment it would be available to 6-7 rangers who most likely didn't have access to the mobs that dropped them.<br />
<br />
The only way this will work out for people that won't have access to the Spectral or Shadowed parchments are if high end rangers keep getting unlucky and get a spell over and over again.  Most likley it will get distributed within the guild but a few might make their way to the general public.<br />
<br />
I just think we might become the class that has some of the rarest 63-65 level spells merely because we will be on the bottom of the list to get awarded parchments.  Sure we will get to roll on them in the beginning but once you have your 63-65 spells what is the point?  I doubt you will be first choice to loot that shadowed parchment when the guild leader knows you have a full spellbook.<br />
<br />
If someone could give me a little hope that I might see Protection of the Wild or Cry of Thunder in the near future I would really appreciate it.  Do shadowed/spectral parchments drop off of mobs that a pickup group could take down?  Do they drop off of mobs that mid level guilds can take down?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celt</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can get spectral parchments solo in one particular higher tier plane if you know what you are doing.  65 parches are dropping rarely at the moment but are attainable by a small mini raid (see: 9 people or so) also drop in the higher tier planes.  Hope that Helps.  I'm sure you can get shadowed eventually in a 6 man as your guild gets stronger in gear and aa, I wouldn't worry about it.  Soon the highest tier guild on your server will be smashing through and filling out their spellbooks, it's only a matter of time before those scrolls filter down to the rest of the folks, or the lower tier guilds accrue enough levels/aa's to overcome their gear deficciencies and get themselves into the higher tier planes themselves :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daesun</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry, I don't really see the problem here.  You level up, you enter new zones, you kill mobs, you roll on parchments, you get your spells.   When you have a full spellbook why on earth would you want to loot again and deny another member of your guild or group a spell that they still need?<br />
<br />
Are you saying that you want rangers with full spellbooks to loot spells they don't need so they can sell them to you in the bazaar or give them to you for free, rather than working for them like they did?<br />
<br />
edit:  simplified some Daesun-grammar that even confused me on re-reading.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Point is if no rangers loot parchments after they get a full spellbook then their will be no extra 63-65 level spells to go to rangers that might never have access to Shadowed or Spectral parchments.  <br />
<br />
We would make our own 63-65 level spells rare as hell not because Verant made our spells rare drops off of mobs but by the fact that no ranger would be in line to loot the parchment since pure caster/cleric/druid etc most likely would have preference.<br />
<br />
This really doesn't affect the high end ranger, since he will loot parchments til he has a full spellbook, but more of the mid level ranger that one day will get 65 but might not have access to the high end content which has the parchments he needs.  <br />
<br />
All of our 62-65 level spells come from rangers who already have that spell (that is if you don't have access to spectral or shadowed parchments)... not by a random drop from a mob.  As you said if he doesn't have any reason to loot it then most likely the casters/clerics/shaman etc will loot it.  How long do you think it will take to outfit an entire high end guild with their 63-65 level spells... all of them.  Only at that point will it make sense for a ranger to start looting parchments again to then sell to the public.<br />
<br />
Like I said above... if a ranger gets unlucky and keeps getting a spell over and over with their parchment then ithe high end spells will eventually leak to the public but I doubt you will get that unlucky that many times before you get the spell you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess that is what I am looking for Celt.  <br />
<br />
So far I haven't seen any spectral or shadowed parchments drop where I have been.   <br />
<br />
If all parchments can be obtained via experience groups then that should solve the problem I am thinking might happen.  So far I have just seen/heard spectral/shadowed parchments drop off of high end encounters. <br />
<br />
Daesun I am looking at this from a casual gamers aspect.  I am not in an Uber guild that has access to a lot of the planes.  I doubt I ever will.  I do however want to get a full spellbook like I do now at level 60.  <br />
<br />
Daesun you make it sound like I want a ranger to sacrifice for me.  I do not.  All I am saying is that before spells dropped random so you had no control over what dropped.  This led to spells being sold in the bazaar and gave casual gamers the chance to get  high end spells.</div></div><hr />

No, you made it sound like you wanted another class to sacrifice for you.. :)<br />
<br />
The thing is, you can't treat PoP like Velks.  You HAVE to progress through the planes to level, because the tier 1 zones green out at level 64.  When you enter the new zones, the higher level spells drop from xp mobs.  There is no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha... Daesun you are reading it wrong.  I am not saying that I want rangers to sacrice for me.  Just forget for a second that you think I am wanting to get something easy.<br />
<br />
I am saying that our high end spells used to drop off of the big ol' meanie mobs and eventually they started to trickle down to the bazaar once the rangers in the guild had that spell... there was NO control over what dropped.  In the case of PoP though the high end parchments will be awarded to people as the fill up their spellbook... once they have filled it up their is no reason to loot and hence the rest of the magic based guild gets to choose to loot it rather than the rangers since they are all filled up with their spells... no extras til everyone in the guild gets their 65 spells.<br />
<br />
NOW... this is pretty much a moot point now that I hear that parchments can be obtained from experience groups.  I however have not seen it but I will take the others word for it that they drop so if that is the case then spells should flow into the world at a good rate.<br />
<br />
My initial concern was that shadowed and spectral parchments were only dropping off of high end encounters but since that is not the case I can rest easy knowing that spells should flow into the game.<br />
<br />
I am not wanting anything easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KelaanNorgale</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rangers will still hand in high level parchments hoping to get back a spell they don't have yet and intsead getting a duplicate of a spell they have already scribed.  Those duplicates will eventually make their way into the market after the guild has as many copies as they can use of that particular spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borzak</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm so you want more ranger specific spells to drop so they will trickle down to rangers who can't get there already?<br />
<br />
What the heck, if you want the spell go get it. This has nothing to do with rangers btw - this applies to all classes. I'd rather see my guild fill up 1,000 spell slots with 1,500 parchment drops than get 4 copies of a spell every other day no one can use and must be sold at bazaar.</div></div><hr />

I'm still struggling to think of an easier way to get a spell than to buy an unwanted one in the bazaar, but nevermind.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hopwin</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Mortok was talking about me Daesun, I am the idiot who will end buying a spell in the bazaar. Mortok will be out there /random 200'ing against strangers to get copies for himself and if he already has it... well that is when it would trickle down to me.<br />
<br />
Or maybe I totally misread it and his issue is that if you are on a guild raid and a parchment drops, who gets it? Cleric/Wizard/Enchanter etc or the Ranger? A non-issue in DKP and roll-and-loot guilds, but for those with a loot team/council/officer....<br />
<br />
But anyways the only place I have seen a spectral drop is the spiders in PoN, I am hoping to pick some up at the CY in PoD, but havent seen any yet. I have no clue where one would find a fabled &quot;Shadowed Parchment.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Celt has been by far the most helpful putting my mind at ease (you too Hopwin) by atleast informing me that spectral and shadowed parchments can be obtained by single groups.  If that is the case then spells will flow into the world and I will have a shot at getting them without having to go on the Uber raids and hope that the raid leader allows me to loot a level 65 parchment ahead of the vast amount of clerics and shaman who have much more useful raiding spells than the ranger class.<br />
<br />
Daesun I am not wanting anything easy.  Let me say that again so you can finally lay this to rest.  I am not wanting anything easy.  I was only thinking about the casual gamer that might not have had the access to the mobs that drop the parchments.  You obviously are in a guild that has access to all the parchments so this doesn't really hit home to you.  I think if you just stepped back for a second and thought about how hard it would be to get stuff without your guild you would see where I am coming from.  BUT knowing that these parchments can be obtained from single groups helps out a lot.<br />
<br />
Borzak I agree.  I would love to give people access to filling up their spells slots so that people can have a full spell book.  The ranger though would be one of the last on the list on &quot;priority&quot; to fill since their 65 spells are not that important to raids.<br />
<br />
My basis for the original post was that I was under the impression that the spectral and shadowed parchments only were dropping off of the Uber mobs that required a raid force to take down.  Under that scenario it would be really hard to convince the guild leader to allow the ranger to loot the level 65 parchment due to the pure casters/cleric/shaman etc needing them much more than we do.  Which in turn would make an extra copies harder to come by for casual gamers.  Since this is not the case then I feel much better about getting my high end spells.<br />
<br />
I guess we will find out the truth in a month or two when we should start seeing spells in the bazaar.  So far I have yet to see a single 62+ ranger spell being sold in the bazaar.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daesun</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mortok, casual or not, to get to 65 you're going to have to kill mobs that can drop 63+ spells, for reasons I've already explained.  Mobs that are dark blue at 61 are no longer dark blue at 64.</div></div><hr />

A casual raiding guild won't get to those zones any time soon, at best in 3 months if not longer.<br />

I'm also looking to find info on drop info for Spectral parchments.</div></div><hr />

Unlucky me.  The other Rangers in my guild also already had the spell so one extra went to friend and to the other to my mule.  Still havent seen SoT for sale, but I have seen pleanty of other 62+ spells for sale.</div></div><hr />
