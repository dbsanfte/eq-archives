<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for a few.<br />
<br />
I two box a 55 monk and solo for grins, but lately I'm just tired of grinding and questing. I want to go do something challenging.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest tough, but winnable fights (solo and 2-boxed)?<br />
<br />
For instance, I have soloed and 2-boxed in PoN/PoD/PoI ... just yard trash, but still. But it's just grinding still. Chardok: bleh.<br />
<br />
So, any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Loot doesn't really matter, but wouldn't suck. I want the adrenaline of a good solid fight that takes some tactics, skill etc.<br />
<br />
(Oh, and if at all possible, NOT in a zone that's going to cost me 5k to get a rez. As you can see from my gear, I'm far from rich. :D) <br />

Tubby's House O'Crap (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=573688) <br />
<br />
Magelo for the monk is broken for some reason, but he's NOT uber. No fungi, no epic</div></div><hr />

I died 2 steps from zone out recently because I'm both stubborn and stupid.  That's not a great combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lodi perhaps.  Yeldema is possible if slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">DN , you can fight at entrance , fight dragon constructs and spiders .... monk can FD if too dangerous and shm can click on portal out ...<br />
yes it will be a pain to get a rez if you need it , but heck you'll be able to do something a lil original :)<br />
<br />
oh and for fun you can duo a few of the dragons in WW )<br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think lodi would be possible at your two levels, though I would be impresed as hell if you could.<br />
<br />
Went there recently with 3 melles (Rogue/Pally/Ranger) by the end of the fight all 3 melles were bellow 30%, and I was oom and starting to wonder if I could survive one more cannabalize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As an ex SHONK(TM) (shaman/monk double), i used to have fun doing some of these:<br />
<br />
Efreeti camp.<br />
Fire Giants.<br />
Nest dragons in WW.<br />
Kael arena.<br />
Bjerakor the Cold for a SoM for your monk.<br />
Guardian Wurms in SF.<br />
TM vamp castle.<br />
UP named apes.<br />
Hole jail including the ratman guard.<br />
Sirens Grotto also has some challenges.<br />
<br />
You may find you need at least 58 and kraggs for some of these. Torpor and malo at 60 will also obviously be a big boost.</div></div><hr />
