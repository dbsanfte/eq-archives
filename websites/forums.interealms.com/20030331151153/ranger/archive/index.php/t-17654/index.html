<br />
Ok, ok,  I know, it's beating a dead horse, but I have a huge problem with it still.<br />
<br />
Just this morning, my guild forms a group. Mage, druid, Enchanter (Guild Leader), Cleric, Warrior, Me (49/50 WOOT! Call of Earth!) as the lowest. So, we form the group, and then we decide where to go. Warrior suggests planes.<br />
<br />
My Guild leader, who is GROUPED with a Ranger constantly says &quot;We'd need a monk to pull in the Plane of Nightmares.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wanted to bitchslap her. Instead, I say, &quot;I can split the pulls there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cleric says, &quot;Yep, he can.&quot; Mind you, I have NEVER been to the planes before.<br />
<br />
Enchanter and everyone give it a go. We head to PoN. I split pull all morning long, only landing one pull out of 30 that had more than one mob to it, going over the same pattern consistently. Ravens, spiders, and trees. They all went down, one at a time.<br />
<br />
I go to leave, I have to work here in an hour, they say, &quot;This has been a great job! Way to go!&quot; Enchanter concedes that I can pull in PoN just as well as any monk she has been grouped with and keep it steady like they can.<br />
<br />
So, I go running off, and I say &quot;Grab a Ranger or a Monk to go ahead and pull.&quot; I left out SK because they are usually grouped up and I didn't even see any in that zone or in the Plane of Tranquility.<br />
<br />
Enchanter says &quot;Probably a Monk. Most Rangers probably can't split pull as well as you can.&quot; I liked the compliment, but it irritated me too. Hello, that's a freaking way of LIFE. Harmony is a blasted neccessity to learn in my view, because that makes you all the more valuable. As it stands, I believe my guild would probably turn down a Monk pulling in PoN compared to me, which I would alternate with the Monk if such the case.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I do like the compliment on the pulling, and my pulling skills there. I don't like, however, that they thought it was just me.</div></div><hr />

Good work!  He may have just been commenting on the hordes of ghetto Rangers that don't know what they're doing though.<br />
<br />
Something along these lines happened to me in Fungus Grove once, among friends who I group with often.  I managed a solo pull from a Shroom Cluster, my chanter friend immediately AOE mezzed, thinking they were all going to come running..../sigh obviously, all aggroed on her, everyone but our Cleric got dropped.<br />
<br />
I blame it on how tired we were though, it was way late, and we had been on a huge massive disgusting failure of a CoM raid all day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Corenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah...stuff like that happens all the time to me in dreadlands these days.<br />
i'll single pull from mobs hanging around each other (social), and people will be like &quot;yeah you're the best puller i've ever seen!&quot;, and be confused when only one chases after me. It's really sad how many people don't know what harmony does. Really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spritle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Keep this in mind.  EQ is over 3 years old now so there are tons of E-Bayed fools and PLed morons running rampant that have no clue how to play thier class, let alone what a Ranger can do.<br />
<br />
Its no freakin wonder Rangers get no respect.  With EQ/AM3, I've even been yelled at in exp groups for standing back during the fight and shooting my bow.  The fools have no clue that I am doing my job and applying max dps to the mobs.  As soon as the 900+ crits start landing they shut their pie holes and let me do my thing.  Sigh.</div></div><hr />

I guess some people think it's fun to hit 3333333333333333333333333333333333 for 6 hours straight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kohpry Mossarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sweet Mother, am I glad our ranger mains have the guild educated!  /boggle</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a misconception that rangers are easy to play in the high end game. They are NOT. <br />
<br />
We balance on the razors edge of having agro and not having agro if we are good, leaning to the not having it side. We know how to adjust our agro management for any given tank from a low agro 54 warrior to an uber 65 massive agro Pally/SK if we are good. We root park mobs like champs if we are good. We know to heal that Canni addict Shaman so the main healer doesn't have to if we are good. We know to put our DS on the MT if no better DS is available if we are good. Plus many many other duties......<br />
<br />
I have run into people who don't know what rangers can do in a group. Most of the time it's not thier fault. They just never grouped with one who knew how to play one.<br />
<br />
Cool thing is sometimes now when I group with people I've grouped with a few times they ask &quot;How long till trueshot Raen????&quot; LOL<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Strongboww's corpse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">aye. agree completely with you. <br />
<br />
my only recent experience with teaching was last night actually. Grouped with friends in PoI and had to pleasure of showing how we can actually snag aggro from the cleric, and place it squarely on the warriors shoulders.<br />
<br />
Looked bad to the warrior, he was yellin' til I dumped the aggro right on his lap and only took 1 bub o' health of damage vs. letting our healer die:D<br />
<br />
made me proud.</div></div><hr />
