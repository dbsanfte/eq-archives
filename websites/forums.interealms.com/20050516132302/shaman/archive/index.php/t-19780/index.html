<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Update 2/12/2004 <br />
------------------------ <br />
<br />
Tribute Update <br />
------------------------ <br />
<br />
The Tribute system as it was released has caused a greater variance in favor distribution than was intended. In order to make the system more healthy, fair, and balanced, there will be changes made over two updates -- one today and one next week. <br />
<br />
The following changes have been made today: <br />
<br />
- Favor Maximum: There will be a maximum limit of 200,000 favor that a player character can have available at any time. If a player has accumulated more than 200,000 favor at the time of this change, the character will retain its favor, but will not be able to add to it until it falls below 200,000. <br />
<br />
- Favor Value Adjustments to Items: Some items have had their favor value adjusted to be more appropriate. For this update, this will not affect the favor amount that a player has gained by handing in items that have had their favor values adjusted. <br />
<br />
For next week's update, we will be adjusting each character's favor amounts based on any items that were handed in to Tribute Masters that have had their favor values adjusted. <br />
<br />
We hope you continue to enjoy the benefits of the Tribute system and Gates of Discord. <br />
<br />
In other words: Play, raid and be merry, for tomorrow we nerf. <br />
<br />

<br />
I'm so glad they're fixing this.  I know several people who got enough tribute points off of tinkered bait to keep themselves in full favor buffs for several hundreds days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">grats all poeple who manage to take advantage of this.  and SoE test your expansion better, and actually think abit more!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some of you may be wondering why this wasn't tested in beta...<br />
Well Lets see.<br />
In order for the devs to have everyone test the expansion they closed all the zones except for the new GoD zones and the home towns. <br />
Sure you could create lvl one newbs but I don't think that you could even zone out to the newbie areas in most of the starting cities.<br />
And once you beta buffed, you char started in Abysmal after sitting at char select screen for a few minutes waiting for the server to move you from what ever locked zone you actually started in...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From people I've talked to 450k pts isnt uncommon.  Even someone that &quot;felt bad&quot; for doing it only racked up 150k on one person and 45k on another because it was just too damn easy to do.</div></div><hr />

I somewhat agree Jinheim but I found it more amusing than anything else. If someone else has 4 million points from 2cp I don't see how that could affect my gameplay. I really like the tribute system so far and it already made a difference to me raiding. I am interested to see how it affects my solo experience.<br />
<br />
I do laugh when I see some of these tribute point mishaps though.... do folks try everything they can think of? I just don't have the inclination to do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mainly I am just jealous that they took tribute masters down before my raid was done and I could take advantage of it myself  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Translation:<br />
<br />
We were too lazy to look up our own loot and price tables to begin with and now do some quick (and possibly wrong again) nerfs to fix the situation. As the tribute system is a completely new idea in the world of Norrath, we didn't find it necessary to look deeper into possible influences on the current game integrity.<br />
<br />
We would like to apologize for those problems, unfortunately we didn't have enough time to prevent them as we are indeed working already on the next half-assed expansion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ah well I guess that having players turn in old junk for lots of flavor was to much to ask (retro setting the gnome stuff to 0 flavor is ok I guess)<br />
I wonder if I can also get those items back if I dont like the new point value on them (PS getting 11.000.000+ flavor took a lot of items  ;) )<br />
<br />
One point I do wonder about is if they will use the same, silly, routine to put the points up the items (for those who did not knew it, there is a fixed routine to how much certain stats/effects grant in flavor and I admit it was way to easy to spot the high flavor items that way)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">nah, i'm glad that I never took advantage of something like that.  Why?  I'd rather not use something that is considering cheating, even something as painfully obvious as turning in the bait for 1 billion points.  We told our guild not to do it and although I'm sure a few still did, most people obliged.<br />
<br />
Anyways, to the above saying about beta.  Gotta realize that problably 50% of the people that we supposed to be in beta, never logged in.  I know a good solid 20 people that were supposed to help test stuff that never showed up until the last few days.  <br />
<br />
They did lock alot of the other zones.  But, I imagine part of it was because of people trying to create sol ro raids and such like that.  Halas was open and it was just as easy to get to there and back again.  Another thing is that things just sometimes get overlooked.  Hell, I never even went back to check the tribute guy in beta until the few days before it went live.  Why?  Becausae I didn't care.  I was there messing around with the AAs, spells, and hoping to catch some of the raids.  I didn't even think of it until around that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This problem with the tribute guys was reported in beta by myself and I know from at least 2 others. It's Sony who was too damn lazy to fix it. Feedback and bug reports were made, they just never acted on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When I looked at the system early in test the rewards were way lower than what they apparently were on release. At the time it appeared to me to be a method whereby the low to midlevel folks could get buffed by npcs rather than by players in PoK. Which was fine I guess, but i didnt think it would be too usefull to high level players due to the speed at which favor was consumed. Obviously stuff got changed between then and release to make it more attractive, and it would apear that the algorithim they used to calculate value had a few bugs in it (fishing bugs? :D) in it. The algorithims probably had the same bugs in those early stages, they just weren't as obvious due to the small amount of points awarded at that time.<br />
<br />
I suspect that after initially getting on beta and testing it out, most people didnt go back and look at it again later, which could be the reason why a clearly flawed system went live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the contrary, I think they did act on it.  I honestly think they chose to do nothing until after the bazaar was picked clean for the plain and simple reason that they wanted to revalue the mid-range items in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
Imagine how much stuff FLEW out of the bazaar and into the tribute masters auto-destroy satchel in the two days that this was live.  I'm not talking about the tinkering exploits, I'm talking about real items that people farmed or bought and turned in never to be seen again.  <br />
<br />
I find it kind of funny that next week the points that I legitimately earned (they set the value -- not me) are going to be taken away through revaluing.  I'm not angry or bitter; I expected it to happen.  So in the meantime, I'll spend my points at 175 every ten minutes and then after the nerf I'll never look at the tribute system again.  I was perfectly fine before the tribute system, and I'll be perfectly fine without it.  It doesnt offer anything in the way of value to me considering the current rewards.</div></div><hr />

Because they don't feel there is anything wrong with shamans to fix.  Even the shaman community can't agree whether we're balanced or not.  Every other class can at least agree, they think shaman are overpowered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
interesting... maybe it's because they don't actually play a shaman?<br />
<br />
it's one thing to watch a shaman, it's another to play one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ditto that.  I frequent the mage board, and one shaman who complained there about the poor treating shamans received in GoD was pretty much savaged.  The perception, among the mage compendium mages, at least, is that shamans got HUGE rewards in GoD relative to mages.  <br />
<br />
I play both a mage and a shaman, and to be honest I don't think it's even close.  Mages made out wayyyyy  better, with regard to AAs and spells, than shamans.  But JDs point about how everyone else thinks shamans are overpowered is dead-on-the-money.<br />

<br />
<br />
I see your point about it being on purpose to revalue the items, except for one thing.  SOE doesn't need to make a system like this to get rid of equipment in bazaar. If they wanted to, they could just create 1 (or many) characters with a bunch of money, buy up all the stuff, and destroy it.  Why create all this controversy with a new system to accomplish the same thing?  Sure, they would be adding new plat to the economy, but they still have the casino and revamped tradeskills to suck some of it back out.  I think it more likely that they did it on purpose to lure people into purchasing the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Khalle <br />
<br />
That would just put even more plat into the economy and cause even more issues</div></div><hr />

Because, while what you say is true, it would introduce more platinum into the economy.</div></div><hr />
