<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My server does . . . now.  I can't take credit cause Mathi was the first moderator and invited me to /join her channel she just made.  I put it on /autojoin shaman  and haven't looked back.  So far seems people use it for strats for shaman soloing, general shaman questions, gear questions, and the occasional silly comment.  I like it cause I feel like I am getting to know some of the other shamans on my server a bit.  <br />
<br />
Does your server have such a thing?  It's kinda hard for shamans to get to know each other I think, unless they're guildies.  We almost never group with other shamans for exp.  As a result, much shamanly wisdom is never passed down and we have a lotta high level noob shamans out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Every time I have joined, it was empty.  My server seems to be a little behind the times in channels, as the only massively used one that I am aware of is &quot;auction&quot;, and every now and then there's people in &quot;ports&quot;, but the rez/LFG/class channels seem to be missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have not seen any others in Mithaniel Marr. I have it set for auto as well. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spitulski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just set it to /autojoin cyber...Viscerator's usually in there so we can get some good strat talk in between the illicit chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree Lan. Have actually talked to a few Shaman on our server I never had before. One of the better ideas for EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">tried it a couple times on quell, i was the only one there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Too many channels as it is, I have to join three permanently, good thing one of them has very little traffic.<br />
<br />
/gu<br />
/chat raid<br />
/chat officer<br />
<br />
I don't think a lot of people really need any more chat spa. I mean, they implimented serverfilter for a reason, right now we are just replacing battle spam with chat spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I join the shaman channel, I'm creating it.  Nobody ever in it.<br />
<br />
Monk channel similarly bare.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is, the few times either of those channels have someone in them, they're generally not talkative or helpful.</div></div><hr />
