<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Picked up the cheap 8400pp horsie last night to complement JBB.  What others here have said is so true--this is a really fun combination for outdoor soloing.<br />
<br />
Tested it out soloing seafuries, which I had been doing a lot with JBB and no horse before.  The horse made a huge difference, being able to med while casting and JBB chain nuking.  Before and after used same tactic--let doggie tank and chain nuke with JBB, casting only a slow on the seafury to pull.<br />
<br />
Before horse, with constant single pulls, would scrape along at 20% mana and half health most of the time, because of canni back the mana from slows and no medding due to JBB chain nuking.<br />
<br />
After horse, with constant single pulls, was staying at full health and almost full mana, and was able to add one EBolt to the cycle.  Much faster and safer soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sweet , makes me want one  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Got a question about the mana regen with horsies...  thought it was said here that you still get it whether horse models are on or off.  Guildmate (wizzie) is saying that there is no mana regen with them turned off...  10:20 from zero to FM on the horse, but only regained 45% mana in that same time, with horse models off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Will have to test it myself tonight; I was playing with model on for the heck of it.  However, from what I have read here, the other two conditions to getting mana regen are no moving around (although pivot supposedly is ok) and melee attack off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think horse models have to be on but you dont have to have your race model on.<br />
<br />
BTW did your wizard friend click jboots or something?  you need to cast or click something to update the manabar while on a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it works with models off. The only factors are you cannot run/walk or be attacking. The mana bar will not update untill you cast a spell or use a click item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Definitely works with horse models off. You just don't see your mana bar update (increase) like normal. It will only update when you cast a spell.  So you could be standing there for an hour and your mana bar will look as if it never increased or filled up. Once you cast a spell, any spell (including JBB). Your mana bar will update and reflect how much mana you have. So while chain casting your JBB, you should see your mana increase with every cast.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are a Shaman, and you bought the cheapest horse (which is smart choice), then its best to have Horse models turned off anyways. That way your SoW will take effect and overwrite the horse speed.<br />
<br />
While standing still and chaincasting JBB. you will be gainig back mana as if you were sitting and meditating. Anytime you move or attack (melee) then you willo not get the meditate effect.<br />
What I do, is turn attack on just as the JBB spell lands, then turn attack off while casting JBB again (8 secs). That way you get that extra melee attack dmg in there, while medding 95% of the time.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps clear up any confusion. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tevash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Very useful for high end solos...I dont think i will ever feel comfortable soloing in CT..but the horse definately helps a lot. I also love that fact that there is no visible knockback on horseback...not as disorienting to me. Very nice to get those ticks in...but I will warn you of one thing...Torpor + Cheap horse = barely moving if you have to get away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, it worked as of last night.<br />
The problem a lot of folks run into, is that the bar doesn't refresh until you cast a spel or click an item. <br />
<br />
I didn't think it was working the first time I used the horse, I got really low on mojo and just stood there.  My bar wasn't moving, then I clicked my JBB and it jumped like 3 bubbles.<br />
<br />
Test it out...it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep, I concur, it works with horse models off.  One canni will update the mana bar, so it is not a big deal.<br />
<br />
Horses do work inside Karnor's, as an outdoor dungeon.  I don't know why I never see horses in there, but I used horse last night inside KC and made a big difference even in a group situation.  Once the slowing is done, you can either canni without worrying about the timing, or blast away with JBB, all the time confident that you are still medding.  I was also able shrink myself while on a horse to get out of the line of sight more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't know why I never see horses in there<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably because you have the horse models off :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Umm, There is absolutely no upside to keeping the horse models on if you are a shaman who owns a horse.  <br />
<br />
With them on you lose: <br />
1) Movement speed of Sow/RS3<br />
2) Ability to interrupt spells by ducking<br />
3) Ability to target with the mouse worth a %^$<br />
4) Ability to see worth a *$(&amp;^(<br />
5) Ability to start and stop moving quickly - which makes for more interrupted spells.<br />
<br />
And you Gain:<br />
1) Pretty horsie graphic<br />
2) Happy horsie trotting sounds<br />
<br />
Automed works great with models off.  The mana bar update issue is what fools lots of people including myself at first.  The only thing I am unsure of is the Invis bug effect.  I have not been able to get invis to function with or without models on though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And you Gain:<br />
1) Pretty horsie graphic <br />
2) Happy horsie trotting sounds <br />
  <br />
<br />
There are a couple other advantages...though not enough of a reason to turn on horse models.<br />
<br />
You gain an innate Safe Fall skill of roughly 150. <br />
<br />
You move at the speed of the horse, independent of encumbrance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nice one, Kronen, hehe.  But last night was the first night I ever turned models off in KC, and before that I have never seen a horse in there on my server.  Maybe this horse thing will start catching on.  Many folks commented on my horse in KC like it was a surprise to them.<br />
<br />
The encumbrance issue is one other advantage of horse, as I noted soloing SF's and gornit.  I could load up on over 350 stones of loot and keep moving at horse speed with models turned on.  Has anywone actually confirmed that you lose this encumbrance benefit with horse models off?</div></div><hr />
