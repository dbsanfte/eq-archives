<br />
Take a look at this more doublespeak and hedgeing of bets going on. <br />
<br />
<br />
We May (Stress May) get around to it (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=1524) <br />
<br />
Are things really changing. Or is it more Perception management.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dude, tenative means &quot;may&quot;. Which would you rather have, a new thing come out in a patch and have it be broken? The aug change is coming. Its not going to be released until its ready. I am no computer programmer, but I do know it takes more than just a couple lines to code this stuff in. What would people say if they went &quot;live&quot; with the aug removal and then they just started poofing when people tried to remove them? Why, EVERYONE WOULD BITCH, thats what. But wait, everyone is bitching now!! Its like a Joseph Heller novel, is the problem. <br />
<br />
Aug removal isnt necessary right this minute. There is no better armor to put it in (or, rather, if you are getting much better armor, your also getting better augs, like 30/30s, and +60-90 hps, etc). <br />
<br />
They did dance around your other questions, though, but honestly, what else could we expect? Changes are coming, albeit rather slowly, they are coming.</div></div><hr />

The two things are not arguing the same thing. Tenative patch Date. With solid information reguarding the patch items.<br />
<br />
Or Solid patch date with Nebulous Patch items..<br />
<br />
Which is the old way of doing things all while saying we care!<br />
<br />
Think about it man. I am playing again. And enjoying myself again. Despite SOE. <br />
<br />
Think about that please. We have fun despite what the developers are doing what does that tell you. <br />

Dang. I really have to work on my ability to resist impulses. I didn't use prison rape, but rectally violated instead. Sounded more professional ;)<br />
