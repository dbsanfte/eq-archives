<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So there I was, in the Plane of Nightmare when a 65 enchanter walked up and asked to join our group.  Group was then a 61 pally, and a 61 shm (me).  She was invited, and then proceded to charm the next Hobgoblin that we pulled.   Impressive I thought.  She hasted it, and next thing I know she's adding a good 300 dps to our group.  Sheesh!<br />
<br />
Later on, she ditches the Hobgoblin and goes in pursuit of a more suitable pet.  She tracks down a Horror Nightmare!  He cons yellow, a level 62 mob.  She goes on about how hard, and dangerous it is to keep a beast of such power tamed.  The risk is soo high (yeah right).<br />
<br />
As we are pulling more Hobgoblins, the poor suckers found themselves unable to mitigate the damage dished out by this horse.  He was hitting for max damage pretty much everytime, dealing a good 560 each hit, slicing and dicing away once every second.  As most shamans could tell you, our pets are not known for having a great deal of hit points, so when the mob enranges (hobgoblins enrange), one usually spams &quot;Pet back off&quot; a couple times.  Didn't have to bother.  Seconds after it enraged it was dead.<br />
<br />
Pulls were pretty easy.  We would pull a hobgoblin.  I would cast three spells sequentially.  Malo/slow the mob, then CH on the paladin.  By the time the CH landed, the goblins was dead.  15-20 seconds tops.  Eventually the paladin learned to just back off, and let the Nightmare do the tanking.  Then I would just slow.  Eventually I stopped slowing too.  Basically we were just a couple of leeches.<br />
<br />
To sum up.. enchanters make the best duo partner hands down after 64 and a few aa's into domonance.  Keep up the good work Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah..cant believe charm isnt nerfed yet..<br />
was in pov the other day, with a druid, went and charmed a frog and brought it back<br />
just for kicks he disbanded for a pull and ks'd a 65 rogue 62 sham 65 wiz 63 war and 62 bard..it was sad...<br />
can only imagine what it would be like with a chanter with a more powerful pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Charm is the only thing keeping me playing ATM.  I hate exping, I hate exping for hours on end fighting the same boring mobs and getting minor exp.  I'm lucky to have several cod enchanters that I'm friends with.  If they nerf it, i'll probably quit.<br />
<br />
Personally I blame it on the guy that designed loio.  A long while ago a patch message that announced some new zone mentioned that SOE was very happy with the amount of people that used loio, and that they were trying to emulate that zone in new content.  <br />
<br />
Since then, we have been blessed with the amazing fun outdoor luclin zones, and the even more fun outdoor pop zones.  Zones that any monkey can pull singles from for hours on end, in a perfectly safe and repetitive enviorment. <br />
<br />
I have to have something to keep me interested, I have a small attention span.  Dealing with unpredictable pets does this for me.  So does figuring out how to optimize the pulling techniques to get the timing just right for max killage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">XP in Crypt of Decay Colal, once you get past the soloing necros and away from the zone in its a fantastic zone, it's about as close as pop gets to having a proper dungeon, and whilst it may not be as good xp/loot as the likes of tactics, theres plenty of variety in the mobs and named to keep it fun, and the loot isnt exactly bad either.</div></div><hr />
