<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Isammu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a new website up located HERE (http://mascotonline.net) That has various everquest movies made by various guilds and players across all servers.<br />
<br />
What I am trying to do is get a collection of them as a sort of library, I have seen people looking for certain movies and not being able to find them so I wanted to make a place where people could find the video they are looking for.<br />
<br />
I am always looking for more videos and also flash movies if you know of any drop by my site and post on the message board so I can get them.<br />
<br />
Also im working on a screenshot video made up of the best &quot;action&quot; screenshots across all servers so if you have a good screenshot I would love to use it in the video.<br />
<br />
Since I am looking across all servers you will see this message on different class and server boards. So if you have any Suggestions or tips or links to flash video or screenshots let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />
