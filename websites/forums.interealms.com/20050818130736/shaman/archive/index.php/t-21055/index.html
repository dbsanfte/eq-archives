<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After months off from EQ I think I'm back. I had cancelled one account but didn't uninstall EQ from my computer and destroy my cds. Silly me.<br />
<br />
During that time I let my son play my shaman. He only did a few times in which he kept jumping off the spires in the Dreadlands and dying. So anyway, a week or two ago I log on and I'm naked without a corpse around. Bah, almost two years worth of items lost to corpse decay. It seems this had happened a few weeks before the graveyard started so that doesn't help.<br />
<br />
I sent an email to the GM link on Sony's website and petitioned twice. The second time I petitioned the Guide said that he was forwarding my request. Now since I've never petitioned before or have had to deal with a GM does anyone have any advice on what I can expect? Should I bug them every few days? Wait a while?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Petition and email everyday.  Good luck, GMs are the rarest of the rare spawn these days.  You'll have better luck finding Amelia Earhart.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Um, just try the new corpse recovery thing, if this was a death and rot that occured after that was in place, your body is recoverable.</div></div><hr />

If you have no friends, n00bie armor quests should be easily do-able.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is a global graveyard zone where your corpse goes if you left your toon to rot for more that 7 days.  Ask around in game and if you died after the patch went in for this your stuff should be recoverable.</div></div><hr />

It is all so clear now. Some developer saw the logs on this shaman behavior and around the coffee table chatted with his friends:<br />
<br />
/dev 1: Take a look at these logs. There is a shaman occassionally suiciding off the DL spires.<br />
<br />
/dev 2: Cool, look at the damage from that fall. 20k! But what are you showing this to us for? Thinking of giving all shaman safe fall?<br />
<br />
/dev 1: No way! Just wondering what we need to do to get more of them to do it. It would certainly solve our slow/buff/heal problems with those whiners.<br />
<br />
... the rest, as we have seen from recent patches, is ... history.<br />
<br />
&lt;sorry, couldn't resist&gt;<br />
<br />
As for your problem, fill in some details ... what level are you (now ... and out of crude curiosity ... what level were you)? It would help to give you some clues on where to go to fix those empty slots the fastest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As I had said it was a little bit before the graveyard so that won't help. (I checked)<br />
<br />
I was level 62 now 54. Though the levels hurt I care more about the items and the pride/memories/work of getting them. I know what I have to do to get going again but I probably won't. If I can't get the items back I'll probably start from scratch with a new shammy.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I'll petition a bit more and try not to think about it. (sob, sob)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it took me over a month of almost daily petitions to get help with a surname...good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shaman are a lot of fun, but new upgrades and style for EQ is short sharp fights. Shaman do really well in long slow fights with predictable and manageble damage spikes. If you are going to start over, you might consider one of the two new dps classes, beastlords or berzerkers, or even the holy trinity of warrior, cleric, or enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Good god, do you guys even read?<br />
<br />
He said it was months ago that he lost his corpse.<br />
<br />
My advice is to not stick around online waiting for GM's to show up or to care or do anything.  In-game service doesn't happen all that much.  E-mails will often get you very polite and timely and competent service, however.  There's a weird divergence in the quality of service in-game and out, so just stick with what works and forget petitioning online.  Don't e-mail every day or in some creepy, crazy fashion, either; that's no way to get on anyone's good side.  And considering the kind of problem you described, I think you need to be on their good side indeed.  <br />
<br />
Not that they wouldn't want your money once you restarted your account -- but it's a weird problem and you want them on your side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My advice would be to contact a GM via email from the EQ site, and follow up the email every 3 days or so if you haven't heard any reply, until its fixed or you give up.<br />
<br />
In the meantime I'd start a new character, not a shaman, and enjoy the game from the lower levels again. If and when a GM restores your shaman you can then decide which character you want to continue with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, I've started a Mage while I wait. I'll probably try a few others I've never played. I'll probably do the email to a GM every few days and maybe petition once a week. It's been actually fun and refreshing to start over with almost nothing. I was actually to Erudin for the first time ever.<br />
<br />
Well, thanks for all your advice. Happy hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So I've been alternating between emailing the GM and petitioning every day. Last night I'm in PoK with my new Mage and a message pops up about a soul needing help at the ancient combine spires in the dreaded lands. What!?! Soul, spires, dreadlands! My body must be back. Yeahh. So I log on my Shaman and run to the dreadlands. <br />
<br />
Well, it didn't take long for me to realize this was the start of a GM event where my body should have been. Being very let down I felt like climbing the spires and jumping to my death. But, I figured it was a GM event so a GM must be on. So I sent my petition in again. I waited around a while watching people with equipment killing giant undead skellies. I got tired of waiting and logged on my Mage.<br />
<br />
Back in PoK my Mage promptly gets stuck while running past a tree. I get pissed and go afk to grab a beer. I get back and a GM sent me a tell. I reply back that I was sorry I missed his tell but I'm back now. He tells me he'll get back to me in a few minutes. Meanwhile I'm still stuck in a tree. I can't cast gate, I can't sit to camp out and I don't want to quit the EQ program because the GM will try to talk to me while I'm gone. No druids respond to port me so I'm stuck there getting pissed.<br />
<br />
After 45 minutes the GM &quot;Senior Guide&quot; as it ends up, gets back to me. He is going to forward my request to the GM. This time I ask how long it may take. He tells me probably tomorrow. That was the only good laugh I had all night.<br />
<br />
I end the EQ program and log back on. I'm still stuck in the tree. This time a druid helps port me out. EQ came every close to being uninstalled and my cds burned last night. Sorry to go on and on but I needed to get that out.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />
