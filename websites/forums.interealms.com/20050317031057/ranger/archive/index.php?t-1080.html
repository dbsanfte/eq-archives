You mean our helm of ugliness? More like a curse...<br />
PS Karana sucks!</div></div><hr />

I have no clue what people are still up in arms about.  I mean there is a neck and sword and maybe a wrist piece but that isn't all that much and thats only the pallies and clerics of tunare.

My guess is &quot;Invoke Snowstorm&quot;, for Karana followers. +100 dex 1hs, not lore, procs like mad.<br />
<br />
What? Me hate rain? no way ;)</div></div><hr />

My one wish is they don't make Karana out to be a wuss. I read something about a quest where you're to help him regain control of his own plane &lt;groan&gt; Guess there is only so much damage you can do with rain :/</div></div><hr />

Besides, Tunare is the earthmother...the goddess of nature, yes?  Well, rangers are very in tune with nature...not weather.  I think it was stupid to allow rangers and druids to choose any other gods other than Tunare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
noooo.  more like the blessed faydark bows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinvaras</div><div class="date">09-17-2002, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tunare Rangers got the helm when it was still a really nice piece of gear, the Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt (about the best bow pre primal), and the Tunare only arrows to match. I know they're only one more point of damage but it's one more point that Karana rangers didn't get. <br />
<br />
After all the emails and /feedback reports I've submitted and urged others to submit, I certainly hope we see some good drops for the Humans and Half Elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tefanus</div><div class="date">09-22-2002, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have to agree with most of you peeps.  Karana worshipers get screwed when it comes to deity sutff.  Tunare ranger get awesome bows and helm of the tracker and we get what?  a 12/27 sword?  I just hope theres some good Karana stuff in PoP or im gonna be pissed.   <br />
<br />
Good day to ya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChromeTalon</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does Diety really matter?  Shouldn't the best bow in the game be made by a Ranger?  Regardless of which god he/she worships.  I'm still grumpy that some Woodelf DRUID makes a better bow than my Half-Elf RANGER ever will.  Where is the fairness in that? :confused:</div></div><hr />

&quot;Storm Forged Armor&quot; (black plate or chain looking...outstanding)..I still remember my first sight of a Half-Elf ranger in black iron mail and dual weilding Yakeshas....I knew I had to be a Ranger..(Yes I am old school..)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relios</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i say give kanara ranger a helm , and a bow ,<br />
with different stats than the tunare ones but similar so no-one gets into a fuss</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samanthie</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Ranger of the karana faith, the stormkeeper, I should very much like to get a clicky earing that can change weather patterns.  Equipable at level 65 only perhaps.  I grow so tired of sunny snowless days -- I should like everyone to slog it out in the rain and snow all the time.  (jk - I love sunny days ... but we should have some power over the nature's elements and opals are a pain to pack around)<br />
<br />
As for the one time switch in Faith -- perhaps link it to paying/questing for a pennace item that you pass to a cleric of your new faith for &quot;conversion&quot;<br />
<br />
Something along the line of a cold spell item as well -- perhaps a mantle of snowstrike or something ... Having speant most of my life in cold weather locations (Everfrost and Velious locations galore I have speant 90% of all my EQ time in cold weather climates)  <br />
<br />
I should like to see some form of specialization, at least among rangers - to keep us from looking like cookie cutter stuff.  Personally I would chose to focus on cold weather, as listed above.  Other rangers might chose Fire, lightning or Rain with each specialization having certain armours.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a Faith based Dye tub to change the colour of our armours --not sure if the hard coding would allow it --- might also make 1000 new all dressed in Black rangers on my server :-( -- <br />
<br />
A faith based robe / dress for us female Half-elves.  I do not often get invited to a dance or festival much, but sometimes I do like to dress up.  Sadly there is no Half -elf robe modle :(<br />
<br />
Sadley  the younger 50-59 crowd of Karana rangers, a rather vocal group to say the least, have gotton the shorter end of the stick.  In time however other items replace the helm and the bow, and everyone hits the same playing field again when they start raiding NTOV level mobs.<br />
<br />
so as I ramble on here venting my frustrations-- I ponder what types of items would you like your diety to grant you?  :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kohpry Mossarrow</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beats me why we wood elves can't at least incorporate imbued plains pebbles into a Karana equivalent of Blessed Champion Arrows or BFTs for our Surefall brothers and sisters.  It would be a step in the right direction for the Karana-worshippers and (I think) require minimal coding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deadman1204</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually i hope they dont make any uber karana only stuff, unless its balanced with tunare stuff.<br />
Honestly, i want the whining to END! Besides, why extend the unfairness instead of doing away with it all together</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirTamalot</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I'm a half Elf kanara Ranger lvl 60.  I think kanara got rip-off when PoG open up. I remember clearly before I pick diety that kanara was a fellow of tunare.  The first jab was the tracker helm after doing the quest found out that I couldn't equipped. 2nd punch since I am a half elf I have no culture armor. Final blow was not able to fletcher the bow and arrow. And now PoP released we demand karana diety gear to be superior to Tunae.  Kanara diety waited half a year for PoP.  Now, The wait is over, maybe the playing field will favor karana. I said to VI give all ranger a break we not fighting in regular zone to get our stuff anymore now is Plane of hell. This is my 2cp</div></div><hr />

You cannot make any cultural armor, but you can wear both human and elven cultural.</div></div><hr />
