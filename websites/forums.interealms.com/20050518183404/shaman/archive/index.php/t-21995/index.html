That's a thread on the SK board, once you get to page 3 you begin to wade into what a few of them think of current shaman issues. I'm not past page 3, so don't hold me responsible for what's written past that.</div></div><hr />

Shamans are the kings of older content....basically a must have 1 year ago, they are quickly sliding into the shadows and sometimes have to be drug along..OoW may change that with the new buffs that SOE has finally decided might be a good idea (+ avoidance, + strikethrough, + damage etc) instead of more rehashed +60 to stat crap.</div></div><hr />

Interestingly enough we have a lot issues on raids ten we do in groups, at least in GoD.<br />
<br />
Blood of Nadox is very useful (as opposed to using it on a single MOB in PoF), you more or less have to slow multiple adds on a lot of raids or they will aggro on the healers, there generally is enough of them to go around to make multiple shaman useful.<br />
<br />
It may not be perfect but it is a lot better then what we do in GoD groups.<br />
<br />
Edit: I just read the post you probably meant. And he specifically says shaman are fine because they can regain mana so fast. And they are talking about Ikkinz trials. Bleh.</div></div><hr />

I know Brael very well.  Hes a good guy and certainly understands his class.  Hes certainly not anti-Shaman, trust me.  <br />
<br />
What I think what you are seeing is something very typical in EQ, especially on class boards with people in the high end.<br />
<br />
There is what we know about our class, and what we think we know about the other classes.  I think as you play longer and get more high end, you tend to think that the delta between truth and perception gets smaller.<br />
<br />
Thats why I always never try to talk DRU and CLR when I am discussing our problems.  <br />
<br />
I think its great that the SK's are feeling our pain, god knows they are feeling some pain as well.  But just as any SK cant fully understand our issues and pain, we wont understand theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Who'd invite a shaman when you can get a beastlord or chanter, unless the shammy's a friend?<br />
<br />
They're the only slowing class that doesn't also provide significant DPS or CC.<br />
<br />
Too one-dimensional for today's game where you're usually trying to juggle multifunctional classes to squeeze those magic 3 DPS members into a balanced group.<br />
<br />
Luckily slowers are at a premium so they DO get groups for non-trivial content.<br />
<br />
But they're rarely first choice. <br />
<br />
/sigh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Georgina Ofthejungle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, at least now we can show the dev's who think we're &quot;overpowered&quot; that not only us shammies think that we're obsolete now :(<br />
<br />
Can us shammies have some new content now? Please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't want to get in a face-off with Brael, so we could use some other shamans there making our points.  I think SK's are more natural allies to us than druids/clerics are, and it would be great if they particularly realized where we're at.  If they don't, as another nerfed class, I really find it hard to believe anybody else will.<br />
<br />
So maybe if we're in the mood to convince people, we can make some well-stated, positive posts there to see if we can communicate our concerns?  The SK boards can be surprisingly stubborn for a group of people who otherwise on the whole seem to have an unusually clear perspective of the game, but it's not usually a negative-intention thing, and since they as hybrids have had a taste of what being second and third best is all about, sometimes they can be well worth talking to, also.<br />
<br />
Anyway,  the thread is worth popping over to to check out.  It would be nice if we could use it to keep a dialogue going, because SK's could probably use a better understanding of what it's really like for shamans and how much we have in common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">that really pisses me off.. they assume SoE isnt doing anything. its not EASY to change the game around they have to do it VERY carefully i bet to not mess the game up.. i understand yall getting mad at the class unbalance but just chill out it will get fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Exes . . . horsepucky!  Seriously, 90% of our inbalance is a fucntion of poorly designed spells.  In our case, it is substantially easy to fix.  Spells are designed to be changed quickly, easily, and efficiently.  Our current heal problems?  Change Daluda's to 1800 base and push it to live.  Our nuke issues?  Shave 2.5 seconds off the cast time of Velium Strike.  How about our DoT or mana regen issues?  Reduce the number of tics, increase the dps per tic.  Reduce the mana cost of certain spells.  Decrease the cast time of malos.<br />
<br />
How about the damage we take as 'battle priests' if that is still even a definition?  Simply raise our dodge cap.<br />
<br />
Almost none of the problems we are having are really that difficult to fix from a balance perspective.  Our problem is that no one at SoE gives a rat's ass about it.  That, or like Ryan, they're so completely enamored of the mystical and abounding effects of slow that no one else can appreciate, that they won't change anything at all.<br />
<br />
This isn't so much of a wait and see issue, as opposed to find someone with a clue to talk to over there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A number of other class people have been posting on the development boards of sony's site, in favor of what we are asking for.<br />
<br />
Exes I think that assumption comes from the fact that we have never received mush attention since kunark.  How much long should we wait?  It was simple enough for them to make a hybrid of our class and give them buffs/slows that a basically equal to or better than ours.  Do you realize that most lvl 65 shamans are slowing with a lvl 51 spell?  Yes they released a new one with GoD, but according to SoE we don't need all of our spells.  Most shaman will not see that new slow unless it becomes droppabale.  Should we have to purchase the new expansion to become useful?   Exes at lvl 13 a shaman is a battle priest enjoy those days now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think half the aggravation have been the blind responses and the complete lack of responses that Shaman have gotten. The last time SoE listened, was changing the garbage spells around that came out with PoP. And that was just fixing an act of stupidity on their part. Beyond that, issues have been raised and brought up. Peitioned repeatedly. Emails have been sent. People have TRIED to talk politely often and repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Now it's a matter of &quot;maybe is we yell and scream and cry like druids, they might listen&quot;. Eventually they may just finally take notice and put a new nook in our mouths, but atleast they will have paid attention to us.<br />
<br />
Right now, I'm just waiting for the next request from those poor board mods and CS folks to &quot;Post what we think is in need of improvement&quot; yet Again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">o when u explained it it made sense.. i guess yall r right :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think the problem is how to balance the shaman class so we are once again wanted in groups and not over powered.<br />
<br />
I recall leveling my shaman up when i started was a pain all my friends shot ahead of me when i finally reached the high end game I was considered powerful but it took me 2 to 3 times as long to reach that level as they did.<br />
<br />
Sit down read all the classes concern's most of them read as such and such class is more powerful then us because. Nearly always they place enough suggestions on board if implemented would overpower the class. The trick is to balance all the classes without totally unbalancing the game.<br />
<br />
It is hard enough to think what would make our class unique and wanted again within high end groups without detracting from another class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">So go check out the SK thread and get them understanding us.  If they don't understand us, with all the nerfage they have in common with us, nobody will.  <br />
<br />
We might as well try to convince potentially the easiest people to convince.  If we can't even do that, ugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">the new buffs look lovely...+10% to melee dmg for the &quot;new focus&quot; would be awesome. <br />
<br />
group avatar would be wonderful.<br />
<br />
group quiesence would be...wow.<br />
<br />
give Bane and Anathema MR check mods like necro version. would eliminate our need to malos in advance to stick them, which would allow us to stick them sooner. with ca3, we suddenly have useful dps in 30 second fights. <br />
<br />
rather than a slow, why not a % debuff to direct melee? ie...give us something unique along the lines of a spell that reduces mob melee output by X% as a direct effect. give it an MR check mod to allow its use in short-combat situations...i'd still be perfectly happy if the end result were a simple 10% decrease in melee output, as long as it stuck FAST. 20% would be even better, and certainly livable, IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
i try to look at everything in terms of what we're supposed to be--buffer/debuffers rather than healing specialists, and DoT casters rather than another nuking class. i LIKE that. screw any changes to Velium Strike. give me a -200 mod to target's MR when checking against Bane, and i'm a happy camper.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
that said, i love being a shammy, and i'm having more fun than ever in game. i'm not in the end content yet, so a lot of these problems are more conceptual to me than real, but i'm not going to give up on being a sham, not going to cancel account, and not going to resort to making an alt to focus on instead of main.<br />
<br />
<br />
here to stay.<br />

On PoN (paladin message board), any poster that asserts that shaman should outheal paladins is called a troll.  This is the same loving crew that got the clerics hammers nerfed and are currently calling for warriors to loose defensive.  With allies like that, who needs france?<br />

Yes, PoN is a cesspool of hypocrisy and exaggeration.  <br />
<br />
It's probably the worse EQ class board in those areas.</div></div><hr />
