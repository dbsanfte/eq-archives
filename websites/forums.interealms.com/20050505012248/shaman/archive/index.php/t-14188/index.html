<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know the maximum amount of plat that a character can hold (either in bank or on person)? I am not concerned about weight. I want to know the actual number size that is limited by Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haven't seen a limit, I know of numbers over a million easy.<br />
<br />
Just from a programming standpoint, I'll wager a GUESS at just over 2 billion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's good. Reason I am asking because I am trying to hit one meeellion plat on my vendor before I totally quit EQ. I am 1/5 of the way there and hope I can accomplish this goal by Dec. '03.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heh.  It's well above 1 million.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Let's also see how fast you can run to meet me at the bank with that much cash when you do decide to quit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its way over a million</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All I know is that I:<br />
1.  would HATE to be consolodating gold to PP and see my 1M+ go to 1PP!<br />
2.  will NEVER have to worry about #1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">convert all your plat to copper, they're going to be the same number limit (if there is one), and you can hit the copper one a lot easier.<br />
<br />
But yeah, it's well over a million.  4,294,967,295 would be an unsigned long (32 bit) type, so that's a good bet, but if you consider what might happen if someone put more than that in their bank (crash, lose that much plat?), they probably went safely with a 64 bit integer, which would put the max at a number obscenely large.</div></div><hr />
