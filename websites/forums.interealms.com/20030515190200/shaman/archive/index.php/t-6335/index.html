<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a guildless shaman and have found another shaman(with epic) from a raiding guild willing to MQ a Tear.<br />
<br />
Is it possible for another shaman to MQ the tear or does it have to come from the shaman working on epic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">any shaman can do it as long as they have max ally with truespirit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are there faction hits when you get the tear from the Broodling in Fear?  And is there a faction hit when you hand in to Rak?<br />
<br />
I have just reached ally with TrueSpirit after handing in Neh'Ashiir's diary, but not max ally.  <br />
<br />
An epic shaman in my guild has an extra tear, but if I miss faction hits with him MQ'ing it, then I would rather wait and get my own tear I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">- Yes, there is a faction hit when you turn the tear into rak. <br />
- No, there is not one when you kill the Broodling.<br />
<br />
If the epic shaman has not taken any faction hits, he can hand in the tear and aggro rak. You loot the scale. <br />
<br />
*BEFORE* turning the scale in, max your faction. Hand the scale in and you have an epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How do you know if you have max ally True Spirit faction?  What can I do to get this faction maxxed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I plan on doing Woe/Envy/Marr's Promise till I max ally.<br />
I could probably do Ghiosk's 3 books too I suppose, since my guild needs lots of reaver drops.<br />
<br />
In your case, do Woe/Envy/Marr's a few times, you will know ally is maxed when you  see &quot;Your faction with TrueSpirit cannot get any better&quot; or something to that effect.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've been told if you say &quot;what spear of fate&quot; and get an answer from the dog in the lake, you're good to go.<br />
<br />
But I've got all my pieces to do the quest legit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ThrugaiSL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did this about 2 weeks ago, shaman handing in the tear had max faction, and when i got the scales, i have max faction handing the scales to the spirit, and got me spear fine :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">MQing your epic is gimp, just do the quest like normal...it's actually pretty fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Question for any might know, Recently guild did Fear due to LD issues 1018 etc, was not able to loot Tear, and no other shaman was available, so a wizard looted tear for mq to me. Is it possible for him to mq or MUST it be a shaman ? And if so, how do we get him the faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Must be a Shaman. No other class can get their faction high enough -- they all start apprehensive to Truespirit while Shaman start indifferent. Rak will eat the tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually, any class can do the start of the shaman epic, and get to amiable or better. I know a guild wizard who fell foul of the wizard epic faction bug, and did just that the second time around to get his faction up. He did the shaman epic up to Woe/Envy, I believe.<br />
<br />
The only thing is, to start it off, you need an enchanter to charm the hand in mob, until you get up to indifferent.<br />
<br />
So, I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to get another char up to ally with Truespirit, but there may be an additional check that it's a shaman doing the hand in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Must be a Shaman. No other class can get their faction high enough -- they all start apprehensive to Truespirit while Shaman start indifferent. Rak will eat the tear.<br />
<br />
WRONG. Truespirit faction is actually used for several of the epics. The sk one off hand also uses it and I beleive the wizzy one too. Anyone who has raised thier faction to sufficient level should be able to MQ the tear for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aye, i thought wizzy had truespirit faction, was kinda hopin for some firsthand info on if a non shaman had mq'd lately =/ Nervous about losing tear, but i figure it wont really set me back in epic and its either lose it or it rots in his bank hehe. can get his faction up i think doing woe/envy/marr as hes working on his epic atm so has some faction already.  Wish the golems werent so contested on my server, its rather hard to find them up or i wouldnt even worry much about the MQ. LD's allways hapen at the worst time heh.</div></div><hr />
