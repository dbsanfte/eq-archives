I was hoping if somone can give me some insite on a Iksar shaman tell me the pros and cons. Im just glad that trading on Drinal Server in the baazar now not north freeport. :) <br />

Bear form has no faction modifiers at all. <br />
<br />
Iksar Pros: <br />
1) Innate Regen, at 65 I have 21 standing regen without equipement or AAs. Self buffed I regen at over 50hp pet tic standing.<br />
2) Best newbie zone in the game<br />
3) Cudgel Quest faction is automatic<br />
4) Infravision<br />
5) Swim at 100 skill at birth<br />
6) Small AC bonus<br />
7) Forage (skill locked at 50 from birth)<br />
8) Best looking shaman of them all<br />
<br />
Iksar Cons:<br />
1) 20% experience penalty (same as Troll)<br />
2) Faction (but very minor, only old world cities)<br />
3) Cannot use JBB (nice 20000pp damage toy to help level from 45 to 55)<br />
4) Have to get a friend to buy the odd level 50+ spell from OT or FV for you unless you build a little faction.<br />
<br />
If you are going hard-core then Ogre for no frontal stun and a few extra HP. If you are a casual player who plays for fun, go with the race you think will be most fun to play. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">FYI , exp penalties used to be null and void once inside a city. If this is still the case then you might wanna take that into consideration</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Iksar &gt; all =) Biased opinion /shrug. Its really about fun for me, i picked the race for the rp aspect of it, even if i dont rp all the time. I havent really noticed the xp penalty holding me back either...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I play a pretty mean Iksar shaman and I love him. I've often thought about different races and whether Iksar was the best choice or not. It's not an easy question, I love all the races. Ogurs and Trolls are prolly my second favorite next to Iksar. Iksar are so cool, they have a fantastic culture and they are relatively unique. There aren't a lot of high lvl Iksar on most servers. That 20% xp penalty gets a little rough though in the late 50's so thats something to consider. Vah Shir are probably the easiest race to lvl so you may want to stick with your original char. Also, Iksar can't use a JBB so thats a drawback too. But in the end, if you plan on really playing this char for the long haul, it won't matter what race you pick as your stats will be maxxed and you'll be decked out either way. <br />
<br />
Choose the race that you won't get tired of playing after three years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I started my iksar shammy as an alt for something different.  She's now my main and my original main (HEF bard) is pretty much retired.  I love playing her!<br />
 <br />
Haven't been much affected by the exp penalty.  Don't nuke much, so I don't miss the jbb (I usually just toss in a nuke on runners).  Love tankin with dogdog by my side.<br />
<br />
And tho I'm only 48 and not a black bear yet, I'm probably the cutest darn lizard shaman on my server   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only 2nd hand information for me, have a friend who plays an iksar shaman and she pisses and moans about the xp penalty. (I think we kinda torment her though, by talking about how much our xp bar moved in the past hour or three while grouping...hehe.)<br />
<br />
If scaley is what you want, tho, go for it. Worst case, you get to a higher level and realize that it wasn't worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tailz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I first went iksar...and loved it to begin with, but as I got into the late 30's/40's and grouped in DL (well populated at the time) I noticed the exp penalty really starting to show. By 50 I gave up.<br />
<br />
When Venril Sathir came up I made a Vah Shir shammie and I've never looked back...far nicer, and there tend not to be very many for some reason - always nice to be different I think ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When you choose Iksar, you are choosing the best race for Shaman. We are unlike any other race on Norrath. Deep heritage and history. We will be slaves to NO ONE !! <br />
The 20% exp penalty doesn't bother me because my former Main was/is a 43 Iksar Shadow Knight. My other characters are either Troll or Iksar, so I'm used to the exp penalty. <br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Innate regen<br />
100 swim skill at birth<br />
Best newbie zone in the game<br />
AC bonus<br />
Easy Shaman only armor quests<br />
Hated everywhere (I say that is a pro because Iksars can kill just about anybody they want and not have to worry about faction)<br />
Ssssexy Tail <br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
No JBB (big deal)<br />
Low HP's<br />
Faction (if you care about that sort of thing)<br />
20% exp penalty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The exp penalty stinks but the rest is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just to add... because it bears note:<br />
<br />
a good 50% of the epic is within 2 zones of cabilis.<br />
<br />
Iksar Shaman Hate Armor is arguably &gt; Shaman PoG/SS/Kael/Thurg Armor<br />
<br />
Boot: Hate boots are lower AC, but with a total of 32 in resists- nearly unheard of in footware.  They don't have wis (whatever...) but do have 5 sta, which is only bested by SS boots.  Thurg and PoG boot's AC bonus is negligable, though the AC on Kael/SS stuff is nice.<br />
<br />
Scaled Heirophant Boots  +14 AC +10 Str +5 Sta +5 Agi +8 vsFire +8 vsCold +8 vsPos +8 vsDis<br />
Wolf Caller's Boots  +21 AC +6 Sta +5 Wis +20 HP +25 Mana<br />
Rune Crafter's Boots  +18 AC +5 Sta +3 Wis<br />
Spirit Weaver's Boots  +18 AC +5 Sta +3 Wis<br />
Spirit Caller's Boots  +24 AC +5 Sta +4 Wis +1 vsCold +1 vsPos +1 vsDis<br />
<br />
Bracer: not gonna argue much for these bracers.  Though they do have more Wis, and HP, though lower AC than PoG and Thurg.  Kael and S blow them away    <br />
<br />
Scaled Heirophant Bracers  +9 AC +5 Str +5 Wis +5 Cha +10 HP<br />
Wolf Caller's Bracer  +16 AC +2 Dex +7 Wis +20 HP +15 Mana<br />
Rune Crafter's Bracer  +13 AC +2 Str +3 Wis +15 Mana<br />
Spirit Weaver's Bracer  +13 AC +3 Wis +2 Int +15 Mana<br />
Spirit Caller's Bracer  +17 AC +3 Sta +4 Wis +15 Mana<br />
<br />
Breastplate: The Hate BP has the best resists, 30 compared to the 20 from the SS Breastplate.  Which I'd rather have than the 11 AC, 20hp and 30mana on the PoG and Thurg Breastplates.  The skyshrine BP however would make me drool, if a tad bit (sarcasm) harder to get.    <br />
<br />
Scaled Heirophant Breastplate  +26 AC +10 Str +5 Agi +16 Wis +10 <br />
vsMg +10 vsPos +10 vsDis +10 HP +50 Mana<br />
Wolf Caller's Breastplate  +43 AC +6 Str +6 Sta +6 Agi +6 Dex +15 Wis +4 vsMg +4 vsFire +4 vsCold +4 vsPos +4 vsDis +45 HP +90 Mana<br />
Rune Crafter's Breastplate  +37 AC +3 Str +6 Sta +3 Agi +3 Dex +14 Wis +30 HP +80 Mana<br />
Spirit Weaver's Breastplate  +37 AC +6 Str +3 Sta +3 Agi +3 Dex +14 Wis +50 HP +60 Mana<br />
Spirit Caller's Breastplate  +48 AC +4 Str +6 Sta +4 Agi +6 Dex +15 Wis +40 HP +70 Mana<br />
<br />
Cloak: There are no Velious cloaks. And this one is pretty nice<br />
<br />
Scaled Heirophant Cloak  +12 AC +5 Sta +10 Agi +10 Dex +5 Wis +30 mana<br />
<br />
Gloves: I don't think these are even in competition, I'll take 6wis, 35hps and 5sv cold over 2 - 5 AC anyday.<br />
<br />
Scaled Heirophant Gauntlets  +11 AC +8 Wis +8 Int +8 Cha +5 vsCold +35 HP<br />
Wolf Caller's Gauntlets  +16 AC +2 Str +3 Wis +2 Cha +1 vsMg +1 vsFire +1 vsCold +1 vsPos +1 vsDis +20 Mana<br />
Rune Crafter's Gauntlets  +13 AC +1 Str +2 Wis +2 Cha +10 Mana<br />
Spirit Weaver's Gauntlets  +13 AC +1 Str +2 Wis +2 Cha +10 Mana<br />
Spirit Caller's Gauntlets  +16 AC +1 Str +3 Wis +2 Cha +20 Mana  <br />
<br />
Greaves:  Like the Boots and Breastplate, The Hate Greaves are all about resists, this time with a solid total of 24.  Decent AC too, though not as nice as Velious.  These might be some you just wanna swap out. (I alt between these and Kromriff Military Leggings myself)<br />
<br />
Scaled Heirophant Greaves  +14 AC +10 Dex +5 Cha +8 vsMg +8 vsFire +8 vsCold +40 Mana<br />
Wolf Caller's Greaves  +26 AC +5 Agi +5 Dex +12 Wis +7 vsMg +1 vsFire +1 vsCold +1 vsPos +1 vsDis +50 HP +80 Mana<br />
Rune Crafter's Greaves  +22 AC +5 Sta +3 Agi +10 Wis +30 HP +80 Mana<br />
Spirit Weaver's Greaves  +22 AC +3 Sta +5 Agi +10 Wis +30 HP +80 Mana<br />
Spirit Caller's Greaves  +32 AC +5 Str +4 Agi +12 Wis +2 vsMg +30 HP +80 Mana    <br />
<br />
Helm:  I don't think this is a worthy comparison either.  3 - 5 AC difference, but Hate has 5sta, and at least 3 wis more than every other helm, and 5sv cold to boot.  An incredible piece.<br />
<br />
Scaled Heirophant Helm  +16 AC +5 Sta +10 Wis +5 vsCold +20 Mana<br />
Wolf Caller's Helm  +19 AC +6 Str +7 Wis +4 vsMg +25 Mana<br />
Rune Crafter's Helm  +16 AC +5 Sta +5 Wis +15 Mana<br />
Spirit Weaver's Coif  +16 AC +5 Dex +5 Wis +15 Mana<br />
Spirit Caller's Helm  +22 AC +6 Agi +6 Wis +20 Mana<br />
<br />
Sleeves: Other than 10sta (which is a lot) These aren't anything to scream about.  They are still better than PoG and Thurg though, 6 - 11 AC difference to SS or Kael, though the Hate has better stats.  Depends on WEther the Wis/STA &gt; AC for you.<br />
<br />
Scaled Heirophant Vambraces  +13 AC +10 Sta +5 Agi +5 Wis<br />
Wolf Caller's Vambraces  +19 AC +3 Str +3 Sta +3 Dex +3 Wis +3 vsMg +10 HP +15 Mana<br />
Rune Crafter's Vambraces  +16 AC +1 Str +1 Sta +1 Dex +3 Wis +10<br />
Spirit Weaver's Vambraces  +16 AC +3 Str +1 Sta +1 Dex +1 Wis +10 HP +15 Mana<br />
Spirit Caller's Vambraces  +24 AC +1 Str +1 Sta +3 Dex +3 Wis +10 HP +15 Mana<br />
<br />
Remember, non-iksar skin is too weak to wear the Scaled Heirophant Gear, so You have less competition on Hate Raids, as well as, they can be achieved at lower levels.  And Hate is a KICK ASS zone :-)  Dont forget to loot all that extra class armor drops that other people don't need to turn in for a blue+ AA xp, and a rare gem.<br />
<br />
Iksar faction isn't a big deal.  Cabilis is one of the BEST tradeskill cities in the game.  And while you don't get Snare neckalces, we do get Fear Animal and Undead... which cast pretty quick, and aren't bad when grouped with a druid or a ranger or other snare class.<br />
