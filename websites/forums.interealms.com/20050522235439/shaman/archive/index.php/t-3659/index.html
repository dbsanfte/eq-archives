<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Pardon my ignorance, but I could not find the information I was looking for with search.  Here is my question:<br />
<br />
How and where do you set up AA experience.  What level do you have to be to start accumulating AA experience?<br />
<br />
The whole AA exp stuff happened during my hiatus, but the &quot;new and improved&quot; Widda has reached level 51 now, and I am starting to wonder about the fabled AA stuff.   Thank you for all your help.<br />

<br />
You have to be level 51 to start earning AA xp, when you get to level 55 and 59 there are extra abilities you can spend your earned points on.<br />
<br />
There are many threads you can probably find that discuss which abilities people think are best for shamans :)</div></div><hr />
