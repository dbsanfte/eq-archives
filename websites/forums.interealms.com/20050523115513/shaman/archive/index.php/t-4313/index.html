<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I'm kinda irked.  Download the new patch, servers finally up, log in, choose my server, everything loads, starts to go to Char Select screen, then Boom, back to desktop.<br />
<br />
Figure OK, I read the patch message, custom UI's may need to be fixed before using them again.  OK, move my custom UI's out of the uifiles folder, start up again, Boom, back to desktop.<br />
<br />
OK, maybe my files got messed up somehow, delete the default folder, repatch to get new files again, Boom, desktop again.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experiencing this same problem or is it just my bad luck?<br />

Running Athlon XP 1800+, 1.5GB DDR RAM, Ti 4600, Audigy, bla bla bla.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here is how you fix it:<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch from TEST server - then patch from normal server.<br />
<br />
Reason for crash is that they have forgotten to put the compass into the normal server patching :P<br />
<br />
All works now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">rofl<br />
Good man!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks KriFos, working 'as intended' now.  Wonder how many other people are pulling their hair out over this.  Leave it to VI to do a good patch change wise and then bork it up.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok you made your joke thanks.<br />
Still crashing. Does anyone know how to set your Ui to the default without logging in?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Should be able to change/remove a line in your eqclient.ini file, I forget the exact line, the one we had to add when the UI first came out (/blonde)<br />
<br />
Give patching normally one more try, I'm told the correct files are up now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Darjeeling,<br />
<br />
If you want to disable the new UI, you can edit that in your eqclient.ini.  The field is called NEWUI I believe (Search for UI), and setting it to false should switch you back to the old one.<br />
<br />
Did you try connecting to the test server?  I wasn't sure from your post.  The compass fix comes down from there right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah i did the test server patch. Still crashed. I found the NewUI entry in EQclient.ini and set it to FALSE. Works now. But~~<br />
<br />
Well i'll get it sorted no doubt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok here's what i did. Moved my custom folder in EQUI folder to desktop. Logged in with the default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">try this:<br />
<br />
find all the files downloaded today (08/14) in the &quot;...../everquest/uifiles/default&quot; and copy them in your personal UI directory.<br />
<br />
works for me minus some changes in the UI i have to modify.. but at least no more crashing nor default skin :)<br />
<br />
hope that helps<br />
<br />
PS: don't forget to make a backup of your actual personnal directory before copying.. just in case :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">woohoo, that didn't work either, tryed copying all files from default to advanced, that doesn't work either...hrm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I had to delete my custom profile and make a copy of the default and rename it to my old custum name.<br />
<br />
I could log in then and switch my UI back to default.  <br />
<br />
have to wait for the fix on the one I was using now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gibb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I really love my Aruman's UI but I can't seem to make it work with this patch. Aruman's changes the pet window into a clickable items box (very handy for JBB, epic, and all sorts of right clickers)<br />
<br />
I have tried overwriting the files in my custom folder with the downloaded files from the patch. I have Test Server updated. Yet no luck and at the same time I'm hearing of others making a custom UI work with these fixes.<br />
<br />
Maybe some of the custom UI need to be updated to be in line with the patch and the new compass?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've pretty much tried all the above. I even tried what was recommended on EQCastersrealm. Still crashes to DT before Character selection screen.</div></div><hr />
