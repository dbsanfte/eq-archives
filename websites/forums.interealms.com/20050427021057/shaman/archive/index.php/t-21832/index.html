<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dottz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I 2 box a 51 Shaman and a 50 (almost 51) warrior, both well equipped. Have tried Plane of Justice at zone out---Velks Lab---Bats and Bugs in Sol B--and now Im in Burning woods mowing down low blues. Thinking of trying City of Mist so I can get my epic pieces while still getting experience. Will stuff still be blue at 51-52? <br />
     Also wondering when to try Chardock with this duo. Biggest problem Im having is single pulls are difficult in small areas. Have to scramble to root one or tank it while warrior beats other. I know Griegs is another possibility once I get a few levels. Any other good outdoor zones for this duo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Swiftkique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i am a 47 shaman and a 48 monk and i did CoM NO PROBLEM its a great place i was 46 and 47 when i got ther and within an hour i was lvled on both guys then got a friend there to help him lvl ( he was lvl 38 getting 2% a kill) so really its great xp i just suggest you make sure you aer properly buffed before you go (virt, Fo7, other high shaman buffs on war and kei, 9 on shaman i would say symbol on shaman but if its gonna take time for if you dont have money for a dot or whatever reason its not that big if a deal when boxing you dont have time to canni too much so getting as much mana regen is more important) edited part- make a hotkey(if you havent) that assists your warrior or whatever tank you useing on first like then /pause 2 on second line(otherwise wont cast lots of the time), 3rd line do /pet attack, 4th line cast slow /cast #, then just sit back down when done casting and then dont have to wory about anything but heals really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Greflin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While camping page in stables i went from 49 - 53.. so yeah is good exp.. can even get 54+ if ya go to back... aa is really good at 54 as well..Another option for you both is the hole. Pretty good exp, ent down to pit. use shrink to get through rock if ya do not have a key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have GoD expansion you could try out Forgotten Halls. I go there when Im low on time or just dont feel like dealing with running somewhere and finding out its camped.<br />
<br />
go to Nedaria and talk to Eldros Danmor and say I am interested in visiting and you will get the expidition. head to the bear caves and click the rock on the map. rats and bats are what you want to kill, they are not social so you can just walk up to one and start attacking it then move to the next one. DO NOT ATTACK ANYTHING OTHER THAT THE RATS AND BATS OR YOU WILL PULL THE WHOLE ZONE!!!! atleast that was the case when i was leveling my necro and pet attacked one of the wondering people mobs there, 50+ things came from from all over the zone to beat me down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlindFaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did alot of lvling in Dulak and aquired about 25 of my 35 aa's there too. Wonderful zone at lower 50's. <br />
If you have the OOW expansion, I'd highly recommend going to Dranik's Scar.  I solo there at lvl 56, and occassionally duo with a 52 Ranger. You two should do awesomely there. Great exp and some really good loot drops.</div></div><hr />
