You will have to go in and so a find/replace for some of the lines...<br />
<br />
change 153,153,153 to 0,0,0.<br />
<br />
The lines are colored close to the background of the map display and makes them hard to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have all the maps http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/<br />
has to offer. Does anyone have the problem that when you use the patcher it tries to overwrite these files? I get around it by having two map folders, one with the &quot;default&quot; maps, one with the custom maps from eq-toolbox. It's not really a big deal to just rename the map folders, but sure would be nice to not have too.<br />
So does anyone have this problem also, and if so how do you fix/work around it?</div></div><hr />

I noticed this today.  It seems to be kinda strange that they would delete the maps that they gave you the tools to create for yourself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well they are in C:\EQ\maps</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mine are in the default EQ\maps subfolder.  I really hope SOE doesn't implement code that just goes through other folders on the hard drive and starts replacing files.   ;)  That would be so bad.</div></div><hr />
