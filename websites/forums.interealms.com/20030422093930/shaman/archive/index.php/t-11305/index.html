<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hope this isn’t too expensive to make, or too high in skill level.  I haven’t started working on my alchemy skill yet. Translation: I don’t have the money.  But this would be a fun potion to shoot for.  Unfortunately, it won’t be as useful as it might first appear.  Somehow, NPCs have the power to look into your mind and see what god you worship.  So even if you look like a dark elf, for example, they may still attack you if you walk into their city.  So unless you’re agnostic, like the Vah Shir, you may be in for a nasty surprise.  Still, if it’s not too expansive to make it would be a fun potion to play around with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WormWood<br />
Any of 250 strong-smelling plants with white or yellow flowers that are generally classed as weeds. It's specifically the Eurasian perennial (Artemisia absinthium) that's so notorious in the cocktail world. Artemisia absinthium produces a bitter, dark-green oil once used in making absinthe, vermouth, and other bitters. <br />
<br />
Hippocrates sipped wormwood steeped in wine for jaundice and rheumatism, and others throughout history have used it as an aphrodisiac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you look at the details though...<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3736&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
5% mana savings.<br />
so for each cast of say, Breath of Ultor you save um... 27 mana.<br />
<br />
Nice idea, but 5% savings?  Let's see if it stacks and stuff, I guess, but now that I see its 3hrs and 15 mins thats a bit better!<br />
<br />
disease awareness IV: birthwart, agrimony, dhea, clover, briar thistle... lemme see if I can figure out the cost on this.<br />
<br />
birthwart=2.1pp<br />
agrimony=105pp<br />
dhea=31.5pp<br />
clover=17.85pp<br />
briar thistle = unknown<br />
<br />
So this potion will cost NO LESS than 156pp.<br />
<br />
[edit:  I somehow read over the 3hours part and just seen the 15mins part, thanks for the correction Gard!! :) ]</div></div><hr />

The Lucy references for duration reads: &quot;3.0 mins @L1 to 3 hour(s) 15.0 mins @L65&quot;<br />

Neither does any other illusion unless you have the permanent illusion AA.<br />

I know what you're talking about though and I have no idea if all models are loaded globally or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">i think what he is saying is that in most zones they do not load the graphic for every single creature because it would be a lot more loading time.  maybe for griegs they do load htem all because of the nature of the zone.  there has always been sepearte files for global models also.  so that what has lead me to follow that train of thought.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Hell frozen over? <br />
<br />
 All the plat I put on alchemy, all the months and years I cursed my only mastered tradeskill. Guess I should be happy now!<br />
Basically this upgrade is what Alchemists have asked for a long time: The illusions, Focus potions, and even some usefull stuff like Gate. Even gave the collapsable medicine bag.<br />
<br />
 Probably might even start selling potions again after this, just for fun.  All the melees want to have at least few for leaving groups in tough places and for raids. So why wouldnt I leave a stack on trader? <br />
<br />
 Group shrink was a spell I really hoped we'd see, but a potion will do just as fine. Until I played a melee to &quot;raid age&quot;, I never could have believed how tough it sometimes is to get to target trough 8 unshrunken Oggers and a mass of other people, or raid indoords with 35 people in one room trying to find the target. This potion will solve one of my pet peeves. <br />
 <br />
<br />
The Focus stuff might be a asked potions too. They last long, and give you 5% focus that stacks with other focus items you already have. We all know how people like high numbers?<br />
 I'd love to see everybody realizing the stacking thing before the face slapping and shafting begins again...  5% isnt much, but it's something extra. Combine with other Focus items and it's more. I'm just hoping that the effect doesnt have a buff slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">They've definately gone the right direction, finally.   Now if they would cut the costs down of components, it will be more thriving.<br />
It's too expensive for how expendable potions are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Well I guess I'm one of the few who is unimpressed by this...<br />
<br />
Ingredient costs are still too high to bother with.<br />
I trained a monk up in pottery to make Thurg gate potions in just a few hours. Now they are cheap... we'd have to be able to make the gate potions at a comparable cost or less for there to be much of a market...(ie. &lt;50pp)<br />
<br />
Also potions are interrupted too easily. So they cant really be used during combat unless you want to die. (Now if they could be used while you were getting beat on, wowee what a market!)<br />
<br />
I bet the illusion potions do nothing other than affect appearance (ie. won't affect faction, won't give race benefits like troll regen).<br />
<br />
Also the bazaar has made it a waste of time to even bother with SOW potions. I liked them when I could sell them for 100p, not when I must sell them at 85p. I expect similar undercutting with the new potions meaning profits will still be low...<br />
<br />
Anyway I hope I am wrong but at least it sounds like some of my brethren will get some joy from alchemy at last..<br />
<br />
edit: Just saw at eqtraders that the illusions behave as the enchanter illusion spells, so troll illusion has a 1 pt regen and dark elf has ultravision etc..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Jinheim, you went through 64 levels and you never realised that only models for that zone are loaded when you enter a specific zone.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, I have been to the Grieg,  that acursed thing you change to is a local model to that zone.   So are the mushrooms in fungus Grove.   There is no way any zone ever is going to load all the models in the game in all the zones.  Furthermore, the code necessary for the potions to recognize the zone they are in... and whether the model has already been loaded... and what the faction for that model should be; would be insane.  <br />
<br />
Anyone remember what happened to the scarecrow illusion do to the faction, they could not adjust properly.  Oh yeah it was chucked.  You can't turn into a scarecrow with out GM help now.<br />
<br />
Lastly there is minor illusion which is a special case but don't want to get into its code.  Secondly they control its effects by not only making everything you minor illusion form; indifferent too, it also does not permit forward, backward or side to side motion.  <br />
<br />
Forty-SoN, I have been playing since March, of 1999 too and have a CS degree...  I serious doubt you do understand the game mechanics, but it is obvious you get defensive when sighted on things you don't understand.  <br />

sarcasm... sarcasm... is my sig.</div></div><hr />

I don't play this game to sit around and make potions.  I just kill stuff.  Put me in for a don't care. <br />
<br />
Quit your shaman now before you actually do real raiding then.  Make a warrior or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Uuena Van Light</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Illusion Potions is great idea but very poorly implemented.<br />
No one going to pay Minimum of 78 pp for 1 charge illusion potion, Min of 780 for 10-charge.  Also, Shaman has to make a reasonable markup,  100PP or 10-charge 1k.   It will have it novelty and temporily initial effect at 1st.  In the long run, it just cost to much for most players to return to a shaman and buy it.<br />
<br />
If verant was smart, they could of made the 1 charge for 4pp, and 40 PP.  Shaman can charge 10pp each and 100pp 10charge.  Right there, shaman will be making lots of money.  Make the Potions during down time, medding etc.  Sell potions while in a exp group or raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Gate to bind potion on vendor is way more superior to the player made one. vendor gate is instant and ours is 10 second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Zeeke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">78pp (my price with unfailing reverence) for Wormwood +farming meats isn't worth the 45 minutes of illusion you get.  They don't sell well either from my initial attempts to move them in bazaar.<br />
<br />
I would think the shadowstep potions would sell well on the PvP servers if the cast time is fast as the spell version.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">I sell lots of illusion potions at 159-249 depending on how available the parts are for that particular potion. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Xanivus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Kind of funny that they chose Wormwood for illusion potions. Wormwood was used to make the drink Absanth. It basically sent people into a catatonic or halucinagenic state. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Actually people would and do buy these potions.  Imagine the quests that are now open to the majority of the player base.  This is game changing imo.</div></div><hr />
