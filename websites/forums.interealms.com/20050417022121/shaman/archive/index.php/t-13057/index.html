If your looking for cash/advancement, I'd go barb.  First off, the halas noob quests for armor (ask Cyndl in Mac's Kilts) and an untwinked character's dream.  You can get nearly a complete suit of patchwork/rawhide at in your first few levels, saving a decent amount of cash.  Also, you can prolly pick up a fine steel weapon off the eternally camped ice giants when thier camper's sacks fill up.  Lastly, your noobie grounds are stocked with pelts and silks which you can sell to tradeskillers for a fair amount of plat.  Not talking a gold mine here, but to an untwinked toon, it will be more than plently.<br />
<br />
Better faction and a wider range of armor than the other shaman races are also a plus down the road.  Also, barbs take the least amount of xp to level.  Downside is, you lack the regen of trolls/iksar, frontal unstunability of an ogre, and the safefall of a cat.  But, the sexy kilt more than makes up for that!  /nod</div></div><hr />
