<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Trying to get someplace interesting, getting bored with DL.  Is 2 yellow into 45 to low to get a group in KC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no effing way. i got in at 44, and slowed every mob we pulled at t1 &amp; t2. just drop a malisement + slow. usually youll be grouping with 50+ people, so most likely you'll have c2 on and a 50+ cleric and 50+ tanks. its not a problem and if anyone tells you that a 45 shaman is too low is an effing tank or a scared shaman.<br />
<br />
most mobs were badass BUT they were dark blue and I could drop a malisement + togors and land it easily. since its a train-happy zone, you will have a chanter (so thats clarity 2) and a cleric (no healing for you), so youll have tons of mana to keep casting a slow if it doesnt stick the first time.<br />
<br />
also, buffs are loved. enough said. you WILL get a group, unless there are higher shamans, which they will probably take over you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jahaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Moonmist is VERY right.  I participated in a Venril Sathir raid there, and managed to slow many mobs.  Sad thing is, too many people have KC pegged ast 48-50+ because everyone else there is that high, and therefore assume you cant hunt there.  Its annoying and it angers me but at least on my server you have to know someone to get a group even at 50+.  Much like velks.  (sigh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Jahaara<br />
if ya know the right people you can do KC 45+ easy.<br />
first went there at 39 myself (actually got a howling harpoon of the 3rd mob we dropped!!!) and have gone back many times since. with a cleric and monk buddy of mine, we'd just grab 3 more members and do hands or something. made great xp there and could slow just about everything (besides some of the named, hangnail, jailer, etc...)</div></div><hr />
