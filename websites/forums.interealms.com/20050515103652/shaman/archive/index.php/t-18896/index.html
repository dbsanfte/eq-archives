<br />
<br />
Yyyyyeeeaaaaahh. I'm gonna have to sorta.. go ahead and disagree with you there. Paragon is good for a 1200 heal and 480 mana. Spiritual Dominion takes about 425 mana. I was maintaining 50 dps for a bit and then healed the MT for 5400 so if you could go just ahead and... move your desk back a bit and have those TPS reports ready that'd be grrreat mkay? Super.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">All ya'll shaman have to admit - our class does have an awesome ability to recover from a rez, and make the worst of situations turn out good. Yes we have bad healing ability, yes our slow is getting a little old, and yes other classes do more damage than us, but it only takes one hitpoint to keep your main tank alive until the next round of combat, while a CH lands. And it only takes the 1 extra hit a 65% slow allows vs a 75% slow to break a cleric channelling that CH. We do so many of the little things that make a raid work.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way Enarch the same thing happened to me on my first AOW raid... some st00pid druid was sitting right in the pull path, and I made the mistake of trying to heal him before he got quadded down to a mush, I pulled aggro and died =( But I got a paladin rez, canni'd back up in a matter of seconds, and ended up delivering a tnargs right as the main tank was at 1%, pulling the raid through to a victory. It felt nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So let me recap your point:<br />
<br />
We are a good class because we recover faster then other classes from a rezz?<br />
<br />
Well not faster then a chanter with GM or a cleric with a 100% rezz.<br />
<br />
Feels good to know that our strong point is being the fast back in action class after a rezz.<br />
<br />
Sorry to break your bubble but I try to stay alive during a raid (if you can call AoW a raid at all considering that he can be done with 1 group)</div></div><hr />

Yes. Yes we do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well not faster then a chanter with GM or a cleric with a 100% rezz.<br />
<br />
Cleric's Divine Resurrection can only be used once a day or so, after that they're just as screwed on mana as everyone else.(Except the Shaman)<br />
I don't know what you're rambling about with the term &quot;GM&quot; but I'm pretty sure it doesn't involve an Enchanter healing a tank for over 5000 right after rez. <br />
<br />
<br />
Feels good to know that our strong point is being the fast back in action class after a rezz.<br />
<br />
Damn straight!<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry to break your bubble but I try to stay alive during a raid (if you can call AoW a raid at all considering that he can be done with 1 group)<br />
Sorry to break your bubble, but you're a spoiled little Plane of Power pretty boy that fights the same Quarm week after week and gets nothing new out of the game. I bet if I stripped you of all your armor you'd be helpless against any green mob you came across. You don't remember what it feels like to be a Shaman anymore. You're just a loot farmer devoid of any definition.<br />
<br />
<br />
Damn it feels good to be a Shaman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well grats you, Stygiana, for being in a group of people that can do AoW with 1 group.<br />
<br />
Some of us aren't.<br />
<br />
I have to agree, we definetly recover fast from either a rez, or even just bad things in general.<br />

Oh and grats on killing a 4 expansion old mob that is way beyond trivial due to level 65. /golfclap<br />
<br />
Sure I was stupid for getting sit agro in melee range, but I was able to recover fast enough to be of real aid to the raid! I'm proud of being the most easily recovered and useful class in the game!<br />
- Gather mana? Divine rez? <br />
<br />
So all I gotta say to you slow stealin, melee hoggin, pet relyin Beastlords, when the rez takes your mana *** you gonna do? <br />
- He gonna do something you couldn't: DPS. You know the thing that kills mobs? A hybrid OOM is way more useful than a shaman OOM. And when he is OOM, he gonna hit his MGB hotkey and fire up Paragon. Or simply do it for himself.<br />
<br />
Estimated 3k damage inc to mob:<br />
[Thu Jan 08 17:56:19 2004] You begin casting Spirit Call.<br />
- Look around for other classes. They have swarm pets! And many classes can do damage OOM (wich is FAR superior than your pathetic attempt). Then there are SKs ... Necros ... <br />

- Why the hell you waste a spell slot for root spell for the Avatar of War encounter? Mem something more useful. Congratulations, your cluelessness (is that a word?) skill just improved to 252!<br />
<br />
Again, grats on killing a four expansion old mob and proving you have no clue about this encounter (aka memming root).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Here is a clue<br />

<br />
And saying that I do not get NEW stuff by being able to kill Quarm.... How is killing AoW fall into this GETTING NEW STUFF?<br />
<br />
You are clueless and fewls like you are the main reason the shaman class is in this crap state.<br />
Whenever there is a discussion there is always somebody posting how uber he/she/it is because he/she/it just killed [insert a random 4-5 expansions old mob]</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This thread isn't about class balance, it's about being proud of the Shaman class which you obviously aren't. Go away.<br />
<br />
Only a retard would play the game or care about class balance after they've already defeated it. You have all your spells, AAs, and l33t time loot. The 1924th Shaman to get to 6k unbuffed. /golfclap right back at you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gather mana?<br />
<br />
Heal?<br />
<br />
<br />
Divine rez?<br />
<br />
DPS?<br />
<br />
<br />
- He gonna do something you couldn't: DPS. You know the thing that kills mobs? A hybrid OOM is way more useful than a shaman OOM. And when he is OOM, he gonna hit his MGB hotkey and fire up Paragon. Or simply do it for himself.<br />
<br />
I already addressed this pathetic paragon argument. Read the thread you illiterate. Let him not help with spot heals on the main tank so he can dps the raid mob in all of his Time Gear glory... but without the heal, he'll soon find himself without any of his gear and looking around at his bind point. Damn it feels good to be a Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Look around for other classes. They have swarm pets! And many classes can do damage OOM (wich is FAR superior than your pathetic attempt). Then there are SKs ... Necros ... <br />
<br />
Yes some can do dps, some can do heals. Can they do both? NO. Druids don't have swarms, Clerics have... some hammer thingy. We have DPS and we have heals. But I guess you wouldn't know that if you bought your character from Yantis.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Why the hell you waste a spell slot for root spell for the Avatar of War encounter? Mem something more useful. Congratulations, your cluelessness (is that a word?) skill just improved to 252!<br />
<br />
Poor Ebayed character, it's real owner must be ashamed... There's a thing called a spell set. It was added recently. You'd know if you were there but you probably haven't owned your character more than 10 days.<br />
<br />
<br />
And saying that I do not get NEW stuff by being able to kill Quarm.... How is killing AoW fall into this GETTING NEW STUFF?<br />
<br />
I'm not telling anyone to fight a 2nd expansion mob. (But after that sniveling little mouthy remark you made above about groups soloing the mob, I'd certainly like to watch you die and die again getting your corpse back from the AoW... I'm sure you can solo and slow him right? Since he's so weak for you and your all mighty Time gear) I was telling everyone who's cognitive that I'm proud to be a Shaman.<br />

<br />
You attempt to debunk the counterpoint that clerics have Divine rez by saying that they can only do it once a day.  How often do you make these monumental F-ups that result in you getting killed?<br />
<br />
Grats?<br />
<br />
Let me clarify.  Shaman WERE uber back around Velious.  We soloed a dragon... oooh ahhh.  At the time that was a damned impressive feat although it did require a full spellbook which for a shaman at the time was certainly not an easy task in itself, arguably it's still not an easy task at level 60.  Combine that with the fact that, at the time, we were the premier slowing class and slow was an immensely valuable ability with limited availability and you had a class that everyone wanted to be like.<br />
<br />
What's happened since then is a series of mediocre upgrades while other classes have made long strides forward.  IMO we aren't ruined, yet.  We are making steady steps backwards, relatively, though.  Up till PoP Shaman always had the best PR dots.  PoP, necroes get a PR dot that is superior to ours in every single way.  More damage, less mana and a resist adjust.  We used to be clearly the best slowers.  Mitigation reduced the lead we had and more slow spells were introduced that were nearly as effective as our own, thus increased availability of slow coupled with other classes having more useful abilities along with those slows made for vastly reduced demand for shaman in xp groups.<br />
<br />
Relatively, the shaman class has declined in power.  The keyword in that sentence is RELATIVELY.  Balance is RELATIVE.  I don't mean this to come off as some old timer saying you don't know how it used to be, but the simple fact is that is exactly the case.  Nobody will deny that our ability to quickly recover after a res is nice.  It is not, and should not be a major balancing point.  Relatively (There's that word again) it is pretty insignificant.  You shouldn't be dying so often that recovery is a major issue.</div></div><hr />

When you are actually done with 4 expansion old content, and move into the bigger leagues, then maybe you will realize that the life of a shaman is not &quot;uber&quot;.<br />

Now back on Topic and back on correcting mister enarcheos.<br />
<br />
You are not proud on your class, you just wanted to show off and flame the BST's out there a bit. Your second line was a direct flame at the BST class.<br />
<br />
Then you show that you have no clue by flaming thge second you get attacked but np, feel proud doing velious stuff.<br />
Let me suggest something for your next post.<br />
Solo Yeldema and post about how uber we are and that we are so balanced.<br />
<br />
PS Feel free to flame me, feel free to flame Zorlac and feel free to keep thinking you are so good and so uber and so all knowing. You are a most welcome target for my frustrations about the SoE crap so I will be more then happy to &quot;correct&quot; your posts.<br />

<br />
That would be the ultimate AOW group. They couldn't do the dps in time to kill it before running out of mana, as the clerics would be chain casting CH.<br />
<br />
Not only do I laugh at your pathetic attempt to trivialize this raid encounter that this guy did, but I also laugh at how your E-Penis gets massively erect at the thought of burning on someone else's effort while you pharm Quarm some more. Fun, isn't it? Too bad you'll never feel the satisfaction of completing anything remotely difficult again.<br />

That would be the ultimate AOW group. They couldn't do the dps in time to kill it before running out of mana, as the clerics would be chain casting CH.<br />

I rolled my shaman, and geared him from the ground up, joined a raiding guild and started from Vindicator. We're in Vex Thal now. The fifth kill of Quarm wasn't half as exciting as our first kill of Avatar of War, regardless of it being 4 expansions old. I get excitement out of challenge.

Yeah shaman can go from oom/dead to fom/buffed pretty damn fast, although vs the AoW theres not really a lot we can do with that mana bar spamming weedy heals around the place<br />

Oh and the AoW is 1 groupable /shrug, its not done from incompetence for gear, its done for the enjoyment of pulling of a pretty hard fight with those small numbers.  Short of the ring, AoW gear is pretty much twink fodder to someone in an established elemental/time guild.</div></div><hr />

I'm proud of being a shaman, but not for the reasons you are.<br />
<br />
An enchanter with Gather mana would do a better job in a similar situation.<br />
<br />
Spirit call might be great on AoW after he's already pinned, but you can't use them on every mob post rez.<br />
<br />
Heals?  An enchanter rezzed &amp; using Gather Mana can Rune the MA and offset more damage than our Tnarg's will, and it doesn't matter if the MA is at 10% or 100% health when the Rune lands.  If our Tnarg's hits right after a rotation Cheal lands, that mana is effectively wasted.<br />
<br />
The jabs at the beastlord class were not necessary, and your including them here detract from your own pride.  Be proud, but no need to knock other classes in order to do it.<br />
<br />
Greater Immobilize shouldn't be in your raid arsenal for memmed spellsets in my opinion.  I recommend you change that.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Canni dancing at a RAID like real shaman do?<br />
<br />
No, real shaman on a raid know about sitting aggro, and the resulting aggro pong.  Also, canni dancing is slower mana regen then chain canni, so it's ineffective in a raid situation, where you need a lot of mana now, not like the continuous mana regen you want in an experience group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya know, I just dinged 56, came back to the boards lookin to see what has been going on lately, saw Enarch's post and thought to myself, &quot;Wow, cool...that's pretty neat.&quot; I myself will never, NEVER see Ssra/VT/Elementals/Time, other so called uber places. Why? Because it is the attitudes of the people who are already there who ruin this game for me. Stygiana (sp?), I'm glad that you are so damn l33t, I'm happy for you that you concider old content to be so trivial. But for people like me, who choose not to be in a huge guild for the simple fact that it turns normally easy-going, cool people into raving loot whores who look down upon their peers and dismiss their accomplishments as &quot;child's play&quot;, it destroys the game. I've been playing EQ for over 3 years now, my highest players are my 56 Shaman and 56 Ranger. I've tried the guild thing and found it not to my liking. I've been to ToV, and accomplished a lot (before PoP) <br />
  Lately, it seems the whole attitude of the people I grew with and watched grow has changed so much that I see no more willingness to help out others, unless it involves them getting something out of it. I can't count the number of raids I have been on knowing that the mobs I needed to kill were up and were passed by because I was told before going that we had a specific purpose and nothing else. I have done epic mobs for people I didn't know, just because I knew they needed help and didn't have a guild. I have yet to see someone from a major guild help out anyone unless they are a personal friend or guildmate. You people have become so full of yourselves that you have forgotten the basic point this game was about (or maybe I have misconceptions) I already know that you are going to rebut and say, &quot;You're just jealous because I can do/have/etc. etc.&quot; No, I'm not jealous, I'm furious. I'm furious because when you achieve your so called l33tness, you ignore everyone who isn't as well off as you are and put down the accomplishments of those of us who haven't reached your supreme state of being. <br />
  Basically, you need to step back and see what's going on, take a good hard look at the attitudes of people around you and look back on when you were a &quot;noob&quot; Maybe, just maybe, you'll appreciate what you have and share the power you have grown into instead of blindly stepping on everyone to get that next piece of Uber_loot.<br />

Shaman recover well after death, but I sure as hell wouldn't lead with that on any guild/group apps.  Not dying is pretty damned good and while you did 3k damage to the AoW (I'd like to see the parses on that as I'm sure the whiff rate was craptastic) practically every other classes doubled that damage without pulling aggro.  You landed one timely heal?  Grats.

It is not, and should not be a major balancing point...You shouldn't be dying so often that recovery is a major issue.<br />
<br />
You're telling me you've never died twice within a 24 hour span? Ever? If you have, then every point I've made is valid. No I did not start this thread to claim that recovery from death is a major balancing point... NOW I AM. <br />
We own all and we are defined by our recovery after death. Take it from a red server Shaman who loses his mana pool almost daily to entire groups of gankers. This ability far exceeds the normal player. Our capacity to do whatever we want even when dead. The next time you're ported to your bind point in POK, get up, stretch your legs. Cast EB, cast some levitate, come back into the zone create and fully buff your pet, suspend him, take that rez, and your pet will be waiting for you on the other side of the rez, just unsuspend him.<br />
<br />
then maybe you will realize that the life of a shaman is not &quot;uber&quot;.<br />

You are not proud on your class, you just wanted to show off and flame the BST's out there a bit. Your second line was a direct flame at the BST class.<br />
<br />
I am proud of my class. I'm not proud of beastlords. The whole class looks like something a five year old would think up. Who would give Enchanter clarity to a melee / priest hybrid and exclude the priest it was made from? If you read the original articles it was a warrior / shaman hybrid, no monk mentioned. They didn't even know what the hell they were creating. 90% Shaman. 20% Enchanter. 15% Monk. 25% warrior. 50% Mage. 200% Bullsh*t.  As soon as I saw Paragon the first time, I knew that no one at Sony could possibly be competent<br />

I think it's great that your shaman has the hp/ac of my warrior...  No wonder you could 1-group AoW.  My guild isn't even to the AoW level yet...  We're just getting into stuff like Vindi/Statue, Dain, and NToV.  It's new, challenging content for us, and we have fun doing it.  I guess I could belittle a guild that's raiding some content that's trivial for me, but I'm pretty sure that wouldn't make me feel any better about myself.<br />

<br />
<br />
Ahhh, here we go:<br />
<br />
<br />
enarcheos, while you may be proud to be a shaman, the reasons you stated are nothing to be proud of. Yeah, Cann5 has helped me turn a fight gone bad into a victory after a res, but if I had a brain I would never had made the rookie mistake I had made that got me killed in the first place (never repeated it FYI). If you are going to say you are proud of your class, you are in fact opening ANOTHER class discussion.

That's called doing your job, clerics and druids who didn't die likely healed for 10 times that value if not more, as did hybrid melees like paladins with their grp heals, AND they even did damage.<br />
<br />
I am a rookie, I already said that. You have died many times. I do not believe you if you come here claiming that you died once and then became so undeniably good that you never saw another slain message. If you say you don't make mistakes, I don't believe you. YOU SIR, have mass cannied to death just like a rookie and you are lying to me if you say you haven't. This is a class discussion. Shamans are superior to all other classes. End of discussion. As for guild apps, you ever read Afterlife's requirements? Someone's gotta call the paramedics and get them out of their basement for nutritional supplement. Don't treat a guild app like it's a job interview. The game isn't making you money, it's taking it. Spirit Call: Level 58 pet parsed unbuffed at 10 dps many times. 10x5x60=3000. I landed 4 timely heals, not one. Again with the &quot;job&quot; thing, are you Yantis? Hybrids either dps or watch for heals on the main tank. They do not do both. I did, and I did it after dying. <br />
<br />
I can continue the battle if something kills me. Once again I believe NONE of any claims that someone had every add on every raid mob in all history under control. You still die occasionally to an add during a raid encounter. Or was I just imagining the exploding AE spiders in innovation? When you do, do you want to be a cleric 100% rezzed with no dps? Do you want to be an Enchanter gathering mana but not having any use outside nuking and runes? Do you want to be a Beastlord and be limited to meleeing and waiting for mana from Beastcrack to do 400 heals with? Personally, I'd rather be a Shaman and be able to pull up a ton of mana to have my menulike choice. I can nuke, ROOT I says, dot, slow, debuff, buff, cure, heal, melee too, pet melee, pet burn melee, or continue to grab mana at 4 times the rate of C5 long after gather mana and paragon have run their course.<br />
<br />

Damn it feels good to be a Shaman<br />
A real Heyokah Shaman makes his potions right<br />
A real Heyokah Shaman never steps on people's threads<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">You attempt to debunk the counterpoint that clerics have Divine rez by saying that they can only do it once a day.<br />
<br />
Relatively, the shaman class has declined in power.  The keyword in that sentence is RELATIVELY.  Balance is RELATIVE.  I don't mean this to come off as some old timer saying you don't know how it used to be, but the simple fact is that is exactly the case.  Nobody will deny that our ability to quickly recover after a res is nice.  It is not, and should not be a major balancing point.  Relatively (There's that word again) it is pretty insignificant.  You shouldn't be dying so often that recovery is a major issue.<br />
<br />
I really respect you and Jih more than anyone here so just to get that out of the way. <br />
<br />
When you get equipped anyone can slow etc. BUT imagine breaking into elementals the first time w/o a shaman. When we first went into the elementals the shm would die all the time, the chanters would die all the time. In a senario like this, divine rez is not enough, gather mana (2.5 hr refresh) is just not enough.  Bestlords and Enchanters could not cut it the way a shaman could. I haven't been to time, but imagine the rings w/o a shaman but enc/bst replacing them.. is it doable? how doable is it. I think it's vital. How about the rathe we're doing that right now and it seems like we could use an extra 10 shaman. When your spells cost 2x as much to cast we're shaman we're used to ass mana costs anyways it barely phases me. But clerics and druids omg they whiiiiine necro necro please.. <br />
<br />
So I think it is important to recover fast when you're doing cutting edge things, poAir was a nightmare for us we had shm slow chains, slow die rez practically! I haven't died in 3 months or so from slowing, but I can tell you I died lots of times when we just got here. We didn't skip vt but in the time I was in vt with my guild I didn't get loot =b so that was also a factor which applies to shaman who skipped vt.<br />
<br />
The guy is proud and I am proud that I can recover from a rez quick.  If you're not that's cool. Relatively shaman have been hosed since velious or whatever, but we are still IMO really amazing if you look at the other classes right now. Relative to them we rock =]<br />
<br />
Also like to say something radical here, why do you guys (giac and to a lesser degree stygiana) remain shaman? Why do you have a bond to some random bytes? Reroll your toon. If you think shaman are underpowered relative to other classes and should be fixed why not play that other class?<br />

When we entered the EP's it was a different ball game, Minis used to be easier (much easier) and so we got our Equipment in order pretty fast. We also did a lot of VT and ssra during Luclin so we had a well equiped force and we had not that much trouble but I can see that a guild skipping VT could run into some problems<br />
<br />

Yes<br />

 how doable is it. <br />

Very, the chanter is much more vital then the shaman<br />

On our first rathe we used 3 shamans (we killed it with 63 toons)<br />

I disagree but on that topic enough has been stated<br />
<br />

<br />
Why should I reroll?<br />
I am proud what I can do with Stygiana, even in this crippled state.<br />
When I made an iksar shaman (the day Kunark went for sale here in Europe) I knew it would not be an easy ride. That did not stop me.<br />
And expansion after expansion I see what is happening.<br />
I saw the Luclin failure but back then we where still ok<br />
I saw the beta testers for PoP and I saw most where not Shaman mains. I also saw our gimpification during PoP.<br />
I see what is happening now and I still wanna figth and get back some challenge and some fun into this class.<br />
<br />
BUT I am sad when I join a group to xp with and the best thing I bring to this group is my pulling.<br />
I am sad when there is no difference between a BST slow and a shaman slow in these groups.<br />
I am sad when group members prefer to pay a random enchanter for a haste above mine.<br />
I am sad when I heal a warrior and the next hit kills him, because my heal is less then the damage that mob does in 1 round of attacks<br />
AND I am very sad when some fool comes to this board and brags about how fast he can get back into action, flaming the BST class while bragging, and showing he is complete clueless about the current issues our class has.<br />
<br />
Because lets face it, no matter any other point stated, AoW is a mob that was designed for lvl 60 characters with no AA's and with equipment that was a lot less.</div></div><hr />

I'm not happy with how the shaman class has gone and seriously Enarcheos, your saving grace is that your at least half amusing.<br />
<br />
Tbh though I'm pretty suprised a 65 shaman on Zek is so happy about how shaman are, your someones buff bot perchance?  Or you spend your time in safe bluebiesque zones?  Shamanic pvp abilities at 65 are hardly anything to be proud of =P<br />
<br />
Still, shaman to the end as it were, no matter what SoE threw at Seb.</div></div><hr />

Good for you enarcheos. I am not on either side, I was just enjoying the thread but it appeared to be running out of steam at the time. I have found from previous experience on these threads that by mentioning girlfriends you can get about 50 posts in anger and I needed entertainment.<br />

<br />
Yeah, and that's why some of us in smaller, casual guilds can actually do some velious raid content now.  I don't know for sure, but I'd be surprised if the early guilds getting into NToV did it with 3 groups (usually just 2-3 clerics, one of which is 2-boxed).  On a good week (we try to raid one night a week), with some guests, we hit 4 groups.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's damn fun for us, and hopefully some day we'll get to do AoW, but I suspect we need to find some more clerics (and perhaps some more dps) before then.  ;)</div></div><hr />

I now wear flaming HOT PINK armor. You read right, HOT PINK. Why? My guild killed Vindi last night ... in typical SOTA-style Overkill we brought 37 of our own to the raid, and had five guests. (A way-too-brief thank you to all of you who sent me PM's with advice for killing him ... you guys know who you are. You're awesome.) He hit the ground dead, and before the chestplate was looted I had pink armor. For those of you who aren't rolling around on the floor laughing at the fact that it took us 42 people to kill him, let me say that he was a challenge. We've not had such an enjoyable night online together in a long, long time. The momentum from his death was enough that we also took a couple groups and got one of our cleric's clickied and one of our druids their Leafblower of Doom. We've not had such a good night in a good long while. His death made this game fun again. Yeap, perhaps this Avatar of War (what I assume AoW is) fellow is one-groupable. Well ... grats. Myself, I'd rather take four or five groups, do our typical SOTA-Overkill and run out of ale in the celebration afterward.</div></div><hr />

I have been playing the same &quot;toon&quot; since day 1. So while these are all pixels and bytes there's 5 years of experience and time invested in this character AND class. If I had to stop playing this character, I'd stop playing EQ and I am about to get there.<br />

I think it has to do with the extremely annoying way in which enarcheos<br />
 presented his feelings.  His post appeared to be a thinly veiled bash directed at Beastlords, then posted a condescending reply to a post bringing up BL mana regen capabilities.  Later on he was dismissive and derogatory towards end-game shaman.  <br />
<br />
One thing I have learned from these EQ message boards is that if you have a superiority complex, then you'd better know what the heck you are talking about.  The posters here don't have a lot of patience for people prattling on about things in which they have no clue.</div></div><hr />

Nothing wrong with that in the least bit IMO.  The point is that thumping your chest and saying how well off shaman are based on an experience with content that is now 2+ years old isn't productive.  It's easily arguable that it's counterproductive even, hence the many responses highlighting that what you are 'bragging' about is not a big deal.<br />
<br />
It wasn't meant so much as a jab at you to trivialize your accomplishment (at least before the flaming began) as it is meant to highlight that being powerful now against 2 year old content does not mean that the shaman class is fine and dandy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Well, I think that what got me annoyed with the whole thing is that the original poster's &quot;bragging&quot; had nothing to do with the content he was fighting, just how fast he recovered after death, so the jab at people doing Velious content now was just for the sake of jabbing.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Having to use something like being able to recover quickly after a rez to allow oneself some pride in their class is kinda sad when you think about it. So you're saying you sit in anticipation of the words &quot;loading...please wait&quot; for your opportunity to demonstrate to your guildmates what it is that makes your class superior to theirs? Well here's a heads up for you, if your guild continues to progress through Velious and into Luclin then PoP you're going to have MANY opportunities to show everyone how well you can recover after a rez because that will be your primary job on raids. <br />
<br />
In a good raid night our slowing shaman dies a LOT, but since we have 5 or 6 on most raids it doesn't really matter how fast he can recover because we won't need him again for another 10 minutes or so anyway. To be honest, shaman are so uber that we could toss them all out and have no additional problems beyond what we have now. Not trying to bash shaman but lets be realistic, we could toss out pretty much any class save 2, warriors and clerics. The rest of the classes have so much overlap that it's easy to sub in another class to do a needed job and when you have 60+ people on a raid there isn't any room for pride in your class. You are a cog, nothing more. The raid won't fail without you, hell it won't even slow down. Put those silly notions about class superiority out of your head right now.<br />
<br />
Ranguard said:<br />
&quot;I'm furious because when you achieve your so called l33tness, you ignore everyone who isn't as well off as you are and put down the accomplishments of those of us who haven't reached your supreme state of being.&quot;<br />
<br />
When you have put in the time and effort to get to that point in the game you can criticize people for having a bad attitude, until then ****. The last thing a person who has spent countless hours on raids backflagging their guild and gearing up people so they can attempt something that very few people in this game ever get to experience needs to hear is some slacker bitching because PoTime folks won't bend over backwards to help them with some quest on their mid-fifties toon. <br />
<br />
People who have put in the effort to get to PoTime, and it is a LOT of effort, should be allowed to be proud of that accomplishment not berated for it. In fact it makes much more sense to take pride in that type of accomplishment than it does in the ability of a class in an online game that you had nothing to do with creating. All enarcheos did was roll up a shaman and read the message boards to learn what tools he should use after he dies on a raid. Really not much to be proud of.</div></div><hr />

The problem I have with ubers is that they have beat the highest content in the game repeatedly to the point of it being trivial - then they have the gall to complain that their class is weak.<br />
<br />
When you have beaten the toughest content in the game repeatedly, when you have 100's of AAs and nothing left to gain, when you have all the best gear available and extra pieces in your pack to optimize every situation and all your level 10 twinks are wearing 500k in gear each, and when you can solo encounters that some groups would have problems with, then you have to figure that you've pretty much beat the game.<br />

<br />
I think I can understand why you think this is a problem only the &quot;übers&quot; see. but in reality it is there just as much for the casual crowd. I think that in reality it is even worse for them.<br />
Lets face it any shaman with more then 5500 hp (unbuffed) can do all LDoN content without much problems (non ebay shamans at least) but for those in the ranges below that the buffs from other classes become important, the resists they have are far less, they go down faster after a beating, have less FT, etc etc. So any improvement made to the class will improve them a lot more.<br />
<br />
 When you have beaten the toughest content in the game repeatedly, when you have 100's of AAs and nothing left to gain, when you have all the best gear available and extra pieces in your pack to optimize every situation and all your level 10 twinks are wearing 500k in gear each, and when you can solo encounters that some groups would have problems with, then you have to figure that you've pretty much beat the game. <br />
<br />
OR you take 1 group and try the AoW. Why? Just so you have done it.<br />
You take 2 man and try vindy (died horribly there).<br />
Even after beating Quarm a few times there is still so much to explore, so much to try out, Beat Quarm with a knight tanking, Beat wave 1 with only a shaman healing the tank on the boss, Pet zerg TT, etc etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
 And you sure as heck have no grounds to be complaining that you're weak in any way.<br />
<br />
Strong or weak is relative.<br />
While we here at the crucible posted that we where beating Yeldema during Velious a bard guildy managed to solo Sont. Sure he used a very &quot;creative&quot; way to do so but still.<br />
<br />
While we here at the crucible posted that we still killed Yeldema during Luclin a mage guildy showed a few devs he could down any mob in the game. Sure he also used a very &quot;creative&quot; tactic but it worked and it was not a sploit.<br />
<br />
While we here at the crucible posted that we had to wait and have faith in SoE during the Priest balance the druids stirred trouble and got everything they wanted.<br />

I for one like my toon and I will try to get her back into a position that she is more to a group then a puller (OK I lie here, they also like the fact i can knock back a mob if it is needed but that is about all they want from me).<br />

I agree that the creator of this post did rank on BL's but he did it to only show that shamans have atleast some uniqueness still.. He loves his class and he did something that made him happy.. I'm really proud of him and also envious.. I have not done anything like he has done yet.. well somewhat but not during a raid situation like his.<br />
<br />
He is also only attacking ppl because they are flaming him for loving his class.. It started out as a yay for shamans and a minor diss on beastlords, but someone turned it into a *wizzys get this.. druids get this.. clerics get this..&quot; whatever crap.. All that crap can be placed on a new tread titled *CRAP* because its obvious something not everyone wants to read.<br />
<br />
Well anyways.. Congrats En for doing something that made you happy.. It's hard to find positive things out of something bad that you did. <br />

Oh yeah.. He admitted he made a bonehead mistake, no need to flame him for that. He's not hiding it or placing the blame on someone else, he admitted to it.</div></div><hr />

Beast would have hit his /Disc and probably lived thus not needing a rez in the first place.<br />
Beast could make a Pet and do more damage while medding than he did with his regened mana.<br />
Beast doesnt really need that much mana in the first place in order to do respectable DPS. just Pet + Melee is approx 140-160DPS for my Beast with Zero mana<br />
<br />
and extended Paragon is 1600hp/640mana, plus any good guild raid your going to have POT9/VOQ/Bardsong/Modrod/SD cast on you within secs of a rez plus whatever FT you have etc, thats up to 80per tic regen plus the modrod and paragon.<br />
<br />
Its good that you regen mana fast after a rez since id guess you spend alot of time face down.<br />

What are you so envious of, memming a root spell on a raid in which it does not matter at all, or sitting right next to AoW and dying, just so you could get back to full mana faster than any other class can after a rez?

I'm already at 1hr a week in eq, pretty much to say hi to ppl in guild and long time friends.. the rest of my time is spent on other things..<br />
<br />
I loved EQ when I first started years ago, but now I'm just tired of all the changes happening.. Especially the bitching that goes on here and slamming of others.. <br />
<br />
Yeah he did mouth off the BL's.. do you really think they say pleasant things about us all the time? Hehe... Well go ahead and prove me wrong with &quot;I have a BL and i read the boards all the time and we never say anything bad about Shamans, blah blah blah&quot; because right now I could care less hehe..<br />
<br />
Every MMORPG is going to have its ups and downs with certain classes.. When they give one class an ability or skill or whatever that helps them, it hurts others.. It's hard to even out everything, and not every class is equal.. <br />
<br />
So sorry Used Car if I praise someone who enjoys their class reguardless of how stupid you think he was.</div></div><hr />

- You praise someone who is stupid enough to sit down in close proximity to a high DPS boss mob with weird undead/regular AI and with this behaviour he endangers his entire raid (hint: mob turns, ripostes entire melee raidforce). You praise someone who memorizes a root spell for AoW encounter. You praise someone who is a clueless idiot and ignores every other very valid point people point out. You praise someone who tries to attack beastlords without having any clue about basic game mechanics. <br />
<br />
Keep praising him. Grats to you.<br />
<br />
Oh and I doubt people THINK he is studid, he proved it beyond the shadow of a doubt that he IS studid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">What's OOM?<br />
- Well, in the quantum EQ universe I play, all the time, clerics save their AA skill called &quot;Divine Ressurection&quot; to use it on important classes, meaning not shamans. So, I usually end up receving a 96% regular ressurection OR in some cases a cheap paladin 90% ressurection. So I get this confirmation box asking me if I want to get ressed or no by so and so, and for this much % XP returned. So I ponder the idea a few pikoseconds and click yes. Next I know, I am teleported back to my corpse, if I had no gear on, then I am naked ... and to my suprise ... I am always out of mana when I get rezzed. I have zero mana, this is a GODDAMN OUTRAGE! Nada. Zilch. NO MANA! W-T-F! Must be some strange cleric curse or something. Next time I'll petition it to see if SOE can correct this horrendous bug. Or hell, I'll demand our clerics to give me ONLY Divine Ressurection! Yeah, that's it!<br />
<br />
Now keep in mind, I have no idea how ressurections are in your quantum reality, so you probably are always rezzed with full mana. Hell I don't even think there is such concept as mana in your quantum universe. Lucky bloke!</div></div><hr />

Never argue with an idiot. You only stoop to their level, and then they beat you with experience.<br />
<br />
A society is in conspiracy against each and every one of it's members... To be great is to be misunderstood...nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
In a lot of places besides kael Res chanter, chanter loots, GM, charms a nearby mob, does more dps in 30 seconds then you'll do in the next 5 fights.<br />
<br />
WRONG: Unless dire charmed the enchanter takes the chance of dying just as stupidly from a charm break and still can't heal at all. Unless you count that chain rune theory in which case still can't match me in heals anyway. There were no mobs within a 4000 foot radius.<br />
<br />
<br />
Instead of coming here and tooting your horn, you should be thanking the cleric who rezzed you, since everything you did after the rez can be attributed to him.<br />
<br />
WRONG: It was a Paladin rez and I always thank my rezzers. Since I was bound at the entrance I would have most likely killed the see invisible mobs and come into the battle with even more mana before it was over.<br />
<br />
<br />
Very, the chanter is much more vital then the shaman<br />
<br />
WRONG: Tell that to the enchanters on the red server that syphon mana off me in ldon to continue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tbh though I'm pretty suprised a 65 shaman on Zek is so happy about how shaman are, your someones buff bot perchance? Or you spend your time in safe bluebiesque zones? Shamanic pvp abilities at 65 are hardly anything to be proud of =P<br />
<br />
WRONG: The Shaman is my main character and since all other classes  are garbage (EDIT: Now I am being a little rough. I'll change this statement to: &quot;I didn't like the other classes' attributes&quot;) I never made an alt nor did I purchase any characters. At the time you typed this I was in group PVP war. I slowed several members of the PK guild &quot;Curse&quot; and Ultored at least one in the Grey. My pets chased off another &quot;trainer&quot; pk while I was attacked NAKED and OOM .In the end we crushed their puny little Ssra rebellion despite their use of trains. It's so much fun here. Come to the red it's a refreshing and challenging feeling.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets see, I could prolly regen mana faster, have a pet up, and push out 3000 dmg in 5 minutes..oh wait I'm a Beastlord..gimme 3.5 minutes.<br />
stfü and crawl back down into your little hole little man.<br />
Damn, it feels good to be a über l33t, time flagged, high AA, Feral Lord.<br />
<br />
WRONG: Beastlords cannot heal beyond 400 a pop and can only do half the things I can after rez. Go cough up a hairball while casting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe you missed the post, but he was just taking a shot at beastlords compared to shaman. I don't include positive with attacks against other people. It would be like saying a white supremicist is being positive about his race.<br />
<br />
WRONG: white supremacy is a disgusting doctrine regarding the organized destruction of a human's life based on skin color. This is not human life. It's a nonexistant nonsentient class which subjects it to any abuse or praise I feel it deserves. I posted my taunt of the Beastlord class because everyone here feels down about Beastlords getting picked over them in situations. I figured this would be a humorous pickmeup. But I'm beginning to realize that there are some posters here that will continue to wallow in self misery and FAR MORE HATE than I could ever drum up no matter what!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He is an Idiot.<br />
Beast would have hit his /Disc and probably lived thus not needing a rez in the first place.<br />
Beast could make a Pet and do more damage while medding than he did with his regened mana.<br />
Beast doesnt really need that much mana in the first place in order to do respectable DPS. just Pet + Melee is approx 140-160DPS for my Beast with Zero mana<br />
<br />
WRONG: I'm stupid and covered that in the original sentence of this ENTIRE thread  along with &quot;sit agro&quot; for memming spells. Your disc and idiot comments are quite ill informed.  Beastlords cannot heal and therefore can only do DPS. Beastlord average dps is 100 with pet and still cannot help heal. Allow me to link parsed information to show everyone here what a liar you are.<br />

http://www.eqbeastlord.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=10702&amp;highlight=dps+parsed - incredible! I'm actually impressed wih this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
What are you so envious of, memming a root spell on a raid in which it does not matter at all, or sitting right next to AoW and dying, just so you could get back to full mana faster than any other class can after a rez? Even though you would have never been oom to begin with had you never sat down right beneath the mob in the first place. It's a good thing you have never done anything like this during a raid situation yet, and I hope you never do. You know those &quot;save the day&quot; heals he did? Think about those 10 seconds it took to click his corpse over stupity that the cleric could have been using for other things, like....I dunno..healing maybe? Something they are vastly superior at than a shaman is.<br />
<br />
WRONG: I memmed the root spell as part of a stereotypical spell set making your assumption incompetent. You seem to think that my death put the whole Raid at danger of wiping. Another assumption since there were several other Shamans in the Raid. And once again, it was a Paladin resurrection. See how much hate you have? All you do is make up things that you have little or no knowledge of. You can proudly display your ignorance before all under the guise that you remotely know what you're talking about. I admit that I'm stupid. It's time for you to do the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
So would you give me the same praise for modding up a sports car and breaking some speeding record, while smashing into someone else<br />
<br />
WRONG: Crashing into someone and killing them in real life does not compare to the unrealistic situation of dying in a video game. The only person I hurt from dying was myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
- You praise someone who is stupid enough to sit down in close proximity to a high DPS boss mob with weird undead/regular AI and with this behaviour he endangers his entire raid (hint: mob turns, ripostes entire melee raidforce). You praise someone who memorizes a root spell for AoW encounter. You praise someone who is a clueless idiot and ignores every other very valid point people point out. You praise someone who tries to attack beastlords without having any clue about basic game mechanics. Oh and I doubt people THINK he is studid, he proved it beyond the shadow of a doubt that he IS studid.<br />
<br />
WRONG: I endangered no one and whatever innane jibberish regarding ripostes is irrelevent. If you look at the parse time it took him one second to kill me and turn back to the main tank. This means a maximum of possibly one or 2 ripostes of maybe a maximum of 500dd to 1k dd. The root spell is part of a stereotypical spell set that I memmed to save time that included debuffs and dots and heals. You obviously are a BOT that stands at the zone entrance to rebuff and never actually goes into the raid to do split second decisions. I have more of a mathematical grasp of game mechanics in one brain cell than every ignorance filled flamer in this entire forum. The word is &quot;stupid&quot; not studid. I wasn't hired out to impregnate... BUT A MAN CAN DREAM!<br />
<br />
<br />
Your a disgrace to Shamans.<br />

Maybe you need to play with an actual beastlord.  I know my friend regularly crits me for over 1k on her heal with max healing aa's.  After she gets a rez she paragons and SD and has a pet out within a minute's time.  I do agree that a shaman is going to recover MUCH faster from the rez, but who cares who recovers faster?  I would much rather be able to do what the beastlord does all the time than have the edge over who recovers from a rez faster.<br />

Good point. Like I said. Just wanted to give Shamans some optimism on the recovery time of their class at the beginning. But I figure optimism is another word for &quot;idiot, retard, moron, etc.&quot; to several mouthy posters. Sorry if I flamed you earlier, had to switch to AE.<br />

Poor Ebayed character, it's real owner must be ashamed... There's a thing called a spell set. It was added recently. You'd know if you were there but you probably haven't owned your character more than 10 days.<br />
Amazingly enough you can have more than one spell set...so this does nothing at all to my assumption of root being pointlessly memorized for an AoW event or just about any other raid encounter for that matter.<br />

You seem to think that my death put the whole Raid at danger of wiping. Another assumption since there were several other Shamans in the Raid.<br />
So first you inflate your contribution to the raid and now you deflate it...<br />
<br />
I really can't understand what your real intention was with this thread to begin with.  To show that no matter how little attention the shaman class receives in comparison to all other classes, you will still play one?<br />
To say that everyone who whines on these boards about shamans not having had a bone tossed their way since Kunark/Luclin has no valid reason to speak, because shamans are in &quot;fact&quot; gods?  To show that someone who is somewhat witty with flames and knows some basics behind the class, isn't so hot in actually playing a shaman?  Or do you simply derive more entertainment out of casual manipulation of others than you do actually playing EQ?<br />
<br />
And my comparison with the car crash was just as intangible as your character is.  It doesn't matter what the hypothetical was based upon, it was simply a matter of taking pride in a stupid action vs taking pride in a stupid action.  In the end it's still just stupid.  But you have already admited having done a stupid action, so there isn't any need to reinforce this.  I was simply asking why someone else was proud of you for doing it.</div></div><hr />

Going to have to remember this. Our rangers seem to be lacking paying attention and continue to dps. While it has never been considered, I am going to make a point to have them monitor the main tank during boss encounters and switch to heals when needed.<br />
<br />
Same with Paly. It so ticks me off when they continue to stay in /attack mode as they cast that group heal. We are probably losing at least 0.01 sec of response time there.<br />
<br />
Same with SKs.<br />
<br />
Then we come to the stupid bstlords ... shame on them for keeping their pets on target and contributing dps when they need to back off and start tossing heals. This just shows the inherent nerf to bstlords, IMO. The pets should have 2 modes: fighter and healer. When the MT needs it the pet switches and instead of dps to target, it switches to MT and the proc becomes a heal spell.<br />

Most of your responses in threads Giac / Wildaar are &quot;I agree&quot; or &quot;Me too&quot;. Neither of you good for nothings have anything to contribute to the Crucible. I do not see any threads started by you. This is most likely because you can't figure out how. Neither of you are Shamans and therefore your opinions don't matter to anyone but your troll selves. My opinion as a Shaman does count though. I believe that you both should be thrown into a trash compactor for crimes against Crucible!<br />

I have 8 spell sets. They all have the root spell on them. They will continue to have a root spell in them. I'd like to help out on any necessary crowd control that might come up during and after the raid mob is dead or even further up when I still have it memmed. You are an idiot bot who hides behind enchanter skirts and bardic drums.You log out of the game after raid because you are useless on your own.

Do us all a favor and delete your Shaman and get off the Crucible web site. You remain illiterate and incapable of grasping even the most base of concepts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enarcheos, to see you quote greats like Ralph Waldo Emerson makes my teeth hurt.<br />
<br />
To see you even in my thread attacking my quotes confirms those very quotes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Going to have to remember this. Our rangers seem to be lacking paying attention and continue to dps. While it has never been considered, I am going to make a point to have them monitor the main tank during boss encounters and switch to heals when needed.<br />
Same with Paly. It so ticks me off when they continue to stay in /attack mode as they cast that group heal. We are probably losing at least 0.01 sec of response time there.<br />
Same with SKs.<br />
Then we come to the stupid bstlords ... shame on them for keeping their pets on target and contributing dps when they need to back off and start tossing heals. This just shows the inherent nerf to bstlords, IMO. The pets should have 2 modes: fighter and healer. When the MT needs it the pet switches and instead of dps to target, it switches to MT and the proc becomes a heal spell.<br />
Some of the above is meant to be sarcasm but this thread is so funny I will leave it to Enarcheos to identify it on his own<br />
<br />
Good job with sarcasm stupid. I will leave you to identify this: Shamans can heal with far better superiority than a Paladin, SK, ranger, or beastlord after recovering from a resurrection (The ENTIRE point of the thread missed on you as well). To try and group my ability to do both dps and heals with these other classes is uninformed and clueless.<br />

I'm tired of weak a*s Shamans whinin over dps<br />

And does this matter one bit if the entire raid wipes? No, not at all, because you still have to wait for everyone else besides you to get back to full mana.  And who cares that you can &quot;heal more than a hybrid after a resurrection&quot;?  You aren't healing more when you are face down in the dirt and they are still in the game.<br />
<br />
You log out of the game after raid because you are useless on your own. This has never been an issue for you because even soloing now is a scary thought for someone who won't have 50 or so living shields with them.<br />
Actually sometimes I do log out after a raid, but it's mostly because I've been sitting in front of a monitor for 5+ hours.  Usually I am casting things that matter, things that do not involve root.  And I have no problem making a group or being invited to one. I also have no problem pulling and tanking or doing CC(Ldon)..and in those cases root actually has a place...just not on raids...at least not a blue server anyway.:D<br />

I'm not your dog lol. Awaiting your order to rant Master. If I feel toon is a useless term, I will rant at will. And that's the point right there:QUOTE - &quot;What toon was what class&quot;. Therefore you have a Shaman alt, not a Shaman main. You don't regard this class with any more import than a... bard. That's why I hate toon. It's a term used by people who bought and SOLD their characters at Ebay with little regard for the effort made to build them up. I'm proud of my Shaman MAIN, His name is Enarcheos. His armor sucks because he didn't sell out to the guilds but EARNS his keep instead. When he dies, I will delete him and not sell him into the hands of someone who'd call him a toon and permaroot him in POK to re-FOS a twink Shadowknight. What else do you need to know?<br />
<br />
I have since joined a guild finding as many others have that the game DOES punish you for not fighting things in large packs. When I was yelling at the &quot;evil guilded&quot; I had also been flamed for my my opinions several times at a much higher rate than normal. Push me, and I'll push back. You won't like what I have to say. As for &quot;when I die&quot; I was refering to another thread going on at the time where people were talking about the LAST PLACE your character will die before you delete him. Did you really think that taking something out of context was witty? I'll do the same then.<br />

Hé fool,<br />
<br />
If you actually think that getting RL stuff as bad as Osama belongs in a flame war about a Virtual Issue you are beyond help.<br />
<br />
Till now it was at least amusing to watch you edit your posts, watch you make a fool of yourself and watch how you flamed like every poster on these boards.<br />
But getting stuff like this into it is insane.<br />
I am sure those who lost relatives due to this man are very amused to see you use this.<br />

But then you are from the Zek server and we all know what wonderfull players are to be found there.<br />
