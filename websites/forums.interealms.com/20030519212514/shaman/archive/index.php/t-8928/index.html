<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ArminiusXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I spent about 3-4 hours trying to pass this trial only to not even get past the first wave.<br />
Our biggest problem was our cleric dying. We had some real heavy DPS groups, 60shm 64clr 2 60+ rog and 60+wiz. I tried several times using tigirs to get all the agro on me which worked but the cleric got agro keeping me alive. I also tried turgurs and got most slowed but still just a little slow on killing the mobs. Is there something I am missing. The group was a pickup group all from one guild so they should know how to work together, but I suspect the biggest problem was not coordinating all the attacks on one mob, then quickly going to the next one.<br />
Is there any suggestions on positioning and agro control on the clerics part?<br />
I am soo sick of first tier planes, reminds me of DL and KC which I avoided like the plague. I can get better exp solo in PoN or even FG than some of the pickup groups around. I guess thats what I get for having a broken computer, then coming back 3 months later with guild disbanded and all old friends already in PoV/PoS</div></div><hr />

<br />
FYI, PoS and PoV are all just like dreadlands (except less interesting).<br />
<br />
But about the trial of execution.<br />
<br />
Add a warrior with reasonable gear to that group (6k+ hps).  Cleric only heals the warrior with elixir.  Warrior gets aggro on everything in sight.  Warrior has max damageshields (potion + dru/mag).  Don't slow a damn thing.<br />
<br />
You are the MA for the group.  You tank one of the mobs keeping torpor on yourself and keeping aggro for the rogues.<br />
<br />
The key here is the warrior+damageshield.  He soaks up the damage and the damageshield tears the other three mobs up.  By the time your group gets the first mob dead, the rest of them will be at half health and you tear through them like a hot knife through butter.  <br />
<br />
If the cleric ends up chealing or fasthealing the warrior he will likely take aggro, and depending on how early in the fight this occurs, it could screw you over.  That is why the warrior having good AC and hps is key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ArminiusXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Forgot about number 6, it was a 60 warrior. I tried to tell them slowing wasnt the way, just wanted confirmation. Will wip up a batch of DS potions then I guess. Thanks for the input. <br />
Even if PoV/PoS is the same at least I will catch up to my old friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Take out some damage dealers and add an enchanter or bard and a tank.  You should still have enough dps.  Make sure no direct heals are used. Just stay close to the MT and nuke with spear of torment or the 54 nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Unless you have torpor and can realy take a beating without the clerics help dont slow and dont heal much just nuke a ton. Slow the boss mob. Inbetween fights heal up everyone to conserve clerics mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tigirs is a shaman death sentence in that trial, and with the amount of damage you have it shouldn't be too necessary except on the final guy.  Use Turgur on him.<br />
<br />
Make sure the cleric has DA memmed, and make sure you have a fast heal memmed as well.  Cleric uses HoT's, if cleric gets agro he uses DA, if that doesn't get agro off him use your fast heal on the cleric to get agro onto you.  With an enchanter instead of the wizard it would be easier for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Every time I've done Exe, I use Tigger's.  It gets the aggro on me for all the adds and keeps it off other casters.  I then concentrate on keeping myself alive as the cleric heals the MA slowly.  I save the Puppies of POWA for the boss man and make sure the team's concentrating on any names that pop.  Also, make sure if you got a dr00d that he's banishing the rocks, which will take a Malo out of you.  Also, don't rush it, you have 30 secs to kill each creature and a set time between the last one's death and the next wave.  The cleric needs as much med time as possible!  Can V between waves......<br />
<br />
Also, you're at a great disadvantage if the cleric doesn't have KEI, both in manapool size and mana regen.  Trade buffs with the chanter's group to get this on your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nanuq Daktari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">61 Shaman, 61 Warrior, 61 Cleric, 61 Mage, 61 Chanter, 61 Rogue.<br />
<br />
That was the first win.  Was a bit close.  As we did the trials more, I leveled up to 62 which helped due to the tnargs mending fast heal.  We also substitued a SK with the Zepher's spell, for a couple hundred extra group mana for casters.  Also worked in a Wizard in place of the mage at times.  For the most part though, least everytime I was in the trials the basic same folks of me the shaman, the cleric, and the chanter.<br />
<br />
The chanter used ae tash the all 4 of his ae stuns, working up from his lowest to his highest level.  By the time he did his highest the lowest was able to be recast.  I topor'd the chanter just before each wave to assist as well as he runed himeself.  Mage kept close eye for when to try to banish rocks and when to hold off on it due to executioner positioning.  One person kept eye out and called 'On platform' when he reached so we knew to kill it quickly then.  Warrior stand and gets aggro right in front of steps to platform, thus attempting to keep mobs off the benches.   For some reason ae sometimes missed them when the mob was on bench.<br />
<br />
As for me, I cast AE slow once they got clumped up.  Then I cast my AE poison rain, then poison dd (Spear of Torment) two times usually then mob dead.  Second mob AE rain, then dd 1 or 2 times.  Third and forth mob I just dd'd while keeping eye out on executioner.  During the 3rd and 4th mob of each wave I would work Cann's in and mage rod.  Right after the 4th mob dead, if Cann V was up, I'd use it.  By the 4th wave cleric would be near 90 mana as would I.  Some reason though that 4th wave always took the mana out.  On the executioner, the chanter would tash, then i would use tigirs on him still, as he was (still is?) slow mitigated.   Then I'd toss my epic on em and spot heal and jbb.<br />
<br />
After that first win, which was like the 5th or so real go at it, we seemed to have it all down.  Then it would take 1 or 2 with the other classes being worked in.  I have been sub'd out for druid, wiz, sk also but it wasn't untill the sk's got zephers that it really started working.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much the way I go in and how I play my shaman part.  I got easier, of course, each time I leveled till 63 and I had my 61/62 spells.  They REALLY help out in there.   I used a horse as well as cleric too.   Gear I have is full SS and about equiv to a little better for other spots.<br />
<br />
heh, one run things went bad but got the day saved by our cleric kiting around for 1 last nuke.  He was the last standing. haha.  It definately wasn't pretty, but a win IS a win.  Thankfully, we don't cut that close anymore. =)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a little for what ya can do as a shaman role.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Our strategy has worked without fail in recent weeks, simply a beefy cleric/paladin, wizzy, 2x melee dps or a rogue + bard, we provide them with mage/ench/sham buffs also, the 6th slot = whoever you want to get flagged for pop, they barely have to be awake tbh =)<br />
<br />
Druids/mages work good in there too with banishment though.<br />
<br />
Main thing, get every bit of DS you can, mage damage shield, fire elemental illusion, shaman ds pots, chardok ring, if you can name it, get it =)<br />
<br />
Don't bother slowing anything except the executioner at the end (Although I havent been in there since slow mitigation went wobbly again admittedly, not sure how reliable turgurs is on him now), instead just nuke away, cure slows and torpor the non melees the second a mob looks at them.  <br />
<br />
Paladin uses Hwop for agro, mobs all pincushion themselves on the pally's ds whilst the damage dealers assist of the pally and mow down the mobs 1 by 1.<br />
<br />
Try to keep DD healing for between waves as much as possible, Supernal/etheral elixir are fantastically powerful tools for the trial and won't get your cleric agro.<br />
<br />
If your MT is taking damage too fast, try chain casting disinfecting aura on him, the enchanter mobs frequently stop to reapply tash =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The best trials groups you can make have mages in them.<br />
My favorite trial group is Tank, Shaman, Healer, Mage, Mage, Mage.  If I need to get someone through the trial that isn't in one of the above classes, I sub in that person for one of the mages.<br />
<br />
Mages (druids too) can banish summoned mobs.  This is an immediate no xp kill that still resets the executioner.  You banish the rocks that spawn, and get a lot of time to med up between waves.  Pet classes in general are good for trials.  Necros have a good damage output on their pet, and they can nuke as well for the fast damage needed to drop the mob before executioner does his thing.<br />
<br />
You need a main tank for the trial.  He's main assist.  Send pets at the assist.  Mages do NOT assist him if they are banishing a mob.  If the executioner gets to the prisoner, and the mob is still at only 1/2 health, you might still make it if you have enough wizards and necros and mages for the fast nuke damage.<br />
<br />
Tirgir's insects is the biggest waste of a spellslot I've ever used in trial of exe.  The only thing it ever does is overaggro mobs onto me.  Mobs slowed with tirgir's seemed to 100% mitigate the slow in my experience in the trial.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, the order of importance I have on things is:<br />
1.  If the executioner is about to kill prisoner then nuke the main assist with poison nuke<br />
2.  Heal the main healer if he's needs healing.<br />
3.  Heal casters with Torpor and fast heals.  Heal tanks with 2k heal if you can to save the healer some mana.<br />
4.  Nuke stuff at your leisure depending on how easily you are going through mobs and the waves.  Torrent of Poison is a great nuke if you are down to 1 or 2 mobs left for the wave.<br />
<br />
When you get to the final boss, malo him (if you have malo), and then slow with turgur.  Heal as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've done the exe trial with many different group makeups, so while DPS is the key to exec trial, you don't really need a set formula to pass it.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, I found recently that tirgirs pretty much does nothing on the mobs from the 4 waves. I've actually chain casted tirgirs on the same mobs 3 times, until I got the Yawn message from all 4 at once... and they did not seem to slow down at all. My advice is stick to nuking and healing. Use Torrent when there are only 2 mobs left, and use your single target poison DDs to speed up the kills.<br />
<br />
If you aren't the main healer, then it's your job to keep the main healer alive. A smart cleric will use SE (or CE) as their main heal, then CH the tank and melee in between castings. Your job is to keep him alive, and let him deal with the rest. If you have a druid, then have him concentrate on the MT and you, while you heal the rest with tnargs or torpor (on casters only).<br />
<br />
The key to exec trial is targetting. As long as your MA targets fast, you'd be fine. Even if he/she just uses F8 it's still a lot better than wasting time trying to find the right mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Boinshar hits it on the head.  While DPS is key, there are a few other things to take into serious consideration.  <br />
<br />
The very most important one is agro management.<br />
<br />
Clerics should use Heal over time spells as much as possible.  If they need to use bigger heals and get agro, you must keep them alive.<br />
<br />
You need a MA who can target fast and get everyone to killing mobs FAST.<br />
<br />
You need someone, be it your MA, or someone else... bards work very very well for this... to be able to pickup the agro on all the other mobs that the tank is not actively fighting.  So they do not agro on your casters or healers.<br />
<br />
You as a shaman should be doing what shaman do... filling the gaps.  Don't slow, instead pass out damage shield potions.  Anyone who is taking hits should have a DS on.  Heal.  If you have a bard who is taking the hits on the extras, you can use torpor on them, they are likely using AE dots and other AE spells to control the extra mobs and not contributing a great deal of damage via melee.  Keep the cleric alive.<br />
<br />
Personally I passed my trial as the one and only healer.  It certainly wasn't flawless, 3 of the 6 people with me bought it to the boss, but I think with tnargs and a better understanding of the event and the strategy that is most important that I could keep an entire group alive, with luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raxthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Its all about damage per second (DPS). All the shaman has to do is get tigirs to land, if you do not, you have lost. Then throw bane on all the mobs that are not currently being attacked. <br />
<br />
Now just as much as this is about level it is also about gear. You can have two 60 plus rogues, but if they are not equipt with haste items or awesome weapons, then their DPS is going to stink.<br />
<br />
My grouped used:<br />
62 shaman (me) :P<br />
65 warrior (required to keep mobs off cleric) (Warrior/Paladin/SK)<br />
62 Rogue (rogue/monk/ranger)<br />
65 Rogue (rogue/monk/ranger)<br />
65 Wizard (Wizard/Mage/Necro/Druid)<br />
61 Cleric<br />
<br />
I can also be done AoE style, it just takes the high level casters to do it so they don't get resisted.<br />
<br />
Oh, I almost forgot. Use that pet of yours. Buff it up and summon it to the trial when you start. Even if it is not the new pet, atleast it is adding to the DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did the trial about 2 weeks ago, right after the slow nerf (or so I heard). I cast Tigir on the first wave, 3 yawned and started beating on me. From what I saw, they weren't slowed at all. Cleric healed me, got agro and had to blow a DA to stay alive through the first wave. <br />
<br />
After that, I switched over to healing and nuking for the next 3 waves. Healing especially seemed to help a lot. Cleric mainly used HoTs and I'd top off the tanks with Kraggs, which had surprisingly little agro. Only time the cleric got agro after that was when he had to use a direct heal on an off-tank while I was locked into another heal. <br />
<br />
Boss mob turned out to be surprisingly easy. I malo'd and used a real slow which seemed to work well. Nobody came close to dying that fight. <br />
<br />
Group was Cleric, shaman, ranger, warrior, BST and monk so pretty high DPS where I didn't have to worry much about adding DPS, just keeping people alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What worked best for us last night was 2 wizards, 1 cleric, 1 Shaman, 1 Warrior, and one Ranger.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sshiverr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I made it through the trials with a pick up group.  Group was me  (61 shaman), 61 warrior that i always group with, 2x65 rogues, 61 druid and 65 bard.  Went in fully buffed with Mage DS, the bard AOE slowed, the warrior agroed everything and we just went to town.  Druid mostly just healed while i through in some patch heals and some nukes when it looked like the mobs were dying quite fast enough.  When we got to the boss mob the druid was still at 2 bubs and I was at 4 bubs.  Slowed him on my first try and just healed through the rest of the fight.  Druid and I both had enough mana for 1 heal left after he was dead.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just did this last night with guild.<br />
<br />
60 Shaman, 64 warrior, 63 Mage, 64 rogue, 61 enchanter and 60 cleric.<br />
<br />
Went in with Mage DS, and buffed to the gills with everything everyone had.  <br />
<br />
Make a pet.  Get the mage to give a mask and 2 of those proccing stones that pets wield.   Have summon companion up as you pop into the room.<br />
<br />
Go in with a mod rod too.  Stored mana is UBER in those fights.  I also had him give me a ring and bracer for higher DDs and Shorter Casting times.<br />
<br />
Slow is only used when the big boy pops.<br />
<br />
Tank has to have good targetting skills and everyone should assist nicely.  <br />
<br />
I was doing 754pt Poison nukes, and was almost never resisted.  When things were going good, I would JBB for added damage.  Put up PR/DR debuff, I didn't but its a good idea to have.   Usually I would nuke once, then JBB.  If the critter was going down nicely I would Canni, or throw in another JBB.  If he wasn't going down well, I would toss another poison nuke.  I only used Jbb when things were going according to schedule.  I was on a horse so I was medding while nuking and saved mana.  As well I could always Click off horse, crouch and pooison nuke in a fraction of a second if the call came down.<br />
<br />
I did get down to about 20m by the 4th wave, but canni and rod brought me back into the fight.<br />
<br />
All in all this test is designed around Maximum DPS.  Shammys aren't designed that way very well.  Given the time frame for persistent DPS and mana usage, you should be using Mages and/or ROgues for the most part. <br />
<br />
All in all, it was rough getting this shaman flagged, and with the group that I was in, it took 2 tries to get it down right.  First try I went in with various spells memmed (slow, Disinfecting Aura, Canni, Poison Nuke, BoN, etc.), and failed horribley.  Second time in I concentrated excelusively on KILLING something (poison nuke), and didn't cast any other spell except slow on the Boss.<br />
<br />
Slow stuck after Malo and tash and he was really slowed.<br />
<br />
THis was completed Last night.  12/15/2002.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nanuq Daktari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As you can see, some shaman do use the tigirs with no problems, some get pelted into mush.  The group make ups very quite a bit.  Really in a way, as frustrating as it is, it is all about put a group together and figure out the best way for you to adapt to the group makeup to assist the best.<br />
<br />
And, in my experience, a tiny bit of good fortune.  Good fortune, meaning that some pet class, or chanter didn't leave a darn pet in there before you else you'll lose someone in your group once the executioner spawns.<br />
<br />
I've seen many group makeups pass, some are easier than others granted, but I'm really going to have to say it really come down to the skills of each player knowing how to adapt and work as a team with perfection or close to it. ;) <br />
<br />
I've seen some post say don't waste mana using tigirs as you'll get pelted, and I've seen use it.   Again, its all about group makup and your tactics.  In my scenario, mobs never laid a hit on me nor did I draw aggro from any.  They all stayed on the MA or around him, due to the enchanters tactics.<br />
<br />
Best advice, is to put your group together, one that will stay together and work out the best tactics for each class and you'll pass in a few runs after ya fine tune it, if fine tuning was necessary as ya may get it right the first time round hopefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mukguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I play a 61 paladin as well as this char, and when I have done it, the most success I have had was with no slowing and no CC.<br />
<br />
Why no slowing? Damage shields..... <br />
Group should have a druid and a mage to banish the Rock guys( they are flagged summoned) ( perhaps &quot;project alpha&quot; a summoned mage sword for &quot;someone&quot; )<br />
<br />
The druid/mage can also DS everyone. <br />
Shammy should go all out damage and light heals on cleric during waves and focus on slowing the last mob, some DD and helping keep the MA alive.<br />
<br />
I did it with no chanter, in fact although this may be an unpopular thing to say here, I never won with a shammy and a chanter in same group for trials, yes I know lots of people have, but my point is, dont let anyone say we cant do this with no CC. It can be done and I am proof.<br />
<br />
Being a paladin I was also able to use group heals to help get some aggro off the cleric and heal up folks.<br />
<br />
You have to kill a mob every 20 seconds, so really its straight out balls to the wall.<br />
And like I tell many frustrated people, if you go in with a group that gives 100% and cant get 1 or 2 mobs killed before losing the trial, get a new group... no point in trying 10 times and not getting close.<br />
My group went in and made it to the third round and we had a ping pong and mage ran out of star rubies, so we could identify our errors and decided this group could win, so we got star rubies and made sure people didnt ping pong and we won.<br />
Earlier in the night I was in a group that just couldnt do it, so I politely left and found another group.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I tried last night with 60 shm(me), 60 warr, 65 mage, 63 cleric, 65 rogue, 61 or 62 wizard. Problem is, all others were in same guild and mage had obviously completed trials before. first try and warrior dropped fast. I then got instructed that I had to slow them all. I tried to explain that it did not work to slow them and it only kills me. Got really quit in group say, figure they were discussing me in GC. I said I would slow if he really wanted me to but cleric better be readu to heal me if I can't channel torpor. Second try you guessed it, I died shortly after tigir. Mage then informs us he is leaving and groups falls apart. <br />
<br />
I would have liked a higher tank but I think we should have been ablt to win with that mix. Was it a bad group make-up or just bad tactics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The group makeup looks pretty good.  I would say it was a combination of bad luck and bad tactics.  It also sounds like the warrior didn't have the greatest gear if he was dying that fast.  Just keep at it and don't get discouraged.  If you are going with pickup groups you should feel very lucky to pass in under 10 attempts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cattie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I passed it with a 65 enc, 65 rogue, 61 monk, me (61), 63 war, and a 63 cleric.  <br />
<br />
Didn't bother using tigir's as it was a waste of mana with the enchanter chain stunning. I assisted and nuked using spear of torment, only bothered to slow the executioner.  <br />
<br />
It went relatively smoothly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I agree there are lots of different group setups possible. Once we even used a Paladin as main healer and it worked well :)<br />
<br />
As for DPS you can argue all you want, nothing beats an epic mage (or with the new pet), preferably with some crit aa's. While a Rogue or Monk or Ranger are also good damage they just can't compare to a mage. The pet won't have problems finding the target, the mage's DD's are pretty good and they can banish if needed.<br />
<br />
So for those lacking some DPS dump all melees (except tank of course) and add Mages, they're your best assets in the trials.<br />
<br />
Edit: Don't EVER use Tigir in the trials. It used to work well but in some patch they made the regular wave mobs mitigate slow 100% it seemed. All you do with using Tigir is overagroing which leads to the Cleric having to heal you fast which kills the Cleric.</div></div><hr />
