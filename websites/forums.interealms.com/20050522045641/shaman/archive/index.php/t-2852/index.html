<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dohrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a barb shaman soon 44, with 1k PP in bank.<br />
What piece of equipment should I upgrade?<br />
<br />
I think of the silver veil (I look for an acrylia cloak to upgrade my cloak, I already have a flawless rockhopper hide and one block of acrylia, as soon as I got the 2nd I shall pay a master tailor to make a try for me).<br />
<br />
This is my profile:<br />

<br />
I saw a barbarian spiritist hammer to sell for 1k, but I have only around 60 in 2HB...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advices<br />
Dohrian, on Ayonae Ro</div></div><hr />

<br />
First glance you're looking pretty good for 43 to me. Pick up some JB or Crystal Chitin gloves to replace the totemic ones perhaps? The stats on totemic arent too useful to you so you're not missing much by swopping them out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definitely change out the wis rings first chance you get..<br />
<br />
Also get a PMM as soon as you can or an Arctic Wyvern Mask (cheap :) maybe 500 on Bristlebane)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dohrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the advice, I shall try to get an Artic Wyvern Mask.<br />
But what is a PMM?<br />
And why change the +6 WIS rings, and what for?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Swap the wisdom rings for 2 6ac/65hp rings or a 6ac/65hp and shadel bandit ring.  The general consensus around here is that AC/HP are greater than everything else, of which the wisdom rings have neither.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what a PMM is myself . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">polished mithril mask?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OH, get the BSH!  If you have a chance to get the barbarian spiritis hammer jump on it my boy!  You will not regret that decission.  Decent melee stats, decent wis, and a SWEET proc.  <br />
I was lucky enough to be given one to me by my guild at lev 46 and it never left my side until I received the epic.  Skill can be trained rather quickly, so don't fret your lack of 2hb.<br />

P.S.  The Keg on a stick look is also pretty sweet )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, polished mith mask.. fair ac and it gives a bit of wis to add to our pool.  That and I actually FOUND a use for damage improvement 2.. mind you it was using my poison nuke KSing in a 2 group trip to Siren's grotto but STILL ;)<br />
<br />
Serioulsy though, it's free on a naggy raid and the graphic on a troll looks cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dohrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the advices, I bought the barb spiritist hammer for 1k, and I shall try to find a group on Fire giants.<br />
