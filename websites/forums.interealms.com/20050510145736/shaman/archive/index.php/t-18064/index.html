<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rad100</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Newb question inc:<br />
<br />
 *** is the point of ancient spells? They seem to be the exact spell as the normal versions of themselves with a lower level requirement. Can anyone tell me what the point of these are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At the time the ancient spells first became available, level 60 was the highest level possible and the ancient spells were better versions of existing spells.<br />
<br />
Ancient Feral Avatar &gt; avatar and primal avatar<br />
(+120 to stats vs. +100 to stats)<br />
<br />
Ancient Scourge of Nife &gt; Bane of Nife<br />
(254 a tick for 7 ticks vs. 214 a tick for 7 ticks)<br />
<br />
If you use Lucy to compare the spells, the ancient spells are superior to other spells available at that time. The ancient spells were intended to be rewards for big raiding guilds, dropping off targets like Lord Seru and VT named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rad100</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So once you get the 65 spells (Ferine Avatar/Blood of Saryn) the ancient versions of the lower level spells are basically worthless?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup, just like when you get Quies, Torp becomes worthless, or you get Malos and Malo becomes worthless. The game moved on past Ancients.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grubbnubbnubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Worthless, no.<br />
Dey jus not as useful as dey was.<br />
Once ya git FA, den ya will probly never use any other type of Avatar spell.<br />
But Ancient Nife is still a useful spell.<br />
Its mana ta damage is still guds and stacks nicely wit Blood fer doin fastish DOT damage ta a mob.<br />
But due ta da way these drop, unless ya is farmin Seru / VT ya will not see dem.<br />
So if ya git a chance ta pick one up, do so, otherwise I would not worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still want Ancient Nife.  Not concerned about scribing ancient FA other than to complete spellbook however - FA surpasses it in every way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">both are usefull, you stack an extra DoT or hit more melees with avatar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">both are usefull, you stack an extra DoT or hit more melees with avatar.<br />
<br />
I would never keep 2 Avatar spells memmed. Ever. Just not happening. The 3 big DOTs we have are pretty darn adequate. Add the Epic if you want more. <br />
<br />
Given unlimited spell slots these spells MIGHT have some use, however, overall, they really are not worth even putting on Page 9 once you have the upgraded versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would never keep 2 Avatar spells memmed. Ever. Just not happening.<br />
<br />
6 to 9 shaman at raids in my guild, not everybody is debuffing and no need to have DoTs memmed since mobs die so fast. so yes, you can have 2 avatar memed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SoN + bane + BoS is really alot of damage.<br />
254 + 420 + 320 = 994 then add in an average 10% for a BA IV item. 1093 per tick. That's 182 dps on avarage.<br />
<br />
Nothing like getting summoned when the mob is at 5% :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Useless?<br />
<br />
So you only ever cast 1 poison dot at a time?<br />
When im doing fast dots its<br />
Bane of nife and blood of saryn.<br />
Think id love to replace bane with scourge</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Scourge of nife is very very good and definately worth getting if you can.<br />
<br />
Note its damage to mana ratio is also the same as Blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The ancient avatar is useless now with ferine avatar in the game. Not because ferine adds more stats but because of the lowered recast time. I can keep ferine avatar up on 8 or 9 melees if i'm really trying. I cant see meming another avatar to get 2 or 3 more.<br />
<br />
Scourge of nife on the other hand can be useful and was more useful before ldon came out. Stacking dots isn't uncommon and scourge of nife was our second best dot till ldon came out. It was also handy that it's lvl 60 so effected by lvl 3 focuses. Now that bane has taken over as our best dot I'd say scourge is our 3rd or possibly even 4th dot now but there are still times when I can see using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">both are usefull, you stack an extra DoT or hit more melees with avatar.<br />
<br />
good fun for having aggro wars with shadowknights in exp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The best thing about ancient bane is when you want agro. Now. The amount of hate it produces is just insane. Not enough? Mem disempower or whatever the first spell in that line is called.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ancient Scourge of Nife is actually a very useful spell.  It's a great aggro generator when you want that sort of thing, also does good dmg/mana ratio.  I use it all the time when I'm soloing mobs, as it adds good DPS and stacks with everything.  <br />
<br />
Ancient Feral Avatar is next to worthless.  <br />
<br />
So in conclusion, get Ancient Scourge, don't worry bout Ancient avatar.</div></div><hr />
