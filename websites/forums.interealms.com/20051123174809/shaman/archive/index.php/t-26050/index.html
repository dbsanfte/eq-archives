<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Waste of $5 as it is right now.  At the moment, you access the first zone, which is in roughly 25-27.  You can only enter with one or two people, so if you were hoping to explore with a group of friends, you will be disappointed.  Click on the tomb, get a quest update.  You then proceed to click on tombstones to spawn named D'Morte mobs.  Do this a dozen times and then click on the tomb again - recieve a neck.  <br />
<br />
Travel to Timber falls, get quest update, then run all the way back.  And when I say this was an uncreative way to update the zone and the quest, let me stress this, because all it was was a waste of 15minutes of my time.<br />
<br />
Zone back into D'Morte, mobs are exactly the same, except they're low level 30s now.  Head up to the room with the named (I think it was SW).  Kill named, get quest update.  Break down wall, kill named inside the tomb that spawns upon examining it, and boom, your neck updates.<br />
<br />
That's it.  Nothing more to the zone.  No other &quot;creative&quot; content.<br />
<br />
Loot drops are tagged low-mid level 30, but have low-mid 20's stats on them.  Experience wasn't anything to write home about, so that didn't make up for it.  Overall, the preorder on the adventure pack was an enormous disappointment.  Absolutely no creativity was shown with this zone.  So don't expect Nek Castle, which I would say has been Sony's best work up to this level range.<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor and just wait until late March, and even then, I'd wait to see what other people say before wasting $5 on this lackluster adventure pack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks for the update.  I've been resisting to start that &quot;adventure&quot;.  In fact, there are no adventures, just shopping lists to complete.<br />

Yup, you're only getting a nibble here of what's coming out. <br />
<br />
So far the loot drops have been good for the level of difficulty and the XP is pretty damn good too. (for low 30's anyway) Even if you can't use the armour/items that drop you can sell them for some pretty decent coin. (Even merchants give nice chunks for them)<br />
<br />
Considering I spend more than 5 bucks on my morning coffees in a week, I don't have too much a problem paying out some pocket change for a bunch of new zones within one theme.</div></div><hr />
