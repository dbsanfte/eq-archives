<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm just curious what you guys think EQ will look like in 2 years(if it's still around)? Seriously and joking.... :D<br />
<br />
1. SOE realizes all other classes aren't necessary they get rid of all classes except for warriors, clerics, beast lords, and druids.(You will be assimilated)<br />
<br />
2.All classes get a port stone that will port you where ever you want(semi-serious here)<br />
<br />
3. A new NPC is created by soulbinder, who after you pay him X amount of PP or adventure points will rezz you(super rez autoloot suits you up and everything)<br />
<br />
4./autorun feature, like autopilot punch in your destination and you automatically run there, that's right you can take your bio break fridge raid. This of course is for the places  your insta-click port stone won't take you<br />
<br />
5. Hiring mercenaries, what's that can't find a cleric, a slower, or need a tank for your group? Click your port stone and /autorun to the nearest mercenary vendor and renta tank.<br />
<br />
6. Buy a friend. No one on your friends list? Your on everyones ignore list, for an extra $5 a month SOE will provide you with a friend to chat to while you have nothing to do.<br />
<br />
7. Buy a camp. I saw this posted somewhere on here, tired of standing in line for ubber item x, pull up the automatic pay machine on your UI and you can buy that item for a fixed price!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
8. Yantis buys EQ from SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, ok in all seriousness.<br />
<br />
1) Level limit will be 80.<br />
<br />
2) There will be one new player race and one new class. Race will be between Goblin, Othmir, an Undead / Tier'dal cross, or one that changes appearance at will.<br />
<br />
Class will be a rip off from W.O.W. I'm guessing a Hunter / Undead lord / Pet - user hybrid. <br />
<br />
3) One new continent. Figure underwater with an entrance somewhere in Veksar.<br />
<br />
4) A new TS. Figure an alchemy rip-off (Who cares about Shaman.  &quot;What's a Shaman&quot;?) similar to DAOC's Alchemy wherein players (and I mean ALL players) can create their own Augs.<br />
<br />
5)  New AA's most will suck - HOWEVER, Sony will give the option to pick up some class defining skills / abilities for  beaucoup and schwanzig  AA's.<br />
<br />
This will be deemed 'creative' on the part of the Dev's as they will have run out of new ideas and simply rip-off classes.<br />
<br />
6) There will be more Focus effects than you can shake a stick at.  <br />
<br />
7) The option to re-roll as another class with equal level and AA's will be offered.<br />
<br />
8) There will be much discussion about the possiblity of players entering a parallel world via a one-way portal. (3 expansions from now). The world will have super-duper MOBs / quests / p}{4t L3wtz, but once you go - you don't come back.<br />
<br />
This will be their answer to the ever-growing discrepancy between raiders and non-raiders.<br />
<br />
9) The top of the line gear in LDON will still be 1492 points.<br />
<br />
10) Upgrades to Shaman healing, a change to DoT aggro and Malos casting and recasting time will still be  under evaluation</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It'll be kinda like Ultima online in the year 2003,  . . . deserted.<br />
&quot;I have 9k hps as a shaman!&quot;<br />
&quot;who cares dude?  We play WoW.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">they'll go too far in making EQ more noob friendly.. and break the game completely, causing all the raiders to leave and therefore cutting their population by 97%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There will be 12, maybe 14 of us who couldnt afford to upgrade our pos systems to handle all the new graphic engines for the new games on the last, single server in EQ two years from now.<br />
I will have made my own guild by then. The BOWL.<br />
The Best Of What's Left. We will do single group ldon hards, with a waiting list to the 2-3 latecomers who decided to show up to the raid late.<br />
On a brighter note, that means there will be a 1in12, maybe a 1in14 chance that I will be the top shaman in EQ. The family will be very proud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">honestly.. how people cant afford to upgrade their computers is beyond me.. nowadays you can buy a very respectable computer for under 800 from a friggin retail store.. and its even cheaper if you know where to buy your own parts.. hell im about to buy a laptop for ~$26CAD per month plus interest.. thats less then broadband prices in my area<br />
<br />
i remember buying an ibm for like.. 2000+? back in the day and its pure crap by todays standards.. you can buy a better one for 50 bucks :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level cap 75 or 80, gimping nearly all the game such that every guild is doing nothing but the current expansion or two.  SOE will have given up on instancing so they can see 100 guilds all fight for the same 4 zones.<br />
<br />
/zone will be added as a player useable command.  You people think I'm joking.  I said years ago it would come to that.  First it was the spires with Luclin allowing people to jump from continent to continent with a small wait time, then it was the PoK books allowing people to instantly jump between most all popular zones and zones like PoTranq where all zones are just a click a way, then Magus were added to allow even more instant travel, the next step will be NPC's in every zone just like Magus that will port you to any zone by just asking, eventually people will complain that it takes them too long to run to that NPC and they'll give us /zone.   Of course druids will complain they got nerfed from losing the ability to port people and they'll be given 100% GM Rez, a right click CHeal with no recast time, and bard speed SoW's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmm there will be added another 300 aa.<br />
There will be a new class/race.(just as WoW is released)<br />
There will be guild housing as the concept to sell the next expansion.<br />
Servers will integrate.<br />
They will add an upgrade to Gems to keep people playing.<br />
The new mobs in a new expansion since having run out of names will have the names of GoD mobs backwards.<br />
They will revamp VT.<br />
They will add a portal to GoD.<br />
They will revamp cities to make them more inviting to new people.<br />
A new series of Ldon dungeons which start in places in Luclin.<br />
There will be a cure for Evercrack which when applied will have people rubbing their eyes and suddenly there will be an influx of pale people on the streets which will cause a news investigation as to the cause. J/k!</div></div><hr />

Housing is reserved for EQ2, like most of the unimplemented ideas :)<br />

Bah, what good would a house do us anyway, when a mob could just follow you in and kick your butt where ya live just as easily as outside.<br />
<br />
I'll never figure out how that giant beetle manages to get the front door of any structure open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Honestly, I do not see the game running more than 1 year from now. Its fairly obvious they are completely out of original ideas. Just look at the list of spells for every class. Its REALLY not that much different from the &quot;Take PoP spells, at 15% across the board&quot; that the started with in the first place. One or two AA's raise an eyebrow, but a lot of them are pretty ho-hum. Content is becoming far too cookie cutter. Unless they get some new blood into the game, they will find thir playebase trickling away steadily. I think its topped out, and frankly I will be shocked if there are even 50% as many subscribers 1 year from today. <br />
<br />
Some ideas to extend the life of the game:<br />
<br />
-Bring back interest in the zones that are totally obsolete. Fabled mobs were an awesome idea. People spent hours and hours trying to get stuff, even if it was only for alts. Zone re-vamps are cool, but they just arent econiomical. They should consider JUST reitemizing some zones, to re-new interest. If they added some marginal stats to some gear, people MIGHT just go there. Lets take Lower Guk, for example. If they added a few stats to FBSS (say 25 hps, +5 str, +5 sta, it still wouldnt be a GREAT item, but it would be usable. As is stands, LG is a faction pit with a pile of garbage thats barely worth carrying to the Tribute master. <br />
<br />
-Soloable Instanced content in LDoN. Even if the points were low, it will still allow people an option. There was a rumor that they would be adding something like this, where you could hire an NPC mercanary (as was suggested above) of your choice, so a tank could hire a healer and a heal could hire a tank (that would be better than the standard pet at taunting, etc). <br />
<br />
-Fix the cleric thing. There is a thread here now about it. Its SERIOULSY dragging the game down at this point. Cleric is a mega-burnout class. As a shaman, I can go ninja-AFK for a couple minutes if I need to, and about all that will likely happen is the tank will take a bit more damage and need an extra heal. On raids, no one even notices if I am AFK these days. But if a Cleric looks away from the screen in a fight or a raid, even just for a minute to answer the phone, someone is probably gonna die. They NEED to spread out the healing a LOT LOT more. I am beginning to think that I should change my position on the healing situation for shamans (currently, I feel like we only need a minor bump, to become effective back-up healers, but I am slowly changing that)<br />
<br />
The biggest problem they hav right now is they have mudlated themselves into a VERY deep corner, and it may not be salvagable. This 250-300 hp stuff shouldnt be dropping til lvl 75-80, IMHO. They started wrecking it with VT, and PoP was just disgusting. Even Gates went WAY too far on the upgrades. Each expansion should only add about 10% on top of the last one, not the 30-50% we are seeing. Whats next? Tanks with 20K+ hps? Spells that do 10K damage pre-crit? Trash mobs with 1,000,000 hps that quad for 3K per? I just dont see it. Mudflation has seperated the EQ population by a margin that is so severe that it is now 2 COMPLETELY different games. There has always been a gap, but sheesh, the monk Guildleader of the top guild on my server is something like 9K hps UNBUFFED. Whats the point, honestly. <br />
<br />
Anyway, thats how I see it, I could be wrong. 2 years from now it may be even bigger and better than before. They arent gonna get there with the curent developers and execs though, I will tell you that much. New game life is gonna come from new blood in the drawing room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mulkosaur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My guess is in two years the issue of the holy trinity and soloability will be moot.  If WoW's formula of no class dependency and solo for all is a hit at least.<br />
<br />
They'll be things like Mage summons rez stones, component free Necro rezes and instead of AA call to corpses Druids and Shamans will have at least a 80% exp rez.  <br />
<br />
Basiclly what happened when all the other games came out take there ideas and make EQ better with the competitors ideas.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm betting that the Devteam will be making noises about how much they are committed to supporting all playing styles.  Then they'll commit massive design effort to epic 3 - which will be available only to people in top raiding guilds and will therefore increase even further the disparity between raiders and non-raiders.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, better to pay $78/month for a 3-player game. :P<br />
<br />
Seriously though were you saying WoW won't succeed because it promotes soloing? I would say that could only benefit them all things considered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better still, an MMORPG that encourages all styles of play, so that the players can choose whichever they enjoy the most, is going to beat one that insists that one style is the one true way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It would be nice, but it's not realistic. Ya would be great if someone could solo as well as a group, loot and xp wise, but have that content be also great for a group, loot and xp wise, and also have it good for a large number of groups. <br />
<br />
But what would it look like? LDON? That's the closest I can come to what you would think is good and a way to implement it. Would you want a game where everything is LDON?<br />
<br />
You have to think what is ideal and what is really possible. LDON type things don't appeal to me personally because at the end of the day, worst come to worst you log out and log in a few hours later next to your body. No thrill like being deep in the deep knowing if you wipe thats a nice cr through all those see invis...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Honestly, I do not see the game running more than 1 year from now. <br />
<br />
<br />
even if smed decided to stop development NOW the game would go more than a year.  there are people right now who are signed up through sept 01, 2005.  you think sony is going to give up free revenue and return their money?<br />
<br />
considering that the expansion is going to come out this month and a great many ppl are sticking around for that at least add at least 1 year + 1 month to the estimate<br />
<br />
considering that EQ2 isn't set to launch until later this year and many players are explicitly playing EQ &quot;until eq2 comes out&quot; add 2005+1 year to that estimate...<br />
<br />
more smoke out of yo ass...<br />
<br />
seriously though, the economic calculus for EQ &quot;ending&quot; would be when the cost of maintenance and bandwith &gt; operating revenue for EQ.  considering that other game companies either run servers for free or offer substantial free playing time, and the current subscriptiont costs o $13 just about yields the most profit per capita than anything else in gaming EQ could probably contract to a third or less of ppl who currently play and support the same number of servers without operating at a loss.  that's the ABSOLUTE cutoff.  sony has vast reserves, the true answer is that even if they have to combine servers, smed can run EQ indefinitely as long as he doesn't figure it's hurting the larger EQ or SOE brand...<br />
<br />
UO is a good example of how long a MMPOG can putter along, even when momentum for the thing has completely died.  2 3 years after everyone's left it's till online<br />
<br />
realistically you can expect EQ to go on for at least 3 4 more years and still be profitable.  more than likely it'll still be online 5 years from now.  we've barely passed the halfway mark</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">/clap temuchintehkhan<br />
<br />
i was wondering if there was going to be a voice of reason before i got to the bottom<br />
<br />
eq aint goin anywhere folks<br />
this isnt a guess<br />
its fact</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">EA is one of the fastest companies when it comes to axing anything that isn't profitable, in development or live. If they weren't still making a hefty profit off UO it'd be gone. <br />
<br />
I agree with at least 5 years on eq1 before they pull the plug completely. Hell, they might keep 2 or 3 severs running even longer then that with the multi game pack thing. Even if half the pop left the day that WoW came out and never came back I doubt they'd have to constrict servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">temuchintehkhan   has it right. EQ will be milked for years before it dies.<br />
<br />
I expect it to waddle around for a very long time, basically unchanged. People will continue to play it for various reasons; system unable to handle new/improved EQ2; friends; curiousity seekers who wonder what all the hype was about &quot;way back when&quot;; hangers on (myself) who couldn't be bothered to start a new game that will ultimately end up the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i'm curious how the game dynamic will change when there arent enough people on ever to do the 72 person raids.. or any high end raids for that matter, considering most of the expansions focus on raiders</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Falling damage will need to be increased to 30k, so that the best equiped Warriors (possibly other classes too) can't survive a 20k fall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
the answer to that is server consolidation<br />
but that is many years away</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Honestly, I do not see the game running more than 1 year from now.<br />
Well let me qualify that a bit then. I dont see EQ &quot;continuing to be the BEST, continueing to grow&quot; 1 year from now (actually, I mean through Dec 2005). UO still has servers. Doesnt mean the game is &quot;going good&quot;. I dunno if any of that makes sense, but thats what I meant. <br />
<br />
I will admit that I can see people PLAYING EQ for another 5, 6, 7 or more years. But playing and &quot;running&quot; (my definition of it, anyway, perhaps thats the wrong wrod) are two differen animals.</div></div><hr />
