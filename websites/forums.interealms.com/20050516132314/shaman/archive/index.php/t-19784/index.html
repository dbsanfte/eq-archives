<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have SCS3. You can still pull aggro quite easily but it's not an automatic magnet on an inc slow. A tank with even average capability can usually stop the mob from even hitting me. And even if you do pull aggro it seems like it only stays on you for a round. I used malos/slow/bane and chain nuked with spear of torment and I only got aggro like twice over a 2.5 hour period in fire. I haven't had it long enough to get a great feel for what it's changed yet, only been in one exp group and some raids. You will still get aggro if you put any effort into it but it's better than it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nice.. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is very nice I managed to only die last night once with me casting malos + malosinia + turgurs resist x2 + bane then 2 more tugurs resists and only cause cleric was nodding off and I only have scs1 =b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">scs3 seem worthless atm, cant notice the difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Feels notible during raids but during a normal 6 person group it makes no real difference.<br />
<br />
Than again that could just be placebo.<br />
<br />
This isnt something that can be parsed easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was going to get it but my UI screwed up so I couldnt.  Kinda glad now to be honest.  Not seeing any raving reviews about it.  Think it's screwed up?  You can notice Night and Day with the Int Caster version and ours is not even noticeable.  What's up with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I noticed that even with a just barely 65 warrior using a crappy weapon I couldn't steal agro with just slow right away on incoming like I usually can. That's with level 2.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yah this could be our best AA from the expansion . . sadly enuf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/fully agreed with Landragoran<br />
<br />
I still enjoy playing a shaman because I have been able to heal very well in a raid and I pride myself in keeping the group clerc and the group alive in elemental raids in addition to debuffing mobs.<br />
<br />
But I have to say that I am very disappointed with GoD AA and GoD spells.<br />
<br />
Sony must have thought we are idiots to give us marginally useful and minor upgrades AAs and skills and think that we should be buying 3 expansions every year.<br />
<br />
I have four accounts and I have stopped buying expansions for them after PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Huurgh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree that this is one of the better GoD AAs.<br />
<br />
SCS 3 reduces Aggro by about 20%, and this applies to all spells, including heals. I have it on my main, a mage, and it is noticable.</div></div><hr />
