<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering with my level and equipment, how many rings do you all think I could do solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Indira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First 3.<br />
<br />
You could do part 4, if you don't mind kiting all the giants--post harmony nerf, you won't get him single-pulled at 53.  They're pretty dang fast though.  Heck, even pre-harmony nerf it could be hard to single-pull him before level 59; they bunch up pretty tight and depop quickly if not aggro'd.<br />
<br />
You won't be able to straight-up melee him either.<br />
<br />
All depends on your personal risk tolerance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had the hardest time with ring 2 and ring 4 solo the others were not bad if you don't mind bow kiting for a couple hours.<br />
<br />
Have not done ring 8 plan on bringing a good group to do that when I get the oppertunity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Indira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ring 2's mostly pretty easy if you're familiar with the dorf's route.  Just before he gets to the giant fort, the prison area, and the R'ygorr fort, snare and drag off the mobs that will aggro on him, and root them off somewhere with your longest-lasting root.  You can do the same with any roamers that are liable to be problems too.  In an emergency, you can also aggro-kite the mobs while the dorf plays pet for you.<br />
<br />
It's easily possible to do the whole thing without killing a single mob, up until the bear at the end.  Just gets a bit tedious...<br />
<br />
Oh, and watch out for adds while killing the bear; I once lost the dorf to a dire wolf that roamed up during the fight, while I was distracted :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lowi Bladeslinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">at 60 i did  123456  all solo 6 + times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rangers have all the tools necessary to do 1-6 solo. <br />
Go to www.monkly-business.com and read the write-up there on how monks do it. With rangers its easier cause of harmony, snare and root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aluaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did 1-8 totally solo, you just have to know the trick to 7 and 8.<br />
<br />
To avoid the giant trap in 7, where several giants attack corbin, I did this ...  shot him with an arrow after the giants spawned and started closing in.  Ran him back, and around the outside of the trap.  Rooted corbin, and camped, clearing aggro.  Came back in, and the giants will just be standing there in a clump, and corbin will walk on in a straight line for the camp, never having been touched.<br />
<br />
The war is fairly easy solo as well.  You start the war, then bolt over to the camp.  Invis inside, Harmony the chief and other orcs near him, then pull Chief, and kill him.   Loot head, invis back out, and wait for Garadain to give the order to charge.   Then, hand in the head, and congrats, 8th ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SolipsisSaVatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aluaden beat me to the punch......<br />
<br />
I did exactly what he described at lvl 57, twice over. (Have 8th and 7th ring atm)<br />
To put a bit more detail in it for step 7, wait til the little dorf says something like &quot;Oh no they are upon us, !! &quot; because at that point he will have repopped. (Pulling him earlier causes him to path straight to ambush spot instead of hut)<br />
As soon as he repops pull him NorthWest til you are fairly near the shoreline (just to be safe heh) then pull him east of the hut. Root, camp etc.<br />
<br />
For step 8 get a 10stack of stinging wort potion (alchemy made, ice giant toe+balm leaves) if you don't feel confident tanking the chief, although kiting him is definately an option since the orcs in the fort all temporarily despawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nightork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In EW near the Ry'gor fort theres a dwarf camp at neg 2700 neg 450, in which is Garadain Glacierbane. <br />
<br />
Ring 1: Garadains Blanket. <br />
<br />
hail Garadain Glacierbane (GG from now on) and he starts off some dialogue, about you not being a friend of the mighty Coldain (no matter what faction you are, unless your kos obviously) <br />
<br />
Anyway, he says to proove your a friend you should go out and make him a blanket. <br />
<br />
Blanket is made by combining 2 HQ Cougar Pelts and 2 HQ Tundra Kodiak pelts in a sewing kit. <br />
<br />
The cougar pelts are dead easy to come by, kill snow cougars in either iceclad or in EW to get them, their pretty common. <br />
<br />
cougars are around levels 30-40 at a guess, a rare 1 or 2 are still light blue to me at 57. <br />
<br />
The Tundra Kodiak pelts is a major major bottle neck to anyone starting the rings, they really are rarer than rocking horse ****, Tundra kodiaks only spawn in EW, and any roaming mob can be a PH for one, as best I can tell (tip: if you plan on farming for them, slaughter stuff like snow bunnies, they die in a couple of hits and gives you a chance of getting a kodiak spawn in place) <br />
<br />
Kodiaks are low 30's at best, all green to me, and have been for a long time, mainly found between GG's camp and the IC bridge, but also a few around the GD entrance. <br />
<br />
Track, obviously is very handy for this, they can be bought however, and retail from players between 500 and 1k. <br />
<br />
The combine should be trivial around 50ish tailoring skill. <br />
<br />
Ring 2: Garadains Nephew. <br />
<br />
Hand in your Coldain blanket to GG, recieve a copper coldain insignia ring Ac1 +1str +1vmagic, GG says something about being able to get some sleep now, if his nephew was ok. <br />
<br />
Skip this dialogue, and just say 'what assistance' <br />
<br />
GG will hand you an axe, and say something about your willingness to help is earning friends etc etc. <br />
<br />
What this one is about, is GG's nephew has run away to hunt some beast thats been terrorising Thurgadin. <br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane can be found at roughly neg 1900 pos 1600, on a hill north east of the Ry'gor fort. <br />
<br />
Hand Boridain the axe GG gave you, and he respawns and starts to wander off towards the giant fort in search of this beast, the rabid tundra kodiak, he will agro giants, and orcs on his way, and dire wovles. <br />
<br />
He will reach the fort and turn around, having walked between the 2 guards there, if the frost giant captain is standing there he will get agroed by that to, even if hes harmonied. <br />
<br />
He then heads off towards the ruins in the north of the zone and stops between a giant and a rygor guard, before turning round and heading towards the Ry'gor fort, between these 2 steps he takes a break, which is useful for medding etc, he then returns to his spawn point, ish and sits down, at witch point the rabid tundra kodiak spawns and moves towards him, I assume it would attack him, never let it get that far myself. <br />
<br />
Kill the kodiak, loot its pelt, hand its pelt to Boridain and he gives you the axe back, now broken, which was 'on the killing blow' as he puts it, lol. <br />
<br />
The way to do this is either by brute force, or by harmony, harmony has and allways will work best IMO, harmonise Boridain, and all mobs that will agro, moving towards him, and all mobs at the stations he stops by. <br />
<br />
Its worth waiting before handing in the axe, if you can check if the frost giant captain is at the front of the giant fort boridain first visits, because harmony or not, he will agro, if you cant wait and want to get rid of the captain, who would path away eventually, then harmony the 2 guards and agro him, then drag him to the coldain camp directly north of the fort. <br />
<br />
*note* even if Boridain gets agroed and killed once hes returned to his spawn, you can save the pelt and hand it in some other time, make sure if this happens, you go to GG and get the axe, and start the quest off again, or Boridain will eat the pelt, you can hand in multiple pelts once hes spawned and get the axe. <br />
<br />
Boridains on a 2-3 hour spawn timer. <br />
<br />
The rabid kodiak is about 45. <br />
<br />
Ring 3: Garadains hunting knife. <br />
<br />
Hand in the broken axe and copper ring to GG, to get a silver coldain insignia ring Ac2 +2 str +2 v magic. <br />
<br />
Garaidan then moans about his hunting knife and asks you to make a new one for him since hes busy at his camp etc etc. <br />
<br />
What this involves is gathering a HQ Walrus pelt from a Walrus in EW these range in level from about 35-40 ish and are very very plentiful in the south western corner of EW. <br />
<br />
A fairly common drop, and easy light blue exp if your 50-55 ish. <br />
<br />
Aswell as the pelt you will need a Rhino horn from a wooly Rhine in EW, these spawn all over the place, but are fairly common in the north of the zone, and in the area west of sleepers tomb at around neg 7000 pos 2000. <br />
<br />
Rhinos are roughly the same level as walrus's. <br />
<br />
Other than the rhino horn, you need a skinning rock, which spawns on the ground in EW, in the same sort of area as the rhino's and walrus's, they apear as red rocks on the ground, and are often seen. <br />
<br />
Combine these 3 items in a smithing forge, (strength greatly affects your smithing success rate aparently, prehaps get a buff before attempting it) <br />
<br />
A skill of around 50 would almost certainly make it trivial. <br />
<br />
Ring 4: Garadains smithing hammer. <br />
<br />
Hand in the silver ring and the hunting knife to GG, to get the 3rd ring Ac3 +3st +3vs magic (seeing a pattern here? ) <br />
<br />
Garidain then proceeds to moan about how badly crafted it is, and asks you to find Tain Hammerfrost, who left a little while ago with a smithing hammer which he can use to refine the blade. <br />
<br />
Tain spawns a little ways west of the Iceclad bridge, at neg 4900 neg 2400 ish. <br />
<br />
You hail him, and he says something about 'help'. <br />
<br />
Tain is injured and needs an elexir from a giant whos been chasing him. <br />
<br />
Be very careful when doing this ring, its highly dangerous, as soon as you say 'blah blah help' to Tain, he respawns, and 4-5 giants will spawn to the south, one named and some normal giants, they hit hard, and fast, and theres no way you could take them down solo unless your very patient or very bored. <br />
<br />
Or a druid who does that sort of thing lots. <br />
<br />
Now depending on your level, theres 2 ways you can do this, both involve a similar principle. <br />
<br />
At 56 and above, you would be able to solo pull Ghrek, below that level, you would agro all the giants with an arrow pull. <br />
<br />
The way I do this, is as the giants are running towards Tain (they spawn with instant agro on him) target Ghrek, and fire an arrow off at him, depending on your level this will or wont agro everything, either way Tain will die, unless you do this in a group. <br />
<br />
Drag Ghrek, with the giants if your &lt;56 north, to Dobbin Crossxes camp at neg 500 neg 3000, when you get near to this camp (within sight of) snare Ghrek, and run the other giants through the camp, they will all agro the dwarves, and instead of chasing you will fight them (as long as you havent hit them!) <br />
<br />
With the giants occupied, run back to Ghrek and Cancel/anul the snare, and drag Ghrek west towards the north west camp which you may have seen earlier with ring 1. <br />
<br />
Resnare Ghrek, the reason you cancel the snare is so, when the giants kill the dwarves at Dobbins camp, your far enough away so as not to re-agro the giants, and its just you and Ghrek. <br />
<br />
Personally I like to let the dwarves at the northern camp do the dirty work of inflicting dmage to Ghrek here, as regen/arrow/dot kiting is long, tedious and boring. <br />
<br />
With Ghrek snared, and prehaps a few dots on him, he will be rather angry with you, so you run him through the dwarf camp, and get the dwarves to beat on him, now be careful as to how much you let them beat him, you can control how much agro you have on Ghrek.. <br />
<br />
A: by how far away you are from him <br />
<br />
B: by casting on him, snare, flame lick etc. <br />
<br />
Eventually Ghrek will get annoyed with the dwarves beating him, and will turn on them, its up to you when you let this happen, I let them get him to about 2/3 health before either jolting or backing off, Ghrek will after this be nice and weak, and you would have saved yourself some time. <br />
<br />
Kill Ghrek, loot the elexir and wait on Tains respawn, roughly 4-5 hours. <br />
<br />
*note* I recomend doing this first, since hes on such a long respawn, and you wont be able to hand the elexir in, unless you have a group taking the giants and Ghrek down. <br />
<br />
While your waiting for him to respawn you can do the other rings.... <br />
<br />
Also the Elexirs arent lore, so you can repeat this process when he respawns, again, like Boridain in ring 2 you MUST say 'what help' and trigger the spawn to be able to hand in the elexir, and you can hand in multiple elexirs and recieve multiple hammers. <br />
<br />
Hail Tain, give Elexir, get Coldain smithing hammer, which also isnt lore. <br />
<br />
Ring 5: The Ry'gor messanger and the invassion plans. <br />
<br />
Hand in ring 3 and the smithing hammer to get ring 4 Ac4 +4str +4vmagic. <br />
<br />
GG then says something about the invassion, and plans and a messanger. <br />
<br />
The Ry'gor messanger is a strange fellow, Ive yet to find any patern, or logic to his spawning times, he does however spawn at the Ry'gor interogator in the ruins to the north, and runs straight towards the Ry'gor fort entrance. <br />
<br />
Hes low level 20-30 maybe, so will be very low on your track list. <br />
<br />
When killed he drops the Ry'gor invassion plans. <br />
<br />
Hand these plans into the coldain lookout in GG's camp and a batch of orcs will spawn to the south west of the camp, 3 oracles or so, and some Ry'gor invaders, and a named SK, Scarbrow T'huk or something. <br />
<br />
Kill scarbrow and loot his head, again the 56+ single pull comes well into effect here, as soon as the orcs spawn, the oracles cast a few buffs, and scarbrow leads the charge towards GG's camp. <br />
<br />
Arrow him, hopefully single pull him, if not snare and drag any adds through dwarf camps, at 57 I can mellee scarbrow, but he has a nasty HT. <br />
<br />
Kill him, loot his head, and wait 45 mins or so for GG's camp to respawn. <br />
<br />
Ring 6: Garadains mission. <br />
<br />
Hand in Scarbrows head and ring 4 to GG,get ring 5 Ac5 +5str +5mr he will then tell you about a failed assault on the Ry'gor, and how no one knows what happened to the dwarves in the assault. <br />
<br />
In the southwest corner of the zone, theres a camp with a named wolf, icefang there, also between the game hours of Korigain spawns, he is a ghost and was one of the lot in the failed asault, hand in your 5th ring to him and he explains what happened, how the dwarves had their wolves charmed and got munched bassically. <br />
<br />
At this point icefang respawns and wanders off, I suggest as soon as you hand in your 5th ring head to the Iceclad bridge, to the north directly of this is an orc camp. <br />
<br />
Icefang wanders around, then heads towards this camp, as he gets near 3 oracles spawn at the camp and a named, poxbreath yellowfang. <br />
<br />
Best way to solo pull Pox is to invis up, walk into the hut just before icefang gets there and they all run off after him, target Poxbreath, run out of the hut and go behind it, load snare or calefecation or any agroing spell and cast from max distance, Poxbreath will come on his own, and yes you can pull through the hut walls. <br />
<br />
I can solo this at 57. <br />
<br />
Loot the note to kromrif. <br />
<br />
At the Ry'gor fort, theres an exit portal from CC to the west of the entrance. <br />
<br />
Ocassionaly (like the Ry'gor messanger) a Ry'gor emisary spawns, when he does he heads to this exit portal, paces up and down a bit, then Rodrick Tardok spawns, agro him, kill him, loot his head and his dagger, he is immune to snare and root, but suceptable to fire spells. <br />
<br />
*note* If no one attacks the Ry'gor Emissary, he paths into the Ry'gor fort, speaks to the oracle (oracle wasnt up when I did this, important?) <br />
<br />
And wanders back out to the portal again spawning ANOTHER Rodrick, this was repeated by myself and 5 others till we all had his head, and where apropriate the dagger. <br />
<br />
Very handy to know as there is often a cue for him. <br />
<br />
Ring 7: Garadains rescue mission. <br />
<br />
Hand in Rodricks head, the kromrif note and ring 6 to get ring 7 Ac7 +7str +7mr. <br />
<br />
Garadain then sends you on a mission to rescue an important dwarf, namely Corbin blackwell. <br />
<br />
Corbin is guarded by a Ry'gor interogator, 2 Ry'gor prison guards and a couple of Giants. <br />
<br />
Loose them in a dwarf camp somehwere and hand him your 6th ring. <br />
<br />
He also requires a shackle key from Warden Bruke. <br />
<br />
Warden Bruke has a PH, and resides in the same sort of area as Corbin, not sure of the precise loc, but he has a kromrif priosn gaurd as PH, and sapwns, alone in a ruined building thats in a circular shape. <br />
<br />
When you agro Warden Bruke, a random number of giants sapwn, if you pull from a distance the giants wont agro, Warden Bruke is unsnarable and un slowable and unstaunnable, the agro on the dwarves trick used in ring 4 doesnt seem to work aswell with Bruke, he seems to pop back to his spawn point for some reason when agroed by dwarves, and he kills them, he will pop back to his 'home' like a mob gating. <br />
<br />
Kill him anyway, loot his key, hand that and the 6th ring to Corbin and he will start to wander off towards Dobbin Crossaxes camp. <br />
<br />
When he gets near to Dobbins camp, around neg 500 neg 1200 a truck load of giants and orcs spawn. <br />
<br />
These all spawn with instant agro on Corbins spot and they charge towards him, to avoid him getting agro, arrow him from a distance, and root him, camp out and back in to clear agro on him. <br />
<br />
The giants and orcs wont have agroed him, and wander past the ulthork fields, and path towards the fort, if you want a bit of exp, pick them off individually and kill them. <br />
<br />
when you log back in, corbin stands still for ages and ages, before eventually carrying on towards the camp, when he gets there, Dobbin and he have a few words to say to eachother, about the dain will be so pleased etc etc. <br />
Corbin will despawn, then after about 10-15 seconds, Dobbin says 'show me your ring and I'll give you some proof for Garadain' or some such, hand him your ring get some letter, take letter to Garadain, get 7th ring, easy. <br />
<br />
The other way is to agro all the giants and Ry'gor before Corbin gets attacked, you could theoretically agro one onto him and kite away the rest to a dwarf camp or 2. <br />
<br />
Ive yet to manage this solo, but have got all but 2 Ry'gor off Corbin. <br />
<br />
Level is a problem with this, and could be a deciding factor in soloing it, due to the agro factor of dragging mobs off before they hit Corbin. <br />
<br />
Bassically escort Corbin to Dobbins camp, Dobbin will despawn and say something about 'take this to garadain' <br />
<br />
At which point you hand him your 6th ring <br />
<br />
Dobbin takes your ring and gives you a note. <br />
<br />
Ring 8: Garadains war. <br />
<br />
Hand in the note to recieve ring 7 Ac7 +7str +7mr. <br />
<br />
Garadain says something about the war with the ry'gor, and tells you to tell him when he is 'ready' you say I am ready, he says hand him your 7th ring a,d take the plans, and give them to Gloradin coldheart. <br />
<br />
She spawns on a 24 hour timer in the hut next to GG's. <br />
<br />
Once you hand her the plans she disapears 'to tell the Dain about the war' <br />
<br />
At this point the Ry'gor fort depops and 2 Kromrif commaners, 2 Ry'gor oracles, the chief Ry'gor and Firebrabd the black pop inside the Ry'gor fort, a bunch of orcs and giants pop outside to. <br />
<br />
What you need is Chief Ry'gors head, none of the giants and orcs see invis, invis yourself inside, harmony pull the chief and kill him.<br />
<br />
At level 60 solo pull the chief, root, arrow, dot, kill etc :)<br />
<br />
Kill the chief, loot his head, hand this in to GG, get your 8th ring Ac 8 +8str +8mr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Myrdale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was able to do rings 1 through 5 with out any problem at all. I had a cleric friend help me out with the 6th since the guy is a caster. I am still trying to figure out how to get the warden apart from the rest of the giants. But will probably just  get the guild to help me out one evening. Basically if you have tolans arms and gloves or some other snaring armor and some arrows, you can do these no problem. Also on the one where the giants spawn and run to kill the dwarf. Just have sow up and stop every 100 yards or so and root one of the smaller giants. They will despawn when you get so far off and all you are left with is the named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Indira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dunno if they've made any changes to ring 7 since the last time I did it, but I'll tell ya what worked for me.<br />
<br />
Targeted Warden Bruke, then ran around the back side of his building and hit him from behind (at max range) with a spell (or maybe an arrow, been a while, I forget)  The extra giants spawned out front of his building, too far away to aggro me while Bruke started chasing me.<br />
<br />
Problem is he's an absolute bastard to kill via kiting.  Much easier to just recruit a healer for this one and melee him down.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I don't know if they've monkeyed with this since then, but it used to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can cast Through the back wall. Just cast Nullify Magic or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samoht_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is what I did for 7th ring at 55 or was it 56?  Cant remember, but should work at either level.<br />
<br />
First, keep killing the PH for Warden Bruke until he pops.  As soon as he pops, go to Dobbin's camp and harmonize everything there.  Then, pull Dobbin back to the plateau close to the Warden.<br />
Root Dobbin and camp out to clear aggro.  <br />
<br />
Once you log back in, target Warden Bruke and go around the back.  Cast Jolt to pull him around and back to Dobbin.  By this time, Dobbin will probably be walking back towards the camp.  Run Warden Bruke around Dobbin until he aggros.  Once they start pounding on each other, snare Warden Bruke.  Let him beat the dorf down a bit to make sure he wins.  As soon as you are sure that he will kill the dorf (dont wait too long), start Trueshot and pluck him.  By the time the dorf dies, he should be very low health, should be less than 2 bubs or maybe even 1.  Just come in and melee him to death.  Shouldnt be long since he will start running.  <br />
<br />
When I did this part, by the time he kill Dobbin, he was down to less than a bubble and was running.  Piece of cake!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Myrdale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah for the 7th Ring pull him to the back of the building. Only took 3 of us to do him in like 30 sec if even that, (one was a Lvl 65 Mage or wizzy).<br />
<br />
You may need help clearing mob around the prisoner or you could pull em to a dwarf camp.<br />
<br />
For doing the event part, i would suggest taking on more of a Roleplaying point of view. Hand in the key and ring, he will start to walk. While the two of us were walking over to the camp like 8 giants and orcs spawned. I looked down at my dwarf friend and was like &quot;Heck man we're toast lets make a run for it !! &quot;. He agreed and followed me to the north away from the fight. Wouldnt you know though the little sucker was ticked off though, being a dwarf and loving to fight orcs and giants and all, he decided to fight me instead. So i was like to H*** with this. I rooted him and camped out. Started feeling guilty for leaving the poor little fellow out there all alone so i gat back on and he was so over joyed to see me again fearing he would have to fend for himself. From there we walked on to camp and told his buddy what a great fellow i was. They rewared me with my new ring and we all set around eatting Snow Griffon Egg Soufe. The End</div></div><hr />
