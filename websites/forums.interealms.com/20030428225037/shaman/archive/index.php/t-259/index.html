<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Originally posted by UgZug <br />
Due to the difficulties in getting some of these reagents, alchemy was redesigned.<br />
<br />
Actually, it was due to the fact that no one could actually gain skill in Alchemy.  VI had it broken, and kept 'testing' by creating a 25th level shaman, and visiting the trainer - what they DIDN'T try was creating a 24th level shaman, advancing to 25th, and then visiting the trainer...  After much complaining back and forth, Brad (Aradune) logged on and broadcasted for any Shaman who'd been able to gain in the skill to send him a tell.  Heh.  Since they finally took a good look at it, apparently they decided to redo the recipies, even though no new recipe books were added to the game.<br />
<br />
Looks like you left Greater Purity off the trivial list?  It's one of the best stat ones, actually... give them to your tank friends (10 dose), or try to sell them.  +25 Strength, +25 Poison Resist, neg 15 Charisma (heh, what melee cares there?).  Also, good for certain raids where PR is needed.  No clue how it stacks with Harness or Focus.  Also, don't forget the Regeneration line (10/20/40 hp per tick) - a wizard in the guild asked me to make one Regen 10 dose potion and one Elixer of Concentration 10 dose.  Since then, she's asked for another Regen, when I can make it.<br />
<br />
A few other points:<br />
<br />
For a complete guide, you might want to include a complete list of potions &amp; recipies - although they are out in other places, it would complete yours nicely.<br />
<br />
Store bought potions can (or could at one time, heh - haven't tried lately) be combined into 5 or 10 dose potions.<br />
<br />
Old alchemy recipies are still in the game, although the home town herb vendors were changed; some herbs were only (and still are) available from the Gypsies.  For those with Luclin (and faction), Shar Vahl has one vendor with the old herbs.  This means that you can make the old potions.  They do combine into 5/10 stacks, and are still Instant cast items, unlike the new potions.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Ach, almost forgot this one - http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1242.topic<br />
Someone seems to have found a success formula, based on skill &amp; item trivials. [Success rate = (1.15*Skill) - (Trivial - 70)]  I haven't read the entire thread, but it seems possible that different skills have slightly different modifiers.  Still, it might be something to look into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow.  thanks for the great input!<br />
<br />
I've been considering including all the recipes, etc... just felt like that was stealing the hard work of other people and putting it in a guide with MY name on it.  Feel guilty about that.  However, I've been asked by many people to do so, so I think the next revision will have the charts included.<br />
<br />
Also - I did read the thread on the success formula... very sweet.  That is one of the biggest reasons I was looking to revamp the guide.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!  New revision coming soon.  Anyone else have some comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you are going to write an entire section about the old alchemy, make sure you mention that there are TWO vendors in Shar Vahl that sell the herbs...one is stationary, the other is in the same room but wanders a bit, sometimes she tells you 'Im busy' but if you wait, she will wander back and sell to you.<br />
<br />
The 'wanderer' has MUCH LOWER prices for herbs.<br />
<br />
I'll look for more details later this weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks Snapdragn!<br />
<br />
Since I never did the old alchemy, any input on it would be greatly appreciated.  Hard to write a &quot;guide&quot; for something you've never done.  :(<br />
<br />
I won't write a section on it unless I feel that I have enough information from folks to ensure that it is informative and useful.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also - please include in your signature your character name and server.  I like to give credit where credit is due in the guide.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Here's a 'stupid inventory trick' that some people might like to have explained to them.<br />
<br />
1. Rearrange your inventory so the backpack you want to put the herbs in is in the top slot.  Buy the herbs.<br />
<br />
2. Re-rearrange your inventory so your empty bearskin potion bag is in the top slot.<br />
<br />
3. Open your medicine bag and your herb bag and place them right next to each other and right next to the open inventory window.  I put the herbs I need in the right-hand column of the herb bag and the medicine bag to the right of that.<br />
<br />
4. Hold down CTRL (never let it up) and click on an herb.  Move to the Medicine bag and click to drop it.  Repeat for each herb.  Click COMBINE.   You do not have to let up on the CTRL key for any of this, clicking COMBINE works fine with CTRL pressed.<br />
<br />
5. Drop the completed potion (if you are so lucky) into the AUTOEQUIP area of the inventory.  It will go into your bearskin potion bag since it's topmost in your inventory.  Keep a mental count so you know when your bearskin potion bag is full.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's not rocket science, but there are still people who don't know about CTRL-click to pick up a single item or who don't think about using autoequip to fill their potion bag instead of opening and closing multiple bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hail,<br />
<br />
Instead of mentally keeping track...<br />
<br />
If you put your medicine bag in the slot immediately below your potion bag, you will know when your potion bag is full when the auto-equip drops the last-made potion right back into the (still open) medicine bag.<br />
<br />
Then you Close your medicine bag, open potion bag, combine, move the 10shot.  Open medicine bag, drop the potion into auto-equip, and keep right on moving making another 9 potions.<br />
<br />
I've done this for a long time.  No need to count ever.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">UgZug:<br />
<br />
I notice in your guide you claim that wisdom has an effect on the success/fail rate of alchemy.<br />
<br />
I always understood this not to be the case, I thought wisdom affects your chance of a skill rise, and your skill level affects the chance of failure.<br />
<br />
Certainly the information I have read on the traders corner website suggests other trade skills work like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Grippa - that is one of the things that will be corrected in the next version.  I want to draw a distinction between success/failure and skill increases.  I'm not clear in the guide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">5. Drop the completed potion (if you are so lucky) into the AUTOEQUIP area of the inventory.

Dude, thanks for this tip. Awesome.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually from what I have read/seen, skill is the onlth thing that effects success.

I should have this uploaded by Saturday night (can't do it till I get home - I'm on the road and AT&amp;T are nazis...).  Till then - send me an email if you want to see it.  I would like at least a couple reviews before I post it - just because I don't want to look like a complete idiot for some stupid mistake I probably have made.  hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">another little inventory trick for people with two boxes - use the trade window as a third open container.  I just stand next to my mule, and can get rid of up to 8 potions, wu's gorgets or other stuff made from stacked ingredients that ususally explode your invnetory fast.  When ready to sell or consolidate, hit cancel and everything sorts nicely into your inventory.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">OK - The new guide has been out for a couple weeks now.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any corrections or sumissions for new content?<br />
<br />
I can't believe that I got it all right.  hehe<br />
<br />
Anyway, outstanding items to add to guide:<br />
<br />
- Old Alchemy tables<br />
- New Recipes recently released (if any)<br />
<br />
Anything else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">would also like to have vendor list and prices by city.  could give loc on vendors along with name.<br />
<br />
i like the idea of a list of vendor available potions (name, effect and cost) for comparison.  Would be nice to have it all in one reference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I believe the guide does have a table for the vendors by city.  Almost all have locs or descriptions of placement in the city.<br />
<br />
Prices on vendors I have avoided.  There's is too much variation due to race and charisma.  If I tell you it costs me 1p2g per Wolf Blood, a barbarian with cha gear might say it costs him 8g.  That's a 50% difference and completely blows away the usefulness of the info.  The average price per combine is included in the charts.  That's the best you'll prolly get.<br />
<br />
Never considered including the potions that are truly vendor purchased... although it doesn't have anything to do with the alchemy skill, it might still be interesting info to include.  I'll think about that one.<br />
<br />
Scroll to the bottom of the guide for the vendor and herb charts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Actually with about 104 charisma and better then indifferent faction prices will almost always be the same.  Though most shaman races got to work quite a bit to get thier charisma up to that level.   EqTraders though does have pretty good price list for potion herbs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I did some research on the price issue... and you are 100% correct.  I will update the prices accordingly and put a blurb about it in the guide.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, the only thing I have seen requested for addition to the guide is the Old Alchemy info.<br />
<br />
I'm putting out a request to people:  Please post here with any suggestions, recommendations, or requests. <br />
<br />
V2.10 will be released once this info is notified and included.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">For all you young shamans. If you fight in GD around your 30's, and don't plan on joining a guild on Kael faction soon, then grab giant groups when u can. I got max ally with the d0rfs, and they give me awesome prices on herbs when I have on some CHA gear (and the spell, very important). Apparently there might be a better place to buy, but if you get exp and faction for potion making in a giant group, it seems well worth it.<br />
<br />
Garf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Best price for herbs is 105pp for 20 of each.  42p, 42p, and 21p for stacks of 20.  I get this price in Thurg with Ally faction (and no CHA buff), in FV with CHA buff and Amiable faction, or at home in Halas with CHA buff.<br />
<br />
As long as you're getting those prices, it doesn't matter where you buy them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Obviously m'learned friend is referring to the herbs for SoW potions :)<br />
<br />
I get the same prices in Shadow Haven, after doing the faction quest a dozen (or so) times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Actually, there is one small correction I have for you, and a recomendation.<br />
<br />
  The correction is in your explanation of the AAXP alchemy ability.   This doesn't increase your skill by the percentage, it reduces your chances of failing by the percentage.  If you ahve a level 3 of the ability, anything you used to get 4 out of 10 successes, will now be 7 out of 10 success.     I am not dead certain on this, but it is how it was worded in the AAXP listing, and makes much more sense given the low percentages on all other skill up items (10 percent on stone being highest in game)<br />
<br />
  THe recomendation is for you to add Stinging Wart to your listing of potions that sell well.   IG toes and Dragonwart for a 300hp instant cast buff.   You can click it a second time (right after first) and as with any Hp buff, it will heal you when trying to stack.   So a 10 dose of these is a 2700 point, instant heal, clicked from inventory.<br />
<br />
  Has saved guilds main tank countless times when we were in a situation over our heads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Nice catch, Caanus!  Thank you very much!<br />
<br />
The stinging wort potions... do they really sell?  I have never even attempted to make one and have NEVER been asked for one.<br />
<br />
BTW - what server are you on?  I want to add you to my credits list.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Upcoming changes in v2.10:<br />
<br />
- modifications to the skill progression chart.<br />
- correction on the AAXP<br />
- correction of prices<br />
- corrected typos *sigh*<br />
<br />
would like to include more old alchemy info - but need a good resource for the research.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kyaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Great guide, I thank you for it, - Just a suggestion, if you cant seem to sell your poitions, Titan poitions seem to one of the cheapest around the 110 skill level.  Just tossing in my 2 scense :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Kyaylon - I agree completely.  That is one of the changes in v2.10.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the affirmation, though!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kyaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">No problem, im still a bit new to shaman myself and after spending near 1-2 k on just 90 skillpoints.. Im not looking forward to it getting more costly, Altho i think that it is an advantage ,expecially on the people who had to do potions that cost 100 + pp for their last skill points :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Gettinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Great guide Ugzug.  It incorporates most of the 2 documents I've used into 1 and has additional info besides that.  Would have saved me some paper shuffling back when I was working on skill ups.<br />
<br />
I just noticed one small error.  In your skills progression list Mystical Aptitude is listed as giving a +4 mana regen.  Then in your listing of all the potions it is listed as reducing fizzle rate.  I haven't made this potion before so I don't know which effect it has.  Just thought you might wanna know.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Gettinn - <br />
<br />
You caught me.  :)  That one of those typos.  The actual potion effect is reduced fizzle rate.  Originally, though, there was some speculation that it was a +4regen - I just wasn't thorough in cleaning it up.  hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Scrantoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I didn't think this potion worked anymore?  Well if it does, where can you get the dragonwart component and what is the cost?  <br />
<br />
The TOON</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Great guide, thanks very much.<br />
<br />
I've just got to 34 and I've decided I can spare the time to work on alchemy, so this is excellent for me.<br />
<br />
One thing occurs to me, that you might like to add, in the part where you talk about wearing all your +wis items, to help with skill-ups, I think you should mention the level-29 Luclin spell &quot;Form of the Bear&quot;, as this has a +5 wis effect.<br />
<br />
As you reccomend not starting Alchemy till 29, then most shaman's could have this spell to use, although anyone with out SoL would need someone to buy it for them.<br />
<br />
Thanks Again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Wow! Thank you for putting this guide together. I haven't touched Alchemy for the past 15 levels. I'll probably go back now and start making some utility potions. I'm interested in those regen potions. Very useful when I'm soloing and the last mob ate my health down to 1-2 bubbles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">One thing you might want to consider for those shaman who have access to Luclin.. is for skill level 110+ or even 103+ you can make growth potions up to 180.  Potion failures are a bit disheartening at this level.. and growth potions seem the cheapest to make... I believe they are somewhere around 10pp give or take a few gold for all components.. compared to the 18+ all the way up to 35+ pp needed for components of other spells :).  Just started alchemy the other day.. and hit 115 last night.. Hopefully I'll be able to hit 180 with 10k :)<br />
<br />
*edit* just read through some of the prior replies and noticed someone else mentioned this and you said you were going to include it in the next version.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">ok - v2.10 is gold.<br />
<br />
This is a last call for requests for information to be included.<br />
<br />
At this point, the only thing I have not included (if my memory serves me well) is the information on Old Alchemy.  I still need a good source for this - one that people trust or someone that really knows their stuff on it and would be willing to work with me to write the section on it.<br />
<br />
Is there anything anyone else wants before I upload this tonight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Nocked this up in my lunchbreak.<br />
<br />
Original Alchemy<br />
For some reason unknown to the downtrodden alchemists of Norrath, the advent of Luclin saw a reappearance of the original herbs used when alchemy was first implemented. These herbs, which had disappeared when alchemy was revamped after the release of Kunark, were snuck back onto a couple of vendors in Shar Vahl in a small building next to the bank.<br />
<br />
To begin using the herbs, a good starting point is the books of Jonas, which can be found on vendors in Oggok and Halas. These give some of the basic recipes. More advanced recipes can be found at EQTraders.com in their alchemy section.<br />
<br />
In contrast to the revamped alchemy, the recipes using the original herbs require a component dropped off creatures only found in the old worlds: Antonica, Faydwer, Odus and the Planes. Unfortunately, some of these components can be relatively rare and may take some effort to obtain. As the original alchemy was something of a mess, there are a few problems with the recipes. Several do not combine, while many of the potions that can be created only give very low level buffs. A few of the potions also have duplicate effects, despite having different names. However, there are some real gems among the trash and the beauty of the original potions is they are all INSTA-CAST. A bonus for the levitate and enduring breath potions is that they do not require batwings or fish scales to use.<br />
<br />
There may yet be other potions waiting to be discovered using the original alchemy herbs. For example, next time you buy some balm leaves or dragonwart from your favourite gypsy vendor, note the other herbs they sell: larkspur and elf leaf. So far, no recipe has been found using these mysterious components…</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Ugzug, thanks for compiling and updating this great guide!  I wish I had found it long ago...<br />
<br />
I wanted to confirm though, that those Stinging Wort potions are one of our best kept secrets.  I don't ever sell them, personally, but that's on purpose.  For me, Alchemy is not really a money-making skill -- although it certainly can be -- I use it instead for it's great situational value.<br />
<br />
Stinging Wort, by the way, IS instant-cast, and it DOES stack with other HP and Strength buffs, including Aego, Khura's, Cabbage, BMB, to name a few.  Not only is it a great potion for boss-mob type encounters, but it's the nail in the coffin for any shaman who enjoys dueling.  We are already a great dueling class, but with Calilmony, I've never even come close to losing a duel.<br />
<br />
Speaking of dueling, another great potion to use is Greater Negation.  Yeah, it's kind of pricey, but I love it, and my opponents hate it.  (Off topic here, I know... sorry about that.)<br />
<br />
One last thing for this post, is a suggestion to add drinking time (casting time) to the table of potions.  I have yet to find that part of alchemy listed anywhere, and it's a very useful piece of knowledge for many of our potions.  I'm on current hiatus from the game, but when I return to the game I'd be willing to compile and submit this info to add to the guide if you still need.<br />
<br />
Again great work Ugzug... I wish you were on my server so I could donate some plat for your efforts!<br />

Today I went from 0 to 175 in Alchemy (yes, my hand hurts) by exactly following the table that UgZug has laid out and, though it cost a lot, it wasn't close to what I thought it would be.

<br />
http://members.aol.com/shokaroffreeport/alchemy2.html<br />
<br />
That can be used to figure out what to sell your potions for.  I have several different PROFIT MARKUPS available.  Higher markups for less costly potions, and lower markup for more costly.<br />
<br />
I added what I call a RESEARCH/FAILURE COST to the pricing as well.  Even if you can make, on average, like me, 40 sows in 42 tries, I still take into consideration all the failures in skilling up, and all the trash potions I had to sell at great cost to myself.<br />
<br />
When you spend 1k on skilling up a few trivial points, you want to add that research cost to your prices.<br />
<br />
Once again, that link:<br />

Use it on your guide if you wish, hell claim credit for it too....LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Nianque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">First off Great Guide<br />
<br />
I'd just like to add that when you get to Cure Disease and Cure Poison, go with the disease. Especially if you're in SH, as they can be sold to people fighting phlargs in Paludal for cost or slightly above cost. however only make the single doses as noone in Paludal will be able to afford the 5 or 10 dose bottles. Also cure disease can be sold in the bazaar if you're very patient (mostly to the same people that you sold to in Paludal) Here it is possible to sell the multi-dose bottles but it's still very difficult. You most likely wont recoup all or even half the plat you spent making it since you wont be able to cover failures, but it's a hell of a lot better than the 9gp the NPCs'll give you<br />
<br />
I have yet to sell any of the Cure Poison potions, prolly because poison doesnt last as long. generally if you are poisoned at the end of a fight you either dont have time to drink the potion or the poison is fixing to wear off anyways.<br />
<br />
Also, Serpents Conviction (infravision) can be used to skill up before Ants Potion. Serpent trivials at 63 and costs less per attempt. the down side is there's virtually no market for it.<br />

What I think might be cool, is to give some ideas on how to bankroll an aspiring alchemist.  IE Hunting Hill Giants can be crowded and slow but you have a herb vendor close if you dont ever want to leave Rathe Mts.  Grobb (my hometown :) ) is close as well as Fearott and it is my understanding that there is a vendor in the Mts. themselves.  I don't really know of anyother ways to make bank fast enough to keep up with alchy, but if you know something that I don't it might make a spicy addition to your guid.

<br />
The hard cap for Alchemy is 200.  You can attain that skill at lvl 64.  Despite the skill advancement formula, no one has been able to achieve any skill ups for being level 65 to get to a 205 skill.  It appears that the 200 is a true hard cap.</div></div><hr />

EDIT:  Sorry I didn't e-mail you.  Read the new guide at one thirty AM &amp; didn't see the post immediately above this reply.<br />
<br />
I like the look of the new reference tables towards the back. :)<br />
<br />
One thing to note though, you still have the negative attributes listed on page 8 under the Trivial level progression table.<br />
<br />
I don't think you need to redo that whole table w/ a bunch of cut and pasting (don't know if that would be hard or not).  Maybe a bolded sentence or two stating that &quot;the stat modifiers on this page are now incorrect, &amp; the reference tables at the end of this guide should be used for accurate potion effect descriptions&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I kind of LIKE having the old stats shown on the trivial table and the real *NEW* stat effects shown in the back.  Who knows, might make sleuthing potion stackability easier to deduce someday.<br />

 THe recomendation is for you to add Stinging Wart to your listing of potions that sell well.   IG toes and Dragonwart for a 300hp instant cast buff.   You can click it a second time (right after first) and as with any Hp buff, it will heal you when trying to stack.   So a 10 dose of these is a 2700 point, instant heal, clicked from inventory.<br />
<br />
<br />
that is awsome, i just looked up the recipie on EQ Traders and this is what i found<br />
<br />
Stinging Wort combine Ice Giant Toes and Balm Leaves. Trivial @ 156. effects are  +17 STR, +300 HP, Duration: 6 min dot decline.<br />
<br />
in your post, you said IG toes and Dragonwart. Can someone please confirm wheather it's Dragonwart or balm leaves? My alch skill is only 42, but i do believe this might encourage me to improve this skill a little faster. These could be VERY usefull in my guilds raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
what does 6min dot decline mean? doest it heals 23 per tick, next tick 22, next tick 21? or that it's evenly spread  out ? or that your immune to dots for 6 minutes?</div></div><hr />

Actually, it was due to the fact that no one could actually gain skill in Alchemy.  VI had it broken, and kept 'testing' by creating a 25th level shaman, and visiting the trainer - what they DIDN'T try was creating a 24th level shaman, advancing to 25th, and then visiting the trainer...  After much complaining back and forth, Brad (Aradune) logged on and broadcasted for any Shaman who'd been able to gain in the skill to send him a tell.  Heh.  Since they finally took a good look at it, apparently they decided to redo the recipies, even though no new recipe books were added to the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I don't remember any broadcast... but Aradune popped up next to me in game and had a conversation with me about Alchemy. Needless to say I expressed my ummm... displeasure at having spent all that $$$ on wasted attempts at raising skill. Also talked to him about the cost of components, and the rip off you experience from selling back to a vendor.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it stacks with Talisman spells, instant recast (were anyway, with the recent patch I haven't looked).<br />
