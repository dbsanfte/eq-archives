Fan's aren't taking this lying down, they've organized. As a <br />
result of their protests, They've reportedly filled up the voicemail <br />
boxes listed for the Sci-Fi channel, brought down every fax <br />
number listed, and crashed the email server a few times. <br />
<br />
The crew was told not to destroy the sets, just box them up. <br />
<br />
The Sci-Fi channel has been rumored to be negotiating for<br />
first a movie, then a mini-series. The fans want nothing less<br />
then a full season 5, and are hoping for more.<br />
<br />
CNN had three segments on this effort. At the end one<br />
reporter asked about the raitings. The other said it was the<br />
number two raited show on Sci-Fi, and said something like<br />
&quot;makes you wonder why they want to drop it&quot;. <br />
<br />
Matt Roush from T.V. Guide has openly expressed his displeasure<br />
over this, and plans a &quot;Roush Rant&quot; in the magazine version<br />
sometime soon. <br />
<br />
UPN and Showtime are also interested in picking up the show. <br />
<br />
There's a big meeting today between the Sci Fi network suites<br />
and the Farscape producers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That sucks.<br />
<br />
I used to be a huge Farscape fan.  Then they started playing musical timeslots and I lost track of it.<br />
<br />
Also, I hear they killed off Virginia Hey's character (Zhaan).  That bites because she was such a central character and I liked her.  I think that was the beginning of the end.<br />
<br />
Anyway, would like to see it brought back because it is actually quality sci-fi, which is hard to find on the Sci-Fi Channel (or anywhere else for that matter) anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nah, farscape i don't like. But Stargate SG-1 i love, its too good but its annoying that they cut out Daniel Jackson, i think he'll be back though evetually, they've even dedicated a site to him, www.savedanieljackson.com also got stuff on farscape being cancelled..............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The actor left Telosk, he's making a guest appearance or two in the next series though (starting soon on Sky One if youre a Brit).<br />
<br />
And Farscape cancelled is a real shame, it was a fabulous looking series.<br />
<br />
As I said to my guild the other day, someone needs to employ Ben Browder to run about in leather trousers pretty soon or I'm going to be really upset :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tonight at 8:15 PM EST, CNN will be interviewing Ben Brower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Update: The CNN interview will be on at 7:15 PM EST as well<br />
as 8:15 PM EST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just found out about this. If you like the show at all go &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.farscapeworld.com/helpfarscape.shtml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to help.  Else we'll be stuck with shows like the Anna Nicole Smith show. :P</div></div><hr />
