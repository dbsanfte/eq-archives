<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know how to spawn the named treant Grizzleknot in South Karana ?<br />
<br />
I have all of my Totemic armour pieces, apart from the Breastplate, and I have the fin from Kedge Keep, the only thing I am short of is Grizzleknot bark.<br />
<br />
I have camped in SK for the past three weeks, a couple of hours a night, and have yet to see Grizzleknot.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest what his placeholders might be ?<br />
<br />
Or prehaps, some strategy to make him spawn ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brelkeryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe previous threads on these boards have pointed to Grizzleknot being a two to three day camp.  Apparently his placeholders are the wandering treants in the zone.<br />
<br />
Regard the above statement with caution, as the procedure for spawning mobs in South Karana is still a bit of a mystery.  Just ask any mage how to &quot;trigger&quot; Quillmane.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sartog1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Alls I can say is good luck - I was in exactly the same boat and I hunted in SK at the aviak platform for about 5 or 6 levels and never ever did grizzie spawn in that time to my knowledge - and I had a hotkey asking if anyone killed him if I could loot the piece - a lot presume you're after the magic item he drops, so it might be worthwhile doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Make sure your guildies know you are looking for him.  I had given up on the totemic BP but after a few weeks a guildie sent me a tell that Grizzleknot was up.  <br />
I was actually grouped with a RL friend druid and he was nice enough to immediately TP us, sow us, and then zoom around SK until he found Grizz on track.  A necro (mage, maybe?) was already taking him down but I just sent her a tell and asked for the quest item - she was happy to oblige.<br />
<br />
So...I guess the best advice is to grab a druid :)</div></div><hr />
