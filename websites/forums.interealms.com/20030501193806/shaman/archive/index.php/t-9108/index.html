<br />
You can still use the 49 Fire pets just like always as long as you do one little thing: Make sure the Mages have their FR under 120. IF the mage's FR goes over 120 or so, the Fire pet loses its immunity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hope it went well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thats some bad advise. That trick doesn't work reliably anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That trick doesn't work reliably anymore.<br />
<br />
If the mages FR is under 120, it works exactly as well as it did before the pet resistance changes.<br />
<br />
Unless your mages are idiots, or some brainless twit drops FR buffs on them without them noticing it, it works extremely well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had 2 mages strip and toss malosini on themselves before they casted. Each pet had a cleric chain casting CH, they both got owned and the raid wiped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Having done Rak 6 times since the pet-resist changes, I stand by my position that it still normally works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok to be more specific. When you guys kill Rak do your mages rebuff after they cast the pet? I'm curious if the pets retain the orginal resists of the mages upon casting or if buffing the mages will alter their resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the 49 fire pet still works fine.<br />
<br />
I think the reason people are wiping using fire pets now is because they don't strip the damage shield (which is 30pts per wack)... and the people that don't wipe but don't strip it were just lucky enough to pull him before he cast it on himself or just overpowered it with heals.<br />
<br />
Dont strip your mages or have them debuff themselves (hell this might even debuff the pets with the new resist rules).  Just don't resist buff the pet or the owner.<br />
<br />
But you can go ahead and hitpoint buff, haste and stat buff the fire pet.<br />
<br />
If your healers are in sync and you have a patch healer or two for between CH cycles you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
Doesn't hurt to mana sieve either as long as the chanter doesn't draw aggro as Rak will quit nuking and ae'ing when he runs out of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Use a high level warrior with good fire resist and 2 clerics.  I know for a fact that this works because I did it 2 weeks ago.  With fire pets you never know what you're gonna get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The pets resists are determined by those of its master at the moment the spell hits the pet. The master's resists at the moment of summoning mean exactly nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With the increase in HP and resists you have now, Pets are not all what they used to be.  His dot is like 1600 in 1 tick or such.  its basicly a nuke, so if your tank has 6500hp or more he can take a few hits no problem.  the trouble is, how much agro can your tank get to keep a heal from agroing Rak orff the tanks and onto the healer.  I would suggest putting a high hp/FR tank on rak along with a fire pet or two for faster killing.  Then have 2 clerics heal tank with CE while Shaman spot heals.  Use a shaman or druid to keep pets live but most likely, the pets wont need any heals at all.<br />
<br />
I did it for a Guild Shaman twink 2-3 weeks ago, with 2 fire pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We've used fire pets a couple-three times since that change.  Buffed mage FR and went to work.<br />
<br />
No problems whatsoever.  In fact, couldn't really tell the difference.<br />
<br />
Then everyone sort of joins when he hits 20%.  <br />
<br />
I think it's bad advice to keep mage FR low.  Having higher FR helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think it's bad advice to keep mage FR low. Having higher FR helps.<br />
<br />
If the Mages FR is under 120, the 49 Fire pet is 100% Immune to the AE. As in, no matter how many times Rak AE's the fire pet will never take AE damage.<br />
<br />
If the Mages FR is to high, the pet resists like the mage. The AE is a -100 FR check.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how removing that immumity is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We took Lord Rak down on Sunday without a single death.<br />
<br />
We had 2 lvl 49 mage pets buffed with only AC/HP buffs, 2 Cleric Hammer pets, 2 Druid pets, and countless Shaman pets from the 3 Shamans that were there.<br />
<br />
The Mages Malo'd themselves (one had a -31SvF) and sent the pets in. (Not sure if they debuffed before or after pets were cast)We had 2 clerics and all the healers concetrating on the mage pets.<br />
<br />
One of the Druid pets died nearly instantly, the other made it the whole fight. Both Hammer pets survived as well.<br />
<br />
Lord Rak's AoE was doing (roughly) 1/3 of the Mage pets total hitpoints in damage on each hit and the clerics were easily able to keep up with it. Melees never engaged him. The shaman that did the turn in was able to malo Rak and actually survived the encounter.<br />
<br />
At ~40% health, casters started landing nukes and down he went. There were some skeptics in the group, but it went off without a hitch. The kill took ~5 minutes or less.<br />
<br />
Dilaudid Iveepush of the Ivory Order, Lanys Server, recived the Spear of Fate shortly after. He is the first IO shaman (that I know of) to finish his epic.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the Shaman's Crucible for the info on how to handle this encounter. <br />
<br />
Additionally, we were able to clear the castle in ~1h 30m, including the Rak and Neh'Ashirr kills. We were also able to get a Jade Reaver for a Druid in our guild. (It dropped off of one of Lord Rak's Reavers.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And how do you know this is true?<br />
<br />
It's not my understanding of the effect of the resist/pet changes.  In the post above, the mages malaed themselves presumably to follow this advice:<br />
<br />
Lord Rak's AoE was doing (roughly) 1/3 of the Mage pets total hitpoints in damage on each hit and the clerics were easily able to keep up with it.<br />
<br />
So, they gave themselves a disadvantage and were able to compensate for it.  <br />
<br />
Like I said, bad advice because it's not true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">And how do you know this is true? <br />
<br />
Level 62 Mage.<br />
<br />
I did extensive testing on the pet resistance changes (about 20 hours of testing in total) after they were implemented. As did other mages. Those were our conclusions.<br />
<br />
One detail I forgot to mention earlier... if the mages resists go negative, the pet loses its immunity again and gets stuck with the negative resists (and as such never resists anything).<br />
<br />
In the post above, the mages malaed themselves<br />
<br />
And in doing so, they were being terminally stupid. Go below 120, don't go negative. Just aim for somewhere in the double digits is the best way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just kill him.<br />
<br />
He is a low level mob with low melle dps, and low hp. he has a hard to resist ae that does alot of damage, and has a very small range.  So use a couple tanks, and a couple clerics, and keep them alive.  The less people you use, the easier its going to be.  His AE is pretty timeable, so have some monks and rogues go in for a few attacks and back out.  If they get hit by ae, have your duirds/shaman heal them (After they back out), and send them back in.  If you don't have a tank that can keep aggro on the mighty rak'ashiir, then you are going to have alot of problems with almost any mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've helped on 3 Raks since the changes, with the same 3 mages.<br />
<br />
One mage pet consistantly took damage while the other 2 didn't.  Mage whose pet was always weak 2-boxes (and groups with) a bard, and always had his resist song up.<br />
<br />
Anecdotal evidence to be sure.  I always thought he was using some lesser (or different) pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Finished off Rak today  ( 05 Jan 03)  <br />
Here is synopsis of fight:<br />
<br />
Rak popped. <br />
Finished off room pops<br />
Backed groups away.<br />
Parked one fire pet near Rak<br />
Handed in Tear<br />
Rak Aggro'd me<br />
I melee'd and attempted to malosini and slow him - resisted. <br />
Then the rain hit.<br />
Healed thru first one. Second one hit and I died ;) <br />
Keber (49 fire pet) kept tanking away being healed by 3 clerics<br />
Keber took NO AE damage.<br />
I ran back and watched the last of the fight. <br />
Took a long time, casters started nuking at 45% and melee's zerg'd at 25%.<br />
Our Main tank was concerned clerics would run out of mana and so with a 160 FR sacrificed himself to do some serious DPS. Alas he didn't last long.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story: pet still works - better to bring more than one tho  :D <br />
<br />
&lt; Mages FR is 65&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Did him about a month ago.  Had 2 mages, both had low FR.  One even malosini'd himself and had like 7 FR by the end.  He (level 60) lost about 12 pets throughout the fight, they just couldn't stand up.  A level 56 mage with us cast 1 pet to start, his FR was 60-70 range, and never took any ae damage.<br />
<br />
Definitely not the case that pets are immune if the casters FR is under 120.<br />
<br />
Eventually we got tired of losing 1 mages pet and a 60 monk jumped in and tanked it, worked a lot better, and easy to heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We didn't use any mages last time.  Just beat him down.<br />
<br />
Went much faster.  Piece of cake.  <br />
<br />
I'm still not buying the anecdotal stories about keeping mage resist low to help pet resist.  It doesn't make sense, it's not consistent with what I've seen anecdotally, and it doesn't sound consistent with the patch message I remember reading.  <br />
<br />
I have no idea how it could be parsed or proven though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Having tried it twice now with mage pets, and failed miserably both times, I would recommend the MA route.  We did it three times during the past week, with 61 SK as MA, 62 Ranger as SA, they were the only two people attacking Rak.  Had 3 healers on each of them (way overkill on healing), and it went smooth as silk all three times.  No question this is the way we will always do it in the future.</div></div><hr />
