<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">whats a good ping time on the lag-o-meter (the numbers on the left of the meter)<br />
<br />
I've been getting 70-130 ping time in a normal situation...dunno about raid yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, I've been wondering about that, too.  Does anyone have any good guides to the lag-o-meter?  What each numbers mean and maybe some scales for each on dial-up, cable, and DSL?  I'd love to post that our our guild website so we can help track down connection issues that crop up occasionally!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Saying that you are most likely for away from the servers I would say anything under 200 is good. Anything over 200 is not good. That's just a basic service agreement standard that some data circuit companies give. If you are on a not so good 56k line then expect higher ping times.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On Dial-up 26400 bps connection mine was usually 250-300ish.<br />
<br />
Since switching to DSL, I have typically been around 90-110.<br />
<br />
70-130 is darn good I would say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What's the number on the right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In english, this is how long you wait for a spell to process. It is server wait time. So if the right number is 1400, you can add an extra 1.4 seonds to cast times. You have no control over this number. It is a function of how busy the zone is. It will get real high during 60 people raids. (Over 3000)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On ADSL from Sweden.. ToV raid with 40ppl i can hit about 5000 ping. You totally give up on trying to type anything, especially with 10% package loss.<br />
<br />
Just glad i dont play a melee.... pvping with that ping is impossible. As a caster that high ping is cool though, it makes you warp around all over, but makes spell casting very tricky since you have to keep count in your head to know when spells actually go off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I avg somewhere between 60 and 130 on cable and never have a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For comparison, down at this end of the world I use an asymmetrical satellite connection; the number on the left is between 500 and 600 at best (mainly due to the sheer distance through space the packets have to travel through space). As you can imagine, this makes canni-dancing tricky at best, impossible with any packet loss.<br />
<br />
That said, because it is a broadband downlink, raids don't cause any problems unless I'm having packet loss as well. If I was a cleric in the CH rotation it would be another matter entirely, but for a shaman it's just not that big a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To actually explain it........ <br />
<br />
Left number is the Ping......<br />
<br />
Time in milliseconds that it takes a request to get from your system to the game server and back again.<br />
<br />
next number is the Percent of loss... Each sent bit of information is called a packet.... this number shows you what percent of the packets you sent have been lost.<br />
<br />
Next number is Percent of loss... Same as above but is the percent of inbound packets that were lost.<br />
<br />
The last number is the Amount of information actually recieved in that time frame ..... 500 would be 500mbits<br />
<br />
Hope that helps...</div></div><hr />
