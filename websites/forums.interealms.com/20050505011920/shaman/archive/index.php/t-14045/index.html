This is not the Matrix: Reloaded thread you are looking for. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought a lot of scenes in Matrix 2 where pretty unnecesary.  Like the wierd rave party scene in zion. ***?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
$%#^ thing never works!<br />
<br />
I enjoyed it quite a bit and it actually does get better after seeing it a few times.  I watched the first one again to catch a few more of the references each movie has to the other.<br />
<br />
You have a point though Walruss, that rave...umm...ya.  *Snore*  Seemed a little primative given the context.</div></div><hr />

LOL, Jaidin<br />
<br />
Seriously, the Jedi mind trick joke never get old with me for some reason haha.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for The Matrix: Reloaded...I was alittle disappointed, but I think I bought into the hype to much...like I was expecting to be blown away and came back feeling a bit cheated. Good movie, not great imo....first was 10X better story wise....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I liked Matrx2 fairly well, even watched it a second time.. up till the Smith fight scene, then I walked out of the theater cause I would rather sleep in my bed :)    The ENTIRE movie, no matter how bad or lacking, is made up for in that scene though.</div></div><hr />

:P~ My monk, image was edited but the 'pose', so to speak, was purely natural :P  He FD and thats how he ended up, but after reading this I thought Id throw it up for a laugh :D<br />
<br />
Edits were the glasses (obivously) and the text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Matrix 2 reminded me alot of EQ.<br />
<br />
That Ring of Smith event was pretty funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The story of the matrix 2 was a great story. The video game helped the story. BUT. The graphics in the movie were lacking compared to the game, and the fight scenes were worse then chuck noris films. I know neo can see the code and all, but does he half to duck before punches are thrown? As well as clip though things? In any case, I love the story, but we make better videogames then that movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The story was lacking compared to the first and since they introduced the fact that Agent Smith &quot;beamed&quot; into the human so early in the storyline, it leaves alot of people confused as to who the white guy is at the end.  I found alot of people missed that part of the movie and it is so significant to part 3.  <br />
<br />
The rave was ridiculious.  I have yet to figure out the point of that scene.  It almost made me doze off because of its length.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The whole sexyness they added to the movie did not need to be there.<br />
No i am not an old lady againt nudity or partial nudity I am a 20 yr old male. I think nudity has its place but definetly matrix was not the kind of movie that needed it. The rave and the lengthy sex scene between neo and Trinity served absolutely no purpose.<br />
The first movie did not have nudity and didn't need nudity because it had a GREAT plot.<br />
They replaced the plot with eye candy in the 2nd matrix which is sad i think we have another star wars movie on our hands :(<br />

I disagree about the plot... But I do conceed that the love scene was really not needed, I don't go to see the Matrix to see people grinding hips. And the recent Star Wars movies had no redeeming qualities at all.  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Liez! Light saber quarterstaff :)  Destroyer droids were pretty cool too, no idea why there weren't used 30 years later in episodes 4-6 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Another lame, special-effects-dependant sequel? No.........really.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What you need to realize is there there is no spoon, there is no movie, it is only you that are lacking ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I guess I'm alone in that I walked into this one fully expecting it to be mediocre. I figured they were following the original Star Wars trilogy formula.<br />
Movie_01  : Catchy themes, good plot, likeable characters -leaves you wanting more.<br />
Movie_02  : Rehash of Movie_01 with some blanks filled in and background info given. Definately a &quot;bridge&quot; between Movie_01 &amp;...<br />
Movie_03  : Wow! big finish! Pow Bang! Zowiee! Ends tidy enough but yet open ended enough to do a prequal or Sequal trilogy.<br />
<br />
In short Matrix:Reloaded = Empire Strikes Back.<br />
<br />
But it was an entertaining afternoon matinee all the same.<br />
Just my 3cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>skulript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">In short Matrix:Reloaded = Empire Strikes Back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have to completely disagree with you hound. Empire Strikes Back was an outstanding movie. The Hoth battle? Lando? Boba Fett? Luke (what a weenie) getting his hand chopped off by Mean 'ole Dad?? <br />
<br />
Empire set the scene for an epic finish, which as we all know, ended up with Ewoks; a huge disappointment to moi and many others. Anyway... couldn't let that comment go unchecked...flame if you feel the need, but I stick to my guns on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When they made the Matrix, they had no idea that it would be so popular and would be able to make the other two parts of the trilogy.  They made sure the first Matrix could stand alone and didn't introduce necessary plot points that would finish in the final movie.  Therefore, they were forced to introduce a lot of new information in the second movie.  I really don't think we can judge how good or bad it was until we see Revolutions, which is essentially the second half of a 5 hour long movie.  <br />
<br />
A lot of people are going on about the Rave scene.  It was a 10 minute scene, yet people complain like it was 90 minutes long.  If you haven't had to sit through 10 minutes of tediousness in a movie before, then you must rarely go.  That said, I think a lot of people are missing the point of the scene.  While not necessary, it does help develop the storyline.  <br />
<br />
Minor spoilers: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all, the city of Zion knows that the bad guys are on the way and will likely kill them all.  This is one last big celebration of humanity before it is wiped out.<br />
<br />
Second, you have the religious symbolism.  You have naked people, in their bare feet, dancing on a dirt floor, in a temple.  This is the real world.  People are in contact with the Earth itself, and are even surrounded by pools of lava, the building blocks of the Earth.  The people of Zion live underground, below the people still plugged into the Maxtrix, are can be viewed as the fallen people, or those cast out of Heaven.  The Matrix, on the other hand, is heaven.  It is &quot;perfect,&quot; or at least as perfect as the machines made it.  The people of Zion have rejected this perfection and would rather fight to survive than follow the path chosen for them by others (the machines).  <br />
<br />
Thirdly, you see a compare and contrast between the behavior of the machines and that of the humans.  The machines are only doing what they can to survive.  The humans threaten their existence, so they work only for the destruction of Zion.  On the other hand, the people of Zion are relishing their humanity as long as they are allowed.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I've missed some symbolism, but I think I've understood at least some of it.  Maybe this all requires too much thinking for a movie, but I enjoyed it.  Suggesting that it was added for no reason, as some have, is kind of silly.  I'm sure they had to cut another scene or two to add this one, so you can be sure there is a reason behind it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Even with its understanding which is EASY to pickup, it drags on forever.  Even though it may be ten minutes, it is a SOLID ten minutes of the stereotypical booty-liscious African romp.  It's like 'woohoo!' look at all the muddy cavemen wearing sunglasses!<br />
<br />
Its not in the grey yet :boggle:</div></div><hr />
