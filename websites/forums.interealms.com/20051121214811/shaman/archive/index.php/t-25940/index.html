<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korrundar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it worth it to try and collect the set of equipment ending with the name &quot;of the viper&quot;, or should I just concentrate on Sta gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">By the time you collect a full set, you will; a) be sick of WC, and b) looking for better gear from leveling.<br />
<br />
It is good stuff, for the level you get it.  I cleared WC three times, and saw one drop in this set.  I suppose that if you have a regular group that is willing to concede this set to you (hunter, rogue, shaman and druid all wear leather at this stage), and likes exp'ing in there, it might be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My weekly group spent 4 or 5 evenings in Wailing Caverns, including 2 complete clearings. I think we had 9 pieces drop, including 3 boots.  Nobody was able to get a complete set (one piece never dropped, cant remember).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">by the time you get it all, you could have found better elsewhere and done some other cool instances.  BFD is really cool, makes WC look lame (aside from the cool dreamer bit, cool while it lasted)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korrundar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Then I must be lucky.  I did one instance of WC and received 2 items.  Another dropped but I lost the roll on it.  So then my question would be, should I scower the AH for the viper set or just try to get the most STA available?  (I am a shaman)</div></div><hr />

What's your playstyle?  Are you PvP or PvE? (my sincere applogies if you mentioned this before, just trying to get my caffiene in right now).<br />
<br />
PvE players will push stats like int and spi, because honestly, a smart caster can really outshine a blunt instrument caster with these.  In PvP, it's all about lasting and surviving ridiculous attacks out of no where, be it from a group, or a stray rogue.  Survival means Stam, AC and DPS.  AC and Stam help you survive the initial attack and solid DPS helps you shock and awe your opponent so they turn and run.  Once an opponent tries to run, you win.  Survivability is good, hard to argue the whole &quot;you can't cast if you're dead&quot; thing and I totally agree with it.  Being a horde player as well, a shaman can be a viable off tank or even a priest's bodyguard for most of his career.  Making yourself more durable adds functionality to often warrior starved horde parties.<br />
<br />
Let me give you my personal exp on sets ... the bonuses are nice, but they suck.  I have two pieces of scarlet armour and I get a whopping +10 AC ... yeah ... underwhelming.  I currently have 3089AC at lvl 40 and I have to say that 10 AC makes no difference whatsoever.  One more piece and I get a +2 to defense and while it's nice to have, I mean every little bit helps, I wouldn't re-mortgage the house or sell off my RRSPs to get the bonuses.  Most equipment in WoW seems to get replaced every 4-6 levels.  Anytime you see a bonus to resisting shadow magic ... don't laugh, just ignore it.  In short, most set bonuses really are not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korrundar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you for that insight.  Makes sense...  I was checking the AH every day for the rest of the pieces, and well .. they were either way overpriced .. or very difficult to find.<br />
<br />
I play on a RP PVE server.  So I guess trying to obtain these types of items are probably not worth it. <br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone for thier input.</div></div><hr />
