<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I never put so much thought into the fact that I was troll. This is the new shaman I've been asking questions about for a while now :p. It was to replace my monk as a main, and I haven't had that much time to get started on it yet.<br />
<br />
Recently I dinged 9 and got SoW, and headed over to NK for exp. Everything there aggroed me. Those bunch of gnomes and dwarfs sitting along a wall hit me first, I ran all the way to the Nexus, and prompbly aggroed the guards as well (I was expecting them to save me, yes, I'm naive.)<br />
<br />
Did I mention when I got my first port to a druid ring, I almost fainted when I saw the loading screen as the druids beat the crap out of me. I just stood there in stunned silence for a while (my main's a human monk) I was confused until I realized I could invis. But still...<br />
<br />
After the guards headed for me, I ran into the Nexus and got ported, seriously. Bleh, after I get back, I just camp out and sit there in front of my computer. <br />
<br />
How do you guys even deal with this. I'm not gonng give up or anything, but when I think about all the evil characters in EQ, it's so annoying it's just weird. I don't mind city KOS and guards KOS, it's really your fault if you're stupid enough to run to a city you're KOS to, but how do you deal with just everything aggroing on you? NPC's in the zone you're hunting at are always high enough to whomp you down. Bah, I have no idea what to do now.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me a simple soloing route after 9? Should I pursue NK even though everything there wants me dead, am I just unlucky? Or is intense noobishness just showing, and theres some obvious solo leveling choice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">South Ro is a great spot for your level. It is near grobb, no merchants that will hate you. Also, very little competition for the most part. After that there is oasis, or rathe mountains. In rathe mountains if you go in from feerrott, then take a left. Plenty of lizard men, orcs, and basilisks to whack on. Being a troll is no big deal. Faction is nothing to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Being evil is awesome, you can kill just about anything you want without worrying about faction. Who gives a crap about faction ? If something rubs you the wrong way, plow over it, since you're a Troll eat them ! <br />
<br />
I don't go into any new zone without first knowing how safe/unsafe it is. Such as Karanas, being Iksar everything hates me, so I stay away from everything, I always invis before getting a port, regardless of where I'm porting to. That should eliminate some problems of getting a TP. Just know that not much of anywhere is safe in the Old World for us evils except your home city and in your case Neriak and Ogguk. Find out some info on the zones you plan to go to and what to watch out for and stay away from.<br />
<br />
I too agree on South Ro, good spot...lots of orcs and other things to beat up. You can get into a Derv group as well and pound on them no faction hits except with Dervs but who gives a crap about them ?  And there are Dark Elf merchants you can trade your goodies with, then you can head to Oasis (1 zone away) to hunt crocs and orcs. There is a gypsy there that will trade with you too so, no biggie. Later if you get the urge take the boat from Oasis to Timorous Deep, then onto Kunark. Evil outpost in the Overthere, where the boat takes..you can bank, buy, sell, right from there. Here is a good source of finding out about the zones and what dangers they hold:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First thing to do?  Hit F9 twice, and marvel at what a fine-lookin' troll you are. /dance. Aww yeah. Of COURSE they want to kill you - if they didn't, they'd constantly be fighting to keep their women (or men, as the case may be) from swooning and chasing you down, never to be seen from again!<br />
<br />
Once you realize that they're just misguided, and envy your trollish sex appeal, you'll learn to avoid any guard-looking fellas.  Whenever you see something that looks remotely humanoid, it is best to be considered from a distance. It will quickly become second nature to you. And be wary around hills and when your vision is limited - those humans can be sneaky folks, hiding behind hills and trees to ambush the jolly ol' troll. /wave Sergeant Slate!<br />
<br />
Oh, avoid houses and huts too - even if they aren't guards, those swarms of adoring fans just get oh so tiring, there's only so much fame a troll can handle in one day.<br />
<br />
Remember, invis and sow are your friends. When in doubt, invis - you can't go wrong with a troll in stealth mode.  And finally, if you do get spotted, having an escape route in your head is key to enjoying the life of the sexy troll you are :)<br />
<br />
One last thing ... if the faction does start to get too frustrating to you, I highly recommend taking a boatride to the overthere, and accompanying the Dragoons on one of their nightly rounds ... there are few things that can match watching those good races scatter as the goons approach. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&gt;&gt;I just stood there in stunned silence for a while (my main's a human monk) I was confused until I realized I could invis. But still...&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
At level 9? You must have some item then, because shamans dont get invis until 29th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If dem like you kill a few.<br />
<br />
If dem not like kill a few more.<br />

When joo are hated kill all joo want.<br />
<br />
Kill the guards, druids, rangers, kill dem all and let Inny sort them out.<br />
<br />
Take pride in da hate that burns in joo vains......<br />
<br />
*burp*<br />
<br />
one of da best zones to level in for 9 is FoB in kunark.  The pit is just wonderfull / safe and great exp but no so guud cash.  Just make sure to take your level 14 and 19 spells with joo.  LoL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I heard Paludal Caverns was newbie heaven on earth exp factory.<br />
<br />
and the good thing is, with the new expansions, being evil doesn't matter anymore (well hardly).   You do business with little problem in Thurg and Bazaar/Shadowhaven, from what I understand.   Maybe think about leveling on the moon and skipping faction problems?  <br />
<br />
I am a goodie goodie barbarian, so what do I know.<br />
<br />
Henora, ally of sarnaks, iksars, dark elfs...I am thinking of slaughtering Holly Windstalker until I am ally to blackburrow too.  :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Trolls aren't evil, they just play at it.<br />
<br />
That being said, if being kos in karanas bothers you, go killa few thousand gnolls in bb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Since you are still a low level shaman now, my advice is to just suck it up. Avoid places where you are KOS in, stay away from those KOS guards, use invis before getting ported to a druid ring, etc. Be patient. Get your revenge &amp; kick those NPC butts later when you get lvl 60. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Get yerself' a pad of paper, preferably a thick pad, and write on the top &quot;Revenge List&quot;. Make a note of all those misguided fools who ruin yer day. This list will grow to be near and dear to your heart. Short of finishing the Totemic Armor quests one of the most deeply satisfying things in this game is to go back and kick the teeth down the throat of someone who terorized ya unjustly when you were young (hey, you wern't eat'n no one right then). My most favorite screenshot ever is me scratchin' my butt over the corpse of 'ol Dark Deathsinger. :) The rangers in WC at the druid ring are next on my list. Took a stab at them the other night and they're still a bit tough to chew at 36, but I'm patient. Seriously, South Ro or Oasis is great at your age, go bug hunting, the snakes and spiders are almost allways left alone because of the poison. Just keep cure poison memed and you should be ok. Crocs and Orcs will take ya to 19 easy in Oasis if you can stand the other players there. For traveling just consider anything that moves to be equaly threatning and you'll get along fine. Good huntin' and revel in you're evilness, it really does make the game a lot more fun. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Saabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">(= What is worse is when you are dual boxing an evil and a good and get confused and run the wrong char somewhere ;)<br />
<br />
But seriously nothing time will not fix. If you avoid the old world troll/ogre faction issues are basily moot. (honestly not sure if that is good or not, but it is awful convient).<br />
<br />
Of course the easy solution is to assume they want to kill you, they ALL want to kill you.<br />
<br />
It's a Troll thing (= (Love that old model run tho!)<br />
<br />
p.s. annoying how both races that get innate regen are `evil`.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">By the invis part I meant, I just realized I could port, as long as I could get invis'd. I was stunned because I thought I could never get a port again, just shocked, wasn't thinking. :)<br />
<br />
The druid was the one that came back, invis'd me, and then gave me another port. Nice guy, did them both for free.<br />
<br />
Thanks, it's alot nicer to know people deal with it easily. It's just I've never had KOS problems before. Just by coincidence, not really by choice, so I don't really mind I guess. <br />
<br />
I'm leveling in Oasis at the moment, I wonder when I can go to Paludal? All I hear about is some huge exp bonus there or something. :confused:<br />
<br />
Also, anyone have any ideas what I should put in my wrist slots if I ever get the money?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bein evil be a labour of love... erm, hate... umm, fear.  Ya well, fer me it a labour of fear.  Me s'pose it wud take a bit of gettin used to, tho bein natrully suspicious of whetha yu KoS becums second nature afta a few brushes wif da food races.<br />
<br />
Just a few tings ta correct sum mistrooths abuv and ta keep in yer embryonic evil skull:<br />
<br />
 - Even tho yu is evil and dem is evil dinna mean dem gonna like ya.  As a troll, *most* of Oggok and *most* of Neriak be okies, but both places hav KoS mobs waitin ta chew on sum green flesh.<br />
<br />
 - Overthere sux aviak eggs as a place ta buy and sell.  Prices be double normal and vendor purchase prices be half.  It is a gud place ta bank tho.<br />
<br />
 - Dinna destroy yer Venril Sathir fakshun (dat is, by huntin in Karnor's, Howlin Stones, or Kaesora) until yu is 50 and got yer Hammer of the Overthere.<br />
<br />
 - Revenge be a dish best served cold.  Like Tuga sez, make a list.  Make a BIG list, it keeps ya goin.<br />
<br />
 - If it moves, kill it.  If it duzn't, chop it down.  If it pink, it be food.  If it hairy, it be clothing.  If it scaley, it be boots.<br />
<br />
As fer da Paludal Caverns, yu cud go der now.  Der be places in der fer all levels frum 6 thru ta 25 or so.  Loot purty good too fer da level.<br />
<br />
Evil be free will.  Da puppet strings hav been cut and yer skull be free of a conscience.  Revel in yer freedom!<br />

<br />
Somehow ... not sure how I became admrial to the druid rings.  All I can think is around that time I was killing lizards to get the cyclopes to pop in Rathe Mnts.  I got faction for killing them but don't remember what the faction hit was... but it could have been something else.  Anyway, I don't need invis to hit a druid ring anymore, except North K... the trents really dont like me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Doh - I'm Evil !<br />
nothing to add to all of the above (I still like Yzzie's way of saying things !)  just - I am not used to the idea of playing &quot;good&quot;<br />
<br />
in all my single - player gaming experience, I killed everything - followed every branch to kill everything.  If there were rewards in the game for not killing something, I didn't get that reward, I guess.  if it is wandering in the country-side, it is grist for the exp mill - why else would it be there?<br />
<br />
Guards for protection?  well, okay, i guess, it helped my very first EQ char live long enough to figure out how to hit 'attack (and why not to do so when talking to a guard or vendor) ... but it felt like an exploit ...  8(<br />
<br />
maybe that is one of the reasons I like my troll so much - I don't have to worry about what I kill, except I choose not to kill trolls.<br />
<br />
I have factioned Thurgadin as a side effect of killing giants.  I factioned Steannor (sp?) in SH to sell up there by running the gems/tailoring supplies while waiting for rezzes.  am always a little surpised to get to Grobb and realize I am still only warmly there ...<br />
<br />
it is normal to be evil in dis game.  Black &amp; White is for goodie-goodies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I play a barbie shaman, but I LOVE my ogre SK, although I stopped leveling him at 18 to faction a bit.<br />
<br />
I leveled him to 10 in Feerot, 10-14 in So Ro, 14-18 in unrest with a small stint between So Ro and unrest spent in LR killing bandits.  I'm in WK/NK killing more bandits till my qeynos guards and my HHP guards faction hits dubious.  The objective is to be able to run the bridge and also pass through HHP safely so I can use the luclin ports to get around. Aside from those 2 factions I plan on trashing everything else.  Odd thing is though that my ogre is more welcome in FP than my barbie shaman (he knows a few paladins ... ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I usually partner with a friend of mine, but solo before he gets on, so this might help:<br />
<br />
1 to 9 in the swamp.<br />
10 to 16 over in oasis.(solo the stuff that you might see in sro at the start then work your way up to crocs etc)<br />
17 to 24 over in the OT(north side along shore and near the mudpit)<br />
Once ya get your new spells at 24, soloing along shoreside in LOIO should be easy.  Ill stay here till about 29(/hug noobie zone exp bonus)<br />
<br />
Till 60, some spots id like to head to:<br />
29-35 ice clad cougars and CC.<br />
36-44 Dire wolves are very nice exp, most overlook it.  Some solb would be nice to.<br />
45-51 Solb, dreadlands, Great Divide Giants(more of a faction issue tho)<br />
52-55 Seafuries, nice cash and exp to boot.  Plus these things are pansies heh.  Also try to get gornit when he pops, always drops nice stuff.<br />
56-60 you can do bnb or ld in solb, Chardok entrance(solo maybe near to 60), velks(find a nice place near the corner to solo, safe hall is always a nice option. Skyfire is nice exp, wurms might be not worth it lot o hp's, but you can maybe gank some spells here.<br />
<br />
Just some ideas, hope it helps. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">as you get older, a lot of faction issues dissapear. i play a wood elf druid. so you wouldn't think i have faction issues. heh. <br />
<br />
i kill anything that moves. if it summons me i book it outa zone and try again later :D<br />
<br />
i am currently KoS in almost every old world city. dubious in felwithe, and kaladim. amiable in kelethin (home town) and ally in gnomertown (hunted minos a lot).<br />
<br />
heck i'm kos in some parts of surefall glade, and kos to all of antonica basically. faction really means nothing as you get older. i bank in thurg or bazaar/shadowhaven, that faction is easily raised and you can just laugh and slaughter anything in the old worlds. me and sgt slate have had many a nice talk about the way i think freeport should be run (i forgot, ally in north freeport...from my talks with the good sgt)<br />
<br />
in short, being evil will never hurt ya in the long run for faction, it all evens out in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Being evil is the only thing I know. I've been a Shadow Knight (to 22), and now an Iksar Shaman (46 now).<br />
<br />
Always SoW + Invis in almost every popular zone.<br />
<br />
NEVER port w/o invis on. You never know whos going to be there and its not like a zone line, where you step back. Someone could have trained a good NPC there and died at the wizzy portal. Then bam, he's on you.<br />
<br />
As an Iksar though, I've travelled to most places, except Ak'Anon 'cause who goes there any ways? Its hella fun and gutwrenching to see the Invis icon start flashing while in a good city. You either gotta find a zone line or find a little corner in the city and pray you can recast fast enough.</div></div><hr />

Being evil is great, when you're banking in neriak you can kill heaps of halfings on the way there and then on the way back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">While I was doing a part of the epic in freeport I was kos to all the guards. I managed to get a train of 30 or so, and get lost since I had never travelled there before. I found my way to the dock and to my surprise the train had grown even larger. This amused me, yet I gave myself a levitate, and camped over the water. I logged back on and started killing a guard that was a yellow con, and whom didnt aggro me while I was over the water. I decided to hop on the boat rather then getting in trouble for taking advantage of a bug. If I were a goodie barb I would have had none of these amusing problems. Kill some gnolls in blackburrow. Its very easy to get your faction up well enough to bank in qeynos (just invis past the corrupt guards), and you are unkos to the merchants as well as the druid ports in surefall/NK. <br />
