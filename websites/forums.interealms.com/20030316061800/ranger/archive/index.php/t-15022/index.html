<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Murchadha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been looking around at Lucy and am a bit confused.<br />
<br />
How can you tell if two spells will stack.  The question that started this was on my guild MB, someone asked in Symbol of Naltron and Talisman of Altuna would stack, since they are both AC buffs.<br />
<br />
According to Lucy, Talisman has the HP in slot 3, while Naltron has it in Slot 1.  I would guess the spells would stack.<br />
<br />
Am I understanding how to read spell slots correctly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go to lucy, then find the spell you want to check, then click on the stacking link at the top right of the page and you will get the stacking page for that spell.<br />
<br />
For Symbol of Naltron  it is here (http://lucy.fnord.net/stacking.html?id=488&amp;source=Test)   Those are what will not stack with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
So yes they do stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry for dredging up an old post, but I guess I'm really obtuse today.  Just got my 30th level spells, and I'm trying to figure out what stacks with what.  I was under the impression that Thistlecoat stacked with Shield of Thistles and Barbcoat, but, no Thistlecoat:<br />
<br />
[Wed Jan 22 02:41:00 2003] You begin casting Barbcoat.<br />
[Wed Jan 22 02:41:02 2003] Barbs spring from your skin.<br />
[Wed Jan 22 02:41:06 2003] You begin casting Shield of Thistles.<br />
[Wed Jan 22 02:41:09 2003] You are surrounded by a thorny barrier.<br />
[Wed Jan 22 02:41:28 2003] You begin casting Thistlecoat.<br />
[Wed Jan 22 02:41:30 2003] Your spell did not take hold.<br />
<br />
Huh? I'm really not following the Slot 1/Slot 2 thing on Lucy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Coats do not stack, though higher level Coats will overwrite lower level ones.  That is why you could not have Barbcoat and Thistlecoat up at the same time.<br />
<br />
Thistlecoat (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=516&amp;source=Live) is 4-6AC in Slot 2, and 1DS in Slot 3.<br />
<br />
Barbcoat (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=516&amp;source=Live) is 11-12AC in Slot 2, and 2DS in Slot 3.<br />
<br />
Shield of Thistles (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=256&amp;source=Live) is 5-6DS in Slot 1.<br />
<br />
If a spell has the same basic effect (DS, AC, HP, Haste, etc.) in the same slot as another spell, those effects will not stack.<br />
<br />
Also, there are some special stacking rules.  For instance, Strength of Tunare, for some unknown reason, prevents the Cleric spell Divine Barrier from landing (which usually ends in a dead cleric).<br />
<br />
Additionally, Strength of Tunare (and it's predecessor, Strength of Nature), have &quot;special&quot; stacking slots.  In Slot 2 for Strength of Tunare is &quot;Stacking1 v2 204: Hitpoints(400)&quot; which is *supposed* to prevent Brell's Mountainous Barrier from landing, amongst other things.  However, for whatever reason, this does not work properly.  Strength of Nature, on the other hand, works properly in this regard and is one of the main reasons that these special stacking codes were put in place: Lots of rangers getting fed up with losing Strength of Nature and it's combo-upgrade, Warder's Protection, to a piddly little 150HP &quot;upgrade&quot; from a passing paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, thanks, Elured, that helps. I knew something stacked with something else, and had heard I'd end up with a 10 pt DS, so now I see what's going on.  Riftwind's Protection is the third piece of the DS puzzle, OK. <br />
<br />
(And, I have to ask - where does the line in your signature come from?  I tried to describe it to my wife, and she didn't find it particularly funny, but it strikes me as hilarious for some reason.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's a line from Dr. Weird, of Aqua Teen Hunger Force fame (on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network, Sunday nights).<br />
<br />
It's the first episode of the show, I believe, in which Dr. Weird reveals his Rabbot (rabbit + robot) and then, to teach it a lesson like his father taught him, sprayed perfume in it's eyes.  It went insane and ate some hair tonic and started spraying hair all over the city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Man, I don't get out enough.  Thanks for the explanation (of the spells, too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, I think my sig reveals that I'm the one who doesn't get out enough.</div></div><hr />
