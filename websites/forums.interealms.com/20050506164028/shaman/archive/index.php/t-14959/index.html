<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shrink. The way this spell works is flawed. Period.<br />
<br />
Shrink is an incredibly important tool for raiding, and yet in all the years of Everquest it has not been the subject of SIMPLE tweaking that would make it so much less of a pain in the ass to cast. Here is what we want out of shrink:<br />
<br />
1. Allow shrink to be cast on people outside of your own group.<br />
2. Allow shrink to be cast on people outside of your own group.<br />
3. Allow shrink to be cast on people outside of your own group.<br />
<br />
Its really not that complicated of a demand.<br />
<br />
Now to make this criticizm constructive, let me offer a suggestion or two on how to do this. You could:<br />
<br />
a. Create a dialogue box asking for permission to shrink when someone outside of group casts it on you (much like translocation or ressurection spells work)<br />
b. Give the spell an icon, so it can be clicked off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the part for the shaman community. Every one of us, every single day, must /feedback this. Its about time it is fixed and I dont know about you guys but I am sick and tired of this obvious problem being neglected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah and fix dd waves under 11% while you're at it :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, dont give it an icon.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just making it so that shrink will work on people outside of your group yet within the same raid would work for me. I don't want an icon though. With only 15 buff slots, there isn't really any room to waste on a shrink icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Making Shrink work on anyone within the raid would be nice.  Anyone outside of the group/raid is probably a bad idea.  No Icon please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yah no icon. Fer crissakes its hard enough having to click off buffs to have better buffs of spells like quiessence land....<br />
<br />
And what is a good reason to not allow shrinking of anyone? Whats the big drawback to being shrunk besides not being able to get up the stairs in Kael by the bank without jumping...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Feedback your own solution if you like. I dont really care. But anyone who has the ability to cast shrink knows it is messed up the way it is now. And it needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And make my dots do more damage/tic with a snare effect. Also, our nukes suck, on bosses I don't contribute as much as I should on raids with respect to the boss. And we need a group quiescence or wave of marr effect, but make wave of marr effect mgbable but w/o a buff icon. Did I miss anything? more hps per sta would be nice... <br />
<br />
Just me, but if you are one of those people who complained about making the game easier by opening the planes etc, then you should be complaining about making it EVEN more easier. Your guildies should spend money on shrink machines or shrink potions, my guild raids about 70 people each time and we don't have any problems at all..</div></div><hr />

 Only problem being it would negate the need for the grow spell...imo casting it inside raid would be the most efficient and fair. <br />

Actually grow is useful for rangers to hit mobs over people's heads...cant think of any other uses though.  And here's a good story about shrink....one time i gave a melee a shrink potion to shrink himself, he promptly clicks it 10 times in a row and says &quot;it didnt work&quot;...yeah next time target yourself and listen to me when i say STOP TRYING TO SHRINK ME.....dumb ogres...</div></div><hr />

Im sure there are many here who remember the days of having to /camp in order to return yourself to normal size...Im assuming this was the application in mind with the implementation of grow.<br />
<br />
And it is this reason that would lead me to believe, for those that want to /feedback this to be changed, that the /normalsize command is the wrong direction to ask for in them changing it.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for posting this incredibly witty response, you bring up a good point. People like Valka here have been working around this problem with shrink for SO long they have found work arounds. You quite simply have no idea what it would be like or how convenient it would be to just never have this problem. To never buy mana batteries, to never create ant potions, to never group hop for shrinking etc. etc.<br />
<br />
This is a problem. People forgot about it because it went so long without a solution. From this point onward is the time when the shaman community wont shut the hell up until it's fixed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Grow potions sell very fast in the bazaar, even with a 30% markup (found out by accident since my mule had a ton of room after one of my skilling sessions).  I'm sure there are plenty of reasons.<br />
<br />
One I'm sure of is asslings and ANY dungeon.  My new bot is a halfling cleric, and she CONSTANTLY gets stuck on steps that are up to my shaman's knees - not just in Kael.  I keep a pack of grows on her at all times now because I'm sick of trying to juggle two keyboards so I can have her jump...  *grin*  Shamans all being large (yes, I'm ignoring frogs), we don't understand the plight of the stunty very well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I just want to see the day when I can open the raid window and do a group by group shrink with tiny terror.  I don't care HOW they do it as long as it gets done. Someone dies, Rebuff, shrink send em on their way. It may be nothing more than an annoyance if you aren't raiding on a regular basis but it's a serious pain in the arse if you are. Even if everyone has a shrink device, you know in a 60+ people raid plenty will have run out of charges, forgot to restock on batteries, or just don't care or can't afford the upkeep (especially necros who need to be reshrunk every 15 minutes... Arghhh) and ripping people's heads off for expecting you to degroup and shrink them in the middle of Ubermob fight_001 gets real old real fast.  <br />
<br />
A Simple Yes/No dialog box and NO restrictions on who you cast it on (just like they did with translocate) would seem the ideal solution to me. Do the same thing with Grow and tiny terror and we're set. And if it doesn't work on pets anymore because of this, who cares ... Every pet class has tiny companion spell (including us) so that isn't even an issue anymore. <br />
<br />
They've said the problem was a technical one but If they did it for translocate, why not shrink/grow. They talk about fixing annoying issues with spells. Here's one that affects everyone that raids.<br />

Summoning items with effects on them is their exclusive domain and I for one think that the lines are already way too blurred between the classes. We buff, we don't summon. Better to keep it simple.<br />
<br />
It is for this same reason that when mages were given the ability to summon tradeable gate items, those items required a shaman created alchemy potion as a reagent for them to work since creating gate potions is pretty much our exclusive domain.<br />

More of an issue on small mobs... and it's rather serious if you start to factor in the amount of missing DPS because SoE thought it would be funny to make 50 people raid a gnome-sized mob...<br />
<br />
Even worst when SK/Necros start turning your dragons(for example) into skelly form..<br />
<br />
Was some thread a long while back on FoH boards(I think) showing several parsing on a Dain raid... Several unshrunk raids and then several shrunk raids... DPS actually JUMPED because more tanks could hit the mob more often and not get that dreaded OOR message...<br />
<br />
So when DPS is critical, shrink CAN save your day... (or reroll all the melees as GNOMES!!)</div></div><hr />

Also the dang range in the raid window. Clicking in there to get a target, the range is just too dang small. Would it hurt for the range to be more than 50?<br />

In the software, even generic industry, this is something we call POLISH. You can leave all the damn workarounds you want for your clients/customers, but when you fail to address a clear problem even if it doesn't cause much more than annoyance or inconvenience, thats just stupid and unfair.<br />
<br />
EDIT: and Axas I must agree that idea is just superb. I couldn't think of a situation where that wouldn't be the ideal way to shrink your raid. You can do it without the raid even having formed yet, you cannot exploit with it and it uses coding that is already in the game.<br />
<br />
We really need to find a way to bring this to Sony's attention. They get truckloads of terrible suggestions that are in no way beneficial to the game (the druid &quot;I want a pony and a 90% rez&quot; list comes to mind) and we need to find a way for a solution as great as the one Axas gave to find its way to them through all that rubbish. I'm open to suggestions, I've already tried looking over the sony boards, chats, and there doesn't seem to be much hope there. I was thinking maybe a direct E-mail to one of the everquest crew.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I looked through the thread pretty quickly, so apologies if someone already suggested it, but it seems like the best solution to me, that fits within the framework of EQ, would be to simply change shrink to pop up a dialog asking if the person wants to shrink or not.  Just like rezzes.  The whole reason why people can't shrink outside of their group is grief shrinking/growing.  There are quite a few places in EQ where if you're too big or too small, you can't get out of areas easily.  I could see /normalsize being a good idea to return out of it to avoid having to re-grow/click mount buff off and back on/illusion/etc.  I think you HAVE to ask the person, if they're not in your group, if they want to shrink/grow, because if it was allowed to shrink everyone with only  the /normalsize, they may have been shrunk, not know it and then need to leave immediately and can't because of their size and not be able to figure out was going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I prefer the idea of a dialog box, rather than a shrink item. People already complain about getting a rod on their cursor which they have to delete if they don't want to use.<br />
<br />
If they do that, maybe they could add a mass shrink spell (like the wizard's mass TL to bind spell) too, to get around the fact that it can't be MGB'd.<br />
<br />
But I hate switching around groups when I'm the only shaman on raids. (Pet peeve: why is it people forget that Beastlords can shrink too? I've been invited into groups which already have a BL in to shrink group members.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I got in a argument with Wildaar last time this came up, but honestly, shrink should have an icon.  Before you get upset please hear me out.  I know the majority of players don't want this because of how precious the buff window is.<br />
<br />
IMHO, the only reason shrink has no icon today is because it began life as a hack.  I suspect that all the player models are the same height in their native file formats.  So, when you shrunk a player, instead of occupying a limited duration buff slot it just changed the scaling factor within that character's temporary, online profile.  Which would explain why shrink didn't wear off until you camped or zoned and why when someone used an illusion before you entered the zone you'd see high-elf sized gnome in the bank (this was fixed a while back).  You were getting the updated model but the race's scaling value.<br />
<br />
This is also why grow only lets you reach barbarian height.  I'm not positive but there seems to be four valid character heights (as you can shrink dwarfs slightly).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I don't think it'd be fair to change shrink to an icon at this stage in the game, and not just because I'm afraid of losing the slot...  I'd be afraid of it getting dispelled on the MA when he has the mob cornered.  Suddenly he's on the other side of the mob's geometry, so 1) He can't hit it any more, and 2) the mob has now flipped to face everyone else, and that would be very bad, especially if it happened to be enraged just then.  Would also flip most front-only AEs towards the crowd as well, I suppose.<br />
<br />
Now I know he can use clickes and all that to help prevent that from happening, but that's a rather big thing to suddenly have to worry about.</div></div><hr />

Making half assed shortcuts around an obvious problem that makes people go out of thier way to correct something you as a developer should have already fixed is FAR from customer satisfaction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Hail,<br />
<br />
This issue isn't worth a mass feedback in my opinion.  Someone at Sony does read each and every feedback submitted.<br />
<br />
The Axas solution seems the best of all the ideas submitted so far.<br />
<br />
If you write a reasonable solution that is workable, submit in both a feedback AND a thread in the developer's forum. OR go to the superuber guilds and get them to write something up on their website front page.  That usually gets some attention.  I doubt they'd do it, but it is worth a try.  <br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I got in a argument with Wildaar last time this came up, but honestly, shrink should have an icon.  Before you get upset please hear me out.  I know the majority of players don't want this because of how precious the buff window is.<br />
<br />
IMHO, the only reason shrink has no icon today is because it began life as a hack.  I suspect that all the player models are the same height in their native file formats.  So, when you shrunk a player, instead of occupying a limited duration buff slot it just changed the scaling factor within that character's temporary, online profile.  Which would explain why shrink didn't wear off until you camped or zoned and why when someone used an illusion before you entered the zone you'd see high-elf sized gnome in the bank (this was fixed a while back).  You were getting the updated model but the race's scaling value.<br />
<br />
This is also why grow only lets you reach barbarian height.  I'm not positive but there seems to be four valid character heights (as you can shrink dwarfs slightly).  <br />

<br />
bingo.<br />
<br />
it should have a spell icon but personally i don't want one.<br />
<br />
oh and on a side note, the gnome is the tallest character file and the ogre is the shortest. kinda a switch around, but if you shrink an ogre twice he is shorter than a gnome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually we do summon, just not to the same exent.  We can summon food, water and 100% weight reduction bags, and a pet.  I think giving a mage a summonable shrink potion would blur the lines more than giving a shaman one.  But this is just shrink, I for one, hate doing it, yet hate not having it done.  Give it to more people, I don't care, its far from class defining.<br />
<br />
Confirmation box, raid, and or normalize command are all great ideas, I'd be happy to see any of them implemented.</div></div><hr />

As for giving it to other classes - Beastlords get shrink, but everyone forgets that. There are shrink devices, shrink potions, shrink effects on some armour, but they cost money, so people will go back to asking the shaman for it. Some guilds *do* have a requirement that you have means to shrink yourself on all raids though.<br />
<br />
It would be good if shrink applied to all raid members, at least, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The game industry is not &quot;generic industry&quot; any more than it is software industry.  All limitations in a game world are artificial.  The developer has the power to grant every toon in the game such time-saving and convenient abilities as free ports to any zone, infinite mana, 100% rezzes, Elemental gear off bats and snakes, etc.  but if they chose to do so it would destroy the game.<br />
<br />
This particular limitation happens to be a pet peeve of yours, and I recognize that it's not logical and it would be better to have it addressed - but you can't demand that it be addressed from a &quot;customer service&quot; or &quot;customer convenience&quot; standpoint, games just don't work that way.  And I don't happen to feel that it's more important than the sorry state of alchemy, or the lack of raid-level content that's forcing high-level guilds to compete brutally for events, or the fact that Warriors can't hold aggro worth a rat's ass.  So forgive me if I hold my mass petition in hopes that they work on one or more of these other areas instead of wasting their time smoothing over a minor inconvenience.</div></div><hr />

Have you really thought through the ramifications of shrink having a duration?  If it wears off in a tight place, that person will be stuck.  Not able to sit to mem spells, not able to stand to cast, not able to sit to camp.<br />
<br />
My vote is still for the summoned shrink item with 3 charges :)</div></div><hr />

Actually I vote for that as well and I vote they give it to the mages.</div></div><hr />

You mean what can happen already when folks go linkdead?  Or like what happens when enduring breath, levitation, invisibility, etc. wear off?<br />
<br />
Chances are pretty good on a raid that your stuck person is not too far away from his original shrinker -- wouldn't have to juggle groups to fix it either.<br />
<br />
The existance of disadvantages does not always equal poorly thought out, Gloriana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">it will never happen. they make it group only because of the PVP servers. live with it.</div></div><hr />

My suggestion would be to add a new alchemy potion of army ants (group shrink) and if they really wanted to make it better make the potion using items summoned from mages.
