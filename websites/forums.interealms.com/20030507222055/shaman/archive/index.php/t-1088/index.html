<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Could I max my true spirit faction and then skip the hole fight, and just turn in the tear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not a silly question, but it is a very frequently asked one.<br />
<br />
The answer is yes. But some people consider it cheating, so I wouldn't brag about it too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fennri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have been playing my friend's shaman in his absence as of late and became interested in the epic. I know that he is near to the end but I do now know how close. He has gotten his black fur boots, but after that I don't know what he has completed. He hasn't killed Kirn or Neh since he has neither the ring or the scale. Lord Ghiosk on the other hand is a relative unknown, and best I can tell the only way that I will be able to find out is by his faction 'con' .. what should the spirits in EJ con after completing Lord Ghiosk defeat and hand in .. what should they and should they not respond to?<br />
<br />
I am going to do the diary collection simply because it is a relatively easy task, but if possible it would be nice to avoid Lord Ghiosk if it has already been done.<br />
<br />
Any info is appreciated :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ghiosk is actually pretty easy - any Black Reaver raid will spawn and kill him. I'd get his books and hand them in, if it works then carry on the quest from there. If it doesn't work, you know your friend didn't get that far.<br />
<br />
Because of the ambiguity of the 'con' messages, I wouldn't rely on them to find out how far through the quest you are.</div></div><hr />
