<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaffis</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being somewhat new to the 50+ crowd (pathfinder for 5 months now, hehe), I don't know enough of the high end ranger population on my server to make guesses at these, but am curious anyways.<br />
<br />
I'm curious as to how many of various items (mostly ranger specific, but some ranger and other useable) there are (educated estimates are fine) on various servers.. things like: Fungi Tunics, Earthcallers, Swiftwinds, Primal Bows, Dark Cloaks of the Sky, Bows of Doom, Forest Stalkers/Golden Leaf BPs...<br />
<br />
Any well-networked rangers out there willing to take a shot at estimates on their server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arbok of Xegony</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres a guess on the Xegony server:<br />
<br />
Fungi Tunic: no exact estimate, there might even be well over 100+ of these floating around but those who have it will probably not let it go.<br />
<br />
Earthcallers: I'd say 20-30.   I dont have any real hardcore evidence but this is just from travelling around/grouping and chatting with people.<br />
<br />
Swiftwind: I'd say about 40-50.   The Swiftwind isn't too hard to get and I'm sure rangers in minor guilds have gotten it, and perhaps twinks.<br />
<br />
Primal Bows: Basically if the ranger is ST enabled, then I guarantee that the ranger has a primal bow since primal tends to rot.    I'd say about 8-9 primal bows for rangers alone, there are much more on warriors/rogues etc.  They make a very nice range item even if you dont use bows full-time.<br />
<br />
Dark Cloak of the Sky: I'd say 4 max on the server.   I thought they didn't even exist on my server till I logged on my friend's ranger one day.<br />
<br />
Bows of Doom: Hmm....about 9-12.   This being based on how often Doom is killed and the drop rate of the bow.<br />
<br />
Forest Stalker BP: Rough estimate about.....7-9.   Since I know pretty much with all the rangers on my server who can obtain it.<br />
<br />
Golden Leaf BP: 5-7, just a guess from what I see walking around etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkus</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the numbers may be higher than that for Epics, Bow of Doom, GL BP, and Primal Bows.  We have 4 BoD in the Guild (3 on Rangers), 2 Primal Bows (1 on a Ranger), 2 GL BPs.  And I don't know many Rangers without Epics at the higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feeldary</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">on AB there are lots lots of everything, except Dark Cloack of the Sky.<br />
its a overcrowded of 60 players, which mean they raid SoL/Velious a lot, so not much time for PoA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaffis</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that the weekend is over and we're all stuck at work and raring to post... Any more takers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goldeneyes</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well on Vazaelle DCoS is by far the rarest, besides myself I know of only one more in existence, might be one or 2 others floating around.  Bow of Doom, prolly 8 or 9 including mine.  Forest Stalkers BP, most giulds are either Giant or went Giant early so there are more of them than GL, prolly 15 or so FS and 7-10 GL.  Fungis, epics, aren't rare at all so know way to really estimate how many are around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dallamar Whiterose</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feeldary is bang on about AB. Loads of everything, but then proportionally AB has a very high average level. I have only ever met one other ranger with the dark cloak, but i cant remember now whether that was on Ayonae Ro (the server i split from) or early days of AB. If i was forced to guess i would say:<br />
<br />
Fungi Tunics: 200+<br />
Swiftwinds: 40+<br />
Earthcallers: 30+<br />
Forrest Stalkers BP: 15+<br />
GoLden Leaf BP: 8 or 9 maybe<br />
Dark Cloak of the Sky: no less than 2 no more than 7 or so.<br />
<br />
edit: forgot Primal and Bow of Doom<br />
Primal Bows: 20 or so on rangers, warriors and rogues<br />
Bow of doom: absolutely no idea, maybe 5 or 6?<br />

Dallamar the Battlemaster<br />
Warder of Tunare<br />
Darkwind - Antonius Bayle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fufinski</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an addition to the Xegony rangers, 2 rangers in my guild have GL BP, and one who has now moved from us to another guild also had GL BP.  I am just waiting for mine to drop next, so I would assume the number is quite a bit higher then 5-7 as I know that many off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rounlin Starwolf</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fungi's are almost common now but ppl still wanna charge and arm and a leg<br />
<br />
Plenty of EC and SW around<br />
<br />
Primal Bows are very rare<br />
<br />
FS/GL bps are common enough<br />
<br />
Bows of Doom, maybe like 2 on the server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaggezin Bloodsteel</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Numbers on these items will vary a lot depending on what server you are on but the cloak of the sky is by far the least common. Most guilds no longer raid sky on a regular basis since the items are inferior now. Approx 4-5 cloaks on saryrn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meecham Saryrn</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dallamar, think 8-9 GL BPs on the server sounds abit low.  My guild alone has 4 of our 6 rangers wearing em, and we are far from being large.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldril Mystwalker</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I don't know many Rangers without Epics at the higher levels <br />
<br />
I wanna start hanging out with you... 56, and 2 steps from swiftwind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkus</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't hang out with me until you get it.  Sorry :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldril Mystwalker</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">even more reason for me to head over the the Hole!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dallamar Whiterose</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As i said Meecham, those numbers are pure guesses. I was going on the fact that there arent that many guilds that do HoT as opposed to West wing or North, hence presumed the numbers would be low.<br />
<br />
Either way AB has a huge number of high level players, and the number of guilds contesting spawns now is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
3 AoW capable guilds now and counting - two very close to taking Emperor Ssraeshza. /sigh<br />
<br />
All this means there tends to be alot more of the high level items out there compared to other servers, except for the Dark cloak for the reasons Feeldary mentioned.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hopwin</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Terris Thule:<br />
8-11 GL BP's<br />
8-11 FS BP's<br />
20 or so Primal Bows<br />
4-7 Bows of Doom<br />
DCoS I have no clue honestly, Ladas has one, other than that...<br />
Earthcaller 15 at least<br />
Swiftwind 30 at least<br />
Fungi Tunic 100+<br />
<br />
just a rough guess based on what I know my friendly ranger type buds are wearing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borzak</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Torv I thought every ranger 51+ had swiftwind till I got mine. Now at 57 I know several aorund my lvl and higher that don't have it...<br />
<br />
Every ranger in my guild 53+ has swiftwind now and no EC's in giuld yet.</div></div><hr />
