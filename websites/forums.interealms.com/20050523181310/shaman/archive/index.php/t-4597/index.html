You're late, they already have in another thread :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I really hope the new bard mez goes live.  It would be wonderful to be able to grab a bard instead of a chanter for CT.  Just wonderful.  As I understand it, that new mez will let bards mez 56-58 critters that before this time they couldn't touch.  The charm nerf made it so they couldn't charm them either, joy.  <br />
<br />
As for the other heal spells, we'll just have to see how it works out on test.  Looks like they didn't like wizard lures being unresistable, so who knows what the future holds for druid/shaman heals?  I'm not opposed to the druid spell healing for more max than the shaman spell.  I never wanted to be a cleric, but many druids however, have wanted that.  <br />
<br />
Looks like this is a half CH . . . tho with current warrior hp totals, it's less than half.  Heck the best equipped warrior in my guild has over 7100 hps.  This isn't even gonna do half of that if cast by a druid.  If cast by a shaman it's just gonna be like a large divine light to keep em alive between CH's.  We usually have a cleric doing that anyway, but this will give that job to a druid or shaman and let the cleric keep their own group alive or whatever.  <br />
<br />
It will totally wreck the grouping game tho.  At least for any kind of non-difficult dungeon or hunting grounds.  A difficult place yer still gonna want a cleric around for rezzes . . . or a pally i guess.  <br />
<br />
Time to give the clerics dots or something imho if this goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well it is still 1950 heal for 400mana (minus focus items/specialization)<br />
Lacks the 6:1 ratio of Torpor<br />
It's nearly 5:1 and you need to have 2600+ hps to get a full 1950 back. <br />
<br />
Correct my math if I missed something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good point. This would be a good pre-Torpor spell for shamans with a few hps who need to regain hps after canni.  <br />
a 54 shaman should be able to get 2k hps self buffed I think.  And with cleric buffs he'll be there or close.  Even 4:1 ratio would mean they gain mana from it.  anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1950 is well under 75% of my UNbuffed HP, seriously under 75% of my buffed HP.  But still,  a 2k heal for 400 mana is MUCH more than we ever asked for.  Not sure why druids are getting such a larger increased on theirs tho, more is fine, but a full 50% (1k) more is a bit much imo.</div></div><hr />
