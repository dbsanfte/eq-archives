<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone enlighten me as to whether there is a damage bonus for 2h blunt weapons with a damage of 25 or greater? I've always steered clear of 2hb weapons with a damage lower than 25 for this reason but as I been away awhile, I was wondering if anything had changed. If there is a bonus..how significant is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not for us. We aren't a melee-oriented class, so we do not get a damage bonus, or primary hand bonus, or any of the other cool melee bonuses.<br />
<br />
Melee classes do get bonuses based on both the delay of the weapon (higher delay = bigger bonus) and their level. But as I said, we aren't a melee class.<br />
<br />
Use whatever 2hb you like best, the damage bonus is not an issue for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was just told ingame by another Shaman that we DO get a damage bonus..but for weapons with a dly greater than 40 (rather than a damage greater than 25).<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's why I link to it. I hope you learned something.<br />

Dismiss the evil stupid teachers! Learn to think and embrace the Cube!<br />

Such a spazz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm fairly sure the 2h weapon bonus is tied to the delay, not the damage rating. It was all weapons over 35 or 40 delay (cant remember which) receive a 2h bonus. I believe it is separate from the normal damage bonus that is listed on the weapons now, though it may be factored in, in the case of 2h weapons. <br />
<br />
Also, I dont recall them (meaning Verant) stating the 2h bonus only applied to melee classes. I think it applies to anyone.</div></div><hr />

We did this nude and unbuffed, using mammoths as our target.  Had a lot of folks wondering what these 2 53rd level folks were doing picking on the poor mammoths.</div></div><hr />

Heh, reading that is like watching Fight Club: &quot;Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken!&quot;  &quot;You are not your ****ing khakis.&quot;<br />

Rantings of a nutty bastard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">High damage (delay?) weapons definately get a boost.  30/38 weapon hits for a minimum of 3, not 1.  48/42 weapon hits for a minimum of 5.  Haven't parsed other weapons so its hard to say whether its delay or damage based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Aye, my 39 43 hammer hits for a min of 5 too, 4 dmg bonus.</div></div><hr />
