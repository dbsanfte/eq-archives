<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faithtoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all wanted to drop by and introduce myself. Ive played a mage for past couple but recently began my adventure with my currently 39 shm.<br />
I must say Im  enjoying her immensely. <br />
<br />
Anyway Ive been PLing her with my husbands wizzy and my mage (pyrilen skin owns) Im excited to get her to a stage where I can group with her on my mage and get loads of exp in GoD.<br />
<br />
Eventually Id like to be able to take her to OOW zones and camp mini named for runes /gear etc. What I was wondering is if you have any suggestions for something they might be able to handle? My mages magelo is http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=941854<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lol, you're at LEAST the 7th person I know of who switched from high level main magician to shaman.  Welcome to the club, it's a whole different world :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well for 66-68 runes you can very trivially kill the nameds in NC....I'd guess maybe after 58 when shaman gets a big, slow clumsy heal...62 would be easier (better pet, spirit of leopard, torpor, fast heal) but still they should be quite trivial.  Beyond that, if you shoot for 70 on the shaman and pick up tier one oow stuff along the way, you should easily be able to do stuff like, oh, RCoD nameds etc.  <br />
<br />
The gear and other stuff in NC is total crap but the rapid rune farming makes up for it to some degree.  Once you suck up all those 66-68's just move on out.  Nameds in RCoD drop some decent shaman items such as glowing stone of expulsion, tattered cloak of the fallen, earring of...something, etc etc plus lots of tier one no-drop pieces.  <br />
<br />
Just throwing out a couple comments here, I fully put up the disclaimer that I am mage ignorant :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First thing you need to do at lvl61 is get Leopard.  Toss Focus, Primal Essence (unless you get a Sleepers Key and get Primal Avatar or get Ancient Feral), and any other Dex buff you can onto your pet and watch your pets DPS go up by 150+DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faithtoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok ,I was hoping to hear that we could take some stuff in NC and RCoD ,this is great news!<br />
<br />
Yes it is a whole different aspect in the game ,she little still but I am enjoying the compliment to mage abilities already! Thank you guys for input  :)</div></div><hr />

There is a lot of good information about where to find / solo the nameds in NC.  Hope this helps for when you are ready to move that direction.<br />

<br />
Magician air pet +Turgurs = Phenominal Cosmic Power.  With Malosinia off Faithlesser, you can probably start NC really early.<br />
<br />
@others: I don't think he's really concerned about gear.  Once he's 65, he can take half a dozen friends to 15% his shaman into qvic for full Kanleku.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;Toss Focus, Primal Essence ..., and any other Dex buff&quot;<br />
<br />
Best way to buff dex is with Infusion of Spirit, Mortal Deftness, Talisman of Kragg and Primal Essence if you can find a copy.  134 less HP than focus, but 45 more dex with IoS+MD.  And Diaku will stack on top of all those when you get it for a total of 163 added dex.  Add VQ from a passing chanter for 196.</div></div><hr />

If you want to save time, get a smaller group of friends (about 2 groups to keep the killing fast) and come back for the 2 TVX's every 3 days... and take out blob 1 if its up as well.  This takes about 2 hours +/-.  during the few weeks, back in the day, that my guild did this to 41%haste up all the slacking melee, I saw many ancients rot.<br />
<br />
Sorry, not trying to make anyone sad about rotting ancient spells.  At least I haven't seen any ancient runes rot.... yet.</div></div><hr />
