<br />
Im checking to see if there would be intrest in a regular EXP group durring the week days any where between 4pm CST and 11pm CST.  would be preferable if you are 46+.  If you are interested, please post the days and times that would be best for you.  once i see if i have enough intrest, ill post back with a target zone and days/times that this will occur. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm always up for EXP but since I'm on-call all week you just have to catch me when I'm online - between 8 and 5 CST there's no telling when I'll have work to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm up for the exp grouping too Gallandro!  Just hesitant to sign up for regular exp group cause I like attending the spontaneous raids and scheduled events...  Aww heck, no use beating around the bush, dis troll jus has a fear of commitment and everyone knows dat we're irregular anyways from the lack of gnome in our diets.<br />
But I'm often looking for the exp groups, so like the Sscaley one said, give me a tell/guild say and more often than not I'll come bash some heads with you :)</div></div><hr />
