<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Delkain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wanted to stop in and say hi.  I'm really interested in joining your guild.  KoE is an awesome guild and I hope to be a part of it one day.  I've had the privalege of grouping with a few members already.  Hughhill and company too me down into PoJ Mauvin hall which was pretty cool.  I've only been to PoN and PoD so far trying to solo as a 54 druid, it was a nice change =)   Also joined you guys in Umbral Plains going after Doomshade, but unfortunately I was met with some isp trouble (Have to pay them every month I guess) so I did'nt get a chance to help out much.  Anyhow, I look foreward to keep on grouping, hopefully with all of ya.<br />
<br />
Also, I think i need a sponsor to join your guild right? I don't know anybody in KoE so if you think me worthy of joining after I group with ya I'd much appreciate it =D<br />
