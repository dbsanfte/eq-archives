<br />
2)  I heard from a friend that Orb in Infinite Void no longer drops, is this true as well?  And if it's still dropping, is the giant that drops it any tough?<br />

Thanks everyone  :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keldor Dek'Torek drops the Orb of the Infinite Void.  He used to drop it every time, guaranteed, but I have not killed him in many months.<br />

If you have non-kos people to do the killing, one good group can do it if you have a level 60 shaman or enchanter.  Ideal group is cleric, 60 shaman, 60 enchanter, tank, damage, FD'er.  I've done this kill with 4 people, all 60, with good equipment.  Back up in the quest mob hallway to the door by the back bank room, have someone go tag Keldor and run like hell out to middle of hall, and either FD or die.  Keldor comes with a NASTY rogue dude, after FD/death, let the rogue guy go home, Keldor usually stops to buff his friends.  Once the rogue guy returns to his room, tag Keldor and kill.  The quest mobs will not assist.  You need Malo, plus Tash if you have it, to slow Keldor.  He hits hard and fast until slowed, so your cleric needs to be on his toes (and you need a decent tank).  A single cleric can keep up with a decent tank, but will not have the mana for the entire fight unslowed.  Remember to /q out if you need to save your faction, and don't lose faction to KOS state back there, or you'll be slaughtered quick.<br />
<br />
If you are kos, you have a ton more work to do.  See invis mobs in the way, gotta fight thru the Tormax throne room.  You will need a good puller.  You will have fights that generally will need 2+ groups.  This becomes a raid if you are kos, and I've never even tried to do it.  Seen some people do it, though, and they  had 4+ groups.</div></div><hr />

Can always count on Crucible Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ive personally seen an ODS drop off 3 live Dar Knights and a Sebilite Golem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gronk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">confirming Keldor still drops the orb every time, at last he has the last 5 times I have killed him in the last two - three months.</div></div><hr />
