<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Below is my mageo. Please take a look. I've finally got my guild to recognize that shaman do indeed want/need thier epics. I'm third in line. All of us pretty much just need the tear We did the first shammy last week. Gonna do the next one hopefully next week so mine isnt too far off.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm at a quandry. As you can see im missing some important equipment upgrades. I need a solstace earring, need to upgrade my rings, maybe the other earring, and pants. Was thinking of Tae ew pants/shield.<br />
<br />
Here is the problem. I've got 7k to my name. I dont have Torpor/Malo/Pox. I have camped GW's alot and seem to get ever other classes 60 spells to drop.  Can never convince a guild rogue to go into seb with me. So it looks like i might just have to buy torpor.<br />
<br />
Do I save all my cash and buy torpor as fast as possible? (seems to run 65k to 75k on sol ro) or do I do some upgrades to bring myself up to par with my level and then do Torpor? Common sense would dictate I shoot straight through to Torpor but there is one slight hitch. Since I've concentrated on HP gear, my wis is kinda low. In a drawn out fight, or in an emergency situation I just dont have the mana pool I'd like. I dont want to sacrifice hp. So that means the slots that need upgrading are 5k to 10k or more a whack to keep the hp, and get gear with wis + saves.<br />
<br />
Either way I get more powerful so both arent bad. Just trying to figure out what would benefit me more the fastest.<br />
<br />
Also, Based on how rare the drops of spells are, its probably faster to farm cash than to camp malo/torpor? Also, I'm in a smallish guild. Getting to 65 and Q isnt an option for me. I plan to stay at 61 with this alt and farm aaexp.<br />

Suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seconds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First off as you said Epic, that will get your wis alittle higher.<br />
<br />
Get Pauldrons of witness for shoulder, you can purchase it or do a trial run.<br />
<br />
The thing that sticks out in my mind, is fungi get rid of it.. Being a vah shir shaman fungi was never really an option. Get a Polished tin mail.  28ac 10wis 25hp and 25mana think some sta on it too. Pretty cost efficent for the price.<br />
<br />
Get an eye of the griffon for range, 10wis 20hp.<br />
<br />
Help some people out on 8th shawl and try to get a tracking wolf collar (the guy is easily soloable if somebody fails, but splitting him requires a monk or 2 people)<br />
<br />
If you can sell fungi that would allow you to make other upgrades such as Earring of the solstice, hiero cloak/cloak of the wise.<br />
<br />
And if your on CoV faction look into the Talisman of Benevolence quest, and working your guild on the way towards Halls of Testing.<br />
<br />
I dont have torpor either, I dont think it is worth stripping off all your gear for it.  KM is a part of me, I love it.  But Quinesnce will kick it out of power.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I should probably just buy a polished tin shirt to see if I can get along without the fungi. The thing with teh fungi is that without epic, that extra 15 hp/tick translates to 7 more mana per tick.. which I use fer dotting.<br />
<br />
Although, the fungi would pay for 2/3 or 3/4 of a torpor if I could actually sell it :P<br />
<br />
Maybe tonight I'll buy a tin shirt and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seconds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just thought as I was looking through your magelo, the fungi is like 75% of your gear.  If you broke that down, distributed, and rounded out your gear I guarantee you will be running alot more effeicently.<br />
<br />
You said about pox, hell I dont have pox. I still use plague when I solo, and I dont think the SoE team thought they would have mobs that hit for 600 and have 26khp when they put plague into the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got lucky and won the fungi. The thing is though that it helped leveling SO much when i was younger (won it with my mage how was my main) that I'm kinda loathe to get rid of it. And it still is useful when i dotn have kei. Although with cani 5 I'm gonan want alot more hps instead.<br />
<br />
I'm defiantely gonna buy a tin shirt tonight and see how that goes.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, Shadel Bandit ring all the way. I got one for 3 K. <br />
Also, maybe look into getting Circled toe bones for the other hand. <br />
<br />
And as far as the Fungi goes, I've never had one, so I don't know how easy it is to get attached to them (although I can imagine they're very addictive). So bear that in mind when I say that you should go for the Tae ew tunic. As far as I'm concerned they're the best chest slot you can get that isn't No drop.<br />
<br />
Up to you at the end of the day, though, we all have different playing styles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Welp. I did it. I sold the fungi and replaced it with a polished tin. With repentishment at 61, I can feel  the difference of not having it on, but its not THAT big of a deal. I can live without it... and now I'm really close to outright buying torpor :P<br />
<br />
Also did 6 trials last night (failed each time :( ) But picked up a Silver hammered earring so it was worth it. After I get my torpor I'll gather a group and see if we can get some bandit rings to drop :P<br />
<br />
Anyone on Sol Ro wanna sell a Torpor for 50k? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh I just did the same thing.  Bought a polished Tin shirt. But I traded my fungi for Torpor + 10k. So I got my most sought after spell and upgraded a slot or 2. Two bad I couldnt have gotten Malo to lol. Gonna have to farm a bunch of HG's for that 1 I do believe. But once you get Torpor you probably wont even give that fungi a second thought.  I know I dont.</div></div><hr />

While I can't directly help with that, I can indirectly help.... keep an eye out for the research components (Yaeth 107 left, Words of Sapience, Words of Revenant, Yaeth 118 right) and if you don't have any 200 skill researchers, look me up if you are fortunate to dig them up. I have 200 skill and I do the combines free (assuming you catch me when I am not in the middle of a raid). 10 pp charge if you don't bring your own parchment and quill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well I am in the same boat so to speak.<br />
<br />
I was using Polished Tin Mail from mid 30s till just 2 days ago. I don't have any of our decent 58+ spells and have less than 5kpp in the bank so buying me spells is not an option.<br />
<br />
What I found very easy to do and significantly increase your AC/WIS with a decent amount of hp increase (about 80 to 90 more hp for me) is to get a partner or a couple of friends and camp CT entrance for Tae Ew blood.<br />
<br />
I did this for 5 days with a bit of soloing Windscorn in Dulak for Iskar blood and finally got my Tae Ew Tunic, Leggins and shield made in exchange for the 10 TAe Ew and 4 Iskar blood in trade to a nice GM smith.<br />
<br />
I was using polished tin mail, Velium Engraved greaves I think and SBS. This upgrade got me from low 940ish AC to over 1K AC (with rage buff) another 25+ wis and about 80 to 90 more hp as said earlier.<br />
<br />
So now I am looking to get rid of them darn loops and look for decent hp earrings :)<br />
<br />
So a very cheap way to improve your armor significantly with zero pp spent plus a so so aa exp gain, go camp CT entrance for a few days.<br />
<br />
PS please disregard this post if you happen to be on Trovo server. Thank you! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try it. <br />
<br />
I've seen that deal made quite often, even when torpor sells for much more.<br />
<br />
Join your servers auction channel, scream loudly, dance like a monkey... whatever it takes.</div></div><hr />

Heh thanks much.. I'm collecting components too.. but they arent the easiest things to find. :P</div></div><hr />
