<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spirithunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've always been the only shaman on raids until I joined a new guild that's just starting to become a hard core raiding guild.  Since we now have 2 lvl 65 shaman with pretty much equal abilities, what should the second shaman's duties be.  Last night the other shaman did all the slowing and I was really uncertain what I should be doing.  I tried dotting the mobs, but they were dying too quickly for the dot to be worth the mana, and with my best nuke only doing 671 pts of damage, it really didn't seem to be worth using with mages and wizzies doing way more dmg with their nukes. <br />
<br />
Any advice would really be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As 2nd shaman of equal level one I like the idea of having a primary debuffer and primary slower.  Primary debuffer loads malo and malos and keeps a slow up, slower loads turgurs, togors, and grummus.  This way you can get around the crappy recasts these spells have yet get mobs slowed as quickly as possible.  Main debuffer can back you up when he's done.  I've never been upset about someone doubling a slow.  On Boss mobs (depending on the boss) you may be relegated to patch healer for your Main Tank. And you can try to stick some dots on in between.<br />
<br />
This strategy has worked for me when I have consulted with the other shaman and chanters on the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What are you currently raiding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guild is usually having 4 - 6 shaman on, and everybody spams slow on incoming.  In elemental planes and time, you want a mob slowed &quot;right now&quot;, and with multiples coming in you can't always be mana concious and sort out who slows what.  And a wasted slow is much less resource waste then having to rez and rebuff.<br />
If you're just getting started with serious raiding, have a shaman channel, and agree on who does malos and who does the first slow.  Have the malos guy make a hotkey to your channel when he casts, and you know if you start turgurs a second or so later your slow will hit a debuffed mob.  Fast slow, but less chance of resist and shaman mush on the floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Now and again we have 3 shaman around. Usually, one does the short buffs (FA, Replen for rangers/necros/pets/etc) and patch heals, one does the slowing and backup debuffs, one does the debuffs and backup slowing. Any spare time/mana is used with nukes/rains/dots as appropriate. Our nukes do suck compared to others, but it all adds up and it's better than nothing. Very seldom will I see my Cann5 button up and full mana available without tossing a couple nukes in and caning it back - it's free mana, more efficient to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild is usually having 4 - 6 shaman on, and everybody spams slow on incoming.

<br />
I've tried assigning certain shamans to turgur's and certain shamans to malos before.  It never works, because one party will be not paying attention and the mob either won't get malos'd or it won't get slowed.  I've seen it work before, but I've also seen it fail so many times that I no longer trust any other shaman to handle debuffs.  I have always had better luck assigning different targets to be full debuffed by individual shamans.  You can just make a hotkey that does something like &quot;/3 Debuffing %T&quot; in to your shaman channel and then the other shamans can go debuff something else.<br />
<br />
Even that, though, doesn't get done fluidly.  Honestly we have just adopted a &quot;do whatever you want&quot; type strategy.  We usually have four shamans on a raid.  One (me) is paying attention about 95% of the time.  Two are paying attention about 50% of the time.  The fourth shaman is typically doing god knows what, usually meleeing (they died to enrage the other day /sigh).  We aren't exactly the most efficient shaman crew around, but, we usually get things slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Assign one to MR debuff (malo/s and Malosinia) and one to slows, for singles.<br />
<br />
For multiples, if you have add tanks assign a shaman to the add tank/s and one to the main mob.  Or go FFA.  Depends on how tough the mobs are and how many are inc.<br />
<br />
Cripple is also good, usually have the one who did not slow land Cripple to spread the aggro around.  Malicious Decay is useful to land disease-based DOTs if you're doing that.<br />
<br />
Straight cold nuking or, if conditions are right, AE rains are the best damage methods on a raid.  Generally you have lots of mana due to raid buffs so the efficiency difference is not so big.<br />
<br />
Also, we tend to assign shaman as group healers on our raids so the druids can nuke more.  Especially once you have Quiescence it's quite doable as long as you're not healing a MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We have 3-5 shaman on our raids generally:<br />
<br />
One shaman to each of malos, sini, cripple.  All shaman slow.  <br />
One shaman to each of sta, billy, focus.<br />
One shaman to each of tanks, rogues, rangers, monks (Ferine Avatar).<br />
<br />
Always stuff to do.  Nuke, Patch Heal, mid fight rebuff etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We do complete FFA in our guild. Max of 4-5 shamans and sometimes 1-2.  We have a shaman channel and if something gets slowed, you interrupt and move to something else.<br />
<br />
Mobs need to be slowed &quot;right now&quot; as someone mentioned above.  We had 3 shamans last night in Plane of Water.  Killed 4 bosses.  On at least one of them we all got 3 resists before the 4th wave of our attempts and one landed. When the second wave resists, I send a raid chat the shamans need help with slow.  With the potential for death on slows and multiple mobs in camp. There just isn't time.  <br />
<br />
Being the only Shaman in the guild for 75% of raids or more for about 6 months we adopted the &quot;You are the only shaman here&quot; philosophy.  We have no egos.  We all act like we're the only shaman and if someone gets something slowed, we interrupt or know not to slow that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On boss mobs: One shaman casts malos, the other shamans spam turgur / malosinia till boss is slowed. After debuff / slow I tend do be healer for my group / patch healer for MT or rampage tanks. Rarly I have time to do damage. Sigh.<br />
<br />
On trash mobs you could try to assign 1st shaman to assist MT for debuff / slow, 2nd shaman assists ST and 3rd shaman assists TT (works great when you have multiple mobs inc like PoE, VT, PoTac...).<br />
<br />
Depending how often your guildmates one shaman on pure buffing duity for the rezzed might be a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My former guild was elemental.  We usually had 2-3 shaman per raid, and honestly, it was FCFS on the debuffs.  It has to be that way, in elemental.  You need it slowed and debuffed, and you need it done NOW.  <br />
<br />
My current guild is working on Tier 2 &amp; 3 bosses, and the average raid (which I occassionaly attend &gt;=P) has about 6-8 shaman on it.  It's a shaman festival!  A lot of times they assign who does what.  I usually end up nuking! (Crit nukes3 + Ornate Sceptre = Shaman/wizard wannabee!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On anything that has a fair chance of resists, I like to have all shaman hitting slow and malosini(a), you want it to land asap on any significant mob.<br />
<br />
Having one shaman assigned to malo(s) on inc and then switch to slow/cripple works well for singles, and for multiples assigning shaman to a specific tank makes good sense to avoid mass confusion. By starting with malo(s) they're normally one slow behind the rest so have a bit less aggro, making em good for crippling duties. On very resistant mobs care is obviously still needed.<br />
<br />
Split buffs up equally, sta/focus and maybe tali of tribunal in some cases can be split between 3 mgb 65 shaman with ease. If you don't all have the same spells and AA then share it out as appropriate.<br />
<br />
Shorter buffs like FA are more of a pain, either do it by groups or by classes. Regen I normally leave to druids :D<br />
<br />
Once the mob is debuffed and any buffs needing refreshes are sorted, you'll either be helping out healing (e.g. stick quiessence on rampage tank and chain casts tnargs, let the druids have fun nuking) or you'll be doing whatever dps you can muster. I'd guess the new bane is good in many situations (no poison counters for aggro, yey!) though I don't have it myself. I tend to stick to rains and nukes, its situational as to which is better. Stuff with lots of hp gets the standard DoTs; just take care with aggro from BoS and BoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My guild has two very active shaman, and one not quite as active shaman.<br />
<br />
Usually, the two of us just figure out who maloses and who slows, then do that for the raid.  Crip/decay/grum is called when needed.  Then, depending on how many clerics/druid we have, one of us is often healer for a group (without the MA/SA in it  :p ).  Pretty much the same thing if we have all 3 shaman on.<br />
<br />
Buffs:  Since I don't have MGB, Hen usually MGBs focus, and I get sta, acumen, billy, regen, and if needed, trib, but that's only if there's 3 groups or more.  If it's just two groups, each of us buffs one group fully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We're just entering elementals now, and generally have 4-6 shamans per raid, sometimes more, very occasionally less, and just do a FFA type thing.  That's usually cut down by some shamans ending up on cleric-type duty for a group.<br />
<br />
Assuming I'm not on healer duty, I usually start with Malos, if someone's doing that (we all call it) I'll slow.  If that's being covered all the time, I'll nuke.<br />
<br />
Or sometimes we have a half dozen shamans on and I'll feel goofy.  I raised 1HB to 185 on Agnarr last night.  heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spirithunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the great information ya'll!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We're elemental as well and go with the call a mob and get it debuffed tactic.  On nameds we split up debuffs (one malos, another sinia, one slow and if he resists everyone else tries).  We vary between 1-4 shamans nightly.  When we're not doing that, we either spotheal, throw FA randomly on people swinging, stuff like that.<br />
<br />
On General Reparm the other day we even had a 4 shaman CH chain on the main tank (completely independant of whatever the clerics/druids set up), and we take full credit for him living.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm assist healing is also something that can be done helps a tonne on some mobs and especially since Tnargs is so fast casting. The biggest difficulty I found on raids is FA, you try to get them to send tells for FA, noone does. So you have to try keep remembering who to FA. Its not bad when your group is structured with a few dps. Just curious how others carry on about FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Debuffing, slowing, patch-healing and ofcourse buffing is what i do. We split the tasks between the shamans on the raid.<br />
<br />
If we are like 3-4 active shamans i usually hang back and relax a bit until things get interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/assist mob_x healing is often most useful.  Keep it mind on some raids.  Really tho, it all depends on the raid as to what your duties as a shaman entail.  Usually I'm healing AE, spamming Tnargs on a MA (specially during tank switches), Nuking a little, DoTing a little, and buffing a lot.  Oh, and slowing sometimes too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mspeedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have a simple but effective FA tracking system.<br />
<br />
It requires a pencil (or pen) lined piece of paper and a post-it tape flag.<br />
<br />
I write folks name down on the lined piece of paper I'm faing.  I have a small red post-it Tape Flag (small red marker basically).  When FA pops:<br />
  /tar ubber_meele_name<br />
  /cast 4 (FA)<br />
  after its started to cast and not fizzled move tab.<br />
Rinse repeat.<br />
<br />
I taped a stick note with the numbers 1-6 going down the left side to my desk.  I use if I'm just doing my group.<br />
<br />
Not fancy, but it works.  Its too easy to forget who you are responsible for, and who you cast it on last.... or maybe I'm just too old and forgetful.<br />

Its not bad when your group is structured with a few dps. Just curious how others carry on about FA.<br />
<br />
I keep FA memmed but I usually don't worry about it when we are clearing.  There is really only one person in the guild (a rogue) who asks me for FA on a regular basis.  Sometimes, before boss fights, I will get a few tells for it and I try to distribute it as asked.  Also, if I remember, before boss fights I just start casting FA on our DPSers I know don't have primal.  We have lots and lots of melees that joined the guild well after we were done with ST, and have great gear, but never had the chance to pick up a primal.  FA helps them the most, so I try and hit them.  For a while we tried to keep established FA loops going where all the shamans were hitting 4 people, but we lost interest in that pretty fast.<br />
<br />
The best way to do it is, as someone already said, get a piece of paper and write down who is on your FA list, then do something to keep track of whose turn it is.  I have a lot of trouble commiting a list like that to memory and then remembering to cast FA and whose turn it is, especially while doing 4 or 5 other things.  Easiest way for me to do it (since I'm way too lazy to actually write something down) is to have a bunch of melees in my group.  If I can visually see the list (i.e. group window), I can usually remember whose turn it is, but I have trouble remembering otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I am in a Time Level Guild from Rallos Zek and we have a cool, family type shaman crew of average 4-5 shamans on a Raid.<br />
<br />
We have a  debuff channel, where everyone calls the slowed, malos,crippled etc messages. shared with Mages, Bards and Encs.<br />
As well we do have a shaman only channel where we communicate with each other and whatnot :p Can get dirrty sometimes, mwuahah :p<br />
<br />
Split the duties is my advice. We assign on big bosses who does MALOS. who sinia and who slow.<br />
If we have 4+ shamans we assign one fast healer as well with Tnargs to make the Tanks die less:p Believe me or net but 2 shamans spamming Tnargs can make a lot of difference, Elemental/time lvl at least:)<br />
<br />
What you can consider as well is a buff sharing. We do sometimes give out info in the raid channels which shaman is doing what buff. I.e. X is doing fo7, y doing sta, z the rest.<br />
That way you can save some spell slots and after a while ppl get used to..<br />
<br />
If you have spare mana..and you should definitely have... get a cold dd focus and a spell haste and nuke away. With SCF 3 I and an umbracite Hoop I get 2083 crits. yay wannabee wiz:) Heal the MT with asessions of spammed Tnargs, DD, debuff. I find it extremly annoying to have less than 3 shamans on a Raid. Buffign/debuffing/healiing is so much faster and enjoyable with 3-4 shamans. Hell we even have 7 shamans online, all good friends, cant be more fun.! <br />
This just as a sidenote for ppl who always say (said) that shamans don't stack at Raids and 1 is enough. Velious maybe yes, but nowadays I do not think so:)<br />
<br />
Hope these infos help ya out some:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Since we now have 2 lvl 65 shaman with pretty much equal abilities, what should the second shaman's duties be.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
with my best nuke only doing 671 pts of damage<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, the *first* thing I would do if I were you, to help myself out, is to get all of my spells because you are clearly lacking some if that is your best nuke.<br />
<br />
When my guild raids there are usually between 2 and 7 shammies there 63-65. Makes buffing go by fast. Makes debuffing go by fast. One malos, one malosinia, one slower. Then dps/heal assist. Even have one shammy who gets a kick out of being in ch chains.<br />
<br />
If you can't find something to do other than slow you really need to learn more about your class.</div></div><hr />
