<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same. Vindi still has better stats plus an effect.<br />
We have seen a few of these drop and mostly they have been going to make rogue bp's. The rogue bp's at least have 100 hps.<br />
<br />
I am curious though, anyone know what this looks like? I have not seen any descriptions for our armor. Wondering what our new &quot;look&quot; is suppose to be.</div></div><hr />

The ranger bp isn't that bad either, actually. like 100hp 80mana 50ac 8-10 to the important stats ... it's honestly not that bad, compared to some of the other classes's stuff.</div></div><hr />

So won't there be a smithing check here? So only 250 smiths will be able to make and wear this armour? (since it is no-drop?)</div></div><hr />

All the various parts for the final combine are tradeable, the final combine is no-fail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I could get/buy/find all of the parts and then combine them with a smithing skill of 1 and have no chance for failure?  Or it is no-fail if you have a 250 skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You could get all of the pieces and do a combine no fail with no skill at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The patterns themselves are No-Drop though correct?<br />
<br />
I gather the idea is that you loot the pattern, bribe the Dorf, pay a local smith for rings and then do the no-fail combine to get your armor.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to double check but I don't recall the patterns<br />
being no-drop.</div></div><hr />

Heya, sort of off topic, but where do you live Atarak?  I use RCN too.  Wonder if you're like...my neighbor or something :p <br />

I find that picture interesting.  Well, other than the obvious reason.  If you go into the directory, the most of the rest of the files are pictures and movies of politicians.</div></div><hr />

Within 50 miles of my office in the Trooper, PA facility :)<br />

That being said, I don't actually use RCN for my internet access because we don't serve the area I live in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The rings are made by a gm smith trivial &gt;246 confirmed so far so probably &gt;250 skill.  They can be bought from a smith I do not expect them to be cheap.  The emblem is bought from the quest giver for 500p.  The combines for the tempers (brewing) and the rings are skill restricted.  You cannot even attempt them until you are &gt;220 skill adjusted (meaning you can use a geerlock or other skill % device to get your skill above 220)  The rings wont be cheap and the patterns are rare drops.  It wont be like everyone is running out and getting this stuff tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Not being 60 yet I feel compelled to ask,  <br />
<br />
Can I wear this at 51 with stat loss or do you have to be 60 to equip it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Patterns aren't no drop. So yes, you could buy your way into this armor. Wouldn't even require a multiquest like ToV armor does.<br />
<br />
Just buy a pattern and the necessary rings and perform the no-fail combine on your own for final piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Catty, yes, you could wear, but stats will be lower.<br />
<br />
They'll show you what stats you're actually getting and beside that number in parenthesis, you'll see what stats you will get at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">arent the patterns the 1s that drop from pop boss's like the dragon in poi . . . ?<br />
<br />
ediy : bah nm i finally found the thread i was looking for to answer my question <br />
<br />
&quot;As you progress deeper into the planes, ye will find many molds an' patterns with which t'base a set o'armor.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well, statwise.. the crafted bp is about 1.5 times as good as the vindi bp, taking into account AC/hp/mana/wis/resists/aob.  It's a question of whether you want to trade off 2 hp/tick for the stats.  Personally I'd take the stats over the aob.  I have a new regen that'll get me those extra 20hps/minute without an eyeblink :)<br />
<br />
Mind you, your gear should be pretty good by the time you get to Tier 3 encounters... this bp might be trivial for you when the mold for it drops.  That would just figure, wouldn't it *grin*<br />

<br />
<br />
I guess it depends on the situation and your other gear. The vindi bp has 5 more hps 4 more sta and more resists. With the other bp you gain the 13 wis and 85 mana. Personally since I'm already capped on my wisdom even at 65 the wis means little to me and with over 4k mana the mana doesn't mean much either so I'll go with the hps, resists and regen of a little bit of ac.<br />
<br />
Still a nice peice tho. I look forward to see what the one made with the fiery mold ends up like.</div></div><hr />
