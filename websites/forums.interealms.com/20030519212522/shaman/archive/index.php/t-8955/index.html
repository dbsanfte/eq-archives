<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm pleveling a warrior twink in nurga/droga, and gotten her from 27 to 35 so far. The problem? I'm still threateningly to the goblin traitor.<br />
<br />
I've been told getting out of &quot;scowling&quot; is the worst bit, is that still true? Am I halfway? Or have I not made a dent?<br />
<br />
Also, when she gets to be 40, would she gain enough xp from me mass slaughtering the gobbies to make it worthwhile? Or should I continue to hand feed her goblins two at a time?<br />
<br />
What's the best way to slaughter these annoying casters en masse? Dogdog + ae slow? AE poison? any idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I haven't been doing the PL part of it yet, i have been faction farming Droga up alot lately. My tactics are to just JBB pull next root sick dog keeping us both buffed up fully, i then grab next and park near dog, if i get a few i root as many as i can or just position myself and use Torrent of poison. I don't use slow, they really don't hit hard enough to warrant that.<br />
<br />
a JBB shot takes 14-24% of their hps off depending on the gob, but dogdog chews threw them fast enough for me.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much Sarnak killing you did getting out of scowling is the hard part, the next big jump is amiable i believe. But that is still alot smaller then the jump out of scowling.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the exp but around chief some of the mobs were still lt. blue to me at 55, so going deeper in might still prove to be good exp.<br />
<br />
Hope i helped.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This one is a bit more accurate and up to date. It is from the Safehouse. Keep in mind max kos to max ally is about 4000 faction hits.<br />
<br />
<br />
-2000 to -801, scowls at you, ready to attack<br />
-800 to -501, views you threateningly<br />
-500 to -101, scowls at you dubiously<br />
-100 to -1, is apprehensive<br />
0 to 99, is indifferent<br />
100 to 499, is amiable<br />
500 to 699, kindly considers you<br />
700 to 1099, views you warmly<br />
1100 to 2000, you are an ally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It was late and I was bored:<br />
<br />
1 backpack full of gobby skins will net you 480 faction hits<br />
1 backpack full of salts will net you 240 faction hits<br />
<br />
So if you're keeping score and somehow you managed to scrape all this together and are still kos (not likely), you will need approx<br />
8 backpacks full of green goblin skin OR 16 packs of salts ... good luck!<br />

Well, she's only 36 1/2, I still have time.</div></div><hr />
