<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone here who has played Baldurs Gate 2 (or AD&amp;D for that matter) surely remembers the spell sequencer line.<br />
<br />
This allowed magic users to cast a few spells, but save their effect for later.<br />
<br />
Imagine you cast malos, slow and a dot, and then place them into a sequencer ready to be activated when you need it (ie pull), and poof, you have a mob slowed, malosed and dotted 5 seconds after pull.<br />
<br />
This would solve our problems with the shaman class being dependant on long fights to work to full potential (ie debuffing slowing and dotting takes a while, especially if you want the dots to do full damage).<br />
<br />
Not to make this overpowering there should be somewhat of a re-use time comparable to say Can-5. You can make a regular slow/debuff on some mobs, but put up a sequencer now and then to really contribute to DPS while retaining you slow/debuff role.<br />
<br />
This could also be used in conjunction with healing spells. Storing a Quiesence and a blast heal would give us a sort of micro lay-hands ability.<br />
<br />
If this was an AA, maybe Quickbuff 3 should be the prequisite...?<br />
<br />
How does it sound?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm...interesting idea Vigdis.<br />
<br />
Every level would allow you to &quot;queue&quot; one more spell.  Level 1(3)-1 spell  Level 3(6) - 2 spells  Level 3(9) - 3 spells<br />
<br />
Aye..QB3 a prereq.<br />
<br />
Would certainly make things more interesting in some ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This would not offer that much utility for most groupage - there is little down time between pulls to cast the spells for stacking.<br />
<br />
I suppose you could set up macros to load these...<br />
<br />
If we could load it with spells we don't have on gems (or on gems anymore) there are some real possiblilities...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Breach, Lower Resist and Lower Resist for me.  ( i think those are the right names, it's been a while since i soloed BG2 w a wizzy).<br />
<br />
Edit:  <br />
<br />
suppose i should add something useful to this post.<br />
<br />
I think it's an interesting idea.  Though for EQ i don't think that it's reasonalbe to get say 3 insta cast spells, or close to it like BG2 does.  It might be possible to say, cast the spells, and then to release them, that cast time would be 50% of the total cast times, and all 3 spells would go off in the order they were originally cast.<br />
<br />
So say you stored Malos (5.0), Slow(3.0) and MD(~2.0) this would make the total 10 secs of cast time, so the sequester would take 5 secs to cast, but this could be modifyed by spell haste... Don't know about feasability, but definately an interesting idea.</div></div><hr />

I'm not certain I understand your model...  ( I don't know anything about Baldurs Gate 2) From what you stated it sounded like you casted malos, slow and dot and stored the effects....then at your choosing you released the effects so that all three effects happen simultaneously. That sounds pretty difficult to implement but would make life much more interesting....  Of course, the problem is it can be exploited and SOE will  use that as a basis for not implementing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wonderful idea, however it sounds like an entirely too convenient ability for Shaman to be blessed with as it would decrease in the spamming of spell keys as soon as the gems pop :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you pay for mana before the fight, but recieve the spells as instacast spells set to go off at once. Once you have them stored you can release them whenever you like.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of things you could balance this with like initial mana cost and reuse time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The way it was implemented in BG2, it is a 1 shot deal.  You would spend the mana/cast the spell, to charge the ability.  And then at some later date you use the ability to release the spells, and then you need to recharge it.  So in essence, it's actually a bit more spamming, though you hit keys when you want to prep for the mob, as opposed to when time is crucial in combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That sounds like a wonderful idea, but you just know if we get anything like this, clerics are gonna want it, too.<br />
<br />
To avoid exploitation it may need some form of limitations put in (ie, exclude CH or spells with cast times longer than 6.5 seconds), or to be hardcoded to cast specific spells, based on class.<br />
1- Malos<br />
2- Malos, Slow<br />
3- Malos, Slow, DoT<br />
<br />
It couldn't quite be instant, but it could be 1-sec casts for each, basically to make sure that Malos lands before slow and the DoT do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That's one of the best ideas I've seen in a very long time.  The only problem I see complicating it is how resists, mitigation, interrupts and fizzles will be handled.<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sorry, but having an ability to save us a few seconds every few minutes isn't going to help balance our class.  Especially considering they aren't going to do all this work on how spells work just to give it to only shaman.</div></div><hr />

I am only 49 but if we stored all those spells and &quot;released&quot; at the same time wouldn't the agro hit the creature at once.<br />
<br />
And depending on the creature wouldn't it turn out like this...<br />
<br />
So and So begins to cast their sequence...<br />
<br />
Target feels uncomfortable.<br />
Target yawns.<br />
Target takes damge from dot.<br />
<br />
Target is glued to shaman.<br />
LOADING...PLEASE WAIT...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh the thing that jumps out at me is that folks would bitch on PvP teams about it.<br />
<br />
Wiz loads up Strike of Solusek, Ice Meteor, Drought of (what ever you choose) and it's instagank all over again.<br />
<br />
Rangers are going to want to be able to &quot;load up&quot; arrows and Rogues will want to....hrm... well they cant load up anything but still I see problems :)<br />
<br />
Interresting Idea though.</div></div><hr />
