<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">According to my deductions turns <br />
Tnarg's from a 1,300 heal to a 1,560 - mana cost 450 and a 3.75 cast.<br />
<br />
Does that mean you bag Kragg's,  which the focus effect doesn't effect?  1,950 max heal for 400 mana and a 10 second cast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its a random %<br />
so anywhere from 1300 to whatever<br />
<br />
ya feel safe to delete the 10 sec one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was able to complete all healing aa's and have a decent hi iv mask.  Can hit over 1800 with a good percentage roll - also the potential to crit.  I will take my chances everytime on Tnargs makin a crit.  I don't think I will ever mem kraggs again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tnargs + aa's + focus &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than krags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haven't memmed kraggs since I was 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kraggs is the most useless spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tnag's = ~4sec cast<br />
Kragg's=  10sec cast<br />
<br />
if you can do the math thats 2 times the healing for about the exact same amount of time.  With the added bonus its in two shots that if one gets interupted your not out 5-10sec of cast time on a critical heal.  Have always found that stinky Krag's pretty useless.  At least with Tnags I have pretty good chance of channeling it in meele where Kragg's in near impossible.  Granted two casts of Tnag's is more mana but when has mana really been a problem once we have Canni 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I rarely used Kraggs after I got Tnargs at 62 without any healing AA or Improved Healing items.  Once you get IH4, some AA and Q you won't ever need to mem Kraggs again.  Kraggs just doesn't heal enough for the 10 second cast time and you could be doing a lot more in the ~6.2 seconds you saved by casting Tnargs everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, Kragg's is quite an appalling spell... Now if it didn't count as a CH spell, then i just might use it. Then it would be affected by Haste of Mithaniel and IH4...<br />
<br />
Nah, it's still crap.<br />
<br />
Feel free to delete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My Tnarg's crits, casts faster and soon has the chance of almost healing for more than Kragg's because it can be influenced by AA and focus item.  Kraggs sucks, I should delete it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can't remember last I used kraggs.. just sitting there 10s annoys the crap out of me..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I vote that Kraggs is garbage as well. I think I used it like oh, 10 times ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Haven't memmed kraggs since I was 62.<br />
<br />
Ditto. I stopped using Kragg's Mending even before I had IH4 and AA healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dump Kraggs.  There is no reason to ever mem it again if you have IH IV.  Put some aa's into healing and it becomes even more worthless than our charm animal buff.</div></div><hr />
