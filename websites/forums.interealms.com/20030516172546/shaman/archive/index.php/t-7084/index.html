I know what the rules say about signatures, esp. their sizes, but it beats me how I can look at a sig 250 by 250 stay on threads and new posts for 3 months without getting hit by the bat, and then change my own to 150 height, and get hit after a week :p<br />
<br />
Anyhoot, I just want 150 height so that I dont have to use a small version of my usual sig :p Any chance you can review the size requirements to allow 150 pixel height on pictures? <br />
<br />
Just inquiring, wont throw a fit if not, but seems to me that a lot of people have somewhat bigger sigs that the requirements, myself included of course :p<br />
<br />
Good board, even though I miss Sam and Eduin :p</div></div><hr />
