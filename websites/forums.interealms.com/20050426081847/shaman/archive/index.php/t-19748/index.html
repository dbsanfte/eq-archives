<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">over the last couple of server ups/downs i've taken a few friends to kill him to support gambling habits and such, and i've done it duo before but i was curious if anyone has tried it solo?  his melee is pretty gimp but i have noticed i don't land slow without sinia + tash proc on, which can sometimes take some time to do.  has anyone tried/done this?  <br />
<br />
was thinking perhaps open with spiritcall and let the pets rage while debuffing to buy some time to get him slowed, once slowed i really don't think it would be a challenge just let dogdog work his long slow magic and perhaps melee w/ a dd proc weapon as most of our good dots have little ease landing &gt;&lt;.  <br />
<br />
any ideas?  think this would be doable?  i mean from the last 2 kills i would think it would be worth the time to get a mule camped down there to track his spawns, seeing as how the last 2 kills yielded 2 Cowls, 2 hearts, 2 droppable st key talismans, 1 mds, and an assortment of other no drop junk + spells.  that's at least 500k+ in stuffs on my server so well worth the effort if possible.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are four problems:<br />
<br />
1) Opening with spirit call would be good, it would give you time to get malos in without worrying about interrupts.  The problem is that one bounced slow outaggros spirit call, so then you've got zlandicar in your face and you have to try to channel slow and heals at the same time.<br />
<br />
2) He's a resistant bastard.  I have always had trouble slowing him with tash, malos, and hos all in.  You would have to have extreme luck to land turgur's.  Odds you'd have an unlucky string of tnarg interrupts and die before you succeeded in slowing him.<br />
<br />
3) Bane is going to land just as often as turgur's, severely crippling your ability to do damage to him.  I am also unsure how well poison lands on him, but I don't think it is good.  This means the fight is going to take a very long time.  I remember it taking a whole raid of sub-ST geared people a few minutes to kill him, so I shudder to think how long it is going to take a dogdog to kill him.  This brings me to my fourth point.<br />
<br />
4) Your pet isn't going to resist the AE.  I don't remember exactly how bad the dot is, but if you have to be constantly healing yourself and your dogdog, you are most likely going to be going out of mana before zlandi goes out of health.<br />
<br />
Basically, though, I think that if you can land slow you might be able to do it.  It will be a hard fight, but I think you would come out on top.  However, your odds of landing slow are pretty bleak.  My advice?  Get one of your guild paladin's log in info, duo zland, and don't share the loot =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">strangely enough on all the last few zlands my pet has completely survived the aes.  and i really don't think i can do any kind of dots at all.  i think if i were to try this, the idea would be to debuff (not even try turgurs until malos tash proc and then malosinia had landed.   once slowed, let the pet do all the damage he could (assuming he's buffed and have another buffed pet suspended), and equip a weapon like sharkspine club or hammer of hours and use proc melee + pet damage to kill him, devoting mana to keeping yourself and the pet alive.  it would take awhile but with how annoyingly MR and DR/PR he is, i don't think any of our dots are an efficient way of killing him.  was thinking melee procs + pet damage + velium strike as dmg mainly, with the rest of mana being devoted to keeping myself alive.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I remember right(too lazy atm to look up zland) his AE is disease based. Most dragons that cast AEs with a base of a certain resist are completely immune to that resist. IE gorenaire immune to cold, talendor immune to fire, trak immune to poison, and sev immune to poison.<br />
This would make zland immune to disease, if my logic is right. Since sharkspine proc is a disease based proc(even -300 resist) I wouldn't trust it to good dmg to zland. And, of course, all dragons are fairly resistant to all spells.. that's their nature.<br />
<br />
Something more to remember when trying him. He does a proc that I believe is major DD. I got hit by him a few times(recently), and his proc rate was just uber. He didn't kill me, but I think he did about 2.5k dmg in under a second. I also can't remember, but I think he rampages. It'd be a fun thing to attempt, no matter if you win or lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe if you had the new slow spell with its modifier +tash+maloX, and see if that gimps his melee enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,Maybe if you had the new slow spell with its modifier +tash+maloX, and see if that gimps his melee enough.<br />
Would be interesting to try w/ the new slow (if I ever see it).<br />
<br />
I tried Klandicar last night.  Once solo that ended VERY fast after 3 slow resists.  Second time was duo with a well geared paladin, and I still couldn't get Turgur's to land.  Died again.<br />
<br />
We didn't go about it in the best possible way, but after what I saw last night I don't think it is possible solo.<br />
<br />
If someone else wants to try, I'd be happy to be proven wrong.  I'd be willing to try again though with full outside buffs. :cool: <br />
<br />
Next time I get the opportunity (not often I see him up uncontested for long), I would Malos and zone to DN.  Malicious Decay &amp; Malosinia and then zone to DN.  Tash stick and then zone to DN (getting the picture  :D ).  Then keep going back for slowing (alternating Grummus/Turgurs) &amp; zoning until it lands.<br />
<br />
My impression is Klandicar is practically unslowable using Turgur's w/o outside debuffing.  This would be a very good challenge for someone lookng for a neat solo feat.  Best of luck to any others who try. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Its more or less worthless.  HERE (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=1331) is a discussion I had with Verdandi a couple years ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i meant use Hammer of Hours or Sharkspine Club after click slowing (Sharkspine is elemental btw), for damage purposes.  not sure of the resist rates on either, as i don't have either at the moment, though.  Zland's proc would be worth looking up, i just remember the last kill duo with my friend he took like no damage at all once slowed heh.  depending on how easy it is to land the new slow perhaps this would be doable?  input more than welcome :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wuoshi I meleed with staff of eternal flames and rabid bear as I could not use any other spells. But I had a druid partner I doubt I could have kept up with the self heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dont' think that it's possible.  Even being in almost complete time gear, I've done him before and if I get anywhere close to him (which I had to do to be able to slow him) he puts a beating on you.  Even fully slowed he still brings out the pain.  We did him the other day with a cleric/chanter/shaman and even that was pushing our luck.  at the end we had klandi up on him hill.. and three adds on us, but we did win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ive been browsing around the forums lately (Im pretty much retired now) and my brother has now been using my character.  I saw this and was very much interested as i still do like my character.  Would a 125 AA partially elemental geared monk, 25 AA cleric, 9 AA shaman, and 50ish AA ranger (all 65, not particularly stunning equipment on any of them) be able to do Zlandicar? if so please let me know, and who did you duo Zlandicar with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think ignoring all other issues that his Hitpoints are just to many to kill him solo with a shaman. even if you use click dmg like elemental legs and spear etc.</div></div><hr />
