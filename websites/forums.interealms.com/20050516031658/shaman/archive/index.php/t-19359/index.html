<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As the GoD expansion grows ever closer, I find myself growing increasingly disgusted by both the poor quality of the upgrades being provided by the expansion and by the lack of any sort of acknowledgement from the developers that they have indeed heard our voice.  I fear, this is at least partially our fault, and partially the fault of our class's design.<br />
<br />
It has been shown, time and again, that the only way to get the development team to take seriously our issues is to present a single, unified community voice.  I applaud the efforts of the crucible to do just that.  Your efforts to present just such a voice are admirable and are by far the best such attempt that the shaman community will ever manage.<br />
<br />
However, there are far too many other posts, with people expressing contradictory opinions and even the opinion of some members of our class that there is nothing wrong and we don't need anything at all.  It would seem that it is impossible for the shaman community to express a truly unified, single voice with any consistency.  Which, of course, begs the question of why.  That, though, is the one question that we can authoritatively answer.  We cannot agree on a single point of view because we all play our shamans differently.  That is the blessing and the curse of the shaman class:  we are too damn versatile.  As a class we've been given such a widely varied bag of tricks that we can do nearly anything, unfortunately just not as well as someone else can.  This versatility is why we can never agree and it is why we will likely never have our concerns addressed.  <br />
<br />
I have been playing a shaman for a good while now, and I love my shaman.  I will continue to love playing my shaman for as long as there is an Everquest to play in.  However, this class has entered it's twilight time, and it is only a matter of time before we are supplanted fully by our competition.  We heal as well as paladins, but can't tank.  We slow better then anyone else, but not by enough to notice and as such we are passed over for our competitors (BL/Chanters).  We can buff stats better then anyone else, but it is pointless because stats have so little impact and a growing majority of players are at or near max in their crucial stats.  We can buff hp, but only as well as some hybrids.  <br />
<br />
Overall, we're good at a lot of stuff, but we just can't bring enough of an advantage to a group to be a first choice class for most situations.  Well, at least we can solo..but wait, we can't even do that as well some other classes can.<br />
<br />
When I created my shaman, I had a vision of what I thought I'd be.  I was going to be a battle priest, wrapped in the power of the spirits and smiting my enemies.  I was young, I was naive.  I'd never even heard of slow, let alone knew the power and significance of those spells.  I'd never heard of canni, nor known the speed with which I could regain mana.  My vision was of a warrior priest, a being to be feared on the field of battle for the might of his arm and the power of his magic.. but that vision faded.  My vision was replaced by the reality of the shaman..and that was a good reality for a while.  We were gods among men with the abilities we had at our disposal.  But time has passed, and our powers have not grown, nor have they lessened.  Other classes, and even the creatures in the world around us have increased in power in leaps and bounds, leaving us well behind them in power.  The shining power that drew so many to the shaman class has faded, dulled by time and neglect.<br />
<br />
I love my shaman.  This class will always be the first one that I ever fell completely in love with.  But like most first loves, time passes and things change.  Perhaps it's time for this shaman to look for something else...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For years, I thrived on the knowledge that my skills were necessary to my group.  That I provided something that nobody else could do as well.  For some of us, the ability to care for, protect, and augment our friends in battle ... well, that was all that I asked.<br />
<br />
EQ has become a quick-DPS world.  The shaman is antiquated.  My beastlord is of so much more benefit to a group than my shaman (even 6 levels less and 180AA behind)....  Part of my problem is just the way I'm entranced with the concept of the &quot;well-oiled machine&quot;.  Every part doing what it can to the best of its ability - ending in an amazing result.<br />
<br />
Maybe it IS time to give it up.  It's so hard to put my finger on what's changed, but it's just so rarely FUN anymore.  I wish I knew exactly what it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anything can grow tedious given enough time and overuse...so you often see people switching classes in MMORPGs.  Once I get burnt on a MMORPG I often find myself developing multiple characters and switching between them frequently.<br />
<br />
I haven't reached that stage in my 2nd EQ life because I've only been at it for a few months, I have much to see/do, and I have a lot of room to develop my shaman.  I have alts, but they might not see action for weeks at a time.<br />
<br />
I enjoy the shaman class, get groups easily, and often get compliments for the way I play my class.  So, I still enjoy it quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I also haven't exhausted the current content of EQ by any means since between my 1st and current runs at EQ I missed most of the expansions.  I can see how folks that have lived through them all and indulged in each one as it came out could be burnt.  It seems hard to believe that any one player could do all the content available in EQ...but some folks apparently have done it.<br />
<br />
I don't expect that much from any given expansion (GoD) because anything good it adds will just enhance something that I already enjoy.  If you're not enjoying EQ it's very unlikely that any given expansion is going to change that.</div></div><hr />
