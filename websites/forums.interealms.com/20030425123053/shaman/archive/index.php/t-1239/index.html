<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bhoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">anyone go over 180 Alchemy or is that tops thus far? I hit 180, am now broke as hell, and was wonderin if 180 is cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Until you get to level 61.<br />

Alchemy is hard capped at (lvl-24) * 5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With a philosophers stone you can supposedly go to skill 198.  I still am trying to obtain one and see if this is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the philosopher's stone gives you an alchemy skill modification so that you effectively operate at a higher skill level. It doesnt actually allow you to increase your ranks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bannek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can anyone tell me the point here? I mean come on all anyone ever wants is sow potions anyway so why did we just spend all that time and plat on a bunch of worthless potion no one will ever buy???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use to want to be able to make the gate potions, but figured it is easier in the long run to buy a 2nd account and level up a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why bother?  Because many of the potions are useful and/or fun.  Alchemy is not for everyone ? it requires extreme patience, a sense of humor, and a willingness to dump large amounts of plat and time down a black hole.  For example ? rather than sell the grow potions I use to raise me skills to the merchant for the pennies on the dollar they offer, I carry the around and offer them to people as &quot;A cure for what ails you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have an 180 skill in Alchemy and have found it to be fairly useful.  It is not, however, a viable trade skill.  Meaning, I do not think you can finance it through potion sales.  And it certainly will not make you rich.<br />
<br />
I generally adventure with the same folks, and we tend to throw some of our loot into a &quot;potion fund&quot;.  From that fund, I keep us in the following potions:<br />
<br />
1.  Damage shields -- these are very nice for challenging encounters, or for soloing.    As potions go, they are not that expensive (relative to some of the other popular potions).   I can make a 10-charge Kilva's Skin Flame for around 300 plat.  The potion does your level/2 +1 damage, and lasts a reasonable amount of time.<br />
<br />
2.  Gate -- Everyone carries around an assortment of gate potions.  The melee can no venture into dungeons without worrying about having a wizard or druid handy.  I carry a few extra single charges, in case we find ourselves with someone who lacks a ride out.  Pricey at 168 per attempt.<br />
<br />
3.  Greater Rejuvenation -- This is a 40 HP per tick regen that gives a neg 40 to str, n 40 to int, and slows attack speed.  It lasts for 2 minutes, for a total of 800 hps.  It stacks with:  Regrowth (group and single); Fungi Tunic; Fungi Great Staff Buff; Bard regen + mana song; and Torpor.  It is overwritten by celestial heal and by the necro heal line.  For those close encounters, where you need mana pronto, and you are cannibalizing like a fiend (or getting hit), it is worth the 115p per attempt price to quaff this potion.  I can't sell any of the melee folks on it, because they just cannot get in channeled in an emergency, but it is a grand shaman potion.  I can move my regen rate (with the bard) up over 100 hps per tick, not counting Torpor.  Solo it is a bit less -- I am guesstimating 90hps per tick -- but still formidable. <br />
<br />
4.  Calimony -- Great for emergency heals at 300 hps per charge.  Very expensive potion if you are not hunting the Ice Giant toes on your own and have to farm merchants or bribe other players.  But, as me favorite rogue notes, &quot;They're Gold Mate!&quot;<br />
<br />
5.  Adrenaline Tap --- Haste -- me monk friend estimates the haste on this potion at 66%.  His words &quot;This potion WILL save your life.&quot;  Again, a pricey potion at around 60 plat per attempt, but one that is well appreciated.  Used for difficult solo encounters and for challenging group encounters.  A bit short on duration at 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
6.  Grave Yard Dust &amp; Dulsehound are fun potions for a twink to use.  I collected toes while I was working me skill up, and parked 'em on said twinks.  Rage is an instant cast, and gives 18 str and subtracts 25 from int, with a 180 hp regen at 3 per tick.  Agile Rage adds 27 to 48 to str and 20 to agi and increases attack speed.  1.5 minute dot decline.  Not the best, but fun to play with in your 20's and 30's.  Me young monk loves them.  <br />
<br />
7.    I carry a 10 charge shrink and a 10 charge Inviso v. Undead.  I do not use these often, but when they are needed, I'm glad I have them.<br />
<br />
8.  The resist potions are useful for raids.  I keep a couple 10 charges in the bank with me resist gear.  <br />
<br />
9.  SoW ? At this point, I do not make them to sell, leaving that to lower level shaman who are trying to finance some of their alchemy skill increases.  <br />
<br />
10.  I keep folks in stat potions for soloing, or for working on trade skills.  The demand for these, however, is pretty low.<br />
<br />
The Luclin potions, last I tried, were too expensive to justify the effect, especially given the large failure rate.  <br />
<br />
I'm not convinced that the original poster's question has been answered, or fully considered.  There are now potions that have failure rates well beyond 180.  Are we certain that level 60 shaman are still capped at a skill level of 180?  Has anyone attempted to get skill level increases past 180?  How many potions did you attempt before you gave up?<br />
<br />
I have not yet attempted to raise my skill past 180.<br />
<br />
Any indication that these mass changes to trade skills in the May 7 patch included alchemy?<br />
<br />
Lastly, the main reason alchemy is not a viable trade skill is that the cost is just too high to risk on an untried quantity.  Folks are unwilling to try a haste potion at 1k a 10 charge or 500 a 5 charge.  I might, as some point, try marketing one shot wonders in an attempt to build interest.  But even once I've convinced them that the really WANT these potions, the cost is still pretty high.  It is a very expensive hobby/habit.  A great way to suck money out of the EQ economy.<br />

Heh, well said.  I tend to make the Rejuvenation instead - only 20hp per tick, but the cost is a bit more reasonable.  Even have a guild wizard wanting a constant supply now - said the first one saved her life at least 3 times while soloing.</div></div><hr />
