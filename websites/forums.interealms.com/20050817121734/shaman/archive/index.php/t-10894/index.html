<br />
How many unbuffed HPs to safely use Canni 5 AA?<br />
<br />
I understand this uses like 1932 hps - thing is I cant see how I could easily get that many unbuffed.  Even self buffed at 60 it seems I would barely have over 2000hps.  How many ubuffed HPs are needed really to be able to use this spell while soloing / doing - in conjuntion with torpor?<br />
<br />
anyone invested in this AA only to find that their hps are not &quot;uber&quot; enough to be able to use it?<br />
<br />
Thanks for you input!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1925 hps will leave you with 1 hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It might be handy if you posted a magelo Kraegar.<br />
<br />
Then people could perhaps let you know what easy upgrades would help you up your HP's.<br />
<br />
There are lots of quite cheap pieces around thanks to PoP and it's marvellous level restrictions on stuff.<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget that if you max out Natural Durability (12 AA's) you will gain another 10%-ish Hit points.<br />
<br />
I'll admit though it, it did take me awhile to intially break 2k hp.<br />
<br />
At the moment I sit on 2643hp unbuffed (with no ND).<br />
ND(3) will take that to 2906 which sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
Only 1/2 my gear is decent nodrop stuff at the moment. <br />
A bunch of slots need upgrades still from bazaar brought gear....<br />
<br />
Perhaps ask a friendly druid for PoTC or snag an Aego/Virtue if you feel your HP's are too low for soloing self-buffed in PoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 that is current magelo - the Hitpoints profile is the best i can do to add hitpoints<br />
<br />
btw - currently i am level 52 -  i have bumped the magelo level to 60 as a forcast.  I expect to have a polished tin mail tunic or similar at 60 when i ditch fungi to use torpor.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sta = 128 is part of the problem.<br />
<br />
Enshrouded/Executioner veil = ~30hp<br />
Iksar Hide cape = 75hp<br />
Barbed Dragonscale pauldrons = 10sta<br />
Coldain gloves = 30hp 9sta<br />
Shadel Bandit ring = 55hp<br />
Hardened Grey flesh sleeves = 5sta<br />
Solstice earring = 5(?)sta ~55hp<br />
SBS = 5sta 40hp<br />
Shissar hat = 25hp<br />
------------------------------------<br />
~34 sta and 310 hp by troll math.<br />
<br />
Sell all your JB except bracer/legs/bp to the nearest vendor because all it does is make you look gold and give you AC.<br />
<br />
Wis and mana will take care of themselves because they slap that crap on damn near every bit of shaman useable gear in the universe like it was peanut butter.  Just focus on hitting 200 sta unbuffed and grab as many hp as possible on the way. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Other upgrades:<br />
Velium Fire Wedding Ring for finger, ditch the gem encrusted ring unless you are root rotting. 6ac 65 hp on Wedding ring<br />
Barbed Rubicite Wrists  (or Artificer's Ringmail since you are a Barb)  to replace Coldain Wristguard, again unless root rotting. <br />
Slime Covered Rubicite Coif to replace JB helm.  Very nice HP/AC on that.<br />
Lots of different shoulder upgrades, DWS, Pauldrons of Witness, Dragonhide, Chokidai Pauldrons, among others.<br />
Legs upgrades are tough.  Your best bet is Wolf Callers from ToV, or Veteran's Chain Legs which are droppable but expensive.<br />
Same with arms.<br />
Back can be upgraded with Cloak of the Wise ( PoP quest ), Hierophant Cloak, Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak, Shimmering Terrorhide Cloak, etc.<br />
Dusty Soriz Boots are very nice boot upgrades for cheap.<br />
Sarnak Battle shield is much more solid then Crystal Chitin Shield.  Leave the CC shields to the druids :)<br />
Thats all I have to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To use Can5 and not die, you need a minimum of 1915 hps.<br />
<br />
To use Can5 and not get low health agro, which starts at roughly 25% health remaining, you will need a minimum of 2566 hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You need to be level 59 to even get can5.  I wouldn't worry about it now.  Level up, get some gear as you go, and ponder it then.  Right now you'd be over 2000 with Focus and Stamina, add in 8 more levels and you'll be an easy 2200+  And you're bound to get some gear by then, so probably 2300+.  Should be right around where you want to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">2000 hitpoints unbuffed isn't that hard to get. I'll be there when I get around to upgrading to a solstice earring, and except for a vindi BP, my gear is pretty low end: <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=527367&amp;alt=0<br />
<br />
PoP hasn't been very kind to my bank account, and since I just got done paying off a loan from a friend to buy torpor, all my gear is either looted or gifts from friends, none of it particularly hard to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have low hps for a shaman....  I barely break 2k unbuffed.  I use canni v all the time.  Self buffed I can use in combat and not draw undue agro.  After a rez, I can canni 4 twice, cast torpor, and hit canni v as soon as I am full health.  It leaves me with 72 hps, but I can do it... another torpor and I am almost full health with a couple bubbles of mana.<br />
<br />
Begin to pay more attention to hps in your gear choices and by the time you have canni v you will have more than enough hps to use it safely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">C5 does exactly 1954 damage.<br />
I don't know where you are getting your numbers from, but casting it below that amount of HPs is just asking for trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I dont know where Juujuu is getting his numbers from but Canni V does exactly 1924 damage (like Grimrod indirectly said).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1924 hps from canniV.<br />
You need 2565 HPs to not get low HP aggro from casting canniV at full health. <br />
2565 - 1924 = 641<br />
(641 / 2565 ) x 100 = ~25% (24.99025)<br />
If you are 62 then you have soul + boar.<br />
Soul is 544 hps and if you don't go over 255 sta you should get 3hp per sta so boar = 195hps<br />
So the min unbuffed HPs you would need to safely use CanniV while self buffed would be 2565 - 544 - 195 = 1826.<br />
Throw a virtue into the mix and you can do it with only 421 HPs unbuffed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My canni5 is more betterer than yours, and only does 1774 for the same amount of mana.<br />

Kill shei a few times, and your canni5 can be more betterer tooer!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Fattn, yeah, one goal is to be able to Cann V fully buffed, but another is to be able to do it at full health but NOT buffed.  Reason: after you die, a friendly cleric will often heal you to full but may not buff you.  If I can cann that health away, then torpor or kragg's back up, I'll have workable mana faster.<br />
<br />
My HP are pretty pitiful atm, I'm going to have to work on 'em in case I have get Cann V (sigh).</div></div><hr />

eh, you talking about that orb thingy? whats the effect on it? Boon of recovery or something?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Only did 875? Maybe because you only had 875 hps when you c5'd :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">no, Leoice, your solution doesn't even work.  You can take way more damage than you have hps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">bingo Boinshar.<br />
Spellshield = mana mmmm.<br />
bard and enchanter runes work for reducing canni damage too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Karadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">hehe 1924 hp dmg.now how many of you within a week of getting Cani 5 kiledl yourself because you were looking at your max hp not your acutall hp.???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I admit... when i first got cann5, I killed myself a handful of times (some by accident others from canning at the wrong time). <br />
<br />
Also trying to avoid the low hp aggro, the worst case dilemnia.... practically going oom during a boss encounter, you have a lure dot on you from mob boss AE.  The group's cleric and chanter are getting low on hp.... you either cann5 get a TM off and die from dot and low hp aggro or you try to cann4 like a mad man which usually means dead cleric and/or dead chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Shei sphere right clicks a 150 point rune (the effect also regens +3 hp/mana per tick)...I use it before canni5 every time, makes the bite a lot more manageable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Canni5 is the reason the shift in thinking about the question &quot;what is best in gear?&quot; has gone from AC to hps.  <br />
Total mana is now a consideration too at uber high level gameplay.  And FT is nice.  And resists go hand in hand with all of the above.  They tend to just &quot;show up&quot; on gear you want that has uber stats.  Funny how that works eh?  <br />
<br />
Suggestion for those of you who are still leveling to 60.  Do some shard farming.  You can get exp for it now, and someday you may decide to level past dicking around in TierII and want to go get ubered up in VT with whatever guild you are with at that time.  If your shards are mostly done that will be much easier for you.</div></div><hr />

Wow, sorry not everyone is mega uber like you Land... your attitude has really sucked recently, you really should go work through whatever is bringing you down (and if you say it's how much beastlords pwn shamans you really need help)</div></div><hr />
