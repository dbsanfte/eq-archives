<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Suineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been thinking about POP more recently and... well, now the novelty is worn off and I'm used to it I still think it isnt a patch on velious. It seems to be much more 'arcadey' EQ without any of the sense of immersion or depth of previous expansions... the whole random linear progression through 'levels' you have to beat to get to the next level, end of level bosses, random events that really dont tie into the rest of EQ that well.. its just kind of beginning to break the spell for me. <br />
<br />
Add that to the insane XP incentive to crowd everyone into the same few zones and... well... I'm kinda beginning to think it sucks. Its way too XP happy massively reducing my sense of achievement (since pop I have got AM3, Innate camo, GOTF, a few other things, and I really dont grind XP much) to the point I now think 'bleh, another AAPoint, no point getting excited, I'll have ability XXX in a few weeks' and dying is just 'hmmm I lost my buffs, thats annoying.'<br />
<br />
Does anybody else miss.... old EQ? EQ that wasnt this linear predictable enforced route of progression, levels, bosses, and the like?<br />
<br />
Feels like I've gone from an open ended adventure to a childrens space invaders game. Is this just burnout after 3 years or does everyone see this too?<br />
<br />
Sui... pondering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">imho what really sucks in pop is that you have only one road to reach the end goal.<br />
<br />
Would have been wayyy nicer to have alternate roads.. instead of that, you have everyone competing with everyone for the same mobs.... once more....<br />
<br />
I dont mind competition, even on an overcrowded server like Tunare, but reallly, the more time passes the more the endgame will be overcrowded, at least level wise, and to devise only one path of progression is ..... poor thinking, to put it politely.<br />
<br />
As for XP, well I find it rather nice, as it gives the peeps who dont grind much the impression that they are achieving something, without having to spend hours to get it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ueauvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">getting to 65 wasn't a pain like they promised, GOOD<br />
everyone in PoV/PoS BAD<br />
last two times AD been killed on Drinla have been over 100 per raid OPEN raids, zerg tactics massive lds<br />
Ive spent time in BoT and aggro through walls sucks major league.<br />
getting copies of earthen with spectral sucks<br />
cry of thunder should have hate reuce like jolting blades, geez it takes to get and i can get killed from the aggro if i use it<br />
fletching is a dead tradeskill unless you are tier 4 planar capable, dropped bows way better than i can make<br />
transportation great especially with tolans bp<br />
graveyards ok some other place could use them but on different timer like emperors room in sst etc<br />
loot in bot pov pos pon pod sucks unless you are lucky<br />
aa skills dont know havent got there yet</div></div><hr />

No problems with PoP from me.  Though I recently saw a post from a guy on my server's message board saying he's done the HoH flag quest five times (I think) and the NPC supposedly has a chance to fail the flag on turn in (&quot;Sorry, I don't fail on this often.&quot;), and he said he's failed every time he's tried it (and he said it takes like 10 hours each).  He said he talked with a GM about it and he said the GM told him that's how the game and quest was designed, which is rather inconsiderate of the EQ Devs in my opinion.  They need to hire me for a while, I'll teach them a lesson or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Honestly I'm disappointed in it. <br />
The plane tiering is basically a pain in the ass. Valor is crowded as heck and unforunately most folks are lazy. Very few pickup groups can be found in HOH, POS and BoT. The first tier planes are basically painful after 62. The old word is basically useless after 61. I spent a few hours in CT clearing spawns out of boredom searching for loot. Full group, I made 1% in 63 in something like 25+ blue mobs dead. In POV it's 3 kills.<br />
I hate being forced into the planes to see my exp bar move and basically I don't usually even bother with nightmare, disease or innovation these days.<br />
<br />
Most of us won't ever see beyond the tier 3 planes. My hunter title used to be an accomplishment. Now I find twink rangers running around who not only beat me to 65 but have their hunter title and have been played a few monthes. Bleh.<br />
<br />
The travel system is nice, but I wish it would have been limited to planar level. Part of EQ's fun was how big the world was when you first started the game. The nexus at least was limiting. I finally ditched my wizard account, I found I almost never logged him in with my OT hammer and POP I'm about 2 zones from anything.<br />
<br />
The story line is fragmented, the progression sporadic, risk versus reward is skewed in alot of places, the spell turn in is crap (speaking as a hybrid anyway).<br />
<br />
Overall I stil rate Velious as the best expansion. They broke the fewest things and added the best content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sorronn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Velious was the best expansion for me as well. There were multiple routes to the &quot;end game&quot; of Velious (north TOV) and the fact that Legacy of Steel did it through COV and most others did it through Kael proved that nicely. Velious did still give more weight to one path (Kael) than others but the amount of weight was not so large as to be insurmountable. In fact nowadays it is quite common for guilds to work through HoT til they are doing HoT quests and at that point spring directly onwards to NToV, bypassing west (and Kael faction) entirely.<br />
<br />
However, the changes were made to maintain customer base and keep the revenue stream going. People fear EQ being shut down when EQ2 comes out. I don't. I fear that EQ will still be around long after it has passed its lifespan as Sony tries to get yet one more crop of players through the subscription wringer. It's that philosophy that I fear the most, a philopsophy that might stifle innovation, and demand that the next generation of game be watered down badly to maximize subscription rates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree totally.  I can't really describe it, but it makes the game...less.  Additionally, it made the already unpopular old world even more of a ghost town.  Even during Velious I would see 30 some people in Highpass during peak times; Paludal Caverns took care of that...<br />
<br />
I would've liked to see PoK unavailable up to 46, or even up to 51.<br />
<br />
Another pet peeve of mine is the PoV/S trial.  I return after two months, and now I have to go through what is essentially a key quest to see more than 5 (only 3 of which are the fun place where you can die) of the zones in the expansion.  Most of the people who can get flags in the guild already had them before I came around.  I'm sure they spent hours sitting in PoJ trying for them too, but now that they have them, we take one or two passes and if that doesn't work, they're off to Valor or Storms for some mad experience while the other &quot;low 60s&quot; and I grind quickly to 62 where we will stop dead in our tracks.<br />
<br />
Why is Storms locked?  It makes no real sense, and it would be a great boon to those of us who can't get two rogues and a wizard to tear through Execution if we could go there after 62 instead of staring at the same machines/rats/lightcrawlers/trees/demons.<br />
<br />
The story makes little sense overall, as well, and while the concept of flags is neat and good in most ways, having to get a new flag at the end of every zone is just a sort of distributed key quest...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Silverbrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PoP - it has allowed my guild to finally get to see some of the Luclin content, and tackle some of the velious bosses. We are a tier 2ish (able to kill tier 3) according to the legends tier ranking.  Since PoP we actually have options of mobs to kill, Vindi / Velks / THO / RC and the likes as a good amount of guilds near us and above are up in PoP.  <br />
<br />
The exp in PoV is a nice change of pace, less of a timesink.  Making 45-60% aa exp for a full night in Juggs in seb was the best i could get pre-pop. now i can do darn near 2 AA's in the same time, and has allowed me personally to obtain AM3 + EQ w/o a timesink in between raids.  <br />
<br />
The only issue is the difficulty lvl of the encounters.  like I said we are in our minds a tier 3 guild, yet we get whhomped on Grummus,  the Behemoth, etc. and as such miss out on some of the cool encounters I wouldnt mind seeing.  The ubber guilds wont allow us to tag when there reflagging :(<br />
<br />
Overall PoP has met my expectations, and paying the 30 bucks to get rid of the timesink that is farming AA's was worth it to me.  Vallorium Ring of Gallentry is my friend ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I love the way the raids are designed.  No more of this &quot;put one tank on a mob and heal him till the mob dies&quot; crap.<br />
<br />
Now, for one example, you might have to worry about keeping a tank on a main mob, as another untargetable mob wanders around and silences all your healers/casters, and three other mobs pop every few seconds and kill everyone else.  The untargetable mob can't be attacked, and thus can't be simply kited away from the raid.  And the adds, do you mez them and mez them until there's 100 mobs sitting around and your mezzers get silenced and the mobs break loose...<br />
<br />
More strategy involved.  Can't really throw 80 unskilled players at an event and win anymore.  Makes it fun, you have to actually think.<br />
<br />
Good stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jooneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Planes of Power seems okay for what it is, the next incremental expansion.  Nothing revolutionary.<br />
<br />
I hope EQ2, EQ3, or whatever gets to the point where gamers with typical computer hardware can get involved in real epic battles, a la The Two Towers' Helm's Hold battle or SW2: Attack of the Clones battle in the arena, with dozens or even hundreds of enemies, instead of your average hyperbuffed B.B.E.G. (Big Bad Evil Guy) and his handful of buffed guardians.<br />
<br />
It's getting a little better a little bit at a time.  I'm anxious to find out what Legacy of Ykesha is about tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Supposedly NoV on Fennin flagged 115 people at an Aerin'Dar raid. Not exactly a game of finesse there.<br />
<br />
Sure. You can mez a planar projection and drag/summon more people to a raid all day long if you want.  Doesn't mean all 115 were there.<br />
<br />
Even so, Aerin'Dar was a well designed entry-level PoP raid that was enjoyable before all the strats were published.  And even knowing the tactics, he's a bit more difficult than simply a main-tank heal-chain fight.</div></div><hr />

I don't see what the fuss is all about.  Finally decided to give the Execution trial a try Sunday night.  Ranger, Bard, Shadowknight, Cleric, a Paladin, and an Enchanter, 59-62. Mediocre gear for the most part (I know mine sucks ass).  Yeah, it took 5 tries with that low-DPS setup, but hell--it was still good AAXP.  After we finished the running-around part with Mavuin we swapped the bard for a necro to flag him as well; got it on the first try.</div></div><hr />
