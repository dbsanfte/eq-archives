I invite shaman's to look at the numbers on that thread.  Post on Grove<br />
feedback or post/reply here.<br />
<br />
Copying just the sumation:<br />
One essential problem with the approach the developers used to maintain ratios at Cleric 100 Druid 64 Shaman 47. The problem becomes one of content design and the way that the RAW GAP between a cleric to druid to shaman gets LARGER as the amounts get bigger.<br />
<br />
In Sumation.<br />
The ACTUAL gap in Healing Per Second, and Healing Per Mana<br />
is growing and growing between Clr to Druid to Shaman. even if the percentage gap is maintained.<br />
<br />
The more and more this occurs, the more and more the game returns to Requiring Clerics in every group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am fine with percentages staying the same through expansions. The 100/64/47 itself is silly. In all other functions 64% of the best means a tertiary ability and 47% means you are not to be taken seriously.<br />
<br />
Slowing<br />
64% of 75% is 48% - that is less then a bard.<br />
47% of 75% is 35% - I do not think any class has slows this bad.<br />
<br />
Melee Damage (stolen from steel warrior)<br />
64% of rogue damage (180DPS) is 115 DPS - thats warrior damage.<br />
47% of rogue damage is 85 DPS - that is less then knight damage on red cons (the above is on blue cons. If I would have to guess I would say that is bard melee.<br />
<br />
So, druids heal as well as warriors do melee damage. Shaman heal as well as bards do melee damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The linked post on the Druids Grove features very unusual sentence structure.<br />

However, unless you find it mysterious that the difference between 200 and 128 is TWICE AS MUCH as the difference between 100 and 64 (MOG!!1!), it's not very informative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">seem lik a reasonable post, you are assuming that the developers even thought about that.. i can tell you alot of other classes dont notice this, so why would developers need to think about that?<br />
now if thay have then fine, but if not it brings up the valid point.<br />
<br />
and veeshan bring a valid point that out healing is well belowa good percentage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Corlathist, while unarguably true, the fact that raw numbers are increasing is kind of moot.<br />
<br />
As long as the percentages are held firm, the net effect is zero.  It still takes XX casts of shaman heal to get the tank to full.  Honestly, it's a moot point.<br />
<br />
The telling factor in this expansion is twofold.  First, absent the spells actually on test atm, the shaman heals did not get increased to maintain healing percentages in comparison to other healing classes.  The second factor is currently more important since the first factor has been fixed (at least on test): underlying changes to the game make an occasional re-evaluation of the percentages necessary.<br />
<br />
Due to underlying changes to the game, the shaman are trying to get the developers to question the percentage heals.  Apparently we were pegged at 47% heals at least as far back as the inception of PoP.  That was before (a) mitigation, and (b) the change to mob hp vs dps.  <br />
<br />
The shaman have been arguing, so far unsuccessfully, that due to the widespread prevalence of mitigation the dev's need to examine the base percentage of heals for high level heals.  More specifically, since stuff now resists about 50% of our slow to have a net slow of probably 37.5%, that shaman heals need to be bumped up to probably around 1800ish.  I'm not sure what that equates to in the heal distribution, but let's just call it 50% instead of 47%.  Someone who's got more time can actually do the math and give us a correct percentage later.<br />
<br />
So, mobs mitigate.  Their dps does not go down as far, but our healing ability does not compensate.  No other healing class is balanced against slow (I discount the minor heals that BLs get), so it only really affects shaman.  Thus, while mitigation hits all slowing classes, it really double whacks the shaman since our heals remain unchanged.  That problem goes back to PoP.<br />
<br />
Now enter GoD, where mobs hit much harder and mitigate, but have less hitpoints.  Fights are over faster, so over the course of a fight, mitigated slows, or even bounced slows are of substantially less importance.  The difference of 30% slows over the course of a 30 second fight is relatively trivial, especially since most cleric and druid heals contain an 'overheal' component--heals above and beyond the hp the tank has.  GoD reduces that overheal component a lot, so much so that many cleric/druid heals hit for full efficiency.  To some extent, that makes druids and clerics MORE efficient, though at the cost of some anxiety since you have larger spikes in hp!  Pity the hapless tanks!<br />
<br />
Shaman heals, on the other hand, are effectively gimped further.  We were already healing for full efficiency.  Now we have a situation where we are penalized for slow by having a lower percentage heal, then we're given a less efficient heal, then we're trying to heal more damage with a heal that, because it almost always hits for full, can't get any more efficient, over the course of fights that further trivialize the impact of slow by being of such short duration.  Slow saves us mana on healing over the course of a longer fight.  Short duration fights, especially since we have to slow at the beginning just don't prevent as much damage.<br />
<br />
Shaman were designed as an endurance class, and that concept is no longer relevant in GoD.  Slow makes healing more efficient over the course of long fights.  Thus, by slow, shaman add endurance to the healers' mana.  Over the short term, we don't really save them ANY mana--they still have to heal once or twice.  Over the long term, we can save them a TON of heals.<br />
<br />
DoTs take a long time to work.  Cannabalize/mana regen depends on our ability to take the time to do it.  Burst healing and dps is now king, but shaman are at best pawns at both of those areas.<br />
<br />
For illustration purposes, shaman got hit in the face with a large fish--not once, but several times.<br />
<br />
Slow is mitigated: You have been smacked with a Salmon!<br />
Your PoP heal isn't balanced to compensate:  Smack!<br />
You aren't given new heals in GoD: Smack!<br />
More mobs mitigate: Smack!<br />
To progress you need to finish trials with lots of unslowable nameds: SMACK! SMACK!<br />
Shorter fights on non-named further reduce the effectiveness of slow:  Smack!<br />
<br />
I've rambled past the topic, but really, it's not the raw numbers that is the issue.  It's a more funamental question of adjusting the percentages to account for significant changes in game mechanics.  That analysis by the devs is still lacking.<br />

EDIT: finally found my answer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Brrakk, mobs 'mitigate' slow.  You'll see the following messages:<br />
Target yawns<br />
Your slow was mostly effective<br />
Your slow was partially effective<br />
Your slow was slightly effective<br />
<br />
Our estimates of effect are as follows.  The first is a full slow, so hits for 75% (normal turgur's level).  The second is only 75% effective, so slows the mob for (.75 x .75) = 56.25%.  Partially is 50% effective, so slows for 37.5%.  Slightly is 25% effective, so slows the mob for maybe 18.75%.<br />
<br />
The effect is to lessen the effect of slow on the mob.  The mob is not as hindered by our spells.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The problem with the percentage game, is that content is balanced against the Cleric Amounts.<br />
<br />
For example.  If content is based to challenge a clerics heals in POP.<br />
Shaman heal 47% of a cleric.<br />
<br />
Then cleric heals get boosted 20% as do Shaman Heals.<br />
So mob DPS gets boosted 20%<br />
<br />
Where previous you were &quot;short&quot; healing by say 150ish HPS.<br />
Now your short healing by 180ish HPS.<br />
<br />
Still 20% granted.   But your tanks die noticibly faster/loose health noticibly faster requiring more of the shaman spam trap.<br />
<br />
On top of that factor in the HPM gap.  Shaman/Druids are stuck in a loop of healing more and more often, with less efficient spells than the cleric by an increasing factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not true, Corl.  As long as you heal the same percentage--AND as long as mob dps only goes up that same percentage (which hasn't happened in GoD)--then percents work.  It's only when you have a more fundamental change that things become an issue.  Here, for the purposes of your example, mobs might hit 30% more, but heals only increased 20% more.  The clerics had excess 'overheal', as did the druids.  Now however, the clerics have very little overheal, the druids are at underheal, and the shaman (who never had overheal) are REALLY underhealing.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Chutoi,<br />
<br />
Corlathist makes a good point. While been less efficient or lower volume can be compensated for with better mana regen or more casts you can't however increase the hps healed per second of a given spell any more than a cleric can. You are correct tho that this is a problem because mob dps has increased alot more than heals have so far. The biggest problem I see for shaman is simply that even with max spell haste and aa's our hps per second still is insufficient to heal in GoD. Efficiency isn't relavant if you can't keep someone alive at all.<br />
<br />
While there was a time where I could see justifying a clerics large lead in healing as a balancing issue I don't feel that it is really justified any longer and is just falling back to kurnark era's where clerics where the only viable healing class. Obviously verant recognized that as a problem back then and eventually added chloroblast, the ICH's and other things to try and make druid and shaman more viable healers.<br />
<br />
The current 100, 64, 47 is far too drastic for healing and IMO needs to be more like 100, 80, 70 or maybe 100, 75, 65. Clerics have pleanty of other things that would still make them better healers even if shaman and druids match them straight up in the 3.75 sec standard heals. Bulwark of vie, Blessing of reverence, Divine intervention, Divine arbitration, Divine aura, supernal remedy and assorted group heals stand out the most. All these tools allow them to bring a group succesfully threw situations where a druid or shaman, even with an identical spell to holy light, would be unable to. The utility clerics bring to a group outside of just the bigest best heal has definitely improved in the last few expansions and they no longer need and shouldn't really have the strangle hold they have on healing in GoD.<br />
<br />
I'd propose druids healing got upped to 2600 hps healed at 600 mana or so. About 80% of the  amount heal and about 85% of the efficiency.<br />
<br />
Shaman would then up at 2275 hps healed at 600 mana or so. About 70% of the amount healed and 75% of the efficiency.<br />
<br />
Changes like this might actually allow you to do GoD trials with out having to have a cleric or 2 to have any chance at winning them. Yeah it would make older world and previous expansion stuff easier but progression always does that even with in the same expansion. You get into elemental planes and get the gear for hps, mana, focus effects, ac etc and everything before that gets easier. Get into time and the elemental planes gets easier etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Taraddar, that is exactly the point I was making.  The percentages are not what they need to be.  Corlathist was arguing that raw difference was the issue.<br />
<br />
Consider:<br />
100k heal for clerics (in 2010)<br />
47,500 for shaman<br />
Thus, shaman heal 47.5% of clerics.<br />
It still takes 2 heals for the shaman get get near the cleric.  However, the RAW difference between the two heals is over 52,500 hp.  Today, the raw difference is (3275-1550)= 1725.<br />
<br />
The raw difference is immaterial if the percentages are balanced.<br />
<br />
Go back and reread what I wrote--I disagreed only on his interpretation of the raw amount making a difference.  I categorically stated that the percentages need to be revisited.   You're agreeing with me!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The gist of this is that Clerics have an absolute lock on the main healer job in GoD trials and that's F'd up.  IMO, minor adjustments are necessary to the heal percentages AND to the trials need to be adjusted as well.  <br />
<br />
Revisiting the percentages is worth a look, but I think the adjustments needed to attain 'balance' are pretty minor.  The major adjustments needed are for the actual content.  There's just no reason why a SINGLE GROUP encounter should REQUIRE 2 priests to heal one of the top 10 tanks on the server.  If it required a backup healer if a druid was main healer, I could understand that.  But when not even the best geared cleric and best geared warrior on the server can reasonably expect to get by without a second priest to backup heal...  That's one messed up encounter imo.<br />

<br />
I think the reason for the trials being designed the way they are, is that they are supposed to be difficult, even to the best groups. And that they are. If you make the trial so that a time-knight can tank it with a single healer, it would be trivial to every decently equipped elemental group with the appropriate class make up. You can't scale difficulty to the lowest common denominator and still expect it to be &quot;difficult&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;An AE here, a proc there&quot; ....ummmm...last time I looked these sorts of things still made things &quot;difficult&quot; by (1) increasing mob dps; (2) increasing mob burst dps (aka &quot;one rounding&quot;); (3) decrease pc dps; (4) decrease pc casting. Basically they involve killing the mob before it kills you, one way or another. The smaller the margin you have to do that, the more &quot;difficult&quot; it becomes. Extending fights to make them last longer also removes &quot;difficulty&quot; since it allows you more margin for making mistakes and not being penalized. Fast vicious fights allow for NO margin for error, and it is that more than anything else that makes them difficult. If Sony were to implement game design the way that you want, time level guilds would be in the end game zone by now. How is that good for the game?<br />
<br />
I like GoD the way it is. It's hard, and I feel like I've accomplished something when I've beaten an encounter. Winning doesn't come solely from equipment, it comes mostly from doing the right thing at the right time, acting as a team and making NO mistakes. Doing some of these fights is like doing an intricate team dance, getting it right is a bitch, but when it comes together, it's a thing of beauty ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On this balance thing, I think the problem is that people are looking at these 1 group encounters in GoD as if they were one group encounters in PoP or LDoN, whereas they should be looking at them more as 1 group raids.

He's not asking for a time knight to be able to tank it with any single healer. He's asking for the best geared/aaed warrior and the best geared/aaed cleric to be able to handle it. When the most effective tank class and the most effective healer class with the best gear and aa's can't handle a mob that has to be done by a single group I definitely think things are a bit too hard. This would still put it at a very difficult level for anything less, either less optimal classes or less equiped or both. Being tankable by a 1200+ hps 2200+ ac warrior with 15%+ shielding mod is hardly going to make it trivial for even a well geared elemental group since thier tank is probably taking 20-30% more dps tanking the same mob while sporting less hps. Shielding and AC both significantly effect the dps mobs do to a tank now a days.</div></div><hr />

We should really get together and reparse slow mitigation. Currently we do not even know if there are variations within the same mitigation category.<br />
<br />
I think the reason for the trials being designed the way they are, is that they are supposed to be difficult, even to the best groups. And that they are.<br />
I have done Tipt with a Shadowknight/Cleric/Cleric/Shaman/Rogue/Paladin group and I have done it with a Warrior/Cleric/Enchanter/Wizard/Shaman/Monk group. The expedition was downright trivial with the second group. Even pulling 5 of the little cragbeasts at once did not wipe us.<br />
<br />
If you make the trial so that a time-knight can tank it with a single healer, it would be trivial to every decently equipped elemental group with the appropriate class make up.<br />
That is laughable. Putting in DoTs that have to be healed, DPS procs that make the MOB spike, AEs, swarm type encounters and endurance fights into the same trial would encourage much more balanced groups and still easily be as challenging.<br />
I have probably said it fifty times but let me say it again. Noone wants these trials to be easy. Few want them to be doable with any tank + any healer. What we want is them to be doable with a range of classes.<br />
Making pure melee DPS encounters and then tuning them for a cleric + backup healer + defensive warrior healer is a ludicrous way to design single group content.<br />
<br />
You can't scale difficulty to the lowest common denominator and still expect it to be &quot;difficult&quot;. <br />
Imagine a MOB that regens 3000 HPs(arbitrary number) per tick. Give him a fairly mean DoT AE. Otherwise he does damage that a shaman can keep up with.<br />
Is that MOB hard? Sounds hard to me.<br />
Do clerics suck on that MOB? No.<br />
Do shaman suck on that MOB? No.<br />
Do knights suck on that MOB? No.<br />
Do warriors suck on that MOB? No.<br />
Do necromancers suck on that MOB? No.<br />
Is that MOB the perfect way to build single group challenges? Probably not.<br />
Is that MOB better then the current situation? A lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;An AE here, a proc there&quot; ....ummmm...last time I looked these sorts of things still made things &quot;difficult&quot; by (1) increasing mob dps;<br />
And in a way that is not mitigated by the defensive discipline. In a way that makes runes useful. In a way that makes cripple useful.<br />
<br />
(2) increasing mob burst dps (aka &quot;one rounding&quot;);<br />
Obviously the MOBs melee DPS would have to be reduced. I guess I should have spelled that one out - I thought it was obvious.<br />
<br />
(3) decrease pc dps;<br />
That is a bad thing, why?<br />
<br />
(4) decrease pc casting. Basically they involve killing the mob before it kills you, one way or another.<br />
Now there is a surprise. Of course you want to kill the MOB before it kills you. Is it so hard to realize that there a ways to design encounters so that everyone has fun?<br />
If you increase fire and cold resists on everything by 12000000 you will still &quot;kill them before they kill you&quot; but you just ruined the fun for a lot of classes.<br />
The same is happening for knights, shaman and to a lesser degree necromancers right now. (and situationally anyone who cannot find a group due to 4 slots out of 6 being reserved for needed classes.)<br />
<br />
The smaller the margin you have to do that, the more &quot;difficult&quot; it becomes. Extending fights to make them last longer also removes &quot;difficulty&quot; since it allows you more margin for making mistakes and not being penalized. Fast vicious fights allow for NO margin for error, and it is that more than anything else that makes them difficult.<br />
These fights are so much easier for classes equipped with &quot;oh ****&quot;-abilities it is not funny.<br />
Why should only a select few classes have it difficult?<br />
<br />
If Sony were to implement game design the way that you want, time level guilds would be in the end game zone by now. How is that good for the game?<br />
So if the single group content was changed to my liking the raid content would instantly be trivialized? Great thinking there.<br />
<br />
I like GoD the way it is. It's hard, and I feel like I've accomplished something when I've beaten an encounter.<br />
And if the group had taken a cleric instead of you it would have been easier for everyone. If you think penalizing yourself constitutes a challenge that works I guess.<br />
<br />
Winning doesn't come solely from equipment, it comes mostly from doing the right thing at the right time, acting as a team and making NO mistakes. Doing some of these fights is like doing an intricate team dance, getting it right is a bitch, but when it comes together, it's a thing of beauty ;)<br />
And that still does not make it ok to design single group content that is trivial with 2 clerics, 2 enchanters and 2 warriors and very hard with a shaman / druid / paladin / bard / wizard / rogue group. Why should a balanced group like the second one have a hard time on content trivial for another group?<br />
Yes, I said trivial. These trials(Tipt/Vxed) are not even remotely as hard with that setup, even though it is supremely unbalanced.<br />
<br />
1) SOE is perfectly capable of creating encounters that let everyone contribute and are still hard - countless raid encounters are proof of that.<br />
<br />
2) The GoD single group trials are not remotely like that.<br />
<br />
3) It would be preferably if every class could contribute to an encounter.<br />
<br />
Can you refute any of the above?</div></div><hr />

You can't scale difficulty to the lowest common denominator and still expect it to be &quot;difficult&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">On this balance thing, I think the problem is that people are looking at these 1 group encounters in GoD as if they were one group encounters in PoP or LDoN, whereas they should be looking at them more as 1 group raids. In feel and implementation they are much more like raids, and the same sort of functional balance in groups is required. I think that LDoN was the first attempt by Sony at &quot;1 group raids&quot;, but the implementation was poor. GoD is a much better attempt.<br />
<br />
I agree its more like a raid but the problem is how are people ever going to get flaged when  you need a warrior a chanter cleric and one other healer most would like a cleric or druid in that spot. That only leaves open two spots. I guess everyone else is just out of luck. This is really a poor way to implement an expation.</div></div><hr />

 Whats really going on out there is the same bs that happened with the PoP trials, whereby the blessed few do the trials first up, and then drag the &quot;also rans&quot; through sometime down the track when they arent busy or burnt out.<br />

<br />
Even if I can't keep up with mob DPS with my heals, a spot heal is supposed to be able to keep someone alive for a couple of rounds if they get agro.  The problem is that anyone outside the MT, if I start casting my spot heal the second they get hit (in theory), they will probably lose so many hp's that my heal will only keep them alive until the next round of hits and I won't be able to get off a second spot heal.  <br />
<br />
It might not be realistic, but if you really want to scale healing dps to mob dps, you need to look at mob dps vs player hp's.  <br />
<br />
If you scale mobs DPS 20% and scale our raw healing HPS 20%..but the player dies 20% faster because their hp's haven't gone up as much.... I'm not sure what the solution is, and maybe the MT hp's will go up in this expansion close to the same % as mob DPS has, but it doesn't seem like it.  It just seems that even if I can heal 20% more, but people die 50% faster.. I'll never be able to keep anyone alive even for a spot of agro.<br />
<br />
To me, it is like when you are trying to PL a lowbie.  I can heal for more hp's than the player has, but if the mob kills the player faster than i can heal, it doesn't matter.  Maybe I'm way off, but I think along with the healing % on our heals, maybe they can do something about the casting time to account for how much faster people die in these new expansions, especially with slow mitigation?<br />
<br />
Let me know if I'm crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hurk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Corlathist, while unarguably true, the fact that raw numbers are increasing is kind of moot.<br />
<br />
As long as the percentages are held firm, the net effect is zero.  It still takes XX casts of shaman heal to get the tank to full.  Honestly, it's a moot point.<br />
<br />
........<br />
<br />
I've rambled past the topic, but really, it's not the raw numbers that is the issue.  It's a more funamental question of adjusting the percentages to account for significant changes in game mechanics.  That analysis by the devs is still lacking.<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
the real issue with healing (opposed to dps) is that healing has a limit that a resonable group can reach. so, assuming a shaman can heal effectivly for a group (and your using your percentages) then a druid can heal and add DPS, and a cleric can heal and... um, save the group in case of a over pull.... er melee... um... nuke really badly...<br />
<br />
the point being, you start with equality among healing (give all priests the same direct healing) then rebalance the classes without healing as part of the math.</div></div><hr />

MOB DPS scaling faster then player HPS is not bad by itself - all healers are affected by it equally, percentage-wise. It does become a problem when you factor in the time needed for a shaman to debuff. When our basic debuff cycle comes dangerously close to having the tank die before we can land the first heal we have a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">And that still does not make it ok to design single group content that is trivial with 2 clerics, 2 enchanters and 2 warriors and very hard with a shaman / druid / paladin / bard / wizard / rogue group. Why should a balanced group like the second one have a hard time on content trivial for another group?<br />
Yes, I said trivial. These trials(Tipt/Vxed) are not even remotely as hard with that setup, even though it is supremely unbalanced.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the problem here is that you don't understand that balance is not about what is viable in BoT or some other trivial older content, its what is viable for the task at hand. The second group you described can hardly be described as balanced for the task at hand. It is lacking in healing capabilities, part of the healing is going to be side tracked into debuffing activities, your tanking capabilities are limited, your puller is also likely primary CC, your dps is average. Of course that group is going to have problems in tipt, it has no real strengths at all. A balanced group has to be at least capable in some respects if it is going to work for difficult material. Compare that with your first group, which has exceptional healing, exceptional CC, exceptional dps (in the context of tipt), exceptional tanking ability.</div></div><hr />

Uh . . that is exactly, one hundred percent what I have been telling you for weeks now.<br />
<br />
The second group you described can hardly be described as balanced for the task at hand.<br />
Group 1 is not a balanced group in any meaning of the word. It is tank heavy, healer heavy, control heavy. It should be the all defensive group. It should not be the group that kills literally five times as fast.<br />
<br />
It is lacking in healing capabilities,<br />
Yet it has the second, third and fourth best healer.<br />
<br />
part of the healing is going to be side tracked into debuffing activities,<br />
Bard debuffs help a lot with that.<br />
<br />
your tanking capabilities are limited,<br />
tell me of other single group content where a paladin does not suffice?<br />
<br />
your puller is also likely primary CC,<br />
A bard will pull singles in just about any situation if he wants to. There is no crowd.<br />
<br />
your dps is average.<br />
Last I checked wizard + rogue were pure DPS classes, something group 1 has not a single one of.<br />
<br />
Of course that group is going to have problems in tipt, it has no real strengths at all.<br />
So excellent mana regeneration, close to raid buffs and every utility spell in the game are not strengths?<br />
Of course if you define strength = cleric + warrior + enchanter . . it does not have any of these at all.<br />
<br />
A balanced group has to be at least capable in some respects if it is going to work for difficult material. Compare that with your first group, which has exceptional healing, exceptional CC, exceptional dps (in the context of tipt), exceptional tanking ability.<br />
And the second group should. Loading up on the same class should not be preferable in single group content. What other expansion do you take multiple clerics in if you can get someone else? What other expansions do you want multiple enchanters in?<br />
<br />
Do you really, honestly believe the second group is less capable then the first anywhere then GoD? Do you really believe the first group will be better anywhere but in GoD?<br />
<br />
And before you tell me again how Tipt and the likes are supposed to be hard - they are not. They are hard for balanced group but they are utterly trivial with the key classes.<br />
<br />
And since you seemed to have missed this let me post it again:<br />
<br />
1) SOE is perfectly capable of creating encounters that let everyone contribute and are still hard - countless raid encounters are proof of that.<br />
<br />
2) The GoD single group trials are not remotely like that.<br />
<br />
3) It would be preferably if every class could contribute to an encounter.<br />
<br />
Can you refute any of the above?</div></div><hr />

... balance is not about what is viable in BoT or some other trivial older content, its what is viable for the task at hand. ... [Y]our first group ... has exceptional healing, exceptional CC, exceptional dps (in the context of tipt), exceptional tanking ability.  Two warriors, two enchanters, two clerics is an exceptionally strong, balanced group in Tipt.<br />
<br />
Inviting other classes with other abilities into the group doesn't make the group more balanced.  It makes the group weaker.  <br />
<br />
That makes those other classes -- hmm, irrelevant at best, but probably it's best to face the fact that those other classes are hindrances.  The group will be stronger, faster, and more capable if it sticks to the three classes that matter.<br />
<br />
Is that the point of the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">balance is not about what is viable in BoT or some other trivial older content, its what is viable for the task at hand. <br />
<br />
That's the whole point.  If they made content that was trivial for 6 magician groups but was borderline suicide for anyone else, the appropriate answer would be &quot;that design sucks ass&quot; not &quot;LOL noob bring 6 magicians it's viable for the task at hand.&quot;  The problem with your argument is that you have redefined the phrase &quot;balanced group&quot; to mean &quot;whatever beats the content.&quot;  That simply begs the entire question that is under discussion, which is &quot;is the content balanced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Let's see why that &quot;balanced in the brave new world&quot; group of war/war/clr/clr/ench/ench is better than the &quot;balanced by any reasonable meaning of the word balance&quot; group of shaman/druid/paladin/bard/wizard/rogue.<br />
<br />
Tanking: The brave new world group is better because an ornate equipped warrior is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a 2200+ AC knight on the bosses because of the asinine disciplines added in Kunark.  Hell, a ranger is a million times better.  Everybody with a clue has been saying these were game-destroyingly imbalanced since the day they were put in (usually to the detriment of warriors actually, so this is not an anti-warrior rant).<br />
<br />
Instead of fixing the tanking problems that they created with this craptacular move, the made them worse by shifting to small DB/large DI model for the mobs in an effort to prevent all the +avoidance stuff that they put in the game from making them too easy, which drastically increases the value of these disciplines and greatly increases the chance of damage spikes on the knights.<br />
<br />
CC: Yeah, a couple enchanters should be much better than a lone bard.  In fact, they should up the CC requirements and ditch the mez immunity in a lot of places to keep the game exciting for CC classes.  <br />
<br />
Damage:  The enchanters in the brave new world group -- in addition to providing the best CC in the game as they should -- also obliterate not just the wizard and rogue, but the entire old school group combined in the DPS category and at minimal risk (because there are 2 of them).  Mmmm hmmm.<br />
<br />
Healing: 2 clerics should be a little better than a shaman + druid + paladin.  They should not, however, be overwhelmingly better.  While the shaman brings slow (largely irrelevant in a world where most bosses are unslowable, and in any event the job can be done with your enchanters) and the druid brings dps (which is an utter joke compared to the enchanters'), the clerics not only bring better, faster heals that can minimize the risk of your tank dying to a damage spike but they also bring the most valuable utility skill in the game to the table (rez), which is greatly magnified in importance in GoD.  The old school group has only the paladin for rez, and considering the fact that she is the one most likely to die (see &quot;tanking&quot;) one spike (which has nothing to do with skill, only the luck of the RNG) and it's lights out.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they want to make an area that suits oddball group compositions like Magician x6 or warx2, clrx2, enchx2, that's fine.  But not in an area that everyone needs to progress through.</div></div><hr />
