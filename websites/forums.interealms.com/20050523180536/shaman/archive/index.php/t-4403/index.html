<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well i never thought it'd happen, but i guess having the summer off from school gave me the time i needed.  the other evening in a routine HS group i ding'd lvl 60, and proceeded to scribe my one spell, focus of spirit, sigh.  what's odd is i still consider myself a noob, geshtar had 63 days played and i created him october 27th, 2001.  ding'd august 14th, 2002.  perhaps i play just a bit too much?  lol<br />
<br />
also to side note, ugh, yes, the khura's avatar malo torpor hunt begins, anyone on tunare server that has lemme know lol.  <br />
<br />
just wanted to say thanks to everyone out there for the information.  while i hardly posted, i often read about spots to solo, grp information, spell information, etc. etc., and this website is full of some of the nicest people around, very glad to have had the opportunity to get much of your input.  thanks again.<br />

Keep EXP popping till you got a fill yellow as a buffer though, before you start doing the big AA push :)  (and I keep mine on 90% to keep the regular EXP going a bit)</div></div><hr />
