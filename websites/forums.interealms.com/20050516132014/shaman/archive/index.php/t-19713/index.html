<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urraca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So yeah, on accident at the server select screen I clicked 'Order Gates of Discord'. Without any confirmation window it orders it, bills you, exits you from Everquest, and makes you download it. UGHHHH. I did not want to waste my money on this expansion. DO NOT CLICK ON THAT BUTTON, let me serve as an example.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did exactly the same thing. Wasn't paying attention, clicked the wrong button, no confirmation dialogue or nothing and BOOM thanks for the cash sucker. :(  Entirely my own fault and nobody else to blame for pushing that button, but I was less than enamoured by the 'oh well, bad luck, too late now, bye' from CS when I asked them if there was any way to cancel it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">log into station.sony.com and cancel the order if you don't want it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know you could do this with preorders...not sure about after release orders</div></div><hr />

CC rules &gt; SOE bs.<br />
Call the card provider and explain it to them.  SOE will straighten up real quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Judana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup, if you chargeback the purchase based on the fact that there was no ability to confirm this was your intention, you'll get your $30 and they'll face an uncontestable chargeback fee from your card issuer, usually around $10. That's what they deserve for slimy tactics like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On the last pop up pre-order window there was a value you could enter to make the client think you've ordered this and skip the damned screen.  Does anyone know if there is anything I can do to stop this screen from coming up, short of ordering this expansion?  If there is, please enlighten me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tried checking the 'cancel order' route, but you can't do that on anyting other than pre-orders it seems. CC idea sounds useful, but knowing SOE they'll just bite back by banning the account or some such pish. TBH I think the only thing to do is suck up the 30 bucks and chalk up another on the 'reasons not to play a Sony game again' list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow, I'll value real world money then a game anyday. Its just me, but if that happened to me, you better belive I would be getting my money back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I definatley value real world money more, especially as a college student. However, I have the account being paid with my debit card, which goes straight to my checking. So the money has already been withdrawn? Is that how that works? I wonder what happens if I am able to cancel though, because I already made the best of the situation and made a berserker....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">CALL YOUR CREDIT CARD COMPANY.<br />
<br />
By rolling over and taking this up the rear, you're encouraging them to use these nasty no-confirmation thanks for the money sucker tactics EVERY TIME there's an expansion.<br />
<br />
Hell, I'm tempted to &quot;accidentally&quot; order this so I can call up my credit card and scream bloody murder.  I guarantee I'll get my money back.<br />
<br />
If you don't fight back, you're basically begging them to continue to steal your money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When the order is canceled (which they can do, don't believe for a second they can't change the 1 to a zero on your account for whether or not you have that expansion enabled) you simply won't be able to play the berzerker you created or zone into expansion-enabled zones.<br />
<br />
What a pathetic, money-grubbing scam EQ is becoming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I work for CitiBank in their consumer credit department and I can tell you that we wouldn't do anything other than tell you &quot;you need to dispute it with the company to have them credit the money back.&quot;  The only way that we would do a chargeback is if it escalated up two or three levels and the chances of that are slim.  You contact Sony first then you contact your CC company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The other option is cancel your account immediately after you sign up for your billing cycle, sure every few months you have to type in your CC again, but it beats the hell out of getting ripped off for clicking the wrong box when loading up.<br />
<br />
If you click it without active billing it takes you to their webstore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My account got charged for GoD also. I had no idea I even clicked on the order button.<br />
I will either find a way to get my cc credited, or I will cancel my account that I've been paying for since march '99. <br />
<br />
I feel like I have been scammed. I'd rather close the account then let SoE do that.<br />
<br />
Btw Piglet, I don't believe it was your fault for clicking that button. I'm sure SoE is counting on a good percentage of people clicking that button &quot;accidently&quot;. Thats why there is &quot;Later&quot; button and not a &quot;Don't ask me again&quot; button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did this too.  I used the chat tool with one of their Customer Service Reps and cancelled it.<br />
<br />
I aslo complained about the no confirmation window and asked that it be forwarded on to the correct people.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
I'm just happy I could undo it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I used the chat tool and got mine removed also. Took about 15 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My sister got slammed with this on her checking account also, as was I with the previous LDoN expansion.<br />
SoE either needs to stop the pop ups or add a confirmation pop up (oh and here's an idea don't spam you with it ever time you log in or hit server select!).  It's so rediculious they'll even hit your card / checking with a preorder charge even if the billing cycle was NOT set to renew on the account.  Whole system they got setup is Bogus.<br />
<br />
Sure if you call SoE they'll reverse it if you didn't intend to order it but your screwed on the bank overdraft charges if you get hit with them because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Is there any reason I cant do this Credit Card Chargeback thing 2,000,000,000 times and make Sony bankrupt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Don33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;Is there any reason I cant do this Credit Card Chargeback thing 2,000,000,000 times and make Sony bankrupt?&quot;<br />
<br />
I doubt it theyve been ripping people off with there ****ty ass overpriced products for over two decades, I think they own half the planet now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">what happen if they charge $10,000 for GoD ? without price &amp; order confirm, they will get rich from this stupit trap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Discordja - that's just flat out untrue.  EVERY time I've had a dispute on my credit card, I've called them, explained the situation, and THEY have told me &quot;We'll deal with the company, and you'll never see the charge.&quot;  Which is exactly what happened.  I was actually pretty surprised with how quickly it was resolved.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
I think &quot;I accidentally clicked the order button, there was no confirmation, I called them and asked them to cancel the charge, but they refused&quot; would get get the charges reversed in a heartbeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&gt;&gt;I called them and asked them to cancel the charge, but they refused<br />
<br />
Sometimes but the people above were saying call the CC before they contact Sony.  The first responsibility is for the card holder to contact the business in question and attempt to work through them before taking it to the card company who has NOTHING to do with the transaction other than providing the tender.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Little update on the web chat tool. I used it and the CS rep I talked too 2 days ago said that the God was removed and my Credit would be refunded.<br />
<br />
I don't see a refund and my account is still enabled for GoD. Guess I'll have to talk to CC company after all.<br />
<br />
Bigger and better Customer Service my ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You damned well better believe your CC company will work with you if you are reasonable.<br />
<br />
And why?<br />
<br />
For the very reason Sony thinks they can be an ass.<br />
<br />
Competition. (Or none for EQ)<br />
<br />
What? Citibank won't help you out? Not a problem<br />
<br />
I'm transferring my balance to MBNA. Or Visa or MC or whatever.<br />
<br />
And the CC company (If they are worth a crap) will damned sure want to try and keep your business. They WILL (again if they're worth a crap) contact you to either: a) Get you to switch back, or b) Find out why you left them.<br />
<br />
Sony doesn't understand the concept of &quot;Customer Service.&quot; The rest of the consumer world does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have a little update on this topic.<br />
<br />
I cancelled my account about a month ago, a few days after I had accidentally pre-ordered Gates of Discord. I get my bill later the following month, and apparently following Sony Slimball Tactics 101, cancelled accounts dont cancel corresponding pre-orders.<br />
<br />
So I call my credit card company, and they basically ask me to sum up the story and they immediately place the credit under dispute, telling me that if I dont get Sony to return my money in 30 days, they will forcably get it from Sony.<br />
<br />
<br />
And on that note, officially, Sony can lick my sweaty nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">lol 8) i just dont understand why such a massive company like sony decides to do business in this way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Having charged back charges and worked as a manager responsible for handling chargeback in big box retail a few years ago I can safely say I am glad I don't have a Citibank card then.  It is obviously prefered that the customer call and resolve the issue themselves to save the CC company time and effort, but by no means required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">lol 8) i just dont understand why such a massive company like sony decides to do business in this way<br />
<br />
Because most people just roll over and take it, and so it works to earn them money. If people were willing to fight for their money, sony would stop abusing their customers... but that isn't the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Barious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I have joined the people trying to get refunds for this.  The customer service guy I have been in contact has been polite, but just keeps grabbing random text from the EULA and their billing procedures that he thinks justifies Sony's charges.  The simple fact that there was no confirmation prompt and/or that they didn't ask how you wanted to be billed (like if you wished to use a different card number), makes me question the legality of them trying to add charges to your account.<br />
<br />
Even the EULA only talks about how the monthly fees aren't refundable, and it never once says you give them authorization to bill you for any amount they wish, only that you authorize them to continue your monthly (or tri-month, semi-annually, etc) subsciption.<br />
<br />
After passing back and forth a few emails with their customer service people, I've now filed a dispute with my bank (I was using my check card for EQ, I know that was stupid), and I've filed a complaint with the Better Business Burea.  I urge any of you who've had to suffer through an accidental click or depression of the enter key to also file complaints with the BBB.  Only the squeaky wheel(s) will get the grease.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">On a similar vein, is it possible to get that stupid window to stop showing up?  I have no intention of ever ordering this expansion, and would like to eliminate this nagware.</div></div><hr />
