<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My main is a 47 Shammy. I have a 20 Druid I play when I need a break. I like my druid, but is there anything other than porting that he can do better than my Shammy (at an equal level).<br />
<br />
I originally started my Druid because people said he soloed so well. My Shammy currently does about one gold bubble an hour, which is about what the Druids claim to be able to do around this level. <br />
<br />
Can Druids solo better than Shamman at higher levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use my Druid to snare, provide supplementary heals to my Shaman when he's tanking, ports to areas where PoK doesn't reach, etc. She's basically a secondary mana pool to pull from if I need.<br />
<br />
Is there really a point? No one can answer that but you. If you'll have fun doing it, then sure. If not, well...then no. Your call.<br />
<br />
In my opinion Shaman &gt; than Druids when it comes to solo, especially post 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can Druids solo better than Shamman at higher levels?<br />
 <br />
  Charm is easily the most effective way to solo, and if it's available will likely outsolo a shaman easily.  Druids however don't get good at it until higher levels and the very highest level charm is likely getting nerfed next patch.  Also animals can be a problem to find, and I've had much more fun with enchanter charms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I was in my low 50s, I thought it would be awful cool to have a druid alt to duo with.  I figured he could nuke for free ( lumi staff ) and heal me for free while I cannibalize ( ES greaves ).  I bought him an ODS, lumi staff, ES greaves, and the cheap ES stuff for free snares, dots, lev, wolf form, etc.  I leveled him up to 47 and he now has all the ports.  I usually duo with a good RL friend ( 57 SK ) and thought the druid would be a good addition.<br />
<br />
In practice, it wasn't nearly as good as it sounded on paper.  He could heal some and do some small nuking, but the effect wasn't as good as I had anticipated, and he required constant attention to have noticable effect.  I believe that he would be very useful if I got him high enough to get charm, but that would take a signifigant amount of work.  I am glad to have him though, cause the ports are nice, but not as neccessary now with PoP.<br />
<br />
Since then, I decided to make a melee instead.  Since I almost always group with my RL SK buddy, I thought a fun DPS class would be good.  I almost went rogue, but decided to make a ranger instead.  I have leveled my ranger up to 51 and he has 3 AAs ( run 3 ).  It took under 50 hours to PL him to 51.  I really think that a ranger complements a shaman very well.  First off, they are self sufficient ( unlike a warrior ), so he can be fun to solo with when I need a break from the constant buff requests I get as a shaman.  Secondly, he has snare which is a critical ability that I lack as a shaman.<br />
<br />
Here are the reasons that I picked ranger for an alt:<br />
1.  snare<br />
2.  self sufficient - sow, invis, SoE later, root, healing, etc<br />
3.  good DPS now - level 51 with windblade<br />
4.  incredible DPS later - once he gets AM3 / EQ<br />
5.  easy of duoing.  It is easy to run him to the mob and turn on autoattack.  If the mob starts running around, I just backup and hit my auto archery attack on the gravis gamepad.<br />
6.  Harmony pulling<br />
7.  Can pass down my Rog/Rng/Shm gear to him as I get better.  Can also MQ any chain pieces I get to him if I wished.<br />
8.  Variety of grouping techniques.  I can tank for him while he melees from behind.  I can let him tank/melee.  I can tank while he shoots, or we can root/rot with me Dotting and him using archery.  We could also kite mobs, but that would seem to intensive to duo.<br />
9.  Tracking<br />
<br />
My goal is to get him EQ/AM3 and let him pummel mobs for over 100 DPS with auto archery attack.  I wouldn't have to run him around, or try to keep him behind mobs ( like a rogue ), or have to keep reaching over to cast spells, etc.  No fear of ripostes or agro.  Just 1 button for massive DPS boost, and 1 more button for snare.<br />

Just popped up with the exact same question =)</div></div><hr />

Ahh welcome to one of the many lovely bugs with archery. There is no auto attack for archery. Have to hit there clicking range attack every time it pops =(</div></div><hr />
