<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wandering about in chadok (am warmly) and decided to follow a raid, as its always a laugh when someone wipes on the royals. *muhahaha!<br />
<br />
They got into the library ok, then suddenly stopped; well some pretty messy pulls but it sort of worked<br />
<br />
seems their rogue had 200 lockpick exactly and could not open the door.<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
This means that the first too doors require a 200 or under skill to open.<br />
<br />
<br />
Infact i am sure i have seen a bard open the first door in to the palace (lockpick of 75??)<br />
<br />
Am curious as to the minimum lockpick needed for first two doors.<br />
<br />
I have a method of getting past the 3rd door.......:)<br />
<br />
anyone have any ideas??<br />
<br />
princes door too....assume a bard can open first 3 doors???</div></div><hr />
