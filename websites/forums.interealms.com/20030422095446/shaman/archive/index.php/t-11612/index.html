There's a quest for Troll (&amp; ogre?) shaman that nets a slow necklace.  Don't know the specifics cause I'm a barbarian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check for quests in Neriak for the Initiate/Disciple/Regent Symbol of Innorruk quests.  The last one in the series (Regent) gives you the neck item with clicky Clinging Darkness.  You must be an Innorruk worshipping Troll though.  If you are a Cazic Thule Troll, check out the same quests in Paineel.  Two are available (Initiate &amp; Disciple) and give you clicky Panic Undead and Panic Animal.  Hopefully they'll finish the Regent quest soon and give us Fear.  :D</div></div><hr />

Effect: Clinging Darkness. The third and final necklace in the series.<br />
<br />
Edit: whoops  :o these don't snare<br />
Wooly Spider Silk Net (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3674) - 3 charges of Ensnaring Roots, instant cast time, drops from Jailmaster in Permafrost.<br />
Crystalline Silk Net (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3930) - 2 charges of Ensnaring Roots, 2.0 cast time, drops commonly from spiders in Crystal Caverns.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are 2 snare items that are quested that I believe are all/all.  One is I a spool of thread quested in stonebrunt.  And the other is a some type of fungus glad from the fungus grove.  Both are quested.  Go to allakhazam item search, and find snare in the effect, and shaman in the class, and the 2 items will be listed with the details of how to get them. Don't think that these are neck items though, they go in the range slot and have charges.  But it's better than nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ensnaring roots is a root spell and not a snare.<br />
<br />
The Regent Symbol of Innoruuk quest probably requires you to skip a step or two since Grobb got messed up and the necklace is limited to Innoruuk worshipping trolls as far as shamans go.  <br />
<br />
There is a Forlorn Sceptre or something from the king in Warrens that has 10 charges of Clinging Dark clickable from inventory.  Swollen fungusbeast gland snares too if I remember right.</div></div><hr />
