<p><b><img src="images/icons/Yin_Yang.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Yeldema soloed</b></p>

<p><font size="3">This just in!  Deranged bear escapes from Ak'Anon zoo, slaughters dragon!</font> <br />
<br />
So there I was, alone in Necropolis after a night of ToV/Klandicar.  Pondering my options, I had paebala and Yeldema nearby.  At first I had decided to go for paebala, but then remembered that they had casters that would heal/gate, and there were often dual wielding rats that I know would kill me before I'd be able to dispel their haste.  So Yeldema it was!<br />
<br />
I set out in Western Wastes, invis but still dodging whatever I saw out of paranoia, and hoping I was going in the right direction for Yeldema.  Well luck was with me and I ran right to him, he's north of DN/ToV along the water somewhere.<br />
<br />
I sat there invis for awhile, watching things wander by, looking for a relatively safe spot to fight.  I finally decided on a spot close to the water, and I basically got lucky.  After making a pet I got 2 wandering Velious Drakes before I pulled Yeldema, but once I pulled I didn't get any extras.  Might not get so lucky next time.<br />
<br />
So I finally am ready, just killed Velious Drake number 2, got a pet that hits for 51, refreshed Voice of Berserker, Regrowth and Celerity, and went to pull.  <br />
<br />
Ran up and Malo seemed to have a shorter range than I thought.  I planned to pull with Malo, instead I just pulled by getting too close then had to run back to camp and Malo with him beating on me.  Got very lucky, had a resist on Turgurs, was down to 1 bubble health before I got him slowed.<br />

<br />
I finally get things under control, basically kept myself constantly torpored, pet didn't need a heal.  Curse of Spirits and bracer nuking was how I did my damage.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Before long my mana started going up while Yeldemas health was dropping.<br />

<br />
Well I wasn't sure if I wanted to try this, but I'm glad I did.  Was very fun, quite a rush.  I didn't really expect to win, part of it was lucky timing.  Probably won't try it again, hehe.  <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Oh yea, battle stats.<br />
<br />
The battle lasted about 14 minutes and I took a bit over 20,000 damage from Yeldema.  Thats ~23 damage per second.<br />
<br />
I cast Torpor on myself 15 times.  Hit Yeldema for 14 full bracer nukes of 263.  Seven spear DoTs landed.  Regained concentration 38 times, interrupted 19 times.<br />
<br />
So I did a little over 4100 damage with the bracer (a little of that from Bramblecoat damage shield.  Didn't have any DS potions or I would have won easier.)  I was out of range of the pet most of the time, but I saw that it did at least 1600 damage.<br />
<br />

I was just about to make a second try at this guy myself. I was going to use the same tactics that you used. Last time i spent too much mana with eb/bane and i should have used mana only to torpor.<br />

<p>Woot! Good job!<br />
<br />
Whoa, 15 torpors? It only took me around 7 to get him down to 30%, malo+turgur at full speed must have really hurt. I only had 1050 ac when I tried, hitting that 1000 mark seems to help a lot (I see you are at 982ac).<br />
<br />
It's slightly easier on your mana if you canni after using torpor, and try to cast it on the tick, so you get 1500 hps instead of the regular 1200. You have cann4 right? With it you *should* be able to recover mana instead of depleting it just with torpor+canni. Your mana's looking a bit iffy at the end there :P<br />

<br />
Not much be easily possible without Epic or Jbb, need that manaless damage.  Sure might be able to kill something like a krup knight, but would have much less mana and would be more risky.<br />

Nah, didn't have the mana to waste on doing damage, needed to stay alive.  Pet, spear DoT and bracer did damage fast enough.<br />

<br />
Hehe when it started running I went to click off Torpor cause I was at full health, and accidently clicked off Shroud of the Spirits too.  So with Fungi Tunic I was at like 1020 AC most of the fight, until it started running hehe.  Can see it in the screenshots if you look at my buffs.  Levitate wore off mid fight, so Torpor was going in it's spot (between Bear form and Shroud of the Spirits).<br />
<br />
Near the end I spent mana redoing slow and Malosini to be safe, and was bracer nuking instead of cannibalizing.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>I must say, the epic doesn't really help my guild so much per se, but it's really a significant weapon.  The combination of jbb+epic+fungi+sow boots really is potent.  <br />
<br />
I'm certainly not ready for this kind of stuff (cuz I'm a wimpy), but I'm enjoying life as a 58 shaman.  <br />
<br />
I wish more people posted little stories like this with screenshots, because I always like looking at them.<br />

<br />
Only thing I had close was when my guild (who is always trying to find a new way to kill me) decided it would be fun to assign me to tank one of the vindicator's pets during the fight...  I had it dead and helped with the other by the time the Vind was dropped by the rest of them.  Have to thank that nice armor Tormax's smiths made for me, made it alot easier. *grin*<br />

Full disclosure from me, hehe.  For all I know a GM could have been invisible and watching the whole time.  Not like I have anything to hide, was a clean fight.  Risky too, another resist on slow or a wanderer coming by would have meant death.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

Assuming this is a serious question (its so hard to tell sometimes, even with the smiley):<br />
<br />
No, to do this absolutely requires torpor.<br />
<br />

Nixx: How come the dog didn't need healing? Yeldema's AE was enough to kill MY dog when I fought him once, and that was with 3 full groups and a 4th group of 4 people beating on him. A 14 minute fight is what, 40 AEs or so? Even if they only did 50 points each, that would be enough to kill the dog.</p>

<p>killing a mob like yemelda  is trivial for a lvl60 shaman with epic and Jbb and malo. yemelda is just lvl53 and has no area dispell , just rampage very rarely.    i've done her several times in the past months and a few shamans on my server farming her.<br />
the biggest problem cause the unexpected roamers if you fight her on the mainland. to avoid any adds pull her in to water, which is almost roamer free.<br />
<br />
btw barbarians suck soloing in DN , because they cannot snare the rats  <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> Nerfs</b></p>

<p>Guys I in no way intended any negativity towards the Shaman Class or the Achievement of Nixx from my posting.<br />
<br />
<blockquote><FONT face="arial,helvetica" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">quote:</font><hr>You knobs.. he did it with endless charge items.. necro's are nerfed because their natural skills are unbalanced.. had Nixx did this with regular ol' mana and shaman spells<hr></blockquote> <br />
<br />
We werent necessarily Nerfed because of what we are intrinsically capable of. We got bashed with the nerf stick so many times because of class envy. So many people posted that it "wasnt fair" that necros could do this that and the other thing that eventually Verant started to seriously look at us.<br />
<br />
Wont it be fun for you when every Warrior/Enchanter/Cleric/Druid/Bard etc etc starts screaming "Look at what the shaman can do!, they can SOLO dragons!". Then when Verant starts the Nerfing you will wish you had shut up. (The entire Necro community certainly wishes we hadnt been so arrogant at times) <br />
<br />
What I am saying is this, being proud of what you can do is great, but post it on private boards, this thread has already been cross posted to both a Warrior board and to the primary Necro board. Once this gets out and becomes common knowledge, once Verant realises that the Shaman is now the king soloist in the game, not the Necro (be it from Items or Mana- and remember this is a game about Grouping and "The Vision"), then Verant may start to take a good hard look at you.<br />
<br />

<p>ulaa,<br />
<br />
as far as i know, yeldema is the only dragon that a shaman can solo.  drop was pretty nifty, a bracer would have rocked... but whats the spawn time?  whats the risk involved?  one stray velium hound, ice burrower or something else = dead shaman.<br />
<br />
it's pretty much a non-issue <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">.<br />
<br />
now if a shaman could solo any of the blue /con dragons in WW, it would definitely be worth noticing.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Nixx! Must have been quite the adrenalin kick <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Well, Verant isnt THAT stupid to fall for that envy-trick in this case!<br />
<br />
Nixx did solo the dragon, and he did well. He had quite some luck (theres not much margin between 1bubble and loading please wait). And he certainly has equipment many Shaman will never see (JBB the least of this things <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">). Not talking about Torpor, which is mandatory for this encounter!<br />
<br />
That said, a Level 60 Shaman in prime gear is overpowered maybe, but compare that to a Level 59 Shaman which is waaaaaaay weaker. Verant realizes that I guess, but you are right. People on Classboards dont <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> actually</b></p>

<p>Nice work Nixx and a great show but...  Be warned.  This is excatly the same type of events that lead to 5 months of the Necromancer being beating with the nerf bat.  And the primary reason we will probably never see any real improvements.<br />
<br />
.::it's pretty much a non-issue::.<br />
<br />
You would be amazed what you consider a non-issue is a huge issue to others.  I thought alot of the things VI nerfed upon the Necromancer was a non-issue until some class started bitching about it and it became an issue.<br />
<br />
Remember the reason Necromancers where nerfed so hard was because they could solo mobs it would take a group to do.  Look above at Nixx's post again, or the one about soloing juggs or the Crypt in Seb, or the Seb zone out.  <br />
<br />
I love seeing what you guys can do [even made a shaman, 38th lvl now], so I would hate to see you come under the watchfull eye of VI.<br />

<p>.::Nothing is going to get nerfed for crying out loud::.<br />
<br />
LOL.  Just keep believing that.  I remember when when Warriors complained about our Pets, which resulted in about 3 different nerfs.  Groups began complaining about Necromancers soloing the Lord, Frezny room in LG.  So Charm Undead was nerfed.  Player complained because groups of Necromancers where slaying mobs well above their level with Life Taps, so Life Taps where nerfed.<br />
<br />
I am sure you see the trend here.  When enough start to envy what you can do, you will understand the nature of it.  I am not saying that it should be nerfed [and I hope it does not] but I would be careful, you are treading upon the same area that Necromancers once did and we payed the price for it.<br />
<br />
As most Necromancers will remind you "Necromancers most pay the price for their ability to solo, that price is their weakness in groups and raids" [abashi's comment during a Necro thread].<br />

<p>Except that necromancers freaking rock in groups, in addition to being incredible soloists.  Good necros are awesome; bad necros are a huge liability.  They don't have that same disportionate power in raids, so they feel abused.  I'm just not "with it" on these necro complaints.  <br />
<br />
Don't want to drag this off-topic though.  I enjoy posts like these from Nixx.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

While I agree with that, the same can be said for Shamans.  Not saying that Shamans will be nerfed but just warning that it was these same kind of things that drew vast amount of envy against the Necromancer and resulted in alot of various nerfing. <br />

<p>Don't worry Briljin, shamen suck for xp groups and raids, so it's ok if they can solo better than necros.  After all from reading this board, we know that not having lure based slow cripples the shaman class and that torpor sucks and it's all Nixx's fault.<br />

Hey, maybe your email about the fungal staff trick and my shaman email will reach them about the same time and we can all have TWO nerfs.<br />
<br />
But you wont mind about the staff trick because you dont have one. Too bad you own a shaman tho. I dont own a shaman anymore, so i guess that gives me carte blanche, much as you dont mind nerfing others because you dont own a staff.</p>

<p>Shaman are NOT OVERPOWERED, rather they are at a state that all other classes should be, kick ass in groups and powerful soloers.  This is the kind of 'Balance' that Verant should be pursueing with other classes, that by lvl 60 you are capable of truely heroic feats even if a group or raid isnt happening at the moment, that at lvl 60 and years of playing, and camping/raiding for the right gear, you arent just a mere cog in the guild raid machine...  If VI seizes this to nerf a class that truely seems as 'balanced' as any in EQ have ever been, it would be a shame.<br />
<br />
Shaman might become the twink flavor of the month like enchanters (pre Velious), then rogues  and recently shadowknights were, however like wizards they dont really come into power till very high lvls and so most people will lose patience pre 34...</p>

First off, Verant knows about the double-regrowth stacking issues.  I wrote in asking if it was legit or an exploit over a month ago AND asked a GM.<br />
<br />
And I don't see this proving anything of the sort.  What do we know?  Level 60 shamans can mitigate damage well with slow and torpor?  That's no shock.  That the JBB and Spear of Fate do reasonable mana-free damage?  Gee, alert the press.<br />
<br />
I think I can pretty much sum the rest of the post as: "wah."<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

Zrazzt thanks for quoting me...<br />
I don't see this as a big deal really...<br />
The shaman that I mentioned that had soloed that dragon, died about 4 times trying...<br />
But he didn't care becuase he was level 60 with exp to burn...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A necro could easly solo this guy...<br />
Again he's really low level... 51... NO AE...<br />
So if you can kite him you have it made...<br />
<br />
There are several spots in WW that have no romers... Find them.. Pull said dragon and kite him...<br />
<br />
You do know how to kite?<br />
<br />
hell you could do it about 3times faster than a shaman could and with less risk...<br />

Should it also be mention that Necros are the only class that I know of that can solo the Priest of Discord?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> too funny</b></p>

<p>Great fight Nix. That was by NO means an easy fight for any shaman even the Super Uber ones.  There are so many random factors that could have ruined the whole event.  As for this "Nerf" crap guy i remember when they nerfed that charm trick and all us Necro's(yesa i played a necro) who KNEW what we were doing sorta just went "Oh Well" lets do it this way then and we got the spawn split up another way. Resourcefullness is key to anything.  Also remeber that whole necro issue went to hell when Kunark came out.  VI just went oh well now you can just muscle your way into the camp, no tricks required.  If you truly believe VI will nerf shamans because they see shamans soloing a mob that drops loot that is marginally good V.S. the fact that his gear reflects a well organized guild of a top notch caliber then you truly have blinders on.  They may nerf necro's and clerics and whatever other class they want but in the end we all adjust our tactics and adapt and overcome the roadblocks they set forth.  I do remeber hearing that statement, "Man you necro's just keep getting nerfed you must really suck now".  This was followed by my Necro guildbrother with manastone in hand single handedly soloing and doing approximaetly 90% of the damage before guild finished him off, to a Fire Giant BEFORE KUNARK came out!!  Once agin Kudo's to Nixx and anyone else that has done this.  Now if only i can get ahold of that dang Torpor scroll sometime soon<img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">))<br />
                            Shamus<br />
Almost forgot..All you NON-shamans do realise shamans cannot stand outside the range of a dragons reach to APPPLY our epic dot?  This makes it more of a challenge for us then say a necro or druid trying a LONG med kite or any other class.  I think if anything we are the class that it's hardest to do it with since we are forced to TANK the dang dragon<img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">  That there makes the risk V.S. reward = in the eyes of VI i am sure.</p>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>Are shamans overpowered? You betcha. Oh, the game *would* be better if ten or eleven of the other classes were as powerful, but shamans in general stand head and shoulders above everyone else. Arkand soloed a level 54 ancient wyvern WITHOUT any level 60 spells, remember? The PoD, BTW, doesn't aggro pets, so any pet class- even an enchanter- could solo it given enough time and boredom.<br />
<br />
(No, a necro couldn't solo Yeldema- not even close. Neither the necro or their pets have the hit points or AC to stand up to an unslowed, summoning dragon, so they'd have to hope that Fear was never resisted, broke early, or wore off over a 20 minute fight- not bloody likely. It might be *technically* possible if you had a necro with a Bladestopper or some such thing in their inventory, but that's about it ^_^)<br />
<br />
Are the items that let you do this 'uber' loot? Not really. If you are level 60 with Torpor and Malo, you *will* have an SoF, a JBB is 15-20k (which you can get in a week of strategic camping), and the fungi tunic is the easiest camp imaginable considering the desirability of the item. Not that you need the JBB or even the fungi (as a lizard/troll) for this fight; although it'd take longer, a fungiless Iksar could do this in a few more minutes (4100 damage=just over 2 extra SoF clicks), and an Iksar WITH a fungi could probably even use DoT's to speed it up.<br />
<br />
Will shamans be nerfed because of this, though? Doubt it. If the old Whineplay was still up, I'd be pretty scared, but now? Three quarters of the submissions never get read, and Abashi has an anti-necro vendetta that means any gripe from a necro won't ever be taken seriously. <br />
<br />
(However, I'd still hope Verant never figures out how to add a recast delay to items, or just how insanely powerful a fungi tunic is...)<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> umm..</b></p>

<p>.::Since I can't post on that other MSG board... ::.<br />
<br />
Did you try registering first?<br />
<br />
.::A necro could easly solo this guy... <br />
Again he's really low level... 51... NO AE... <br />
So if you can kite him you have it made... <br />
<br />

::.<br />
<br />
Not likely.  It would have to be a HUGE track with no roamers at all.  Fear does not work upon 60th lvl or higher mobs so one add and it is pretty much over.  If this thing has as many HPs as Nixx reported it would take a Necromancer several minutes to kill it.  That is a long time to be kiting a mob through WW. <br />
<br />
Not to mention we are talking about robed casters with if they are lucky about 1800 HPs.  Fear is a fickle beast, sometimes it lasts for 40 seconds and sometimes 1 second.  With a 7 second recast time on fear, all it would take is a resisted fear...<br />
<br />
.::hell you could do it about 3times faster than a shaman could and with less risk...::.<br />
<br />
Maybe quicker but definitely not at less risk.  Nixx said he had to deal with 2 roamers [drakes I believe].  Well those alone would be a big problem.<br />
<br />
.::Should it also be mention that Necros are the only class that I know of that can solo the Priest of Discord?::.<br />
<br />
Seeing the tactic really only involves the caster kiting the PoD around while the pet attacks, why could you not do it?<br />
<br />
.::As for this "Nerf" crap guy i remember when they nerfed that charm trick and all us Necro's(yesa i played a necro) who KNEW what we were doing sorta just went "Oh Well" lets do it this way then and we got the spawn split up another way::.<br />
<br />
While that is true [I also soloed that spawn once just to see if I could] it was nerfed because players complained because it allowed a single necromancer to kill something it normally took a group to do.  Sound familiar yet?<br />
<br />
And you make it sound like I am for Shamans getting nerf, well I am not.  I am just pointing out that you are making the same mistakes the necromancers did.  We flaunted our fights and in the end the envy of others got the better of us.<br />
<br />
.::Resourcefullness is key to anything::.<br />
<br />
And Shamans are very resourceful.  They have spells to deal with most sitatuions.<br />
<br />
.::If you truly believe VI will nerf shamans because they see shamans soloing a mob that drops loot that is marginally good V.S. the fact that his gear reflects a well organized guild of a top notch caliber then you truly have blinders on::.<br />
<br />
The gear he used to defeat this mob is hardly "top notch caliber".  Lets be honest a second.  The Fungi is not that hard to get [hell my 38th lvl Shaman has one], the JBB is not all that hard to get [I bought one 2 weeks ago for 13k], the Epic is about middle of the road in difficultly to get [compared to the others], not sure how rare the three of four spells he used are still.  So there is nothing all that hard about the attaining the equipment that made this fight possible.<br />
<br />
.::This was followed by my Necro guildbrother with manastone in hand single handedly soloing and doing approximaetly 90% of the damage before guild finished him off, to a Fire Giant BEFORE KUNARK came out!!::.<br />
<br />
/yawn.  Welcome to the new world. The world where manastone do not work anymore and the tricks no longer apply.  You know what I mean.  <br />
<br />
.::I think if anything we are the class that it's hardest to do it with since we are forced to TANK the dang dragon ::.<br />
<br />
Seeing as Shamans are probably the ONLY class that could solo it who cares.<br />

Yes, I clicked on that little register now link, but was told that they were unot taking any more blah blah blah... <br />
<br />
So I couldn't post...<br />
<br />
From my memory Yeld doesn't summon...<br />
I'll verify this tonight though...<br />
 <br />
Correct me if I"m wrong Nixx...<br />
<br />
So just like the PoD... Let you pet do all the damage while you kite...<br />
And there are two places in WW with out romers... As of 5.12.2001...<br />
<br />
A leave it up to you to find those places...<br />
<br />
And Nixxes two addes came before he pulled...<br />
Reading comprehension 101 here...<br />
<br />
And if you want something to really get your goat...<br />
A level 60 shaman on Ayonae Ro soloed a Named Kobold in Velks Lab that was yellow to him...<br />
<br />
Yes it took him several hours of trying but he did manage it...<br />
<br />

I'm sure that'll really get under your collar...<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>I've seen here, and in the thread that was linked above, people talking about everyone making shaman twinks now.  Never happen.  Shaman are a support class, people generally don't make support class twinks in my experience, they make damage classes (rogues, monks, warriors).  How many people out there are making twink clerics?  Twink enchanters?<br />
<br />
Plus we're not easy to twink.  Give a monk a tranquil staff + fungi + haste item and he'll get 50 in a week.  Give a warrior 2 bad ass weapons + fungi + haste item and he'll get to 50 in maybe a week and a half.  Give a shaman fungi + mana stone + brawl stick... and it will take maybe 1 month?  Who knows, definately a lot longer.<br />
<br />
You won't ever see 500 shaman twinks running around because (a) we don't fit the twink mentality, and (b) we're not easy to twink.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> Shaman twinks</b></p>

<p>Interestingly, shaman are surprisingly easy to powerlevel with just a druid. 50 in 5 days is easily done, just like any other melee class.<br />
<br />
However, I agree with Gikk, shaman aren't a twink class. There's nothing that goes *boom* when playing a shaman. You slow. It's your primary role 95% of the time while grouped, and honestly, slowing isn't a fireworks display of eyecandy <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> hmm...</b></p>

<p>.::From my memory Yeld doesn't summon::.<br />
<br />
Hmm...  Seeing most seem to claim his is 51st to 53rd lvl I would expect him to summon.  As all 51st+ lvl mobs do so.<br />
<br />
.::And there are two places in WW with out romers... As of 5.12.2001::.<br />
<br />
I think you are missing the point.  Look at it this way.  If it takes me 5 minutes to fear kite and kill an Old Wurm in SF [has been a while] and this mob has about twice as many HPs..  It would not have to be an area, it would have to be a HUGE TRACK.  We are talking about maybe 8 - 10 minutes of it being feared.  Now if you can tell me there is an area that BIG in WW, I want a loc!<br />
<br />
.::And Nixxes two addes came before he pulled::.<br />
<br />
Before, during or after does not matter.  It only shows the point.  His two adds where both Drakes [which being 60th lvl are immune to fear] would be more then a match for a Necromancer [or probably any other solo player].  So if I where to have just one add during that 8 - 10 minute fear kite it would be over.<br />
<br />
.::And if you want something to really get your goat::.<br />
.::I'm sure that'll really get under your collar::.<br />
<br />
I think you should take your own advice about that reading comprehension.  I never said "I have a problem with this".  It does show the extreme power Shamans do have at the upper levels but then are we not supposed to be powerful at 60th lvl?<br />
<br />
I did howevery point out that while I do not really care, OTHER WILL and do care.  As you have seen a couple Necromancers have already sent Emails off to VI asking where the balance is at.<br />
<br />
I hate soloing [sounds strange coming from a necro] so it really does not bother me.  To be honest, I see 55th+ lvl Shamans as the Necromancers of the old world.  Before VI torn them apart that is...<br />

No Briljin.<br />

To be that powerful, you need lvl 60, JBB, epic, and your lvl 60 spells... there is a world of difference between 55+ and a 60 with gear and spells.<br />
Over that, you need luck and you may certainly eat death a lot more than you will kill this dragon while trying.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>all these whinetheads from disappointed necros made me laugh , because it seems none of these crybabys has ever tried to kill a mob solo in that western wastes zone. <br />
<br />
yelmeda can be feared ....  and necros can fearkite very well in western wastes.  the thing is , none of them tried it yet i guess.<br />
the mammoths give very good exp btw. a ranger friend fear kiting there with panic animal. its superb solo exp ....<br />
 <br />
you just need to know the areas with no roamers. once you found out that you can solo all day.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Whats really comical is how stuff like this upsets other classes. You have to remember tho, most people have totally bought into NEEDING the perfect balanced group to do anything. Therefore the idea of killing something even remotely tough solo or with just a couple ppl seems vastly overpowered. Thats the problem with a thread like this, it gets the lesser experienced player upset and they whine about class balance. Course if enough people whine someone from VI might just listen....There is a lesson here for everyone, and no this isnt directed just at nixx. Think before you post something like this, if enough people view what your doing as overpowered, it could result in nerfs down the road. Ask the necros that used to brag about soloing frenzy in Lguk, or the clerics who could use bp and mok to heal so effectively that they never needed to med. I like the shaman class just the way it is, powerful and under rated by most people, no need to flaunt our power in their face.</p>

<p><b> Am I missing something here?</b></p>

<p>How much HP does Yeldemar have?<br />
<br />
If he's 32k, like many of the minor toughies in Velious, your dog was doing around 1.5k damage per minute, assuming that CoS was always on the dragon (32000-4100-1200*(14/2.5))/14. Can a 51-hitter with Celerity really put out that much damage? Or do I have the numbers for Curse of Spirits wrong?</p>

<p>This is a very very easy dragon.  It has no AE.  Given the right area any number of classes could solo it much better than a shaman.  It just happens to be in an environment that shaman can deal with better than other classes.</p>

<i>Posted by Shamus on 06-14-2001 08:13 PM:</i>

<p><b> interesting</b></p>

<p>That was a rather interesting reply to my comment about his gear(including spells).  So you have a tunic on a character WAY lower then me(i'm 59 without a tunic , but i am next in line for a hand me down tunic<img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">), you got a bracer for 13k(not unthinkable), And your epic is i'll grant you relatively easy but not esactly CAKE(but then again none of them are).  The big thing nixx had that many 60 shamans will tell you is the fact that his spell book is all but FULL!!.  Sure all that gear is nice but as he stated this is WAY WAY impossible without TORPOR. I myself have seen ONE yes ONE of these drop so far and we raid and drop big mobs all over but still it doesn't drop in mass.  Then there is Tirgirs which i am sure he slowed with(i haven't gotten that yet either), maybe i am unlucky but you know those spells are VERY much key to anyhting BIG like this that you are going to solo.  Saying his equipment is not that great without taking into account his spell book is not a complete thought on the issue.  Anyway it doesn't really matter either way, if VI decides to nerf us or whatever then so be it, they will just add to the exodus of us already leaving the game.  I thought being a cleric was bad but man sitting around for 10 hours just casting buffs and cani/medding is DEFINETLY like WORK!!!!!!  I truly am becoming Anti-Raid as of late as have many of my shaman guild brothers.  These little challenges like soloing a dragon that is not SUPER powered but then doesn't have SUPER loot are great distractions for us and make the game fun for lets see..Nixx said took him 14 minutes..that's about the extent of his enjoyment that nite i am sure but then i am sure his pulse was going a mile aminute and he was shaking pretty good wondering if an add was coming.  To me THAT is REAL fun!!! i MIGHT die. WOOT i gotta try it though just to see!!<br />
          I welcome the Nerf VI gimme it.  I look forward to them adding one more reason for me to go play DAoC until Horizon's comes out and shuts VI DOWN!<br />

<p>Feressa, from the one test i've seen, our dog does something like 700-800 damage per minute with celerity on (can't remember if spirit quickening was on or not).  What that probably means is Yeldemar doesn't have 32k hps.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>The thing I love about the necros doing their whinefest is how they are bringing up the "we are mana whores on raids!"...try being a shaman on a raid sometime.<br />
<br />
At least necros only have to do one spell while they whore.<br />
<br />
We have what..10? Sit, med, stand, canni, cast, cast, cast, canni, sit, med, stand, cast, cast, canni, sit, spellbook, take out all spells, re-mem 8 new ones, start from the beginning. Repeat nonstop for 6 hours. That is with 1 or 2 shamans on the raid. With 3 or more it becomes: Sit and do nothing..unless you are the highest level, then you do all the above, while the others sit and do nothing.<br />
<br />
Try it sometime, necros. At least mana whoring and corpse summoning stack 100%.</p>

<p><b> That's some good **** you are smoking</b></p>

<p>mind passing it around...nm looks like somebody already did.<br />
<br />
So Nixx solo'ed a dragon (yeah Yeldema "looks" like a dragon). We all agree (except Ickly da Iksar) that was some outstanding performance, we all know he could 'cause of 1 spell (Turgurs), we all know he got very lucky, and we all know he wouldn't live 20 seconds against any other dragon (pseudo dragon) in WW or elsewhere. So is the shaman class overpowered ? Do we need to get nerfed (they'd need to raise mob's resistances at this point...haha, this stuff is cracking me up), because we can solo a single special mob? The lvl 20-30 shamans in this comunity are thinking they gonna be gods and VI doesn't care for what the truth is, so they will for sure look into the shaman class and maybe delete all new ideas, they were coming up with, for the shaman class. (If you want am example of this read through the logs which lead to the CQ:Sleepers Tomb affair, where the biggest reason to ban those people and possibly disbanding the guild was, that those CQ guys in fact thought they were sploiting and therefore filling their GC with the word "sploit" for half an hour, while VI was monitoring it, just cause "sploiting" for "Itz" is "cool"). If you all "think" (Yes you just think so, 'cause most of you don't know jack ****) we are too "uber", VI will think that too, 'cause they know even less about their game than you!)<br />
<br />
Oh and a few corrections to some nice but actually wrong assumptions some people made:<br />
<br />
1. Yeldema does indeed summon<br />
2. Pulling Yeldema to a "safe spot w/o getting adds is not possible, unless you clear a few dragons before. (the water isn't totally safe either, Cargalia loves to take a swim every now and then)<br />
3. Drakes are NOT level 60, Mr Necro (not trying to be a smart ass here just letting you and some other peope *cough* VI *cough* know that Nixx would not be able to kill 2 level 60 "roamers", not even 1 (hey, wait there's that misth panther in WL...).<br />
4. You need a tash or Malo to slow Yeldema, i.e. you need to channel at least Turgurs.<br />
5. Mr Necro is just trying to help you guys, there's no envy nor any disrespect in his posts. That's the 2nd time a Necro comes to our boards, knowing more and being much more reasonable than most of us. Thanks.<br />
6. No a necro could not solo Yeldema ever. Fear wouldn't stick to begin with and necros healing abilities are somewhat humble. Considering he couldn't ever keep the dragon on his pet, which would die fast anyways, he'd have to tank the beast.<br />
7. Kiting a summoning mob is no alternative i think, unless you'd do no damage. One might question though, if kiting training Yeldema and 6 other dragons to zone is the best way to kill the boredom.<br />
8. A hasted shaman pet deals 700-1K damage per minute (depending on level of the pet)<br />
9. The PoD is level 50 and can't summon, you can easily keep the aggro up and let your pet do the work while you run around. Since Kunark all level 51+ mobs have the ability to summon. Pre- Kunark there was a number of special mobs, who could indeed summon even though they were below level 51 (Fire Giants , Ice Giants are the only ones coming to mind atm.)<br />
10. For all the people wondering whos pipe of crack it is, which is getting passed around, its Icklymuck who initially got it from his friend, who solo'ed a yellow conning (yellow to level 60) Kobold in Velketor. Btw, why in hell did it take him several hours of trying? Was he "sploiting" ? =p<br />
<br />
While we are at it, Mr Poe (or whoever has the nerf stick closest to him)... could we nerf bards too please, i am sure they can solo Yeldema as well...pretty please?</p>

Not all, especially in Velious.  Don't know if its because of aggro bugs and pathing, or gating + unstunnability causing problems or what, but a lot of Velious mobs have some kind of flag that makes them not summon.  Was killing 53+ sirens in SG for awhile in a group and none of em summoned while we park-DOTed em.<br />
<br />
I could easily see a Necro fear-kiting Yeldema.  The bonus for fear being a level 4 spell makes it a hell of a lot easier to stick than Turgur.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon3.gif" alt="Lightbulb" width="15" height="15" border="0"> necro nerf b/c</b></p>

<p>necros were nerfed because they were too "uber" with just themselves and their pet (this counts spells)<br />
<br />
big difference between a level 50 shaman and level 50 necro.<br />
i use these numbers from back in the necro nerf days pre-kunark.<br />
<br />
Nixx is 60. Nixx has his epic weapon and jbb (hello EPIC, not your normal everyday weapon). <br />
without these two things and THE spell, nixx would have been face down.<br />
<br />
comparing necro nerf to this is like apples and oranges. Necros were overpowered, no ifs ands or buts about it. Even with an epic and jbb, tis a fight i'd not like to take likely. <br />
<br />
To me it just sounds like class envy. These are some of the best items a shaman can get that verant has made for us. THE spell included. Big difference between the best stuff you can get and your normal everyday spells. SO please take your class envy and go back to the necro boards. Nixx has struggled a long hard road to be able to do something you guys could do back in the day. I say this as a generalization b/c shaman couldn't solo outrageous things with normal standard issue equipment back in the day.<br />

Sorry I dont get that. let me repeat my self in large letters so that Luclin's Arriana and Fraanz can read it.<br />
<br />
CONGRATULATIONS NIXX ON A STUPENDOUS FEAT!.<br />
BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU POST THIS STUFF ON PUBLIC BOARDS OR YOU MAY DRAW VERANTS ATTENTION.<br />

There was that clear enough?.<br />

<br />
Thank you Rumpa you understood why myself and Briljin have come here and posted on your board.<br />
<br />
1. We are NOT Class envious, I love my Necro and dont want to be a Shaman.<br />
2.We are truly impressed with Nixx's achievement and wished to congratulate him.<br />
3. We wanted to post a friendly warning based on long hard experience with Verant and Nerfs.<br />
4.We wanted to clear up some statements made on this board along the "oh but a Necro could do this as well" and "Necros are coming here to whine". No a necro with top planes gear and Epic could not do this ( as well illustrated by Briljin ) and at what point did we whine?, please show me.<br />
<br />
The necro community has been hammered by the Nerf stick. If you read the Necro boards you will see nowhere, class envy postings. We believe that ANY Nerf is bad (Ask Warriors about the Moss covered twig) especially any Nerf to Class power.<br />
<br />
No we come here to be nice and friendly and you say WE are whining about YOU?. Sorry no, for having been the brunt of Class Envy postings for the last 2 years, the last thing we want to do is start a Class envy war. Mainly cause we would lose when it got to Verant.<br />
<br />
If any of you have read Zrazzts postings on the abi board I believe the pertinant comment he has made is this, and I am quoting from memory so bear with me.<br />
ABSOR/ABASHI "Necros must be made to pay for their soloing abilities at higher levels."<br />
<br />
That comment is what we want addressed. That comment goes to the heart of the Necro communties whole problem. We are saying that we are no longer the king solo'ist and havent been for a long time, so can Verant please explain to the Necro community exactly what this "payment" is and why we are made to pay it when no other class is. (NOTE. No mention of any other specific class)<br />
<br />
I was soloing in CS the other day when I saw a druid Kiting 5 Wyverns around. 7 minutes later he did it again. Please, and if any of the shaman community can explain this to me feel free, why am I as a Necro who can only solo 1 mob at a time, being made to pay for that power when a Druid can do Five and isnt made to pay?. <br />
<br />
CannaIV is now more efficient at regaining mana than lich so it cant be that we are too efficient?!. All of my spells are HEAVY mana use, MAJOR aggro and long term DOTS so why and how am I being made to pay for my Power?.<br />
<br />
Id like to put it this way for those of you who are still reading this. It has long been a tenent of the Necro community that we arent such good soloists simply because we are powerful, we are also good soloists because WE KNOW OUR CLASS. Like the Shaman the Necro in a group is a mostly a support class, like the shamn the Necro will only reach High level if he/she KNOWS what they are doing, how their spells work and how to use them effectively.<br />
<br />
I have spent many hours studying boards, talking to Elder Necros, reading posts on Hunting techniques, where and what. I know my class inside and out. I have suffered just as many deaths as a necro as any of you have, or any other class has.<br />
<br />
So please dont turn this into another anti Necro war cause we really arent interested. We arent saying Nerf another class, all we want is a dialogue with Verant that makes sense.<br />
<br />
Oh and:<br />
<blockquote><FONT face="arial,helvetica" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">quote:</font><hr>We have what..10? Sit, med, stand, canni, cast, cast, cast, canni, sit, med, stand, cast, cast, canni, sit, spellbook, take out all spells, re-mem 8 new ones<hr></blockquote>  <br />
Ever heard of a hot key? try<br />

that will make life easier. Also yes I know exactly what that is like. Because like you I have about 20 spells in use at any one time depending on the situation and I have to do exactly that as well.<br />

<p><b> hmm...</b></p>

<p>.::but a lot of Velious mobs have some kind of flag that makes them not summon::.<br />
<br />
I have not noticed that myself.  Might have to check out the Sirens and see <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
.::The bonus for fear being a level 4 spell makes it a hell of a lot easier to stick than Turgur::.<br />
<br />
Actually that is incorrect.  The lower level verison carries a resistance bonus, making it easier to resist and has a shorter duration.  The 34th lvl still has a resistance bonus but a bit longer duration and the 54th lvl on [which most never use] has no resistance modifier but has a shortier duration then Invoke Fear and costs twice the mana.<br />
<br />
.::I could easily see a Necro fear-kiting Yeldema::.<br />
<br />
If [and a big if] a Necromancer could get a large enough track with no roamers and no short duration fears, then MAYBE.  But that is a rather big IF.<br />
<br />
.::At least necros only have to do one spell while they whore::.<br />
<br />
That is probably the most assisne comment upon this thread thus far.  There is a HUGE difference.  Shamans know they where a support class.  They know that their job was to enhance the group and debiliate the mob.  It has been that way since first level.  Necromancers where never mana stones UNTIL VI went crazy with magic immune mobs.  If you miss that vary obvisious point them you are utterly clueless.<br />
<br />
.::big difference between a level 50 shaman and level 50 necro::.<br />
<br />
And there is a big difference between a level 60 Shamana and  a 60 Necro.  Come on and admit it, a 60th lvl Shaman with some [on average not to hard to come by equipment] is a monster.  Look at some of the stuff you guys solo.  I am not saying it is wrong that you can but atleast admit it for christs sake.<br />
<br />
.::Nixx has his epic weapon and jbb (hello EPIC, not your normal everyday weapon).  without these two things and THE spell, nixx would have been face down::.<br />
<br />
The epic is not the hardest to get by a long shot, I have seen 50th lvl Shamans posting here that have one.  The JBB is not that hard to get.  And to be honest if it was not for the Slow Nixx would have never lasted 20 seconds.  His equipment made him able to do the damage but the Slow made the fight even possible.<br />
<br />
.::Necros were overpowered, no ifs ands or buts about it::.<br />
<br />
Where they overpowered because they could solo mobs that it normally took a group to take down?  If so I would direct you to some of the brag solos posted here.  Necromancers where nerfed due to envy from other players because they use to do things such as Nixx and others have shown high level Shamans can do.<br />
<br />
.::SO please take your class envy and go back to the necro boards::.<br />
<br />
LOL.  Can you point to ONE stop where I said I disagreed with Shamans being able to do this?  Even one?!?  Hell I could careless what you are able to solo, it does not change one aspect of how I play the game.  <br />
<br />
Funny I have noticed a couple other shamans agree with me but are you flaming them?  No, it is because my primary is a Necromancer that so many of you attack me.  Well, no I will not leave because <br />
a) You have no control over what or where I post <br />
b) I do play a Shaman<br />
c) I give less then two f'ing cents what you say or think.<br />
<br />
Did I make that clear enough for you to understand?<br />
<br />
.::So I think I am just gonna go QUAD kite with my druid since my shaman is OVERPOWERED::.<br />
<br />
I have to agree that is pretty damn impressive aswell but I also do not really care about quad kiting either.  Different solo styles.<br />
<br />
.::5. Mr Necro is just trying to help you guys, there's no envy nor any disrespect in his posts. That's the 2nd time a Necro comes to our boards, knowing more and being much more reasonable than most of us. Thanks::.<br />

<p><b> hmm.</b></p>

<p>It's kind of interesting the comparison of a 60 necro VS a 60 shaman. Yes, i'l grant you a 60 Shamn is a monster.  I also believe that VI has to get their heads out of their collective bottoms and give back Necro's what they took.  Sure they got nice cool new pets in Kunark but i mean really the 55 shaman pet with correct buffs and agor managment is every bit as strong as theirs.  Is this fair? Probably not but somehow they believe it is.  Another thing is that i have talked to many high lvl necro guildmates and they generally say that they could care less about their soloing power and want more of a role in Grouping situations.  Most say they can solo just fine ATM with what they have but they are WAY lacking in the grouping/raiding department.  I do have to agree there, not sure what they can do to fix it but a little more variety VS the Environment would be nice hell maybe some cool new necro buffs that are helpful/harmful in another way.  As for the equipment somparisons i wonder what EQ would be like if instead of the JBB dropping in the crypt that the Bone Braclet of Condemnation or maybe even the Boots of Bladecalling. Granted they would prolly not have the stats but if they just had the affects then i think Necro's and Mages would be more at an advantage.  Either way once they get these items they gain a measure of power that seperates them from the High lvl ones and the Uber ones.  Lets not forget also that ALthough both Necro and Mage Epics are difficult to obtain they are WELL worth obtaing.  I do have to say that the Mage one is a wee bit more powerful though(come on that pet impresses me on every raid).   If VI decides they gonna Nerf they will.  If they don't then they Won't, either way lets just congrats Nixx on a fine accomplishment as well as to all those of EVERY class that have pulled off great feats such as this.  Grats guys You all prove that even the seemingly impossible can sometimes be possible<img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

If a shaman could only wear the same type of equipment that, say, necros can, Nixx would have been beat into a fine, red paste. HORRORS! SHAMANS CAN WEAR ARMOR! NERF!<br />

<p>good post Ulaa.  We got a Necro in our guild who used to love the class.  He has since switched to playing a warrior due to the lack of options for necros on high level raids.  I agree with everything you said in your post.  Anyway I don't think anyone gains anything when another class is nerfed.  Verant needs to get on the ball and realize that there are other classes besides warriors,clerics,rogues.  At level 60 and 2 years played time, I assume most have made thier friends and enjoy playing with them each night.  to make a class pay for solo ability is pretty stupid.  Was bored waiting for my guild to log into TOV tonight on innoruuk<img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> fired up test and forgot I had a lvl 7 shaman on there.  /who all nixx had him in tov.  he was soloing in there! hah jk<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<br />
That is pretty much the opinion of most 55th+ lvl Necromancers.  We understand that soloing has become pointless in the upper levels.  I can easily get much better xps in a good group in the lower areas of Seb or HS then I could soloing.  These days soloing is more about brag rights then xps.  Something I really careless about.<br />
<br />
.::Lets not forget also that ALthough both Necro and Mage Epics are difficult to obtain they are WELL worth obtaing::.<br />
<br />
While I agree upon the Mage epics [that damn pet is scary, seen one take two Specter pets at the same time and live!] the Necromancers epic will only really enhance the solo aspect of the Necromancer.  Personally I run around with Zland's Heart [love regen items] and I am more then happy with to use that.<br />
<br />
.::Nixx is a KICK ASS shaman::.<br />
<br />
Never doubted that fact and I respect anyone that is willing to play upon the test server knowing the risks involved.  You guys are very lucky that Nixx is such an active member of this board.  Most classes do not have that kind of repersentation within their own class.<br />

Yes some did but really a minority and it died down rather quickly.  The biggest issues Necromancers have with the Spear of Fate is it does not stack with Splurt.  So it removes one of our better DoTs if we group with a Shaman [may aswell use the free damage].<br />

I think there was actually a bigger uproar over SKs getting summon corpse.<br />

Dots - Spear ~1500, Bane 1600, Pox 1800, Ebolt 1200, Plague 1400 and all stack.<br />

Pet<br />
<br />
Movement:<br />
Sow (+sow boots), group scale, Gate, ports to Field of Bone, Everfrost, Swamp, pottery and faction = port to thurgardin, invis / invis to undead, feign death ring<br />
<br />
Combat Crowd Control:<br />
Slow + ae slow, root, snare spear / quest snare necklace, unresistable debuff in Malo / insidious <br />
<br />
Buffs:<br />
Stat buffs, Focus, Jbone bp AC/damage shield, potions for 30 pt damage shields, regen + speed + Heals<br />
<br />
Items - fungi tunic + regrowth + staff regen + aura of battle + bard song + bear + troll is almost 100 hps per 6 seconds. . Access to a range of great weapons / armor with Kael armor = Kunark warrior AC<br />
<br />
Overall a pretty sweet package...</p>

<p>The three arguably greatest soloing classes, necros, druids, and shamans, each depends on different things to kill different kind of mobs. There are normally three reasons to solo, bragging rights, exp, and farming items. The three classes are not equal when dealing with these three situations.<br />
<br />
First, lets talk about shamans. The shaman's greatest asset is the ability to use armor, and the spell Turgurs. To be able to solo well a shaman HAS to have decent equipment, if not absolutely needing one of the 3 toys(jbb, fungi, epic) to be able to do certain thing. With good equipment, a shaman is perhaps best at soloing for bragging rights, because all you have to deal with is 1 mob, and that mob is operating at 25% efficiency. With the correct equipment (jbb, fungi, epic) a shaman can almost solo 1 mob at a time non-stop for exp, and with the same equipment a shaman can farm multipul mobs at the same time for items pretty easily.<br />
<br />
Necromancers are 95% dependent on their spells(the pet is a spell), it is the only source of power they have, and to be honest, it's the only source of power they need. The necromancer excels in exp camps and farming, because there is little to no risk involved, and can literally kill things non-stop for a long period of time(my first main was necro, 1-50 took 20 days on a main char with a lvl 34 pet). Necros are slightly less keen when soloing for bragging rights, but as long as fear can land reliably, it's no big deal. Necromancers were the first to solo the Dino in OOT, and was the ONLY class able to do it until shamans gained the necessary equipment to do so. Hence, this is the reason necros go nerfed so much. Other classes depend on a few sources of power, while necros only needed their spells. With spells like harmshield and FD, I don't recall dying even once trying to do something that was deemed "impossible". Is it justified? Each person has his/her own opinion.<br />
<br />
Druids. They are pathetic at bragging-rights type encounters. Anything that summons will kill a druid quickly. They can use decent armor, and with the right equipment they can get to 800ac fairly easily. The ES arms help them with exp soloing quite a bit, since their root line last a lot longer. They are good at farming 1 mob at a time. Because of their lack of a way to regen mana, they cannot farm multipul mobs like shamans and necros. Before kunark, Druids were a distant 2nd after the necros in terms of soloing, but with the introduction of quad kite, they seem to be 1st. However, quad kite is limited to mobs with relatively low HP, and if they get any adds, they have to either gate or zone, there is no other way around it. The greatest problem with a druid compared to the other two is their inability to regen mana quickly, thus they are extremely limited when low on mana.<br />

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>Actually to their credit, druids can go significantly above the 800ac mark with the right equipment. One of our guild druids is riding above 900ac buffed even without any Kael gear, and still has basically maxxed wisdom.<br />
<br />
Of course  he still can't really solo summoning mobs, since even at 1100+ ac tanks get hammered vs unslowed mobs. More ac just means he dies less quickly.<br />
<br />
There is one other soloer of 55+ mobs that really springs to mind for me, but it's situational. Enchanters can charm solo some amazing things using Dictate. Stuff a shaman really couldn't even touch due to either location or magic resistance. But again, highly highly situational.<br />

FYI, shaman soloing is very situational.  I don't like soloing casters, really sucks when something gates or heals.  With no snare I have to make sure I have room for things to run, or have to kill fast.  If I die on Velious it's either a long run back to my corpse from my bind spot (firepots), or I have to get some help from a druid/wizard or cleric.<br />

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>Basically it's the way it always has been:  shaman are very good at soloing single melee mobs.  And this is the first time, and perhaps only time we can better than necros.  Nixx pushed the envelope on that one, but it doesn't represent any seachange in class abilities.<br />
<br />
It is a lot dependent on gear, which is fine since that's true for a lot of classes.  And it's contingent on being level 60.  A level 59 could not do that.  I couldn't deal with 20000 of damage with fungi, regrowth and chloroblast.  <br />
<br />
A level 60 guy with uber gear should be able to do some amazing things; it's one of the reasons we all want to level.  I really think all classes are extremely rich and viable.  If there's one level 60 class that should complain, it might well be druids.  I haven't seen enough in action to really say though.<br />
<br />
Fundamentally, it's very cool, but I don't see how it effects gameplay much because well, so what?  It's not like he's doing it for experience, or item farming.  It takes too long and it's too dangerous to be anything other than a rare bragging right ritual.  <br />
<br />
Still, I can't wait to try it.  <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> hi</b></p>

<p>Nixx so powa<br />
<br />
Spells: Torpor: Any shaman that doesn't have Torpor wouldn't be able to do this. Torpor = 1200 hitpoint heal, 300 hitpoints/tick, 4 ticks for 200 mana. This is easily the most mana efficient heal in the game besides complete heal.<br />
<br />
Malo: resistance debuff: cold, fire magic disease blah blah. I don't know if jaundiced bracer does 263 per hit always, but I'm assuming it doesn't, so lower cold resist on target = good. Slow is magic based, lower magic resistance on target = better chances of a slow.<br />
<br />
Canni 4: 148 hitpoints into 78 mana. Canni 3 x2 but without the obscene fizzle rate. This is good. Fizzling wastes a second; wasting time while fighting anything isn't good, obviously.<br />
<br />
Equipment: Spear of fate. The shaman epic, duh.. has a right click effect of a 1200 point dot - splurt based (damage accumulates). Doesn't stack with Splurt, Bond of Death(Vexing Mordinia), or higher level spear dot.<br />
<br />
Jaundiced bone breastplate: I'm assuming Nixx has better, but the effect on the jbbp is a 22 armor 3 damage shield buff. A previous poster mentioned that the bp did 178 damage over the fight. Not much, but I guess that's okay.<br />
<br />
Jaundiced bone bracer: Shaman bracer that has a right click effect of 263 point direct damage spell. = good.<br />
<br />
Fungi tunic: 15 point regrowth added to regen rate.<br />
<br />
Fungi staff: 15 point regrowth added to regen rate, there's a sploit to get normal regrowth and staff regrowth to stack, but I don't.. well, I don't want to tell you. [No, I do not have a staff.]<br />
<br />
Yeld infoz: Yeldema.. level 53 drake/dragon whatever, summons, hits for 180 or so. Slowable, obviously, is not immune to anything.<br />
<br />
Zone crap: West wastes = many dragons, lots of things. To be quite honest with you, the gravid drakes are harder than Yeldema [when I was tanking, anyhow]. It's the roamers that would screw over somebody, not Yeld herself.<br />
<br />
Conclusion.. without a lot of the above mentioned items and spells, the fight is (more or less) impossible. Items and junk alone don't make things doable though - it's the player's skill and understanding of things that make it possible. Nixx has all of these. Hoorah. So powa = nixx<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Yeld hit me for around 219. When Nixx didn't have any wanderers it wasn't really 'luck.' More like he killed the wanderers that came by, the 2 drakes. Also, when elephants/rhinos replace the drakes/wurms/wyverns they don't agro if they wander.<br />

<p>Pardon me **Busseux raises a hand**  But did I read somebody saying that lvl 50 is possible in 20 days?  If so:<br />
<br />
1.) What the $#@! have I been doing wrong?<br />
<br />
2.) Does this strategy exclude sleep?<br />
<br />
3.) Would this strategy allow me to remove myself from my    computer chair?<br />

<p>-------- The necromancer excels in exp camps and farming, because there is little to no risk involved, and can literally kill things non-stop for a long period of time(my first main was necro, 1-50 took 20 days on a main char with a lvl 34 pet). ---------<br />
<br />
        This being said i can very well see a necro get to 50 in 20 days IF he knew exactly where to go to hunt and most likely used an old quest that is not NEARLY as good as it used to be.  If he was a twink then this is a no brainer 20 days is easy.  This is 20 days of play not 20 days on your character i am talking of.  Hell on Luclin it is common knowledge that the first Gravelord was a twink of a 60 shaman named Papazol who did it over the course of 4 weeks.</p>
<hr>
<i>Posted by Boinshar on 06-16-2001 06:42 PM:</i>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>Hehe, when my necro hit 50 about 4 monthes after release, there were maybe 10 quests in working order throughout EQ. The best robe was oracle, and the highest int anybody had achieved was like 180. An uber twink in those days used PGTs and a full suite of bronze, twinked casters almost didn't exist, considering there were maybe 20 people over lvl 40 on the server at the time.<br />
<br />
The point is, an almost naked necro with the knowledge of how to use his spells can out level anybody by a huge margin back then, that's one of the reasons we got nerfed so badly. It's a different story nowadays, but then again, the last major necro nerf was probably over a year ago.<br />

How many people out there are making twink clerics?  Twink enchanters?<br />

Plus we're not easy to twink.  Give a monk a tranquil staff + fungi + haste item and he'll get 50 in a week.  Give a warrior 2 bad ass weapons + fungi + haste item and he'll get to 50 in maybe a week and a half.  Give a shaman fungi + mana stone + brawl stick... and it will take maybe 1 month?  Who knows, definately a lot longer.<br />

Ok, it seems there is a lot of experienced players posting here, and I don't want to sound like Im an idiot, but it is just mind boggling to me that someone can lvl so aggressively.  Ok, let me get this straight.  Basically, a quest done over and over and over could be done to gain lvls that fast?  I can honestly say that I have never done a quest.  It seems that any website I go to for quest information, if I type in Shaman/Iksar/search, it comes up with this stupid 3 skull quest that is easy for lvl 10.  One thing that I do to get good exp is solo Forest Giants in WW, but I don't see myself leveling that fast.  Anyone out there that can help with specifics on this type of aggressive leveling?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> ACTUALLY.</b></p>

<p>The quest i was speaking above about was the old(spelling butchered here) Hedi Kiola nut / Trumpy tunic quest in Dwarf city.  It was a quest that gave WAY too much experience and at one point i rememebr them saying people took turns handing stuff to him cause so many people did it at one time it was enough to almost shut down the zone.  VI finally fixed it but i know MANY casting classes and such that did this quest and made lvl 30-40 inside a day or so EASY.  To me that's an exploit but technically it wasn't just bad programming.  Yes, Busseux those lvls are all doable in the times set and sometimes faster.  It's all dependent on how long you will invest at one spot getting exp solo and how efficiently you can do it.  SURE it's way BORING but it's the experience grind we all hate to do but becomes natural post 50. God 59 is the endless lvl, but i finally got my Fungus Tunic!!<br />

actually, not to be diffrent but I have a prety constant group of 60 sk 59 cleric 59 ench and sometimes 3 others tag along.  we are all great players and as such 59 has prety much soared for me, basicly a bubble yellow per 7 hours or so.<br />

of corse I spend alot of time raiding and as such dont really have a true measure of what fast xp is, so not sure if I'm just thinking this is good since thats what I always have goten )</p>

<p>Some formal review took place by me for the shaman and the mage classes and it became aparant to me that they were overpowered a long time ago.  It didn't take much to observe this if only you had a class of your own, high level as well, at the low end of the balance scale.  Yes, they are overpowered and although it is nice to read this and i'm sure it was a rush to do, but it is certain to get the class nerfed if enough ppl push for it.<br />
<br />
Some classes are considred balanced based on their equipment; the ranger being one. It is obvious that you can't claim this guy is an exception, because of his gear, when classes such as the ranger are considered balance only when they have the top gear.<br />

<p>one thing that i think hasn't been mentioned when comparing the solo abilities of shamans and necros is that while a shaman solo impressively, shamans cannot do it for much gain. this is because of the efficiency involved.. a shaman has to do his damage SLOWLY, and if the mob is at all challenging, will spend alot of mana during the fight, either healing or with dots. so the mobs die slower AND the shaman needs to rest up before pulling again. where as a necro can virtually continue killing endlessly with lich + and lifetaps.<br />
<br />
so while a necro can 'farm' mobs for xp and loot, a shaman cant anywhere near as quickly.  the best use of shamans soloing tough mobs like this is really only so they can say they did. and i admit its fun to solo tough things and brag, but its not overpowering, because we dont gain much. it is still far more efficient, kill per hour wise, to duo with a melee.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Clearly this is not something your 'average' shaman can do, and it isn't easy even then<br />
since more than 1 resist on turgors probably means you're dead, and you are most definitely dead if you get any adds throughout the course of the (long) fight.<br />
<br />
To make this possible you need to be 60, with more or less a full spellbook and<br />
plenty of rather difficult to aquire gear.<br />
<br />
(ie. epic+fungi+jbb gear wise, along with enough ac gear to stay alive for the duration)<br />
<br />
You'd also need at minimum malo, torpor, and cann4. These are not necessarily easy to aquire,<br />
they drop quite rarely in fact. (cann4 is not a hard drop, but malo is, as is torpor). <br />
<br />
So,Yes this is impressive, IMO No this is no reason to break out nerf bats-o-doom. <br />
Enchanters are just as capable of killing 'bragging rights' mobs like this one providing there are tough charmable mobs in the area (there are). They require no 'uber' gear to do it, just charm, haste and gate. For Fearable mobs (this one may not be) Necromancers can likewise go to town with much lower risk. <br />

<p>I was on as my bard in FoB today, the noobs were talking about soloing at high levels. Someone declared in ooc that only necros, druids and bards can solo at high level. I said in ooc back, "lol but not shamans?". Everyone there agreed that shamans can not solo at high levels. I said shamans are the only class that can solo a dragon in WW, everyone said anything a shaman can solo a necro can solo faster. <br />

<p>Hate to break it to you, Jing! The Noobs are right!<br />
<br />
Except for a few Mobs (in Dungeons or confined spaces) everything a Shaman can solo a Necro can solo faster!<br />
<br />
Slowly Im getting tired about our perceived Uberness, because we are overpowered at Level 60 with the use of a spell not even every Level 60 Shaman has!<br />
<br />
Ok, so other classes believe that, they are not at fault, but you as as Shaman should know better!<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>I didn't explain the whole story actually. A few of them actually said there's no way any class can solo a dragon unless they exploit it. What really confused me, was one of them claimed to have a 54 shaman and said they can't solo at all. Either he was lying about having a 54 shaman, or was a really really terrible shaman. The same person said all dragons have a 700 dmg AE, which leads me to believe he was just lying about having a 54 shaman. It just irritates me when people say shamans can't solo, and necros and druids are the best soloers.<br />
<br />
Also Enkebesh, show me a necro soloing Yeldema faster than a shaman can. Actually....just show me a necro soloing Yeldema. That was my point. That shamans can solo things that necros can't. Also, I used to solo in sebilis at various spots (usually zone in, zone out, or necros area). I really doubt a necro could have done it more efficiently than a shaman, especially a shaman with fungal, JBB and spear of fate.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Reasons necros were nerfed....<br />
<br />
Necros could literally park their pet in places and FD.  They would go to bed while their pets got them exp all night.  I've seen this happen and I have a friend that has done this.  He would park his pet inbetween the two guards outside of Oggok and go to bed.  When he woke in the morning he had quite a bit of exp.<br />
<br />
Verant tried to change this by making FD a short duration spell.  This did not work.  They had to do something about that incredible pet.  Necros could stick two rust daggers in their pet's hands and it would be like giving him Wonderous Rapidity.<br />
<br />
I remember the days when I would take a full group to camp the fort in LG and one necro would spoil the fun by camping the entire place.  This stuff happened.<br />
<br />
What this inovative shaman did was nothing at all like what necros could and would do.  <br />

<p><b> Concerning Lodizal</b></p>

<p>If you want Lodizal's shell, I suggest you camp him and have 1-2 other people with you to kill him. Lodizal is cake, I camped him in the first few weeks of June and killed him 3 times. I got myself a shield (makes 2 since I had one already), Belt of the Great turtle, and an eyepatch for my level 39 SK, and silly boots. The Cleric got 2 lodizal shields and boots, and the monk got 1 lodizal shield, a club. He had an eyepatch already so that was the only reason my SK looted it <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br />
<br />
And for the person who said every dragon in WW has an ae of 700 is a complete moron who took the information from either someone else or has never gone there. The AE's of all the nest dragons except Yeldema had to be 200 the max. They're easily resisted so they hit about 90-100 on avg.<br />
<br />
A Necro on my server was able to solo a Jugg(hits:~170) but thats rather easy compared to Yeldema. I high doubt a necro could take Yeldema's 20k or so hp. I had a log of it but forgot to do at the start of the fight. Necro wouldn't be able to heal his pet for the rounds of double 219. Also Yeld rampages once in a while (killed my pet and I didn't even realize it, was on me the whole time) Buffed my pet with focus and it still died by ONLY rampages. It died at 30% so had to finish off Yeld with only bracer/epic <br />
damage.</p>

<p>Read this post before, grats Nixx btw.<br />
<br />
Im a 60 necro from Druzzil and in the 3 attempts ive made at Yeld in my WW excursions only 1 had any success, the fact being that if i dont land darkness off the bat its pretty much over.<br />
<br />
The one time i did however, I managed to fear kite yeld down to about 2/5 hp, and would have taken it pretty easily.. but Von being as she is, came in and vaxed the floor with me.<br />
<br />
I'll get her yet!</p>

<p>Hehe i know your pain Serendib.  I prob took 10 attempts before I managed to Solo Yeldema.  I think the Clerics were getting tired of resing my big butt.<br />
<br />
But after i figured it out it is cake now.  I have actually soloed the Brute 3 times now, good fun and really shows off what a level 60 shaman is able to do.<br />
