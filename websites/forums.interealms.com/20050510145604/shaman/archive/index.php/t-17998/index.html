<br />
WHen out of no where i get a tell:  can you cast your shaman loves on us please.<br />
<br />
I do a who and they are 60+, I ask are you in a group, they respond yes, i ask do you have a shaman, they say no<br />
<br />
I respond:  I am sorry but buffing without a shaman present in group violates the local shamans 702.<br />
<br />
after which they got kind of pissy so i didnt buff them.<br />
<br />
anyone else have this problem, my union card specifically states no buffing of groups without a shaman present in said group.  why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I buff anyone if I am not running somewhere, and have mana. I have even run to a camp to buff folks, before leaving. It takes little time, or mana, and helps those folks out.<br />
<br />
Have you ever gone and got KEI, or Virtue? Did they decline even for money?<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I disagree entirely, but it is up to you how you play, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally I probably would have done the same thing.

<br />
As for union cards, well until the shaman union starts threatening my job and/or family if I fail to pay dues and starts making ultimatums to the general EQ populace stating what times of day shamans will be available to buff and slow (but still collect xp and loot all day long of course), they have a lot to learn about unions.</div></div><hr />

I give out lots of free buffs, but I also steer clear of camps and stones so I'm not bombarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love when i get the random tell... can you buff me?<br />
<br />
my response is always.... yes<br />
<br />
3 or 4 minutes later the next reply is always something like... well are you going to?<br />
<br />
to which i usually respond.... going to do what?<br />
<br />
<br />
the conserversation proceeds long these lines and usually lasts about 10 minutes.  It makes for a wonderful time on my part.  If your going to ask for a buff 1) be specific on what buff you want. just saying a hp buff is fine, i dont expect everyone to know the names of all the shaman spells.  2) be in range when you ask, dont expect me to spend 5 minutes waiting on you to get to me and or explainging where i am.<br />
<br />
This is of course doesnt include guildmates and friends.  These people get everything whether they wanted it or not  heheheheheh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Most likely if I did not know anyone in that group then i would not have buffed them. I would have asked them if they had room for me and if not oh well, no shaman buffs. Sorry that may seem rude but I have plenty of friends in this game, and certainly dont care if I lose the chance of getting another because I refuse to buff some group that has the nerve to ask for my buffs but not for my participation. However, if I knew anyone in that group that I would not have hesitated to buff them to the max.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree on this here, never even knew people did that to clerics/encs/shamans till LDoN came out. <br />
<br />
Also *** is it with other classes and shaman buffs? They pay for V and KEI but think cuz we're shaman we don't deserve money (It's not that I need it, but its the gesture that counts). The same people that beg focus/diaku/sta off shaman for free pay 50pp for a single V or KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I often buff other groups while I am waiting at the wayfarer camps ... but I don't recall being asked for a group buff from someone while I had my LFG tag up (get a lot of requests for single buffs, for some reason).<br />
<br />
One example, I had two people grouped with me (we had 3 total, fer da other trolls reading dis), and someone else forming a group had 4, so we didn't quite match up.  when they filled up, I had no problem buffing them (they did ask nicely, which always helps).<br />
<br />
If I am standing there LFG, and doing the occasional /ooc, I expect to at least trade buffs, but I don't make a scene about it.<br />
<br />
I cannot count the number of times I have benefitted from a KEI or Virtue from a friend of a group-member.  Also cannot count the number of times I have plunged on without ... don't think I have ever kept a group waithing while I &quot;make a quick run for clarity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Local 1337 sounds right, to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'll buff aa group if they ask me to, whether I'm lfg or not.. It doesn't matter if they invite me to group or not, I could care less. I have all the exp I ever want, and ldon drops are not a great upgrade for me. Sure I could use some points to get Bane and the affliction augment thingy, maybe a couple other items, but in the end I don't care.<br />
<br />
I play the game to have fun, and if I can help someone else around me have fun, all the better. The main reason I hang around in the camps lfg would be hoping that a kos or 2 will waltz on by so I can have a bit of fun =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personally I think think the group in question here was being rude to ask for your buffs when you're sitting there LFG.  It's like them saying, &quot;nyah nyah, we're grouped, you're not, you have nothing better to do, so buff us fool!&quot;  Under similar circumstances I would've attempted (and probably failed) to politely decline (and more likely told em that if they wanted shaman buffs to get a shaman in their group).<br />
<br />
I'm very generous with my buffs but there comes a time when you just have to say &quot;no&quot; - that would've been one of those times for me.  I might've SoWed them...depending on how long I'd been LFG (ie, what mark on the LFG frustration scale I was at).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">well, the originator doesn't specify if the group was full or not, and I still don't see any reason for the issue. He was LFG, so what? They had a group, and they asked if he could buff them. A simple no would have sufficed. Being an arrogant so and so just doesn't make anyone happy.<br />
<br />
I have read all the posts and frankly am amazed by some of them. It doesn't sound as if they asked rudely, they just asked for a buff. No one can force you to give one, but to not give one because they won't group with you seems spiteful. <br />
<br />
I hate to point out the obvious here but you were LFG. That means that you didn't have a group of friends to hang with on an adventure. That seems to point out that you might very well be LFG in that camp again soon. Those people will remember you and it might work against you. That is all I was saying. Those who only group with guildies have a different setup, and kudos to you.<br />
<br />
I was just going by the content of the post. I get offered cash all the time for buffs, but don't take it. Yet I pay for kei if I bother to get it, and virtue if I am soloing tougher spots. Why? Because I just don't see the market for Shaman buffs. You don't see brisk business at the local buffing spot by Shaman. The buffs just don't last long enough.<br />
<br />
Anyway, play the way you want. I haven't been asked to join the local l337 Shamanz 702. Phew.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you've built a sidewalk reputation - people know they can walk all over you.  That's not the reputation I'd want to build, I agree with the original poster.<br />
Also *** is it with other classes and shaman buffs? They pay for V and KEI but think cuz we're shaman we don't deserve money (It's not that I need it, but its the gesture that counts). The same people that beg focus/diaku/sta off shaman for free pay 50pp for a single V or KEI.<br />
Our buffs are merely nice to have.  KEI is considered a necessity by many/most people who play classes with a mana bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">if someone gets beligerant about buffs I will cast me below 30 spells and scale of wolf.  Scale of wolf really pisses them off.</div></div><hr />

I would have buffed em unless they were on my blacklist.  Mana is trivial, and if it helps someone out all the better imo.  I'll have the mana from 7 and sta back before my group ever notices I even did it.<br />

Its all in how they ask though, I've really lit into a couple people who were rude about asking.</div></div><hr />

This has paid off for me time, time and time again.<br />

In my timezone (not US) Clerics cross zones to res me, most chanters refuse donations, mages spend time equipping me and the pet, I get more invites to group than I need and am in demand for LDON.<br />

By legible english, I dont mean perfect, just not full of plz, thx, u's, roxxor. If a person can't type out a simple well written sentence when asking for favors from others, they are lazy arses who don't respect your time and don't deserve your time.<br />

I've actually had dozens of people on both my enchanter and shaman beg me buffs, after agreeing to, they send me THEIR /loc half way across a zone expect me to run to them and often in other zones......idiots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I tend to see where people are, and provided they are close and not someone who has screwed me over in the past, I buff them.  I do agree though that it seems that lately people seem to feel a certain entitlement to buffs.  Had a guy a ways up in BoT ask me for focus the other day while I was hunting on the first lvl.  It's not exactly reasonable to expect me to bail on my group to come buff someone.  Outside of that, though, provided they are polite, I usually cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">EDIT: I have nothing to defend.</div></div><hr />

I hate tells from random sides of the zone just because i'm a shaman. As for a group not having a shaman i dont worry about that. It not easy enough for me to tell who is a pickup group and who is a group of friends playing who just dont happen to have anyone playing a shaman. My friends and i have tons of combos i play my shaman all the time but we could do a group without and be funny someone not buffing me cuz we dont have a shaman. But heck just my thoughts to the orginal poster your buffs your choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Odds are I'd buff the group in that situation. Maybe not, depending on the mood I'm in, but a simple &quot;no, can't atm&quot; should be enough. Shrug, no need to go out of your way to make enemies.</div></div><hr />

No, the group's supposed to invite a shaman to adventure with, or do without shaman buffs. You want shaman benefits, but you won't let the shaman get some exp too?<br />
<br />
This is where the original guy comes from.</div></div><hr />

I also buff beggars and such, I still don't see the big deal.   All I remember is being level 3 and some shaman casts altuna and chloroplast on me and I thought I was indestructible, and had a blast all night.   10 seconds of trouble is definitley worth making someones night, or making someones adventure easier.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is, so many people refuse to buff &quot;Beggars&quot; and it probably pisses them off that someone could possibly have the audacity to ask them and interrupt their day!   They then get pissed for an hour and go write a post on a message board about it.   Why not just cast the spell, make someone smile, and move on?</div></div><hr />

I read through it, responded then:<br />
<br />
   &quot;Of course you can!&quot;<br />
<br />
... and continued my run towards the whichever place I was going at that moment. Hey, I answered the question, didn't I?<br />
<br />
But other then that, I am not a Red Cross representative out there. I have better things to do with my time then waste it by standing there, LFG on, and buff the groups who have no shaman in the group, have one free slot, and then in the end, invite some random_char_03 and move on. If they think that the shaman as such is useless in their little LDoN scheme, then the shaman buffs are just as useless for them and they should manage then without those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If someone asks nicely for a buff, offers to pay (even though i never took donation for a buff, ever), and is next to me at most 1min after u ask for a buff, i'll most likely give it to ya. <br />
<br />
This &quot;no shm in grp, no buff&quot; thing is questionable imo. It doesn't necessarily show shaman hate. if they have a lot of casters in group they may get a chanter.. or if they have no bard to single pull, enchanter would be better then a shaman most of the time.  If a group is 90% melee and they pickup a chanter then i would tell them to **** off.. and just in general.. here is something that has kept me pretty sane ingame all these years.. use this hotkey that i have:<br />
<br />
someone asks for a buff.<br />
<br />
hit hotkey :<br />
<br />
line1: /r I'm not buffing atm.<br />
line2: /pause 5<br />
line3: /rt<br />
line4: /pause 5<br />
line5: /ignore %T<br />
<br />
woot, peace of mind in the touch of a button !<br />
<br />
at the end of the day you can just clear your ignore list unless this person comes to bother you on a regular basis.. but if that happens using my &quot;**** off&quot; method gets rid of ppl 9 times outta 10 !</div></div><hr />

I think that's only fair. If it was 1 or 2 people wanting HoS or something, I wouldn't have a problem doing it. But giving an entire group an entire set of buffs for free? Seems a bit much to me. I had someone ask me to do this for them the other day, except that I was already in a group for an adventure AND we were at the zoneline fixing to move in.<br />
<br />
I think the larger problem is crack babies who won't leave PoK without a full set of buffs. I can always tell when I'm grouped with someone who is going to suck if they refuse to do anything without a minimum of KEI and Virtue. I understand that it's more efficient to get a good set of buffs, but don't stop the group from starting an adventure or continue to XP just because you don't have the skills to fill your roll without assistance from buffing classes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">guess I should say, I have and will buff people that are 50 and below no questions asked, I've been sitting there lFG and lately i've got quite a following, they will zone to where I am jsut for the buffs.  What I was complainin bout was teh level 60+ peeps that have a full group and chose not to take a shaman because it didnt fit their grand plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Buffing a group that isn't full and won't invite you sounds weird.  Are you sure they weren't waiting for an LD person or it wasn't a group of friends or guildies?  That's the only reason I can think of that a group would rather sit there with an opening than invite you.  I probably would have buffed them since I wasn't doing anything else anyway.<br />
<br />
Unless I'm in the middle of a fight or have no mana I'll give anyone a specific buff if they ask for it and are standing next to me.  I buff random n00bs as I run from spiritstone port location to the pok book unless I'm in a real hurry.<br />
<br />
I refuse to buff anyone that tells me to buff them or just asks for &quot;shaman buffs plz&quot;.<br />
<br />
May as well just kick me out of the union - my dues go to Sony every month anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">It's part of the job for me to contribute to my group/raid by buffing them... Yep.  <br />
<br />
It's not part of the job to help PL the rest of the server by buffing them on demand.  I will almost always ignore any lowbie asking me for buffs.  But, I'll stop and buff the piss outta some lowbie as I pass by when I see him doing his thing fighting for xp.  Help yourself and chance may help you.  Sit around begging so that you can take the easy route... I'm not gonna encourage that, so I say no/ignore to buff beggars.<br />
<br />
If the standard practice was that you get buffs from groupmates or occasionally friends/guildies and that's it... We'd see a lot less of the Buff Beggars/Crack-babies that don't have a clue how to actually play their class efficiently.<br />
<br />
The same people that MUST have KEI for every mission are the ones that can't group with a WAR as MT because they don't have a clue about how to control their aggro anymore than they have a clue about how to manage their mana efficiently.  Why should I contribute to that decline?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">well, I don t mind buffing anyone who askes politely and comes to me. I also never refuse donations, why should I, I donate when I get buff too.<br />
<br />
And to decide on the reasoning &quot;they could have invited a shaman&quot; really takes the cake. To me, this is very arrogant. But any as they feel, you play your way, I play mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I'm a shaman scab apparently. The few times I have consciously denied someone buffs who is in range have been when I desparately wanted to get PoV/PoS flagged, and ringer teams wanted me to sit there and buff em all day when they got twinks thorugh, but wouldnt give me 15 mins of their time to flag my fat ass.<br />
<br />
You think people wont remember you? Its a possibility if your name is some random naming generator crap. Flabbo is pretty memorable, I think people on my server who have good dealings tend to remember me. I've gotten lots of tradeskill component stuff as a result, but thats hardly the issue. Its a buff, it costs me practically nothing to give it out, and it helps others have a good time. You only have 6 slots in a group, and I dont think every group should require a shaman; I normally dont run with a chanter in my group, and my groupmates tend to like kei. I typiclly pop MGB before adventures, barring me expecting a raid call before refresh timer, or intoxication related forgetfulness hehe. Perhaps that makes me a tool, and on rare occasions I may go lfg when a chanter or bard fills my spot in a group. /shrug. I normally got more crap going on in EQ than I have time to do. If nothing else, I can lift weights or watch tv and wait for a purple msg to flash across the screen.</div></div><hr />

Heh, or the same people who MUST have vengeance items, or ft. Or melee with dps weapons... or their 65 spells. Usually, its not a must have, but rather whats efficient. Kei and pally tanks increase exp gained per hour, no questions asked.</div></div><hr />

Sure, but how much XP did you lose by waiting 20 minutes for everyone to run to PoK to get their crack fix? Or waiting that long to get a Paladin when there's a Warrior available and you could start your adventure / group / whatever right away?<br />
<br />
If something's immediately available to you and easily accesible, fine. The problem I have is when groups / adventures are forced into downtime because someone refuses to do something without the absolute best combination possible. And I'd say 99% of the time, the people who DO hold things up do it because they can't handle themselves without assloads of mana regen and an agrolock tank.<br />
<br />
I do just fine with only Cann for mana regen and a Warrior, myself. I get smacked a little more and have to work a little harder to stay at a decent mana level, but not so much that I can't do what's expected of me.<br />

<br />
player01 tells you: &quot;Can I get buff plz?&quot;<br />
<br />
you tell player01: &quot;Sure thing, I'm at the Freeport Stone right now&quot;<br />
<br />
player01&quot; &quot;Huh&gt; Oh... um can you meet me by the bank plz?&quot;<br />
<br />
you tell player01 &quot; Um, ok sure omw.&quot;<br />
<br />
...5 mins later after waiting for the player to show up.<br />
<br />
you say &quot;Hail player01&quot;<br />
<br />
You begin to cast Focus of Soul<br />
<br />
Your spell is too powerful for your intended target<br />
<br />
You tell player01 &quot;What level are you&quot;<br />
<br />
Player01 tells you: &quot;26&quot;<br />
<br />
*You open your spell book and start searching in the back for HOS finally finding it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You begin casting Harnessing of the Spirit<br />
<br />
You begin casting Spirit of Bih'li<br />
<br />
You tell player01: &quot;There you go! Have fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
2 mins later... <br />
<br />
player01 tells you &quot;what about sta and agi?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Now let's look at a different scenario on how to properly ask for buffs.<br />
<br />
player02 says: &quot;Hail Zaviax&quot;<br />
<br />
You say: &quot;Hail player02&quot;<br />
<br />
Player02 tells you &quot;hi, could I bother you for a quick focus and sow please?&quot;<br />
<br />
You tell player02: &quot;sure thing&quot;<br />
<br />
You begining casting Focus of Soul<br />
<br />
You begin casting Spirit of Bih'li<br />
<br />
player02 tells you: &quot;Thanks a lot!&quot;<br />
<br />
You tell player02: &quot;No prob, good luck ;)&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
regardless if you think if it's our &quot;job&quot; or not there's a certain ammount of etiquette that goes into asking for buffs. Ask nicely... and be specific of what you want and be within target range when you ask.<br />
<br />
And PLZ is not a word. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I buff everyone that asks except the idiot who stands in front of me and says &quot;need sow&quot;. How that erks me when they cant say please or ask me specifically. &quot;need sow please&quot; works fine.<br />
<br />
Also if they offer pp I take it to pay for my KEI, however I dont ask, but I dont refuse either.<br />
<br />
When I get the real idiot I gloat my spear of Fate and just say that Im a warrior LOL. if they are old enough to know Im lying they are old enough to say please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I'm with most of the people here. I'll buff anyone that isn't on my No Assist list as long as they are reasonably polite and it isn't going to cost my group serious downtime. Yes, it pays off for me, as well. Not nearly as much as my Epic Cleric's policy of doing a few RezRuns a night when I have time, though. ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>LorriLou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Imho, people get KEI without having a chanter in the group, so the argument that no shaman=no shaman buffs doesn't hold much weight.  <br />
<br />
I buff peeps whenever I'm available, and usually I get paid something.  If it's under 10pp, I'll refuse it.  I think the point is, be nice when you can.  Why not.  This IS a game for kriminy sake...have fun with it.  If you're getting pissed off about a group asking for a simple buff, you need a break from the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">It's not my job to buff every noob that I run by. That said, if I see someone looking for buff in /ooc I'll do it if I'm not busy. But direct tells for buffs make nuts, I'll rarely do it. <br />
<br />
Too many times I'll  see a shaman offering to buff in /ooc, and someone will run by me then give me a tell begging for them. Alot of them must be thinking, that some offering to buff at the nexus stone in pok, is too much hassle to run to when I have a Shaman standing right beside me at the bank.<br />
<br />
Myself, when I want Virtue or kie, I ask in /ooc if anyone casting, then donate for it. I never ask in tells unless I know the person.<br />
<br />
one of my hotkeys for buff beggers is &quot;Due to high volume of Unsolicted tells I am currently recieveing, wait time for buffage could be several hours. Thank you for your patience.&quot; then I run away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I think there is certain rules to follow when it comes to asking for buffs and I dont think all people follow them.<br />
<br />
1. Only ask from a person your looking at and know are in range.<br />
<br />
2. Dont be greedy about asking for several buffs. Ask for the most important to you and thats it.<br />
<br />
3. If there is a regent involved pay for the regent.<br />
<br />
4. If the person asks nicely and avoiding &quot;dude can ya buff me plz&quot;<br />
Or &quot;Bro can you drop some shammy loving on me&quot;<br />
<br />
5. If the person roleplays I often drop a full load of buffs.<br />
<br />
6. If standing there LFG I often buff with SOW for free and wait for the WOW thanks alot reply and thats who gets my full buff line.<br />
<br />
I dont like having to pay for KEI and VIRTUE because the tanks never get paid to taunt? The wizzy doesnt get paid to nuke? The puller doesnt get paid to pull why should a caster get paid to buff?I dont get paid to slow?<br />
It should be based on if the person is in a giving mood and has mana to burn while doing something else. Not a method of becoming a casting cash cow. Simply based on class.<br />
<br />
Ignore the above of course if travel is involved.<br />
IE summon corpse from a necro or a res for a cleric.<br />
They have to actually travel to perform those abilities so I agree they need payment for the trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">If I am not busy, I will buff them.  I almost never accept donations.  You tend to get back many times over what you give out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being asked for buffs:  Will it take me out of my way or slow me down significantly from what I&quot;m doing? If no, buff.  If yes, &quot;Sorry, on my way to do xxx&quot;<br />
<br />
At a camp with a full mana bar with LFG up?  Why not?  When that group finishes their run and you've finished your run and groups are replacing members, who is getting the group, the guy who made your life easier or the guy with the attitude?<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned being walked on.  Buffing someone who asks when I've got the time and refusing when I don't does not mean I'm being walked on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">of the people trying to be nice, i wonder how many go completely anon and the only people that know they are shaman are people that know them already.<br />
<br />
or how many people moved their bind point around in PoK to the 'little bank' or inside a building so the min they zone in they aren't being asked for buffs.<br />
<br />
the reason we don't charge for buffs like a bot in PoK is several fold.  we gave em away for free so long, we consider mana to be cheap, and our longest buffs only last an hour and 12min (without extensions).  <br />
<br />
give me a useful 3hr buff that people love, and i will have a horsie like every KEI enabled chanter i know plus be able to afford Torpor.<br />
<br />
on Prexus, a 10p donation always gets me a KEI buff from someone offering it for donations.  but i spend about 32p (8 each) in bazaar for a muzzle, girdle, and two mage pet weapons.<br />
<br />
by the time i have bought pet kit, buffed myself first to bury KEI, got KEI, canni'd back most of my mana, and start moving; i don't have the mood to start searching my spell book for stuff that will stick on a lvl 30 who wants buffs for free.<br />
<br />
i don't even send the normal &quot;howdy&quot; to guild until i am up and ready to go.  normally by that time i have already gotten a tell or two asking if i want a group.  luckily i never have to wait LFG, by the time i start moving i already know where i am going and what i am doing.<br />
<br />
first is guild, second is group of friends with an eye to adding a guildmate or two, third is duo with guildmate, forth is solo, fifth is quest/faction work.  i don't do LDoN pickup groups, and i make my friends responsible for outcome, if they get me in one with a few people i don't know.<br />
<br />
when i show up for group, the people i group with know what is going to happen.  i sit, remove traveling spells and load the group buffs, cast, reload pet ect spells, cast, reload atk spells; and /g GTG.<br />
<br />
i would rather win friends in my lvl range from being on time, being good at what i do, stuffing any holes in the group, and helping everyone get the exp and loot they want.  <br />
<br />
granted my guild uses TeamSpeak, so all the chit chat and joking is done there. but with limited play time, when i am on, i am trying to get ahead with a goal in mind.  might be work, but i enjoy it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I am never /anon or /role, on any characters. Not my Shaman, not my Epic Cleric, not my Enchanter.<br />
<br />
I also have no trouble saying 'No' if I don't have time or inclination to buff/rez.<br />
Whether they get just a 'no', or a 'Sorry, on my way to X now, but I can get ya in 10 minutes if ya still need it' depends entirely on how polite they are.</div></div><hr />

  I don't mind hookin' up peeps with a few buffs if I'm not engaged.  If the favor goes unreturned, no problems, I ain't lookin for anything in return - it would be nice, but it ain't expected on my part.  Now, if someone can't understand I'm unable to provide a buff because I'm engaged, or unwilling to travel from one end of Norath to the other to provide it, and I get greived for it - /ignore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">See, if I am in the mood to buff I will buff to my hearts content.  However, if anyone knows me...they know I RARELY do that!  I enjoy casting MGB before I log usually, though I haven't done it in ages.<br />
<br />
I refuse to buff anyone who says plz or pls to me.  They say that, I tell them to learn how to type before asking me for any sort of buffs.  Or when one person asks for focus of the 7th.  Hi, its a group version of focus of soul.  They can't seem to grasp that concept.  They think it has more HP than single target, and it just doesn't.<br />
<br />
If someone doesn't know what buffs they are asking for then they don't get it.<br />
<br />
Ohhh and I love it on raids...as the boss mob is inc...and a warrior asks for cha or a rogue wants acumen.  I laugh and say, well after I slow this mob, probably die, and then get some mana back, MAYBE you will get that buff.  But I would suggest checking your buffs well before the boss is inc and asking at that point.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I'm all about respect, if you don't show me respect then I don't have to show it back to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I worked hard on my class, am proud of my guild, and I am one of the few ogre shaman on my server. If I dont have time, or mana to buff, I'll let you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I had a 36ish mage run up to me the other night. I was sick and I was just talking with friends, so I didn't want to put AFK on, but nor did I feel like doing anyone any favors. The mage asks me for sow. I ignore him and continue talking-- after all, putting your AFK message on after someone asks you for a buff is fairly rude. Ignoring them you can at least feign that you were briefly afk. Most of the time lowbies that want sow will run off after a minute or two.<br />
<br />
This mage sat in front of me FOR OVER AN HOUR. I didn't once move and he asked a few more times. I think he was trying to out-afk me, but you never know.<br />
<br />
The point is he sat there the whole time instead of XPing. If people are unable to play the game without buffs, they've got issues. I pride myself on my skill, and rarely have I ever run completely out of mana in a group, I've never blown an adventure because of mana issues, and I haven't paid for KEI since level 59, and I never will again. I understand that it should really add to my efficiency, but I just can't bring myself to powergame that badly. You should be able to recognize what you can and cannot handle with your own power. KEI and other ridiculously powerful and long lasting buffs are the reason that so many smacktards have achieved level 65.<br />
<br />
Which side do you contribute to-- playing with skill and intelligence or leaning on buffs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Is why i resisted c3/c4 unless a chanter was in group for such a long time while i leveled up.

I put my time in so to speak and know what i can do without it being cast or if i get it dispelled wont bother me. <br />
<br />
 Again with the buffs your buffs your call. I dont like tells for buffs i dont send them for buffs to me its like making a phone call and i dont call people i dont know. If i want something i'll /ooc that looking for it or will respond to /ooc's if people need something. But for some reason its always buffed me getting tells for buffs or asking for stuff. Mayve ive just had bad luck. I've had the weirdest luck with people begging so sure makes me jaded. The guy sending me tells in warrens for buffs when i was in the bottom of Kaesora was fun. Dude can i get some shaman buffs plz??? Giving a beggar a lore item and they cant take it , giving someone 20 plat for spells when i my wizard was till saving for lvl 44 spells and was 43 and the guy said it wasnt enough. <br />

If having a faster run speed was really important to these people, they'd play a char who can run fast.  Or group with someone who can cast it on them.  Or buy tboots.  <br />
<br />
Or better yet, BUY SOW POTIONS.  Or concentration, infusion and awareness potions (for casters addicted to KEI).<br />
<br />
But no, I suspect alot of these beggars want to solo, and not have any leeching  of exp from adding in a class who can sow, or boost their mana regen.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I have to say, I do agree with the logic that if you want shammy buffs invite a shammy into your group. <br />
I remember doing some brewing in PoK one day, forgot to put anon back up (think I just got a level and wanted to show off to anyone who might be doing a /who on me  :rolleyes: ), and got a tell from someone I never heard of before, something along the lines of &quot;my bro and I need some buffs, we're about to go out hunting&quot;. I did a /who of his name and he was some level 30's person I never met or would ever be likely to meet so I put him on ignore and went on with my brewing. I distinctly remember thinking to myself that if they wanted shaman buffs they should invite one into their group. They would get what they were looking for and a shaman would get to do some hunting, maybe even contribute to the betterment of the group  ;) .<br />
On the other hand, if I'm sitting somewhere waiting on people and someone comes up to me and politely asks for something specific, I have no problem giving it to him. I've noticed that if I am waiting in the at the zone in area in BoT waiting on a group to assemble, I get lots of requests for buffs from people who's just had a wipeout. If I've got full mana and the group is still a ways away I don't mind helping them out. I did that one day while my group was taking forever to get there, others from that guys group came along and wanted the same treatment, still others saw I was buffing and asked for some too. It got a bit annoying, but I never said anything to them about it and just put invis up when I was tired of being bugged. The next day I got an ivite out of the blue form the guy who had started the whole thing, was a group in BoT. I went out and joined them and it was an awesome group. Made 65 with them and almost 2 more yellow of full xp as well.<br />
By the way, I've never begged for KEI or virtue. I'll pay for it if someone is casting, but thats it. I also never ask for or accept money for my buffs. If I don't want to buff them, I'll say no, if I don't mind buffing them I do if for free.</div></div><hr />

I'm bound near the Time zone, but I've never been bound in POK either, so I can't really relate to your pok point.  TBH, I rarely get the &quot;buff beggars&quot; unless I'm sitting at the Nexus stone for an extended period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">why has this thread even gotten 70posts? lol. imo this is a really weird subject. not complaining, just dunno why you're talking about this  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">if someone gets beligerant about buffs I will cast me below 30 spells and scale of wolf.  Scale of wolf really pisses them off.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have, on occation, done that to l33t doodz that insist on pestering me for buffs.  I load them up with crummy buffs and scale, and /tell idiot_01 bro, with my buffs, you can take a low red!<br />
<br />
Usually followed by /ignore shortly thereafter.</div></div><hr />

Soandso tells you &quot;want to come adventure/ group/ help my group because we are too incompetent to hunt in the area we have chosen?&quot;.  <br />
I reply &quot;nope, but here, have focus (and go away)&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't care if there is a shaman in their group or not (plenty of times I have given Fo7 to a group with a pre-62 shaman).  I get a ton more offers for groups than I have any use for, and I usually do not group outside of guild and certain friends/people I know.<br />
<br />
So they can have their focus, maybe a bih li, sta if I remember. Their chanter (if they have one) will usually cast something helpful in my general direction, same for BL, ranger, cleric, or whatever buffer is in group.  Always seems to be a reasonable trade, even though I don't ask for their buffs and refuse their money.</div></div><hr />

My peeves on buff requesters.<br />
<br />
1) People who send coded messages that dont sound coherent.  Plz to cast l33t buffage!  Will pay!  /ignore<br />
<br />
2) People who ask for buffs and arent in the same zone or dont even know where you are.  Yes I have gotton requests from people who want me to come to their BoT group and Focus them.  If I get a tell from someone and I dont see them next to me then they dont get it.<br />
<br />
3) Also people who ask when I am obviously busy.  If I am standing next to the pottery wheel or the forge I am busy you dork! Leave me alone!<br />
<br />
4) People who ask for odd or low level buffs, including sow.  Find a druid for sow.. sorry.  I never mem sow, i have my booties and i just click those when i want sow.  No I wont mem HoS to cast on you.  There are plenty of lower level shamans you can ask for that.<br />
<br />
I feel the same though as some of the other posters about buffing groups that wont even invite you when your LFG, though often if I am sitting in an adventure camp I will throw a buff on a group if they ask, especially if they offer to trade for a buff I dont like a Virtue or KEI.  I also feel it is a bit rude to ask others for buffs you dont know.  Being a buffer I can relate to that, especially when I play my non buffing alts. Also there are always people on my server offering every kind of buff for donations in PoK.  So I dont really see the need since its not hard to find people who are willing to cast buffs.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, me too.<br />

Ways to Guarantee You Get Nothing From Me This Time<br />
 - You ask me while I am butt-naked (i.e. recently deceased)<br />
 - Your request appears in my chat window BEFORE the 'Welcome to Everquest!' message (this happens a fair amount, actually)<br />
 - You want me to come to you<br />
 - The &quot;words&quot; 'plz', 'thx' or both are in your request<br />
 - You spell a word with a number.  I don't speak number.  (d00d, buffz0r m3 p13453.)<br />
 - You don't PHRASE it as a REQUEST. (i.e. there's a '?' at the end of your sentence.<br />
<br />
If I am sitting LFG, I will buff pretty much anyone who comes up to me and asks for something, including sub-50 folks.  It doesn't really bother me if they don't tell me beforehand... I'm LFG, so I'm not really busy with anything. <br />
<br />
I do lots of drive-by SoWs and I love buffing the ever-loving sh*t out of unsuspecting newbies.<br />
<br />
I've even been known to PL newbies without them realizing it at first.  It's kind of nice to basically give someone a level or two in 15 minutes or so.  I know I wish someone would give ME my next level or 4. :)<br />
<br />
I'm generally free with buffs, provided I'm not in a bad mood.  I've never given scale of wolf to anyone, though I've been tempted on occasion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">If I don't get a group in like 5 minutes of LFGing that's acceptable to me, I make my own.  Thus, I'm not really caring about how wanted shamans are to a group or whatever.  I know I'm good and I know what I can offer a group.  It's pretty freaking sad to decline to buff a group just because they don't have a shaman.  They may have wanted one, but couldn't get one anyway.  I'll buff people who ask nicely, it don't really matter to me.  Keeping reputation up is worth more to me than squeezing a group for a shaman slot.  <br />
<br />
Also, the advantage of making your own group usually is that you get to pick the venue, choose the adventure, etc.  So try that next time, and try to be a bit more social!  Don't depend on others to provide you with what you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">I'll buff people at my whim.  If you are standing right next to me, your chances increase GREATLY.  I always buff friends, within reason; no, I'm not coming to buff your twink that is 7 zones away.  A beastlord once asked if i would follow him to Mseru and buff his warder...yeah...<br />
<br />
Sometimes I'll have nothing to do and run around buffing random people.  However, no means no!  ANyone that gets mad with my saying no gets added to my ignore list.<br />
<br />
Asking a LFG shaman for group buffs was rude IMO.  Although I would have maybe buffed them if they asked nicely; if i didnt have anything to do with the mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Years ago when I had a high-level Shaman (before velius was released i left, for RL reasons) I had a lot of the same problems as everyone else does.<br />
<br />
Now, I am generally a nice guy, and if i'm not doing anything - and the person(s) asking is close enough, alright - i'll do it.  I've buffed before, i'll buff again.<br />
<br />
But the comments that bug me the most are the &quot;It's only a game, why not..&quot; blah.    I dont see how I should feel obligated to buff every scrub who doesn't know how to play without full raid buffs.<br />
<br />
Frankly, like I said, i'll buff if it's not too big of a convenience.  But is it fun for me?  No.  Not a bit. <br />
<br />
Some people talk about karma, about building a list of people who will be glad for the service. <br />
<br />
Do you know what thanks I get for buffing 80% of the population?<br />
<br />
Neither do i.   Most are gone without a word.  The type of person who is too 'busy' to type out anything but &quot;plz&quot; and &quot;thx&quot; is the kind who isn't going to remember your name.<br />
<br />
And that was before shamans got any exceptionally good buffs.   Though it was back when stat buffs other then stamina saw a lot of action because not everyone had them all capped.  <br />
<br />
I will be one of those in /roleplay.  When I feel like buffing, i will announce it with a shout.  Or more likely, i will find a newbie hunting ground and watch a bunch of lowbies rampage through bats and beetles. :)     Thats more satisfying to me, even if i get the same rate of actual thank yous...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Buffing strangers does get old. If they asked very nice and not just &quot;buffs pls&quot;, then I will usually. If I'm at bank doing something and someone stops in front of me, then edges forward, then just Hails me...well, that annoys me and I go hide in PoT. It's like panhandling to me. I buff guildies alot (usually without being asked), and friends...but my mother told me never to talk to strangers.  ;)  Not that I don't, I just want politeness. It's MY time you're asking for. You could be interrupting a good conversation...would you do that in the middle of a restaurant or a park to someone that is sitting close face to face with someone and looks like they are speaking? I should hope not.<br />
<br />
I am NO ONES buff bish. I don't have to buff you, unless you're grouped with me, because then...that's my job there. That's what I was &quot;hired&quot; for. <br />
<br />
Politeness will get you everywhere with me. So will a good sense of humor. Ask me and offer to donate for my time, that assures me you realize my time is just as important as yours. More than likely (unless you're a twink  :p ) I'll cancel the trade and buff you anyways.<br />
<br />
Like the prior poster, what do I get out of this?? Mostly nothing, that's why I'll go buff some 1-10 in a newbie zone. Walk up to some newbie in the middle of the forest and buff em to hell and back - and watch even a wizzie become a newbie chainsaw wheeee...now that's entertainment.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">So what is the group sapost to do? Kick a mamber out to let you tag along? If thats what you think then your an arrogant ass. If you want a payment for the buffs that is your opption but be up front about it. Personally I have NP with buffing other groups. So long has I see the tell and I am actully in the same area. Friends / Guild being the exspection that I will trave to them if they need me to. <br />
<br />
  ***?  If you are going to flame the guy at least use spell check.<br />
<br />
I agree 100% with the original poster.  I think it was rude of them to even ask you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>zymar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Pfft, buffem with the group spells. Focus, sta, etc.  They want more, tellem you need the mana.  <br />
<br />
The second poster was right... <br />
<br />
<br />
You earn a nice rep from buffing like that, people will always go out of the way to help you because you helped them.</div></div><hr />
