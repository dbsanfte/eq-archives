<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Schpleef, you memntioned something about a Druman outfit in a thread about the 8ths shawl.<br />
<br />
I have searched Allakahzam's and asked many tradesmen in game and no one has heard of it.<br />
<br />
Could you please explain what is it?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khalle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol, Druman is an insulting term used to describe a Shaman who wears all wisdom gear like a Druid. Dress yourself up like a Druid to have high wisdom to increase your chances of a trade skill going up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bleh! :)<br />
<br />
Heh okies ty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A SHAMuid is also the same as a druman.<br />
<br />
If a piece of gear is said to be Druidic then even tho it may be shaman equipable it's definetly not what we consider good shammy gear :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well it really pains me to spend my hard earned pp on any WIS item just for trade skills.<br />
<br />
Doing the 8th shawl quest atm and just past 3rd shawl but am already dying trying to get the skill ups for the easy brewing, pottery and baking skills.<br />
<br />
My best wis gear gives me 185 wis but I get very little skillups even in the mid50s sigh..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buy or ask a friendly chanter for a KEI/C3.<br />
<br />
That'll help.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Your magelo has a wis of 180. Add these items to your tradeskill gear set:<br />
2x +7 Wis Rings = 14 wis<br />
1 Chipped Bone Bracer = 5 wis<br />
A +3 or +4 Wisdom earing <br />
And maybe get sort of range item with +WIS (Sarnak prayer beads?)<br />
<br />
Also your arms have zero wisdom. Do a quick bazaar search for a cheap item that adds a few points.<br />
<br />
That should stick you on like 207 wis + KEI (+25 wis) = about 232 Wis + there are a few slots that dont have +wisdom still.<br />
<br />
Maybe go complete your epic as well for another +20 pts!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't forget, the 29 bear form adds 5wis, and the 55 bearform adds 10.  For tradeskills only skill is a factor in success rate (int/wis and some other stats can help with skillup rate though) so see if you can buy or borrow a geerlok for the important combines.</div></div><hr />
