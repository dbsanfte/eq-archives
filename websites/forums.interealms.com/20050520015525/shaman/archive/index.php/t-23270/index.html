<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its following a different nomenclature than usual.  If you'll notice true spirit, for example is &quot;Summon Pet: SpiritWolf242&quot;.  The # is NOT the level at which you receive the pet.  Pretty sure I'm not over level 242 yet.<br />
This wording looks more in line with beastlord pet wording which is indeed the level of the pet, i.e. sorsha &quot;Summon Warder: BLpet51&quot;.<br />
Basically, it could mean anything or nothing at all, since its not final.</div></div><hr />

On that note, the spells right now will be alot easier to get.  I don't know about the drop rate and what they drop from, but how they are given out is very nice.  Course... will be fun for those farming spells.</div></div><hr />

Your right Wulf. the correct word is EFFORT. <br />
But I must confess, I'm not playing in god, my gear isn't that good.<br />
And of course, you have read here that it takes EP level gear to play in gates, so naturally you havent bothered to even put in any EFFORT.<br />

If you're trying to get GoD groups and aren't having any luck then so be it.  Also, I know for the GoD groups I've done, not a single thing has dropped yet.  Bad luck happens also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not in a guild and last I heard in god you bring your own group because you won't find one there. Couple that with the fact that I have limited play time and that my gear is mid range, 2800hp's unbuffed then the answer is yes, I have not bothered to try to find a group in gates. Unless by EFFORT you mean getting flagged and eventually going to time. You should probably try to be a little more specific. And please, don't even try to insinuate that I am too lazy. I've worked harder for the last 22 years then you can even imagine.<br />
<br />
Btw, you come across as an arrogant asswad. Perhaps you should try rewording your messages so you don't sound like you got some huge ego from playing a video game. Building your ego on the successes you have in a video game is like building a house on a foundation of toilet paper. Pretty weak imo. Keep in mind that I am assuming this , (just like you made assumptions about me), and that in fact you may not be like this at all but all I can go on is reading your post so don't take this personal unless the shoe actually fits.</div></div><hr />

Send me a tell some time Gloriana, I can give you a few mob spots where you can get spell drops pretty regularly (Nihils and Daludas).  Actually, Daludas is pretty common in Vxed runs, just kill like 10 mobs... check for the close named pooka guy.. and leave if he isnt up.  Rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Glori, your best bet for runes in Kod'Taz are from the kyv named dudes who spawn by the 3 temple things where glorification, righteousness, etc are. If I recall correctly, it's a 20 (or is it 30?) minute respawn on the dot, and you can get named like Hexxt Deathaim, etc. Also the wandering Cragbeasts and Hynids can pop as named too. I'd have a ranger friend tracking KT looking for nameds after patches or server crashes as soon as possible. If you exp a lot in KT and camp the temples you'll get your runes :)<br />
<br />
I don't hunt in KT much anymore, Yxxta is nice and quiet. Damn you Mastered Destroyer, keeper of endurance augs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I don't know about all your servers, but on E'Ci there are unguilded people running around in Qvic. Camping Kod Taz names requires a decent tank and a cleric and backup healer; the rest is simply luck. If you know the named mob spots, you can farm 4-5 PHs with a somewhat low dps group; with a good group, you can add another 2 name PHers. Give it 3-4 hours and you will see a named unless the rng is really nasty to you.  <br />
<br />
If you don't have access to Kod Taz, well, Vxed runs are quite easy to farm 2 named mobs from the entrance. And no, it doesn't require a charm group to do this, just a bit of intelligence on the part of the players.  Ever since the patch to allow knights to tank in Vxed/Tipt, a decently geared (LDoN+) knight should be able to function as MT.<br />
<br />
I spend far too much time in kod taz (dunno why, but I love that zone!) and maybe I've just been lucky, but we've been calling in alts to loot the runes.  It's all about knowing where to hunt, and what to pull.  If you've got all that down pat, and it's simply EQ not playing nice for you, you have my sympathy, 'cause that is just frustrating.<br />
<br />
GoD isn't work; it's a challenge, it's fun, and it gets you on the edge of your seat sometimes. (ever remember when you first played Doom with the lights off, and the sound cranked up, and you actually jumped when you heard that monster slavering *somehwere* near you?)  Don't be scared away by the horror tales, and don't be put off by one or two failures, it's a learning curve. Once you get used to it, you won't ever want to go back to BoT except when you're feeling really lazy  :D</div></div><hr />

Answer 1:  All of them.  It is easier by some, doable by most.  Runes get ooc'd in KT.  Twinks have them.  Freinds get them.  Some rot.  Take two freakin groups if that is what is necessary and work on them over time.  <br />

I, on the other hand, have gotten Trushar and Nihil both from pickup groups, despite the fact that I could just as easily be deemed &quot;Ms. 5k hp 480+ AA shaman.&quot;  I've seen the rune for Daluda 3 times, rolled against guildies on it, haven't won yet.  Trushar is easy once you hit KT.  I got Nihil out of Vxed - that works for Daluda too, or you can get the rune for it off Hexxt Deathaim (which is my plan).  If your guild isn't Time geared, its not a problem.  Take 2 groups if you have to - put one at south and one at north or west temple, and cooperate to kill the rares.  My last roommate has all but one of his spells (ranger), and he is by no means in anything resembling a Time-level guild.<br />
<br />
You may be offended at the superiority that some endgame players express, and I suppose you have a right to that opinion.  But I have an equal right to be offended when it is assumed that, because some of us are in high level guilds, that everything is given to us free.<br />
<br />
Damn you Mastered Destroyer, keeper of endurance augs!<br />
<br />
I know what his loot table says, but does he actually ever drop anything else?  I've seen enough endurance augs to turn a pet store rabbit into the Energizer bunny. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Some of us are trying to pull thier guild up by the bootstraps. And don't have all that much time to run off and get things solely for themselves. <br />
<br />
Or when they have the time.  There are 8-10 people on and Not enough healers to go around. So instead of 6 man runs we do Ferubi with 8-10. <br />
<br />
That way everyone has a bit more fun at the expense of Me not getting spell sooner. (Shrug)<br />
<br />
Plunty of effort expended on my part. In more ways than some snot nosed punks will ever understand. Just because someone doesnt have the best gear certainly doenst mean they are ignorant. Or unskilled. In fact next time some Time plus person starts mouthing off try running around in my gear and doing what I do day in and day out. <br />
<br />
I suggest you just hush up and enjoy your little god mode charecter while pounding away at triviel content and reassuring yourself that you are superiour in every way. <br />
<br />
I might choose to not raid. But I assure you that in no uncertain terms that I play a shaman to the best of my ability, and that ability is not found lacking. <br />
<br />
All raiders are not pricks. In fact some of my oldest friends in the game are raiders. But much like Droods of years past. You seem to get a greater collection of self serving egoistical pricks converging towards the uberguilds for what those said guilds can give them.  You rarely see the same egotistacal pricks in the smaller guilds (Well unless they are leaders of said guild) Because the lack of power curve and upgrades just don't seem to intrest them as much.<br />
<br />
This game is made and broken by the players involved with it. So please stop being a dick. And assuming that people are all cut from the same cloth. Be they raider. Non raider. Or some ******* like myself that has a little too much time on thier hands.  <br />
<br />
Effort is required in all things even playing a game well. But certain things in EQ do not reward Effort. Just who you know. And the luck of the Random number generator rules all with an iron fist. <br />

<br />
Well no offense, cause i know your just seeing the world from another place then i am. But as a solo shaman with no guilds to help, i would like to see how your attitude would change without so much support.<br />
<br />
Try sitting LFG in GoD and putting a group together, atleast on MT. I sit there for hours literaly, tossing away invites to EXP and LDoN's only to finaly drag a group together thats not even elemental geared ( which is fine ) only to get down to the bottom after 2 hours of killing and whipe on the final mob. I have been down there many times and we always whipe.<br />
<br />
You just dont get it cause you have so much support. You have support that a lot of us dont and im happy that you do. But to sit there ony our high horse and tell us that we arent working hard enough and we are being lazy with a &quot; oh woe as me&quot; attitude is so ****ing elitist. You equate work and drive to your level of gear and the people you can pool together for a event. Like i said, not all of us are lucky enough to be in time capible guilds. <br />
<br />
Come down with the rest of the world and see how most people live when dealing with GoD, then decide if we are &quot; lazy&quot;</div></div><hr />

Thank you for noticing. I've done the best I can with limited play time. I wish I had more time to play but with changing careers I work all the time. I did have a little luck financially with the server rollbacks. I got a few toons back fully dressed. That extra cash helped a lot after taking a 15 month break.<br />
<br />
I don't follow too closely but it looks like Stasis is in Time now. I wonder which toon Jerm is playing now. Last time I checked he was playing Asiv but I've been out of the loop for a long time. I kinda miss all the drama and politics. It made the game interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Litgruv,<br />
<br />
Once again, there was the all too common SOE sucks post and I responded in kind.  Perhaps that was not the meaning that was intended.  Perhaps if the poster put a smiley by the post I would not have interpreted it as I did.  Lot's of what ifs that mean absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, you were the one that brought on the sarcasm due to my magelo.  I can be farily certain that the magelo also allowed you to peg me into your predetermined mold of an &quot;elitist&quot; regardless of what I have posted or do to help others in game.<br />
<br />
The bottom line here is that I saw another SoE sucks thread and I kicked it in the beanbags.  That is all.  I think most of the posters here who are elemental, time, or GoD guilds would be happy to give a useful reply to an intelligent (and perhaps frustrated) post.  However, I will continue to do the same to these types of posts - and yes...I will be blunt.<br />
<br />
Now please find me a post where I call somebody lazy or equate work and/or ability to gear.  Please use the &quot;intelligent post&quot; criteria.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">. . . I have not bothered to try to find a group in gates. <br />
I had a long post written out, but I decided not to be even more &quot;arrogant&quot;. But I am not gonna let this statement go by. Tell ya what. Log in. Run to Baruindu. Hit LFG tool. Find a balanced group. Stay at the ZI area in Vxed, and SEE FOR YOURSELF. Its hard. They hit big. Too many mistakes on a pull is a wipe. It will be even harder for you. But your not even &quot;bothering&quot; to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Some people are making much more out of this situation than they need to.  If you want your spells you NEED to get KodTaz flagged and thats it.  6 trials is what stands before you.  They are very tough, tedious, and outright annoying adventures to which anyone with a goal in mind can finish.  You will find that alot of trials groups need slowers for sure so don't respond saying that shaman are useless in god trials and blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
For those of you who do not wish to go through the trials, keep an eye out for guilds planning on doing the Smith Rondo event.  Getting a flag for this event will get you the first 4 of the 6 flags needed for KT access.<br />
<br />
The 5th trial is cake... all it takes is patience and a decent group.  Kill 100 or so mobs... a named spawns at the end of the adventure... pop on your horse or get bard speed... and train like mofos to the named and hail it for the flag.  It cannot get any easier than that.<br />
<br />
The 6th trial is a cake trial cept for one part, the final boss.  Hes an extremely fast and hard hitting mofo.  You will find that most people want the PERFECT group for this event.  It certainly is not needed though.  There are many ways of dealing with this named via different melee diciplines, ranger weapon shield, pali stunning, warrior diciplines.  If you read the boards enough you will see planty of posts about tipt (trial 6) cause of that last mob, soooo many people fail and fail again.  It took me 5 tries with some VERY VERY solid groups.  Tenacity won me that flag just like it will for you.<br />
<br />
KT = all but ancient GoD spells<br />

If you are lacking in gear and spells and shiz like that, you have ZERO excuses not to be doing these trials.  Lots of wonderful loot and augs and spells drop in these trials so get your asses to GoD and get crackin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Try sitting LFG in GoD and putting a group together, atleast on MT. I sit there for hours literaly, tossing away invites to EXP and LDoN's...Come down with the rest of the world and see how most people live when dealing with GoD, then decide if we are &quot; lazy&quot;<br />
<br />
I think that says alot acutally.<br />
<br />
If you are sitting LFG in GoD tossing away invites for other groups you are going about it the wrong way.  Try making a group before you go there.<br />
<br />
Lazy is a bad word to use.  I lost to the Kyv jerk 6 times before I finally got trial 6.  Misdirected would be a much better word.  I was totally miffed everytime we lost to that guy.  We used the right tactics etc but then cleric would get toasted or warrior would LD, etc.  Bad things happen.</div></div><hr />

By the way, they nerfed the crap out of sewers!  The only spell I've seen drop post nerf is from the boss in Sewer 1, every other named has dropped an item.  Trust me on this I've been trying to get my friends sewer flagged for about a month or two.  We're finally on to Tipt and Vxed (yay for persistence!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Balance of the Nihil dropped for me in a sewer trial. I haven't yet seen a rune drop out of Vxed (got a nice mask though), and we've farmed it for coming up on two weeks now Meh, no biggie ... KT is but two sewer trials away! :cool: Should be there by Sept. 1, I'm all excited.<br />

As a side note, I have to nominate this thread for best derail of 2004. Great job, Grim.<br />

<br />
why would u like to repeatedly camp Vxed for spells if you can win it without them and get every spell in KT from mobs that are easier than some mobs in the trials?<br />
<br />
you dont even need amazing gear, with a bit of luck you can win Tipt with a WS-Ranger, an enchanter and some more dps, nothing else. You need skill for it, you dont need elemental or even time grade gear (though it definitely helps in case things go really wrong, which admittedly often happens).<br />
just get an enchanter that knows his job and has the right aas, perma-DA the pet and hack through it.<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean Tipt is easy or so, it is an awful trial, but it will get not really easier with all god spells available.</div></div><hr />

Well im sure your intelligance allows you to see that a post that state ..<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again, God forbid that you might have to do a bit of work to get them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can very well be interpreted as you calling everyone lazy cause they dont all have their god spells like you. Fact is some of us have put more blood sweat and tears into it then you have, simply cause your path was a easy one considering your support.<br />

But i didnt mean to get off on a elite rant. I have much love EQ and SoE, they just are changing course down a road im not too down with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">BTW.. technically if you want to count shaman game changing spells, then we have two of them, not just one.  BoT and Daluda are very nice, nice enough that I can get 5k crit heals with Daluda and not take any damage sometimes while soloing stuff with BoT... however Balance is great, especially for that emergency need to slow 10 mobs asap.  Ancient Canni however is my favorite.  No longer does it take 7+ min to canni back all of my 8k mana, now I can do it in just over 3 min, with time to spare.  It's so powerful, I've gone LDoN adventures where I can pull, slow, main heal, dot every mob in camp with bane/anathema/or blood, finish it in 20 min and still be sitting at over 80m the entire time.  It's just great.  And, it's stopped me from testing any of the new shaman spells right now in beta.</div></div><hr />

In the beginning, this was much more true than it is today. Vxed farming, for instance, is doable by any capable group. My server usually has a bunch of people sitting around the ZI to Vxed-Tipt, looking for groups. To farm, you dont even need to risk going too deep. Just sit at the first platform. The XP is certainly better than your ever going to see in BoT, it ranks right up there with Earth and Fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I tried ONE pickup Vxed group ... it was like these people just walked out of BOT and decided one day to try GOD. An inkling of the intelligence I was dealing with ... I was grouped with a 65 baron Druid who had purchased pet affinity and insisted on having his pet up at all times. Ten mobs into the expedition, I became main healer because he was too busy playing Wizard. The other group members weren't much better. The Ranger would pull two repeatedly, and then decide it was his job to kite instead of root the thing and help with DPS on the first mob. It should come as no surprise to you that the Ranger and Druid were &quot;bestest buddies.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was my last pickup GOD group. I avoid them for the same reasons I avoid pickup groups in other expansions: Idiocy.<br />
<br />
I see very few pickup GOD groups on Karana. You see the occasional lone person /oocing in Barindu for a sewer trial, or LFG in the open group channel we have, but other than that, it's pretty much bring-your-own-group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I agree on Nihils, cant imagine playing without it now.  Ancient Can though is a situational spell at best.  Its a nice recovery tool, but I wouldnt feel lost without it (like I would without Nihils).  Of course I raid 99% of the time and my opinion could change when I have to exp and grind AAs again with OoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Situational for Ancient Canni?  No way.  It is the single reason that most people that i know on Beta are now /spellscribing right now or wish that they haven't.  I sense that if you had a TA Kiebler your opinion of Nihil wouldn't be as high (don't get me wrong, it's very nice, but even with it most of the time I'd rather hit malos and then TA first before I use Nihil).</div></div><hr />

That is obvious.  However, I did ask that it be in response to an intelligent, non-hostile or cynical post.  I stated that I will respond in kind in these cases.  Let's end this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">On Cazic Thule there are decent oppurtunities for a pickup group in KT.  That being said, KT is at the level where reputation comes into your group invites.  The world gets smaller and this is the kind of place where you want all of your group members to be on their A or atleat B game.  You can do with maybe one slacker, but more than that and you're in trouble.  <br />
<br />
The named here are like anywhere else, except for when they do spawn, it's a whole lot more exciting.  Find yourself an area near one of the temples, as they usually have a named spawn straight in at the back, and maybe a wanderer as well.  Also if you're in one the large courtyard areas keep the trash clear for chance at wandering named crag or hynid.  The named are more rare than you'll see in a place like BoT, but who cares?  The exp is great, the trash loot is nifty, and the place has a nice dynamic.  I just hate the rain!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">The TA is a nice item, but it wouldnt replace Nihils.  The shaman in the guild who carry it just it use to apply long slows on named fights.  Ancient Can is just... average.  Nice down time spell, but nothing to worry about if you dont have it.  Your mileage may vary though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Amen. Nobody wants to put any time or effort into anything anymore. Too bad there's no IDKFA in everquest.<br />
<br />
Its a game, I play to have fun not too work. The drop rate for shaman spells has always sucked and SOE has always said we were wrong. However we know the truth and unless something has changed at SOE we will be screwed again.</div></div><hr />
