<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kindonini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our cable seems to be acting up today. We can't stay connected to the game at all, but it seems to be fine on the 'net.<br />
<br />
I wanted to apologize to Arbor, we had promised to come help with the ring quests in EW, and to 3 recruits we were bringing along, Windigo, Nadonius and Meiamour. We are really sorry guys!<br />
<br />
Hope we can get it together and be back asap!<br />

Hugs,<br />

btw...Ali...NO we aren't watching the news!! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You maybe want a tech come to your house and see how strong your cable signal is when it get to your modem. If you have a low quality of cable wire connecting to your modem, it might affect high bandwith performance. So I been told...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kind-  I don't know if you have solved this by now, but I have a suggestion.  Make sure that the cable goes straight to your cable modem and does not go through a splitter.  My cable went through a splitter (I don't know why, my brother set it up) which weakend my cable modem connection, eventually losing the connection altogether.  It's kind of along the lines of Sinsemsinfutura's comment, but make sure that the cable is solid and strong.</div></div><hr />
