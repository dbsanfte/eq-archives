<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My shammy is 43 now (just got canni 2  ;) ) and I've been grouping with a fairly twinked SK for most of the last 20 levels.  Most of the time I just summon dogdog, buff, slow, get a couple quick melee hits in, and occasionally nuke or add a dot.  Last night I tried soloing and kept getting fizzles - especially on my poison dots.  So, I looked at my skill levels for the casting schools and alteration is 220, but the next highest is conjuration at 157... :( <br />
<br />
I know the only way to raise my casting skills is casting (duh!), my question is what impact does the spell level have on my skill increases?  For example, will the 24 poison dot and the 39 poison dot both increase my skill level at the same rate?  If so, I'll use the 24 version since I don't really need it to kill the mobs, it costs less mana, and it fizzles less (which means even less mana used per casting.)  <br />
<br />
Note:  I'm assuming Wis also impacts casting skillups, so I'll grab some gear from my druid to get me around 200 wis (about 165 now.)<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was always told just simply casting a spell of the right skill-type, no matter what spell you use, will work towards a skill up. For example, I recently had to get my divination up, so I set up a hot key for True North and chain cast it in a quiet zone. Do the same thing for any skill you want to get up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, repeated casting works fine.  Set up a macro hotkey.  I used to put Burst of Flame in slot 6 (Evocation), True North in slot 7 (Divination), and Sicken (Conjuration) in slot 8 and use something like<br />
<br />
/stand<br />
/pause xx, /cast 6<br />
/pause xx, /cast 7<br />
/pause xx, /cast 8<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
Where 'xx' has to be tuned to make sure you pause enough for that spell to be cast.  Note that although the /pause is at the BEGINNING of the line it doesn't take effect until the END of the line.<br />
<br />
Just get in a safe place, target yourself, turn on the TV or grab a book, and whack that button over and over and over again.  If you get low on health or mana, just cool it for a while.<br />
<br />
Note that you can use Summon Food or Summon Drink to work on Conjuration and it's cheaper manawise, but then you have to do something with the food/drink on your cursor before you can hit the button again.  Depends on how involved you want to be with the process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, if you recast food or water with it on cursor, when spell finishes, old one poofs and new one is now in hand (Of course this is a guess as to what EXACTLY happens - important thing is you lose one, and one is still on cursor). So if you don't care about losing the food you just summoned, then you can summon away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As of the last patch, you can summon food/water upto 11 times before you get the message that there is something in your hands.  Just open your inventory window, and click 11 times in the autoequip (sp?) window, and the summoned items will drop into your inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, cool.  I think when I tried this last (a year or more ago) I got the &quot;something in your hands&quot; message if even one bread/water was on my cursor.  I guess they updated that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh cool, I never knew that, as I never casted more than a few times in a row, and I would just destroy it anyway, and the amount says 1, so I just thought it poofed lol.</div></div><hr />
