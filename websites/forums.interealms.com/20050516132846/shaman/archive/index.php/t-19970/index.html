<br />
The healing wards don't have more hitpoints yet, so you can probably bet the SC pets don't either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nope, was online not 10 minutes ago and the dogs still go down like a fat kid on a twinkie.<br />
<br />
This isn't surprising though, they said it would be a couple patches in.  As long as they get the HP up to somewhere slightly above the last pets from SC, I won't hate this ability nearly as much.  *sigh*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It needs a DPS upgrade too. Advanced SC 1 should outdamage SC 3, since you pay AAs for it and the skill replaces SC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I'd agree there.  It seems like Advanced spirit call 2 is a small damage upgrade over SC3..but...ASC 1, as was stated, should be a dps upgrade (and a decent one) all on its own.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">from what i have heared they proc fairly often.<br />
venom claw (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5125&amp;source=Live) is the proc, which is pretty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ha, yeah right I wish.<br />
<br />
If my pets proc'ed that Id be dancing in circles everytime I summoned them</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure what u mean, but according to this tread http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19851 it seems that they do proc venom claw.<br />
<br />
The log shows that with Spirit Call V, doggies bite 130+ and proc 640.  His log shows lower bite damage due to the PvP pet penalty.  However, against a mob, this is respectable damage.  They just need to add a zero to the number of hp the dogs have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if they upped the hp of these dogs to just 500 hp, I'd buy em.. but as they are, no way will I buy em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My apologies Thunder. I was incorrect :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Imo they should have made this a seperate spiritcall with spiritcall3 as requirement.<br />
<br />
Personally, I bought spiritcall3 because it's FIVE level 58 dogs, a 7500hp dogrune that lasts 1 min with 5 chances to enrage ;) <br />
<br />
I would be disappointed to spend more aa for less puppies ;) Also, the cumulative hp of spiritcall 4 should be &gt; spiritcall3. I use spiritcall for lots of things, but DPS is pretty low on that list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah, its sad...the days of 30 dogs engaging one poor mob for the pushing of its lifetime are over :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only if you bought it... those of us that didn't spend 15 AA on that boondonggle still get to use 5 pets for jamming a MOB into a corner while the tanks pull its jersey over its head for the beating.<br />
<br />
At this point, SC4 and 5 are on par with the rest of GoD... except for SCS (which we should have gotten with Luclin) and Crit DOTs (maybe), the whole expansion is completly useless, unusable and/or inappropriate where my shaman and how I like to play him are concerned.<br />
<br />
At this point, I hope the lot of you who spent on that useless SC4 and SC5 get at least an AA refund for those paper tissue pets. Given they haven't shown the slightest interrest in fixing or even looking at shaman issues since sometimes before PoP, that's probably the best you can expect.</div></div><hr />
