<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Going to be working on twinking my shammy after I get lvl 60(in a few days) so want to plan for a few things.<br />
<br />
I would like to get her an earring of the solstice and a Spiritstone(troll) I recall the spiritstone having a reccomended level, do I need to have her at a certain level before she can use it? What are the stats of the solstice earring at lvl 1, and if they are pretty low, when is it better than bs electrum?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">51 min on both.  I'd imagine the solstice earring give 1 hp, 1 mana, 1 wis, etc at level 1, every other item I've seen does.  Ft1 would likely not work either.  The spiritstone won't work until 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The spirtstone works at lvl 51 just dinged lvl 51 my self. the earring i got at lvl 46 and there were no neg stats on it, i think that maybe the Flowing thought dosent work tell lvl 51 but the stats were the same</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kinda figured on the spiritstone, oh well. How about the earring, has anyone tried to use it at lvl 1 or similar low lvl? I think I will get one when my guild is able to make them (hopefully the first on server to have them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've heard FT1 on the earring works before lvl 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm sorry but I think its fun hearing that people cant tell if FT1 is working or not. Thats gotta be a clue to how important FT1 is to a shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ya, but I didn't ask about the ft, i asked when it is better than the bs electrum ear that she already has :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd get solstice over the BD earring.  My rl buddy has solstice on his 22 shaman, and has no neg stats, dont' know bout if FT1 works, cuse it's just a mule atm, he never plays with it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got my shaman a earring of solstice at level 1 (was worried it would be nerfed before he was leveled up) and all stats were 1 to everything.  As you level, they go up as well.  At level 32, stats are something close to:<br />
<br />
3 ac 3 sta 3 wis 3 int 34 hp 34 mana 3 to sv fire/cold/magic.  Hp/Mana goes up every level, but at levels 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 the rest go up a level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Great, she will likely be 20ish or so before my guild can make all 9 gifts thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />
