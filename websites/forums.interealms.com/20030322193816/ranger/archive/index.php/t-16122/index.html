<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Enorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there has been loads of threads on this exact same topic, but I really couldn't find any of them.  So I am wondering how exactly does it work.  For example my bow is 28 40 + random stats and then +3 dmg Poison.  How does this +3 get added in, does it mean on mobs like Trak who are poison based the +3 would work, or since he is poison based it wouldn't come in to effect.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Magic/poison/fire etc damage aren't exactly bane damage.   Bane damage is always applied, there is no resist check. <br />
<br />
The poison damage on your bow will only be applied if your target fails a save versus poison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Enorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">o, that makes since.  So can you basically assume if it does fail that the bow automatically goes up to 31 40?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shugamayatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if mob fails bow = 31/40<br />
if mob makes it = 28/40</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was under the impression that each point of elemental damage was suseptable to save checks.  Meaning, a 28/40 with +3 Poison could end up being:<br />
<br />
28/40<br />
29/40<br />
30/40<br />
31/40<br />
<br />
depending on how the mob made it's saves.  And of course this would be re-rolled every shot/swing.  <br />
<br />
I got this info from a discussion about the LSoEE elemental damage a long time ago.  Wish I had more to back up what I'm saying, but maybe one of yous guys remembers or knows different.</div></div><hr />
