<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lately I have discovered a couple things that bug me.<br />
<br />
#1 Spiritstone of Cabilis is froglok useable. Um, no? Gating to a kos city? No way. A guide (I know they can't do much...but hey I already /bug and /feedback'd it) told me it must have been an oversight and they would tell the powers that be.<br />
<br />
#2 Scaled Mystic armor is froglok useable. Once again....*sigh*...no way. Take away our class weapon quests, then give away our crappy armor quests? How about no. You're not a scaled mystic, you're a slimy mystic.<br />
<br />
Frogloks are our arch enemies, they wouldn't exactly use the spiritstone of our ancestors, or the armor off my back. Please /bug, /feedback, spread the word about the errors. I can't stand it &gt;:(</div></div><hr />

Lots and lots of stuff seems to be froglok usable that probably shouldn't be.  The human / half elf newbie warrior quest armor, for instance, is now HUM HEF FRG.  Dwarven cultural armor also added FRG.<br />
<br />
They pretty obviously just ran some automated update program against their entire item DB, so you get some weirdness.  I suspect that they'll get around to fixing this sort of thing on a case by case basis eventually - it happened when they added IKS and then later BST after all.  For the first couple of weeks of Kunark, iksar could wear bronze and totemic cloaks when they couldn't wear any visible pieces of bronze or totemic, and then there was the whole &quot;hero bracer is iksar usable!  oh wait, no it isn't again&quot; with the BST armor update.</div></div><hr />
