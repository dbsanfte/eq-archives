<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gbab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So today I decided i would powerlevel one of my alts in Dranik Scar.  I zoned in get all set up start buffing and go to canabalize using Pained Memory.  I am not allowed to cast it.  I zone into Bloodfields i can cast it.  I zone into Noble's Causeway i can cast it.  I zone into Plane of Knowledge i can cast it.  I figure what the hell i can canabalize that should be good enough.  I go to cast Ferine Avatar again same problem.  If i zone to other zones wow i can cast it.  Come on SoE fix stuff don't break it.  Disgruntled shaman!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That happens occasionally.  Players lose the ability to cast any of their memorized spells.  Zoning, camping, and rememming spells usually fixes it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was the spell gem circled in white instead of red? I get that once in an while, and unmem/remem fixes it. Only happens to meon gem 7 / Yoppa's Mending, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">those two buffs have a recast time...takes time for them to pop up unlike other spells that just auto cast hopefully this isnt your problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have had this problem off and on in DS and NC.  Can't cast Canni.  Its in slot #5.  Re meming, zoning, meming in different slot, zoning (can cast in other zones..but not in the one it started in), camping, re booting...nothing has helped.  I have been told that it takes ~1hr sometimes for it to just go away on its own.  I have /buged it a cpl times with no response.  I  would reccommend that everyone who gets this bug to /bug it.  the more that people /bug it I hope SoE will listen and fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Happens to me on FD AA and Dark Nightmare. If camping doesn't fix the spell issue I just un-mem and swap spell slots. If AA doesn't reset after camp I raise hell in /bugs, /feedbacj, etc.</div></div><hr />
