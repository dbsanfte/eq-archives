<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yo, I recently got a portable MP3 player and found I can't upload mp3's from it to my computer!  This seems lame to me and I'm sure there has to be a hack for the software that will do it for me.  I use an Irock 500 series mp3 player for reference.  Can anyone recommend a link?  <br />
Also, is there a link for a hack that makes the new copyrighted CDs open to make mp3s from the music I already own?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.  I trust the people on this board a lot more than using a random search engine and possibly coming down with a virus or some crap.</div></div><hr />

I don't have that many details but I remember it being all over the new and there was some thing about it on slashdot</div></div><hr />
