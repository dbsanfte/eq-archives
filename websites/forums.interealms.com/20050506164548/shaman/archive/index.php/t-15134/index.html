You know where the warder used to spawn in dining room? THe guy there now drops a SWEET sword i want for my SK, but ive camped it many times and never seen any named yet, i think im killin the wrong ones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">personally i dont think the upgrades to droganurga have been a sucess.  They fulfil soe policy of increasing mobs hps to annoying lvls but thats all. Theres alot of monk gear droping there, but the rest is junk, except one of the cloaks.<br />
<br />
Very much doubt anyone wil use these dungeons for exp. Which was the point, i thought.  Droga is just too dangerous for a mid fifties grp to exp in. Maybe nurga is doable aas its alot easier to get in/out.<br />
<br />
Can someone give me loc in FM of cave with the rings quest goblins ion plz?  tnx)<br />
<br />
However i am a huge fan of chardok b. Suprisingly soe got something right  EEEk!  Well side from buggering up the quests in there, otherwise this place is great-- just right for lvl 61 shammmy.</div></div><hr />

Id really have to argue that these are not rspectable drops atainable with a group of level 55's. There are a few drops like that copper hammer i wouldnt mind having in my bags at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You must have had a bad group there because droga rivals Plane of Tactics exp easily. Then there's the added benefit of the nice drops linked above (I've made over 200k selling the hammer alone), and the fact that mobs drop 12-18pp each.<br />
<br />
One of my favourite zones now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why couldn't any group of 55s go to Droga for xp and loots?<br />
The mobs hit for about 200 at the most I've found; a level 55 tank with decent gear is quite capable of tanking mobs that hit for 600+ like in the Plane of Valor.  200 hitters are a freaking joke nowadays.  I know this, because I party in PoV with a 54 shadowknight whenever she's online.<br />
The mobs have low resists (at least to magic and poison).<br />
The mobs don't summon.<br />
The mobs are slowable and don't mitigate slow.<br />
The mobs are snarable and rootable.<br />
The mobs don't see invis.<br />
The mobs give xp comparable to the various POP zones like BoT or Hoho or Tactics.<br />
The mobs are much less densely packed compared to how they used to be; it's almost all single pulls.<br />
The mobs have a tiny aggro range further making solo pulling or duo pulling easily done.  Only a very few pulls are 3+ pulls.<br />
The only inconvenient thing about hunting in Droga is you have to run through the Overthere and then through FM before you enter it.  Oh no a 5 minute run to the place you want to hunt!<br />
Any group capable of hunting in Sebilis, Chardok, Chardokb, Charasis, Karnors castle, Velks, Plane of Nightmares, Plane of Innovation, Plane of Disease, Plane of Justice, or Veksar could quite handily take care of themselves in Droga.<br />
Maybe you should actually try zoning into the new zone before you dismiss it?  hmm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">found the cave in fm.  -2000 +2000  so angry goblin spawns there now?<br />
<br />
Actually that 2hb posted above i hadnt seen, its ok the spear is a rogue weapon really not better than a soulstripper.<br />
<br />
None of the rest is much use for shaman, or theres better buyable cheeply in bazaar.  OK if copper hammer dropped its better than a poke in the eye...i wouldnt rush to replce my current gear with it.  Granted it probably the best ihb droping in kunark atmo!  How many secs is the stun affect on it??<br />
<br />
&quot;the mobs dont see invis&quot;  ahh!  now thats interesting,  that makes the place more to my liking.  <br />
<br />
Ok soon as chardok b vanishes, il spend the next week in droga. If i go on less than 6 CR il pass the zone  :P<br />
<br />
btw ill point out, that u folks farming the drops are 60+.  This is NOT a mid fifties exp zone.  Its now a CT lvl zone.  <br />
<br />
I was exping in tactics last night, if mobs hit for less here then il think about exping here myself....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Starlite, that isn't just an ok spear for a rogue, that is drop dead AMAZING for a rogue.  You hav any idea how hard it is for their class to gear up at all?   <br />
<br />
   Your initial post said that this dungeon was useless and nobody would go there.<br />
<br />
  Your second post says it all quite clearly for me...  nothing YOU want is in there, so you bashed it without reading up on the zone fully.<br />
<br />
  Also, there is a ring type quest in there that I am working on decoding which results in some VERY nice wis caster gear.  But the ring itself requires camping 3 spawns on 8 hour timers and then doing a 1 hour + event with NO loot just so you can spawn the NPC to START the real quest... so you can guess how much help I can count on from people like you who read the drops of a zone as figured out by other people and then try to convince everyone to avoid the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well i think the important thing is a trend in EQ that is starting. They are expanding the pre 65 game and amking things more intresting and decent drops apearing that you can get with 1 group for the correct level of the geat. that hammer is 12/19 with a 250 proc. ITs not uber, but if a ranger was weildin g it in my BoT group, i would say he was descently equiped, meaning iw ouldnt be like &quot;OMG look at this crap this guy is using&quot;  Personaly im going to camp it myself for my own uses.<br />
<br />
I agree the drops for shaman arent super there, but for other classes they are certainly respectable. Im intrested in seeing how CoM will turn out since our epic has such a high concentration there, itll be intresting to see how smart sony is and if they will put in alot of shaman drops since we spend so much time there.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
btw, i would like to add that this is a dungeon, just like the old days, a throw back to the style of play that got us into EQ to begin with before the power gamers stormed in. I find myself fighting through for a hour ro 2 then going, omg i just dinged. In BoT i find myself looking at exp bar going &quot; 20% more till i can do something fun&quot;. That alone hold merit, its a intresting fun way to XP even though its a lil slower then the planes, its alot more fun then pulling #565 giant from south camp</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, right. I duo'd there with an overlord friend. It was dark blue to both of us...and I was getting 1% of 61 every 4-5 kills. He was getting 1% aa every other kill. Compare that to chardok B where I got over 2 blues of 61 in an hour and a half in raid exp.<br />
<br />
The drops are completely nonexistant. I took a group and a half or so of guildies to crawl through this place...ent to pool/temple to ledge. We got jack ****. Not one drop. Ok, I lied we got 2 mineral salts. Even with the plat drops, and 1 gem, I can make more cash than what we got in one clearing of NG bugs.<br />
<br />
....And if those boots drop there there is no way they should, that zone is too easy to have &gt;vindi items.<br />
<br />
This zone's itemization sucks. <br />
<br />
On a different note, the mobs have a complete spellbook. ***? Didn't we already have to beat SOE with the clue stick because they were being morons and giving mobs rare dropped spells?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i dunno if you think its like nurga where mobs can spawn anywhere, but there are camps, so yes, crawling through there isnt going to yeild you anything. You have to kill the place holders and hang out. I find the named mobs spawn 1-2 times per hours, its very consistent.<br />
<br />
But anyway, yea this zone sucks ass, i hate how its so peaceful and quiet and drops  are about 16-21 pp a mob and 2% AA a kill.  Please dont go there, it sucks, dont waste time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LMAO.  You complain about the exp being crap, about not getting any drops, and then turn around and say that *IF* items are dropping here they are too good.  Well, it seems that there's no pleasing you!  :) <br />
<br />
The reason you didn't get any items crawling, sir, might be very well because of the fact that the items are *rare* and the nameds are also *rare*.  If you expected to go in, crawl for an hour, and come out with 4-5 items that are, as you call it, &quot;&gt; vindi&quot; (though I should point out that boots of the vindicator are hardly what people kill him for), then yes you will be disappointed - and should be disappointed.  Items of that quality aren't going to drop common as water, and the itemization of the zone doesn't suck.  If it did, no one would go there, and that's far from true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't think there's any chance this zone is near tactics in exp.  I solo'd a few mobs near the top, all were around 1% aa exp, tactics is 3-5% solo.  I'd imagine it gets better deeper, but didn't try soloing down there.  Took a group and wandered, too many damn casters and gaters for my soloing tastes, though the mobs hit for nothing, quite easy to tank (I've missed that a bit in PoP).  But in a good group in tactics, an AA takes 45 minutes or so, depending on afk's and how many people are 2 boxing.  No chance droga can match that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">LMAO.

<br />
<br />
That's right, exp was crap compared to mid pop. I get more exp off one mob in a full group in HoH than i did off 3 duoing in droga.<br />
<br />
I realize it's a jump for you.... but: <br />
<br />
There's a reason why SOE, when they do revamps,  usually randomizes some loot throughout the zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you expected to go in, crawl for an hour, and come out with 4-5 items that are, as you call it, &quot;&gt; vindi&quot; (though I should point out that boots of the vindicator are hardly what people kill him for), then yes you will be disappointed<br />
<br />
<br />
I expected to crawl through, including the camps where the king and other named are, and come out with something. To compare, HoB..put in at exactly the same time...yielded an assload of 59/60 spells, several of those earrings, an improved healing IV cloak, a stone splinted cloak, and 2 of those mantles for the same amount of time. <br />
<br />
And to top it all off *GASP* it was a crawl there too!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Now I realize you evidently had a lot of trouble following my post, so I'll spell out one last thing:<br />
<br />
The boots being better than vindi boots is an observation in and of itself, not related to the telling of my disappointment in my crawl of the zone. I did not say I wanted to crawl for phatz better than vindi's loots. I said it is stupid to put that level of gear in this easy of a dungeon. I then further implied that it demonstrated the idiocy of whoever itemized the zone to place both items of that nature and the lack of lesser items of any type there.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly it's amazing to see someone misquote so close to the original, most people are generally smart enough to wait a couple pages before doing such a chop job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">#1 Ofcourse its crap exp compared to PoP. PoP is meant to be where you go for nothign else but to Exp. The entire expansion that is PoP has a exp modifier over the old world built into it. But this is a respectable place is what im saying, for people that have had enough fo PoP.<br />
<br />
#2 Nothing sees invis there, so you dont have to crawl.<br />
<br />
#3 No one is saying its the best zone int he game, but its a nice revamp, nice AA and even though they dont randomly drop loot, through the zone, EVERY MOB drops 15-21 pp per shot. Thats not exactly horrible. To be honest i dont like random loot, i mean have you ever tried to get a OBS or a RBB form Seb?  Talk about suckage. I like knowing where the camps are so i dont have spent 3 hours clearing everything in site.<br />
<br />
Also i have the boots from vindi and i dont think they are worse then the kingly boots that drop there, unless your talking about another pair ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So to sum up, no this might now be a &quot;Power Zone&quot; where you can make insane EXP and loot drops like rain from all mobs. But its a classic style dungeon that i feel was upgraded pretty well. This is a good zone for people that still like EQ the way it was before PoP and SoL i think. Im happy with it and im after spending time there im actualy anxious to see CoM, it might be my home all over again at 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wow, all this hostility from people who refuse to think in ANYTHING but absolutes..<br />
<br />
 &quot;OMG!  He said I wasn't totally right and should be praised!   FLAME HIM!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
  and <br />
<br />
  &quot;Well, there is this one zone, that was 0.00001% better this one day when I was in there and we were doing REALLY good, and that is compared to my one time ever zoning into this place and just trying it with a sucky group... I decided I needed to run away FAST to get my 3519837th AA point done, so I gated on the group right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
  These people, mainly the mentality of them, are reasons I hate grouping for exp and never did exp in Oasis, LOIO, Guk, Sol Ro, DL or any of the other &quot;IN&quot; zones...  Man it's nice gouging you guys in teh bazaa....  I mean...  finding zones that you don't like to go to.<br />

Next, every mob does not drop 15-20p. In fact there were many times they dropped 10g or so in the several times I've checked out the zone before giving up on it.<br />

<br />
Correct! PoP exp trivialized every dungeon up to this point in the game.  People simply no longer go to dungeons for exp purposes.  What's left? The loot, of course!<br />
<br />
I realize it's a jump for you.... but: <br />
<br />
There's a reason why SOE, when they do revamps, usually randomizes some loot throughout the zone.<br />
<br />
No jump at all sir! I am merely mimicking your judgemental tone, and I think I've done a fair job at that if I managed to get you to respond.<br />
<br />
Now onto your point: okay, so Droga has no randomized loot.  So? Every dungeon must be like Sebilis in order for it to be a fun crawl? Far from it!<br />
<br />
<br />
I expected to crawl through, including the camps where the king and other named are, and come out with something. <br />
<br />
Well the nameds were not up.  Tough luck! If I expected to come out of every crawl I do with something, I'd be swimming in loot and frankly I don't want to inflate the economy with cheap items like that!  There are dungeons where if you crawl through it randomly you get a bunch of drops - but Droga is great for the other people who actually enjoy the concept of nameds being rare and dropping good loot. Perhaps you don't.  That's okay, but it's no reason to call the itemization crap.<br />
<br />
yielded an assload of 59/60 spells, several of those earrings, an improved healing IV cloak, a stone splinted cloak, and 2 of those mantles for the same amount of time. <br />
<br />
Funny, I crawled through the same dungeon and got an assload of useless 59/60 spells, several of those virtually not sellable earrings, a cloak worse than those dropping commonly off of mobs in chardokA, and some quest stuff for quests that are broken! What's more - guess what, among the best items in all of HoB are the FT2 necklaces that drop near ZI.  That's right - near ZI! While useless junk like those big race only cloaks and rings of the walking dead drop off of mobs MUCH harder and MUCH deeper in.  Great itemization there!<br />
<br />
The boots being better than vindi boots is an observation in and of itself, not related to the telling of my disappointment in my crawl of the zone.<br />
<br />
Of course not! You missed the entire point of the zone with that statement and thus are disappointed.  Sorry, sir, but maybe the zone's just not for you and your idea of a good crawl...  But it sure is for those dozens of other people I see there everyday!<br />
<br />
 I said it is stupid to put that level of gear in this easy of a dungeon.<br />
<br />
Okay.  I said it is stupid to say that a zone sucks without realizing its purpose.  <br />
<br />
I then further implied that it demonstrated the idiocy of whoever itemized the zone to place both items of that nature and the lack of lesser items of any type there.<br />
<br />
So if they placed lesser items in there that are basically bazaar fodder (and bad bazaar fodder, given that the droga items are merely average given today's standards) that randomly dropped off of every mob in the zone you will call it a good zone? Somehow, I doubt that.  More likely you'll be complaining that the loot sucks for anyone willing to crawl there and that the exp makes it worthless for anyone in PoP to go to - and you'd be right! <br />
<br />
The loot is exactly the reason Droga is visited now by groups of level 55-65 players.  If not for the phat lewts, every one of your predictions would come true and it'd be a truly badly itemized dungeon which no one goes to.  <br />
<br />
But it's not.<br />
<br />
So you're wrong.<br />
<br />
If anything, HoB is a badly itemized dungeon - and that's why nowadays on my server no one goes anywhere past the zone in, whereas 2-3 groups are almost always in Droga.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ooh Ooh I forgot to respond to your snobbish insult at the end.  Guess I missed it, but here's the response!<br />
<br />
Quite frankly it's amazing to see someone misquote so close to the original, most people are generally smart enough to wait a couple pages before doing such a chop job.<br />
<br />
Frankly, sir, your original post was nothing but an aimless bash at a dungeon so many others have expressed great interest and fondness for.  If I misquoted you, I apologize, but since your response clarified (at least I think!) exactly what you meant and it's exactly what I thought you meant, no apologies are needed!<br />
<br />
Moreover, I'd like to say, if my post was a chop job, it is through mimickry of your post! Thank you and good day sir!</div></div><hr />

*edit*<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, like i said, nice zone, good drops, if you dont see anything there you can sell for good cash or use as a nice toy, then i dont think you are looking hard enough.<br />
<br />
I know what i like there and most the people in this thread get it too. The rest can just /gate and begone.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW -- Is there a way to dump a pitcure of the ingame map into like a .bmp or whatever, i got alot of the camps located and would like to post them here</div></div><hr />

thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Been interested in camping the named flame master who drops the boots of kingly splendor.... as near as I understand, he pops in the table room... area 4 on eqatlas. Has anyone had any luck camping him? just seem to be wasting my time the past few trips I had gone.<br />
<br />
I like the zone a lot. I seem to get comparable exp to pov/pos/hoh but with better loot and less dumbasses. Plus I can take any 5 friends I want... an ideal group, or hell, even a strong group isnt needed to do well here. As someone said... its pretty fun to tear up mobs who dont hit for over 600.<br />
<br />
The fact that the goblins spend so much time casting isnt a bad thing... resists playa  decent role in this dungeon.<br />
<br />
I like dok b.. spent some time there last night and walked with torpor, a bonespur mantle and something else (sadly not the brittlebone arms i wanted heh). The mobs are irritatingly resistant... kind of sucked to have to malos them first. But both zones are fun. So is veksar. I really cant wait for ldon, as I have enjoyed going back in dungeons a great deal as of late.</div></div><hr />

...and 2% AA a kill....<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
at what level??<br />
<br />
AA xp isn't level dependent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">AA xp isn't level dependent.<br />
<br />
Really?<br />
<br />
So if a level 51 gets lets say 10% AA from killing a level 51 mob I too would get 10% AA from that same level 51 mob?<br />
<br />
Thats news to me - GOOD news!</div></div><hr />

1-2 hour camp, pops everytime in the same spot in the lil fireplace area, always drops the boots<br />
<br />
Yup dok b is sweet too, i have twinked out my 48 SK and most my alts there lol. even with the recommended level they are respectable and 30-50. I also for the first time in my life saw torpor drop from a rabid chodika at the steps leading into the castle, i couldnt believe it, after so long it was amzing to just see it. Im truly going to miss that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Wow, time to level the warrior to 56. That hammer and sword would be awesome for agro at lower levels. <br />
<br />
What mobs drop the hammer/sword? Soloable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The hammer is soloable, that drops from king, but its fairly tough camp to break. The thing is at king camp there is 2 mobs that spawn in the front and they are almost always nukers it seems, so 2 level 57+ mobs nuking you for chain nuking you for 800+ while you try to get the situation under control slow/rooted/kill  is a lil tricky, but doable. Its probably the rarest spawn from what ive seen in the zone. Supposedly the PH is the gob on the right as you come in, siting next tot he fireplace thing. I didnt stay long and he didnt pop and the other night a groupw as there fro a while and they said they got jack, who knows though /shrug<br />
<br />
the sword im still trying to find, no luck yet though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hijacking this thread.<br />
<br />
Anyone know where the goblin that drops the arms live? The crown and the arms would be upgrades for me, but I have yet to figure out where the arms drop.<br />
<br />
/Merry<br />
<br />
PS The king is probably no more rare than the other mobs. Was playing around here solo one day, and a group camping king got him 3 times in less than 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Where can I sign the petition to makes those boots SHM usable? :).  I'm jealous since a lot of PoP stuff is RNG ROG SHM but we got left out on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Darshad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">According to what I can find on Steel Warrior - the Sword of the Bloodsworn drops from Elder Seer Gamlok(something like that name) spawns in the area above where King Dronan does.<br />
<br />
Anyone think/know if  a 62 Shaman(full spellbook, minus ancients) and a 61 Warrior(1200ish AC &amp; 4.5khp - unbuffed) could duo the Hammer from the King(assuming I can get the camp)? <br />
<br />
The sword and hammer would be a nice weapons upgrade for my wifes warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">You can duo for the sword... done it myself. :) The earthseer also drops a Great Sword of Broodsword.. 2hs version that ptocs a mana/hp drain. 9 poison counter on that proc, so good for aggro. By comparison, blood of saryn adds 9 as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">ok , so the Sword of the Bloodsworn drops above the king camp, cool was wondering, but were is the earth seer, is that the old dining room camp?</div></div><hr />

(Litgruv - folks if you ever saw his old Magelo, anyway.......)<br />
<br />
saw torpor drop from a rabid chodika  <br />
<br />
Are you telling me Torpor drops off of MOBs NOT named Severilious, Trakanon, that one in Skyfire?<br />
<br />
Holy sheep dookie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah it can drop (rarely) in the new chardokb zone.  It's a &quot;pocket zone&quot;, which means they're getting rid of it sometime (no listed date yet - probably when LDoN goes live is my guess), so aim for it while you can.</div></div><hr />
