<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With a bit of luck, I'll be doing my final battle in the next week or two.  I've read up on the fights, and based on the posts, it appears I'll be using a couple level 60 tanks with massively buffed FR and a mage fire pet (I'm guessing using a solo mage fire pet does not work still).  The rest of the force will be a standard force, though we are a bit short on wizards.  <br />
<br />
My question is:  Are there any recent changes to this fight that I should be aware of?  <br />
<br />
I have seen too many threads where people failed due to changes that people didn't know about.  The change to mage fire pets jumps out as a recent example of this.  It has taken a long time to get to this point, and going back for another Tear is not going to be an option anytime soon.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here a few pointers I learned about the hard way:<br />
<br />
1) BARD! Get a bard in your group with MTs and clerics. Resists are huge for this fight.<br />
<br />
2) 2 MTs you said? Then have at least 2 clerics, one for each. <br />
<br />
3) When fighting the reaver that will turn into Rak, make sure you hotkey for everybody EXCEPT MT to back off when reaver is around 20%. /ray BACK OFF ALL PETS NOW!  I can't tell you the number of times the mage pets have aggro'd Rak and we had wipeout! <br />
<br />
4) Always con Rak before you do turn in!! Make sure he is amiable to you.<br />
<br />
5) At time of turn in make sure NOBODY is sitting. Very important, Rak will run for anybody sitting and AE all those casters sitting in the corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just did the fight a few weeks ago for my epic, and found that it was a cinch.  Of course, I had a 65 tank and cleric from a solid (just working on VT access now) guild, plus about ten other people, so it was kind of overkill.  To be honest, a good 65 cleric/tank duo fully buffed could probably do Rak by themselves.<br />
<br />
As for useful advice, I don't really have much to offer.  We fought Rak in his room, and everything went smoothly.  So, I didn't notice anything new or exciting to warn you about.  Which is a good thing, right? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, Lord Rak hasn't changed in the past year.<br />
<br />
P.S. This thread should go in the quest forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When you do Neh/Rak, bind yourself in the  &quot;courtyard&quot; area of CoM and go kill Neh.  Then gate, run to EJ and torun in her diary.  Gate and come back to do Rak.  DO NOT DO RAK WITHOUT TURNING IN THE DIARY (you might not have the faction for him to drop his item).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have done Lord Rak'Ashir 3 times now (once for myself, and twice for other shaman in our guild).  We leaned toward extreme overkill when doing this encounter -- as you said, getting another tear is not really an option.<br />
<br />
We had no mage, so in all three instances we simply sent in our MT (a warrior, who was level 62 at the time) using defensive and then sent in the remainder of the raid force.  Since we had ~20 people, mostly between 55 and 62, Lord Rak Ashir died *extremely* fast.  His AE was not a significant factor, to be honest.  You do not by any means need this kind of force to do him, but as I said, we wanted overkill (and I would suggest you use similar overkill).<br />
<br />
Also, as another poster said, it is a good idea to bind in the area so that if you die during the fight you are not dependent on a rez from a cleric to get back to loot (becasue clerics can die too and then where would you be?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rak was pretty easy. We did it about 8 weeks ago. We had a full raid force but did Rak with just 1 group, 2 clerics, 2 mags, 1 bard and me. I was raid buffed and had on my resist gear, fire was at 175 plus the bard resists I had 300 fire resist or so. When I turned in the tear I didnt even lose a bubble of health. It took about 5 mins to kill him but we were never in danger. Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They didn't aggro, your people sent them in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah with the single group Hillaan described Rak is doable SO easily.<br />
<br />
just get 2 mages (necros will work but they dont have the nuking power of mages, so you'd probably need 4 instead of 2 of them) 1 or 2 clerics to heal the pet, and a bard for resists and to add a DS/ some dots. And then just let rak wail on the pets. Expect to lose them, so one of your mages should be epiced. when it gets to about 20% hp he should start summoning a new one, and then send it in. its really hard to fail with just a few pet classes and a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A group of friends surprised me last night and ordered me to CoM. Two Shaman's got their epic last night, with 11 people.  2mage's, under 55,  1 Wizard over 60, mage and wiz pet's tanked Lord Rak' and with just some healing on the  pets, he went down fairly well.  Both I and the other Shaman lived thru the fight, with my hp only going down 1 and a half bubbles. <br />
<br />
2 rogues, 2 cleric's, 2 mages, 1 warrior, 2 Shaman, 1 wizard.  No deaths. I had been dreading this fight, and in the end it was fairly easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with what most people have been saying above. Mage pets aren't immune to the ae any more, but they seem to resist it quite well, so they are worth using in addition to a normal tank. But a decent warrior backed up by a bard singing a resist song can easily tank Rak.<br />
<br />
Just keep him in one place, don't let anyone get nuke/archery happy and get agro, and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm one of those lucky people who got whupped doing Rak after they changed the resists on mage pets. <br />
<br />
First time we had 2 mage fire pets and a group on standby ready to jump in if things went bad. The fire pets were both losing hp to the area effect so the mages couldn't effectively chain cast by alternating and they were losing their hp fast enough that rak aggroed the clerics. Things went downhill from there. <br />
<br />
Second time, we went in with a solid 60th tank, a cleric a rogue a wizard a necro and myself. The outcome was never even in question. Also it was remarked that with the resist changes the necro specter pet was much more efficient and needed no healing at all due to it's drain life proc. <br />
<br />
<br />
*****Things you want to keep in mind.****** <br />
<br />
-Have everyone bind at the com entrance and clear the way before you trigger rak. That way if things go bad people can run back and keep fighting, healing etc .... (this would have saved us a lot of trouble first time)<br />
<br />
-Pets resists are now based on their caster's resists. <br />
<br />
- Rak's ae has a very short range, casters can stay well out of range and do their thing. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Doing Rak wasnt much of a problem. We didnt have any mages nor warriors with us when we killed him...we just had a 65 chanter, 65 sk, 65 rogue, and 3 50-55 clerics, and a 52 enchater and myself (54 at the time). We also had 2 50-55 warriors but didnt send them in to avoid the ae....all casters can stand far enough away to avoid ae. all in all, a fairly easy fight. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I just did Rak last night (4 May 2003).  We had two groups, dotted with quite uber toons.  One cleric a few tanks, couple of shamans.  We had a fire pet, but probably didn't matter anyway.  We simply blew him up, might have ae'd twice, maybe three times.  He didn't really aggro 'instantly' after the turn in, there was a slight pause, shaman doing the turn-in never really got hurt at all.  FYI, I did woe/envy turn in a bunch of times (4-6 can't remember) until I got 'Your faction with true spirit cannot get any better' (whatever the message is).  I had another shaman from guild MQ the tear for me.  I looted from rak and did final lake spirit turn-in just fine.  I like the spear and am really glad I got it done, wish the cast time wasn't 9 damns seconds :(  Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brakins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is it possible to do this fight with 2 65 beastlords a 60 beastlord and a 62 druid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I did it earlier this week with a single group:  61 warrior, 65 warrior, 65 shaman, 60+ cleric, 60ish rogue (didn't fight, just opened the door), 60ish shaman (didn't fight, just hid).  Ie, 4 person kill.  Was uber-easy.  <br />
<br />
My 2-boxed warrior is only 61st level, has an unbuffed fire resist of 30.  I kept both the shaman and warrior in the AE, healed the warrior a couple times, used torpor maybe three times.  For those 6 characters there were only 3 humans.<br />
<br />
All were buffed by high end druid and enchanter, plus cleric and shaman buffs.<br />
<br />
If you are level-appropriate (mid-50's), work hard to get mages and it's cake.  If you have a few 65ers, you can probably do it in one group or less (depending on your 65ers).<br />
<br />
FINALLY got rid of the Tear I had in my bank for nearly 3 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Got my epic on Saturday. :)<br />
<br />
The Rak fight was very straightforward.<br />
<br />
We pulled the reavers to the wall by the water, so that is where Rak spawned.<br />
<br />
After a little mishap with an AE mez (after I'd emphasized &quot;No AE&quot; several times, we got buffed up and ready.<br />
<br />
We had a small raid force there (try keeping people away! :)), but only one warrior engaged in melee range. I assigned 2 clerics to his group, and they were stationed the other side of the wall, where they could heal but wouldn't be hit by AE. All other casters were down by the ramp, out of AE range.<br />
<br />
We most definitely had overkill - after this experience, I'd say the fight itself could be done with 1 warrior, 2 clerics (to be safe), and the shaman. Of course, you need a rogue to open the door, and a few more ranged damage dealers make it quicker, but yeah, not too hard.<br />
<br />
As a note on the fire pets - the 61 mage tried 3 different pets 49 fire, 51 fire and 61 air, (only the first was fully buffed though) and the AE chewed through them all. I'd personally feel happier with a tank than a fire pet, but they'd probably still work if buffed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Yohimba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They didn't aggro, your people sent them in.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that a LOT of people w/ pets don't know how to use them. If you have your pet on guard, either from the UI or /pet guard me (not sure of key-in cuz I don't use mine like this) they WILL agro anything that is a threat. This happened to us today in CoM when Neh Ashir spawned. She won't agro unless attacked. We weren't there for her, were there for reavers and at that point (after about 5 reavers in a chain) could use down time to regroup, so weren't going to fight her. I see BST kitty at her feet and I *know* what's coming next, as BST didn't really know how to handle pet, as had been evidenced earlier several times. Sure enough, kitty bite Neh. He did not send it. Asked him after fight if he used guard. Yup.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the only way to use pet is with targetted attack and have a hotkey with:<br />
<br />
/pet backoff<br />
/pet follow<br />
/pet backoff<br />
/pet follow<br />
<br />
on it. That takes care of the times they agro what jumps you (don't know if there's a way to get them not to do that) and beyond that, they behave like fine little gentlebeasts.  :)<br />

Yup.  :)  I have already (though a good while off till that day) Made piece with this notion, plan to bind somewhere near and safe, and be shammy snacks. ;) I do draw some comfort in the posts here, though, as several have survived. Maybe I'll get Rak on a happy day...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Moxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The reason the pets got chewed up is because there resists are no longer pre-set (which is why the fire pets used to be so uber for this fight), but are now based off the mages resists. <br />
So with a very well resist-gear equipped mage, their pets are even better than before for this encounter<br />

maybe~ would totally depend on the fire resistance of the beasts~ since the druid alone might not be enough healing for 3 beasts who get aoe'd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>ftQ!</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I will be doing the final tear turn in this weekend.  Will probably be 63 War, 63 Rang(EQ/AM3), 64 Cleric, 65 Rogue, 65 Bard, 57 Sham(Me), 58 Druidbot, 61 Enchanterbot.  Will this be a big enough force for Rak?  Should have 300+ Fire Resist with bard song and buffs.<br />
<br />
Also wanted to know a little more about Rak himself.  Approximately how many Hit Points does he have?  Does he have high Magic Resist?  I read he is unslowable, so should I just sit back and assist in healing, or DoT/DD him?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advanced!!</div></div><hr />

As stated earlier in this thread, and others, Mage fire pets are no longer immune to fire spells. Their resistances are based off the Mage's resistance.<br />
