<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The following classes are the most unhappy with the state of their class (in no particular order):<br />
<br />
Shadowknights (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=22487)<br />
Magicians (http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=16831)<br />
Monks (http://p201.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=47043.topic)<br />
<br />
Then of course, there's Shaman in, from my couple hours of perusing, clear first place.<br />
<br />
Most everybody has things they want to fix about their class.  I mean we'd all like the little niceties, like big boom healing, some improved DPS, etc.  From what I can tell, however, the Crucible is the only community where the extremists are not minimized.  <br />
<br />
No pun intended, but we sit here and cannibalize ourselves over these issues, these issues no one would even notice if they didn't read these boards.  The happiest shaman I know, as far as satisfaction playing their class, are the ones who don't read these forums.<br />
<br />
Just seems pretty senseless we get bent at the edges about this stuff to the degree we do. (I'm guilty too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">magicians have the most to complain about, then monks, then SK's.<br />
<br />
SK has both group and raid utilities and desireability. Monk has high raid utility, super useless in groups. Magicians are low group utility (wiz better in most cases) and low raid utility in no-coth zones especially.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is where the issues come in though.  Note that you compare to Mages to wizards to highlight their relative failings.<br />
<br />
The question is, why would you take an SK over a paladin or a warrior in a group for a tank?  Why would you take a monk over a bard for puller, like.. ever?   <br />
<br />
The answer to that question is:  Who cares?  I know that I personally don't sit around trying to min/max my groups to MAXIMIZE DPS.   I grab a druid or a cleric, a tank of some type (don't care what), and the rest DPS.  I actually prefer mages to wizards.<br />
<br />
On paper everything looks ****ed up but somehow it all comes together.  My bigger point is to just not get bent out of shape over all of this, the shaman class is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Apply your points to shamans, and while you are correct in that it doesn't matter a LOT it is the nature of the game that MOST people do try to maximise the benefits of the group composition.<br />
<br />
When forming a group and you are looking for a slower (and you are not a shaman :p ) why would you take a shaman over the &quot;almost obligatory&quot; enchanter and another dps?<br />
<br />
When forming a group and you are looking for a backup healer why would you take a shaman over a druid assuming a slower is in the group?<br />
<br />
Most people have a list in their heads of what classes they want to invite to the group after they have the first 2 members, they then run down those classes LFG and invite the ones who are free.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it used to be shaman were top of the totem pole for the &quot;slowing spot&quot; and now we are not (mainly due to shortcomings in our other role - healing), so when people do their mental list shaman are last spot backup healing, and now enchanter and beastlord are (arguably) above us for the slowing spot.<br />
<br />
Added to this problem is there are a crap load of druids out there who place a huge buffer between the shaman getting the backup healer role. There are also a crap load of people who are playing the latest &quot;godlike&quot; class, BL's, further compounding the problem on the slowing side.<br />
<br />
Leaving us dead last in being invited for a group position in the two roles we have in the game, we are never gonna be invited for dps or pulling. Please those who rock in pulling LDoN's refrain from commenting, pulling in LDoN does not compare to pulling stuff in difficult areas where a 2 pull can mean a wipe. Also if anyone brings up dps in GoD etc I'm gonna laugh in your face.</div></div><hr />

Thank you!<br />
<br />
Min / Maxxing is all very good until you realize it's garbage.  Now, I'm sure alot of you think that's untrue, but let me explain where I'm coming from with an example or two:<br />
<br />
I log on, and do a /lfg.  I see there is about 25 people LFG, so I pull a monk, BST, mage, and druid out of the lot (actually, those four were sitting with LFG on in the safe room in BoT).  Now, I need a tank.. so I look into /lfg again, and find 3 tanks LFG.  One is a 65 shadowknight, one is a 62 warrior, and the other is a 65 paladin.<br />
<br />
I send a message to said SK (simply because he had the easiest name to type) and tell him to head to BoT if he wants a group (his note under LFG is &quot;Anything&quot;).  The SK sends a reply &quot;You have a cleric, of course.&quot; and I reply &quot;druid, actually.&quot;  He then comes back with &quot;I refuse to group with druids, they aren't good healers.&quot; Oookk..<br />
<br />
I grab the Paladin.<br />
<br />
An hour later, our BST leaves, so I turn to /lfg for another DPS... SK is *still* LFG.<br />
<br />
An hour and a half after that, our wizzah leaves (he replaced the BST), so I turn to the /lfg again.. sk is LFG, again.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, our Pally has to leave, so I turn to /lfg and ask the SK if he wants a group (he was the only tank LFG), he says &quot;Didn't you ask em before?&quot; I say, &quot;yup, you said no because we have a druid.&quot;  He says &quot;ahh, get a decent healer and I'll come tank.&quot;<br />
<br />
Point is, because this SK is trying to min/max with a healer, he wasted 2.5+ hours of xping in Bot.. about a full AA.<br />
<br />
I don't care much about min/maxing.  I've done quite a bit of main healer, slowing, and even on two occasions tanking. :P<br />
<br />
If all you look at is min/max, you'll miss alot of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oops. another point.<br />
<br />
Where you say if people didn't read these boards everybody would be happy with the shaman class.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I call BS on this - it used to be I logged into EQ and could guarantee getting asked to join a group within 30 minutes, or less, very often, without even putting up the LFG tag at all sometimes.<br />
<br />
I don't want to argue if this was good for the game, but it certainly used to be good for shamans :p<br />
<br />
Nowadays I can be LFG for hours (excluding guild group invites), often, and it isn't because I am a bad shaman.<br />
<br />
Even without reading these boards I could have seen there was a problem with the shaman class. <br />
<br />
We are now back to the point we reached when we had the last healing rebalancing. Keeping crits, GoD heals and healing aa's out of the picture, the reason being is all priest classes get these and because the percentage increase is on a higher base all other priests benefit more than us from them. Using healing aa's we get worse if we assume similarly geared and aa'd other priest classes.<br />
<br />
My best heal is not healing half bub of a well geared, buffed tank, assume 13k+ - which is pathetic for &quot;priest&quot; class (and I will slap anyone who mentions Kraggs Mending :) ). My HoT, which used to pick up the slack in olden days, is now laughed at by mobs hitting for 1k+. For the shaman HoT to make any impression nowadays, similar to Torpor, it would have to be around 1k per tick (I'm not suggesting it be raised to this, it would be nice but I can never see this happening).<br />
<br />
The paladin I usually group with is 9k buffed (only just above average these days) and my best heal is 14% of his hitpoints :(  - I don't have Daluda's in which case it would heal a massive 18% of his hps.<br />
<br />
Its not extremists, its everday shamans who are feeling the LFG problem. Personally, I'm relatively OK for groups ( I'm in a reasonable sized guild with 40+ members on most times I log in) but that is solely due to guildies who will invite me and doing similar to what you are suggesting and not max'ing the group potential.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't quote it all<br />
<br />
Lets suppose you had to leave and not one of the other classes - do you really believe the group would recruit a shaman in your spot.<br />
<br />
I can see the group conversation now if you left:<br />
<br />
Paladin: OK, shammy left - we looking for another shaman to replace him<br />
Beastlord: No, I can slow - if mage will malosini we'll be fine<br />
Mage: I can Malosini np<br />
Paldain: Great, lets look for another DPS, enchanter or maybe a cleric (and druid can nuke) then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, as many know I don't think Shaman are hopelessly broken.  But, I have to say that I play a lot, 430aa's and there has been a tremendous reduction in quick LFG invites compared to the old POP days.  I have got 2 invites to GoD trial groups in 5 months (pickup) and thousands of invites for LDON, BOT, Earth, Fire, blah blah blah.  Even our bread and butter &quot;easy&quot; invite LDON is much worse than it used to be, and I have taken to starting groups myself (have full leader aa's now, lol) since I don't like waiting around for long periods of time.<br />
<br />
Whatever you think about Shaman tuning this is undisputable - Shaman are not getting invited to their fair share of GoD content groups.  Some part that problem is that we don't measure up to Beastlords/Enchanters/Druids, and some part is peoples perception that we suck (and some Shaman do suck).<br />
<br />
The other undisputable fact is that Shaman stack poorly on raids and that our burst DD damage needs to improve to carry our weight in raid settings with multiple Shaman.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't think that a hard working talanted Shaman sucks.  But to be just average or slightly below average while playing your class to it's full potential is bad.  Just as an amazing Bard, Enchanter or Necro is so good you want to clap you hands, so should an amazing Shaman.  These are the classes where imagination, timing and skill really matters.  Oh a good pulling Mage is something to see also, lol.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, but you make a lot of assumptions here that are not always true.  Last night, had a great group in BoT, 3 aa's in 4 hrs with Bard chain pulling, cleric, myself, SK tank and 2 dps classes.  I had to leave, 65 Chanter in zone lfg, so I ask the group if they wanted him.  Answer, no get a shaman.  The dps classes obviously wanted the Fo7, FA, back up healing and dps I was providing.  Even with Bard pulling 4 on occassion, his mez was all we needed to keep things under control.  So, your obligatory class in this case would have been as useful as tits on a bull.<br />
<br />
So, my point, it is all relative.  In this case the chanter brought nothing to the existing group.  Charming a pet would have increased our dps, which was fine already, and would have stolen both exp from the group and proven a distraction when charm breaks.  Last time I died in BoT was due to a charm break in the middle of a double pull.  Yeah, it can be fun to have the pet, but it can also be a royal PITA.  I'd rather do it the old fashioned way, good balanced group of experienced players.<br />
<br />
Finally, we also had a BST join before I left the group.  He tried slowing on the next pull, got 3 resists and I ended up slowing the mob.  Not sure what happened after that (I logged) but I believe they were still looking for a shaman.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the person that said they go hours without a group when lfg, gee, maybe The Nameless server is unique, but after 65 levels of pick up groups and raids, I know many folks on the server, and never go lfg more than 10 min.  And if I did, I'd solo a bit or start my own group, LDoN guarantees an open camp whenever you want.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, all this maxing of group members is just plain stupid.  If you consider the time you waste looking for the perfect group, you would realize you are better off just getting a group and exp'ing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as my experience goes, this is dead wrong.  Most tanks I know will always look for a shaman before a chanter.  Yeah, if you are going somewhere with lots of adds, or where a charmed pet makes sense, then maybe the chanter will come to mind.  However, most of my tank and dps class friends are confident in their abilities to kill the mob.  Funny, but the only charm killing groups I've ever been in were started by the chanter.  And the rest of the group had to baby sit him in case the charm broke.  Both boring and annoying for the rest of the group, regardless of the exp, which was not that much better than we could have done without the pet (since he reduces the percentage exp the group gets).  I've never seen a tank say, gee, let me start a group and get a chanter to charm kill.  <br />
<br />
However, I usually get tells from tanks or dps classes starting groups who first, get a cleric/druid to heal, and second, get the slower, usually shaman first, then rest.  Yeah, you could try BST and get slow/dps, but with 3 dps slots already, why do that when you could go Shaman and get slow/heals/buffs?  And don't tell me a Bst can do what we can do, no BST I know can keep all buffs on a high dps group, back up heal and guarantee a slow on the mob.  And don't forget that Malos also makes it possible for the other casters to better land their spells.<br />
<br />
Not trying to start a flame war here, but your experience is opposite from mine.  I get groups every single night.  Don't know the last time I did not get a group when looking.  Last night, log on, 3 invites before I got to the BoT camp and turned off my lfg flag.  Maybe in Gates it will be different, but in 65 levels and almost 2 yrs of playing, it's always been the same.   I figure when I get to Gates the trend will continue, at least for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">and my experience is the opposite. I get regular positive comments on my skill, but generally takes anywhere from an hour, or more, to even get lucky with a group (and it only takes longer with my bard and I can't solo worth a nickel there).<br />

&quot;Your mileage may vary&quot; definitely holds here.</div></div><hr />

As stated numerous times, the primary issues with the Shaman class have their roots in PoP (slow mitigation) but do not reach fruition until GoD. In BoT and up through Time, we're still on the upper scale of necessity. <br />
<br />
When you get to Gates, the trend will only continue briefly. Then the tanks WILL say &quot;let's get a chanter to charm&quot; and ask you to buff them on their way past you. <br />
<br />
Hell, just a few nights ago I saw a guild group looking for slower in GoD pass over one of our shaman for nearly 30 minutes because they were hoping a BL would log in. Something is entirely wrong with that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nice Thread.<br />
<br />
Few points from me:<br />
<br />
1. It's the player not the toon that matters.<br />
<br />
2. Yes we Shamans on paper are not the most desirable classes (Tanks, Clerics and Enchanters are)<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes only a certain class/archetype (or even a certain class with specific AAs) will do to group a certain spot.<br />
<br />
Given all these factors:<br />
<br />
I make my own groups (have almost all the Leader AAs maxed now) so that i can strike a balance between:<br />
<br />
1. Inviting friends/talented players<br />
<br />
2. inviting the right classes<br />
<br />
3. Choosing the right camp spot for the group. E.g. there are plenty of spots I can get pretty decent exp without a Fully defensive AA equipped tank, and I will go to one of those spots if i don't get the tank.<br />
<br />
The moral of this story is (and it's already in the Shaman General FAQ Thread) make your own groups.<br />
<br />
See you,<br />
<br />
Vincenzo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/agree with you Vincenzo<br />
<br />
With in minutes of me putting on LFG I get invites..now normally its Hey wanna group in BoT or are you up to healing in a Norm LDoN and slow too we have another healer a druid.  Things like that.  If I can't find a group I solo.  Thats what I love about being a shaman.  I am not dependant on anyone to be able toplay this game.  I explore all over its great.  I try to find mobs to solo which give a decent time to kill/exp ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There is nothing wrong with shaman pre GoD other than raid stacking, which shouldn't be as big problem with good recruiting and all the class-of-the-month-club people switching to BL's. If you are fielding 6 to 8 shaman a raid, stop recruiting them and the problem will fix iteself.<br />
<br />
In GoD our heals are underpowered, our nukes to weak, and our dots to slow (other than on a few encounters). Yeah, it really sux, however, this is ONE expansion, we still have solro / elementals / hard ldon for a decent challenge, and we do well grouping there.<br />
<br />
On average, I loggin, turn on LFG, and get a bot/ldon invite in the first ten minutes, after about 15 to 30 minutes I ussually have a PoE / SolRo invite. That's still better than many classes out there. In a normal elementals group I am slowing, buffing, patch healing, sicking the pet, and still doing a decent ammount of damage with rains/nukes/dots, whatever the situation calls for. If I want instant GoD invites I play my cleric (/shudder), but for everything else, I have much more fun with the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;Point is, because this SK is trying to min/max with a healer, he wasted 2.5+ hours of xping in Bot.. about a full AA.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Except, you can waste time in other ways, depending on the content.  Waiting an extra hour to get a better group in KT, usually means you save time on corpse runs and downtime later.<br />
<br />
That SK refusing to do BoT with a druid.. now, thats dumb hehe.  Maybe he has like 2.3k hp or something:)</div></div><hr />

Don't need to get bent out of shape, I agree, but indeed, the shaman class is NOT fine.<br />

And seriously, BoT is not where you are going to see a weakness, it is going to be in the *latest* expansion where Shaman class breaks down.<br />

<br />
Slow has been marginalized, what did we get in return? Nothing.  Snare, ports, evac, harm pulling and better nuking have NOT been marginalized.<br />
<br />
If you are getting KT groups &quot;minutes&quot; after logging on, then you are very lucky.  And I consider myself to be a very good shaman.  I literally never stop casting.  Ever.  My hands are very tired at the end of the night.  Mobs are always slowed the instant they touch a tank.  <br />
<br />
Its not that I don't contribute the maximum that my class can provide, the problem is this:<br />
<br />
Druid+Cleric+Enc &gt; Shaman + Cleric + Anything else.  <br />
<br />
As I and many have said before, sure, replacing the enc slower and druid backup healer with one character (the shaman) opens a slot in a group for another player.    You can add utility, dps, whatever in that situation.  It basically boils down to heals.  On a tough named, our heals are not enough to compete with a druid.  When slow bounces, we are stuck in that lame situation as the tank is dropping fast of A) try to fast heal or B) try to slow again.<br />
<br />
Either A or B can mean death for a tank on a hard mob.  I've watched as myself and cleric, chain spamming fast heals, were not able to keep up with a unslowed mob.  A druid could have.  If the backup healer were not the slower, slow could have been continually cast on the mob, while backup healing was still occuring.<br />
<br />
Being able to slow and heal is almost a curse in that situation.  Specialized classes excel in GoD, jack of all trades do not.</div></div><hr />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Sorry, but you make a lot of assumptions here that are not always true. Last night, had a great group in BoT, 3 aa's in 4 hrs with Bard chain pulling, cleric, myself, SK tank and 2 dps classes. I had to leave, 65 Chanter in zone lfg, so I ask the group if they wanted him. Answer, no get a shaman. The dps classes obviously wanted the Fo7, FA, back up healing and dps I was providing. Even with Bard pulling 4 on occassion, his mez was all we needed to keep things under control. So, your obligatory class in this case would have been as useful as tits on a bull.<br />
<br />
So, my point, it is all relative. In this case the chanter brought nothing to the existing group. Charming a pet would have increased our dps, which was fine already, and would have stolen both exp from the group and proven a distraction when charm breaks. Last time I died in BoT was due to a charm break in the middle of a double pull. Yeah, it can be fun to have the pet, but it can also be a royal PITA. I'd rather do it the old fashioned way, good balanced group of experienced players.<br />
<br />
Finally, we also had a BST join before I left the group. He tried slowing on the next pull, got 3 resists and I ended up slowing the mob. Not sure what happened after that (I logged) but I believe they were still looking for a shaman.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the person that said they go hours without a group when lfg, gee, maybe The Nameless server is unique, but after 65 levels of pick up groups and raids, I know many folks on the server, and never go lfg more than 10 min. And if I did, I'd solo a bit or start my own group, LDoN guarantees an open camp whenever you want.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, all this maxing of group members is just plain stupid. If you consider the time you waste looking for the perfect group, you would realize you are better off just getting a group and exp'ing.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, I have no idea what you are trying to prove with this example. <br />
<br />
Of course a group with a reasonably competent bard isn't going to want to take an enchanter, the overlap between those classes is so high that the benefit is minimal (therefore the group was min/maxing). I have almost never seen a bard and an enchanter in the same group. Naturally in this example the shaman makes a better group member than the enchanter. For every rule, there is always an exception, you spotted the exception, grats to you. There are probably more, but I am speaking in general terms.<br />
<br />
I still believe that group would have been better taking a beastlord, all the bard would have to do is twist in HoS (with reasonable mods he could get pretty high mr drop on the mob to enable the BL slow to land). Hell, the bard could have slowed for 50%, with +mods bards can get up to 67% slow. Beastlord buffs are better than a shaman (arguably - so close its not worth mentioning the difference) and their dps is much better.<br />
<br />
I am not saying I approve of min/maxing groups - I don't myself with regards to guildies, if guildies are looking for groups then I will happily take 2 clerics and go and do an BB adv using a cleric for dps. Hell, I've done an EF adv with 3 shaman before from my guild. What I will do, and I am sure most people do (even those who are not min/maxing, they say) is looking for specific classes for specific roles, they then go down the LFG list and pick those classes and invite them. <br />
<br />
Even if you are not min/maxing you do this subconsciously, i.e. as a shaman how many times have you looked at the LFG list and thought &quot;Oh, gee, theres another 65 shaman there lfg - guess I'll invite him over &lt;insert any other class here&gt;&quot; You have then min/maxed by not inviting another shaman into your group. Even when you &quot;randomly&quot; invite 5 people to a group I will bet my bank account that your &quot;random&quot; group includes as many people of the core class roles as you can fit in given what the LFG tool is telling you who is LFG - excluding guild groups. You are not truly doing a gather 5 other &quot;random&quot; classes, if you wanted to do this you would put all the names available who are lfg into a hat and draw out 5 names.<br />
<br />
What I am trying to point out is that the majority of EQ DO min/max, and will only take the &quot;lesser&quot; option if there is no other choice, and unfortunately, shaman are becoming the &quot;lesser&quot; choice (if we haven't reached that place already). <br />
<br />
Finally, to repeat a quote from above, I wish a thread like this could get raised without someone mentioning BoT in it and how we are fine in there - I can rock in Velks also, but I don't want to freaking xp in the place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was exping in Barindu the other day. Pulling to near the sewers entrances.  Guess what. Every single mob Mitigates. Now I can still heal here. Because I have 421 AA. With Spell casting mastery 4 And IHA and HM all full ranks. And SCRM full up. I also have ornate arms. And some other bazzar gear level stuff. The SK tank I duo with is right at 7600 Hps with 126 aa. And A Velium Gemmed weapon. (2 hand blunt) For information with Full raid buffs and tribute running I am at 5600 hps roughly and around 1150 ac. Pathetic to this crowd now. But it is my gear I have earned and I am proud of it.<br />
<br />
But you know what. I have to play my ass off to do it. And a 2 pull has every chance in the world of wiping us both in a split second. The ratuks are only partially slowable. Flurry, proc chaos claws and can hit for upwards of 600+ It is hard content for me to duo. <br />
<br />
I am taking advantage of my class abilities. If we add dps Then the camp becomes trivial. Even with me healing. But If the mini named Ratuk spawns. Guess what. I am 95% useless. Sure I can slow him. And it does help. But he mitagates, and a beastlord can slow him damn close as well but will do much much more damage in the course of the fight. And make the fight shorter. But here is the kicker. I Absolutly cannot heal this fight. I can do everything to spawn him then have to call in a real class to heal. And the only level of gear that would allow me to heal this fight is a warrior with time+ level gear. So that his damage is almost meaningless. <br />

<br />
Nothing to prove, just making a point.  You gave an example which assumed if a shaman left a group, the rest of the group would not recruit another, I say that's bull (from my experience).  It is all situational.  There is no &quot;almost obligatory&quot; class, as you said.  No, having a chanter is not always a must or even desired.  Just like every other class, there are situations and locations where they are less than ideal.  Can a good shaman play and have fun in Gates, sure.  Will you be on everybody's must have list, probably not.  And just about every other class would say the same thing.  The grass is always greener somewhere else.  However, the game is what you make of it.  <br />
<br />
And I mention BoT, because at my level, it's great exp and lots of fun.   :)<br />

<br />
I min/max all the time...but I use a slightly different algorithm...<br />
<br />
1. /who all guild - pick my fav guildies who are not engaged in anything that they can't drop.  Ask them and usually get a few yesses...<br />
2. /who all friends - pick the ones at my level and ask them if they're busy.  Again, usually a few yesses.<br />
3. if there is a missing &quot;core&quot; class and there rarely is, my guildies and my friends will also have their own friends list to parse.  <br />
<br />
I recently found my way into a small group of friends that hunt together alot. They consist of war, dru, and bst.  With my combo of (cleric or mage)+shammy, we can do alot together.  Ldon's, 1/2 tier planes..(no we're not all 65's yet).  It's true that the war, dru, bst and do without me easily.  But then again, they like to have me along.  Not for added power, but for added companionship and fun.  And I like to group with them, not because they complement me well, but because they are fun to hang around with and easy going.  <br />
<br />
Generally, my choice of partners and hunting zones go like this.  Pick your favorite partners first and go to the zones that you can handle--have lots of fun killing and joking around.  The added advantage to this is...it's almost always understood that loot is NBG.  I know this is the slow way to becoming uber(and I may never get there)...but it sure is a fun way to do it.<br />
 <br />
I know this doesn't really address the issue of this post, as some of you will say that a chanter/bst with good friends+guild is better than shammy with good friends+guild.  Hehe..I guess all I really wanted to say is if you emphasize the social aspects of the game more, any class deficiencies can be somewhat &quot;mitigated.&quot;<br />

<br />
min/maxing is where it's at.  in fact it's made the min/maxer so far ahead of you that if you're stuck trying to put together bot groups with strangers they're completely playing a different game.<br />
<br />
the fact is, 6 good shaman could group anywhere in bot and ****ing tear the place apart while bored to tears... any sort of playing tactics really is meaningless if you're talking about doing trivial content.  often people who doubt their own abilities will ask 10,000 questions when taking a group not because of anything to do to min/maxing but to see if there will be others in the group to cover their asses<br />
<br />
if you're talking about doing current, hard content, min/maxing is the difference between winning a trial or losing, of steady 4 hours of exp and 12 aas or wipe<br />

Sorry, but I have a problem with this.  Just because the group was not &quot;maxed&quot; or &quot;ideal&quot; does not mean it was crappy.  I have more fun playing with guys who like to have fun, then I do with a bunch of yo-yo's that are only interested in maxing the group so they can &quot;maximize&quot; their exp.  <br />

True story, last night, 8/30, in BoT (of all places) cleric leaves, so I invite a druid.  Not too worried about not having rez, just needed some healing to augment mine, and since I have druid friends who have a hard time getting groups, as group leader I chose a druid.  Screw the fact that &quot;by definition&quot; I should have gotten a cleric.  Anyway, druid gets there, and before we get our 6th, he starts pulling and tanking (to our amazement).  Turns out to be Kallamon Ragingwind, top druid on The Nameless server (per EQRankings, only player I've ever met with 820 aa's).  The guy was incredible and basically PL'd us for a while.  <br />
<br />
Now my point, it was fun as hell.  And I would never have met and played with him if I had my nose up my butt and only considered inviting a cleric.  This is a game, take a chance and play with other classes that may not make a perfect group, it can be a lot of fun.  And you know what, so what if we fail or get wiped, what's the big deal?<br />

I don't know anyone who is getting a check from SoE for being the most uber or for getting to 70 the quickest.  I pay them to have fun, not sweat whether I have the perfect group or not.  If everyone played with that attitude, then no class would be &quot;broken&quot;.  Please, wake up.<br />
<br />
I don't think that the &quot;crappy&quot; reference was to the group, but to the zone.  The context was such that any ol' &quot;crappy&quot; group could do BoT mobs, whereas the tendency to do the new content requires more min/maxing.  Hence, the reference made earlier that your groups in BoT do not need a cleric (nor a druid either).<br />
<br />
What I still find entertaining is that people seem to be acting as if the min/max idea of new content is something new.  Every expansion has required such methods, Gates just held onto that a bit longer than others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I think people are getting way off track on this subject.  Trivial content doesn't matter since any Shaman with some aa's and practice can throw together a group to do that content.  The Shaman is not at the whim of the Holy Trinity in trivial content and we can just assemble a group if we are not satisfied with the speed of group invites.<br />
<br />
But when you get to more difficult content you have two problems.  #1 is getting people to want to go GoD stuff at all instead of lesser risk camps, and #2 assembling a group that can actually do it well.  When you have these two issues facing you it's the group that is forced to balance itself - and like it or not the GoD groups start with a beefy tank, a cleric and some sort of puller bard/monk or Enchanter.  <br />
<br />
Shaman are not the ones assembling pickup GoD groups because it just about can't be done.  Oh how I have tried, and it is a complete waste of time outside of Guild groups.  The successful pickup GoD groups are formed with the core classes (see above) and those peeps fill out the remainder of the group.  With an enchanter or beastlord in the group we don't get invited (99% of the time).  The group makes that decision.  If they want to wait for 30 min to find the perfect group it is their decision and often they do it.  The other classes read the boards and they are convinced as many of the Crucible members are that we suck so we don't get invited.<br />
<br />
There is no way that I feel a Beastlord brings more to the table than I do in any content unless the Beastlord is godly.  Safety does matter and a great Shaman provides more than a Beastlord at the expense of some DPS, yes, but not so much if you are a well equipped high aa shaman chaining nukes.  Unfortunately Enchanters blow us out of the water regarding safety since we really don't have any CC abilities to speak of in hard content where our root break/resists just doesn't cut it.<br />
<br />
Well, I think the holy trinity is back (duh I guess) and we are at the mercy of the hold trinity to get the better higher content GoD groups and we are getting stiffed.<br />
<br />
Solution?  Better DPS (to compete against Beastlords and Druids) and significantly better CC (to compete against Enchanters).  Healing is not our #1 issue IMHO nor it it even on my list since I believe strongly that the decision on Clerics being necessary in harder content single group encounters has already been made.  Our issue is how to get parity with Beastlords/Enchanters/Druids to be selected by the holy trinity<br />
<br />
Unfortunately that is the way things are.  We are not in control of our destiny in harder content.  That is why we need retuning to get the tools to compete (on level ground - not superior - not inferior) with BL/En/Dr.<br />

PS: It's no coincidence that the godly classes in easy LDON, Shaman, Mages, SK are having issues getting groups in tough content.  I never realized how godly a great SK was in normal LDON's with their taps, etc until I did one with some wizzy/mage/necro Dps'ers in addition to the SK.  I casted Q on the SK twice and no heals in each of the two adventures we won.  But unfortunately (like us) the wonderful taps that SK's get become much less efficient as the DPS of the mob increases (including slow mitigation).  Mage pets rule normal LDON's and can offtank or primary tank wonderfully but they lose that ability in GoD content.</div></div><hr />

Numerous posts, parses, experiences .etc etc ever and anon.... attest to the fact that shaman are not broken in BoT or other older content.<br />
It is newer content, being a worthwhile contributor on the cutting edge that is the problem.</div></div><hr />
