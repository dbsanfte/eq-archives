<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Warning - this is kinda lengthy . . .<br />
<br />
<br />
I had an interesting discussion with a fellow shaman last night about equipment and the inevitable AC/HP vs Wis merits. After reading this board I became a very strong advocate of the AC/HP school. My intention with this post is NOT to resurrect the debate over AC/HP vs Wis. I have a unique and very specific angle on the issue that I would like feedback on.<br />
<br />
<br />
As I talked with my counterpart I began to wonder if perhaps I have gone a little overboard in my pursuit of AC/HP. My Wisdom is very low - 110 or 115 if I run around in bear form. My AC/HPs self buffed top out at 809 AC and 1300 HPs - all at level 35.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I know that the answer is &quot;I need to find what works best for me and go with that&quot;. But before I start experimenting too much with wisdom gear I just wanted to hear some thoughts and opinions on my setup. Is this a similiar route that YOU took as you worked through the mid-levels??  What worked for you? Am I at the level where Wisdom is starting to become important? <br />
<br />
AC/HP wise, I am very happy with my setup. There are a few upgrades that I would like, but none of those have Wis on them. I rarely go OOM in battle, but I do micro-manage my mana very carefully.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is the AC/HP debate more of a &quot;high-end&quot; concern? I certainly see the advantage of my AC and HP as I am pretty tough when I have to melee (keyword is when I HAVE to - in good groups this is rare). It is nice to play meat shield for the intelligent casters until the tanks can taunt mobs off of me but this is a rare occurance. At the same time, I wonder if my setup is hindering my performance as a caster??<br />
<br />
Obviously, I'm not contemplating going the path of the druid with wisdom veils and polished bone bracers :) , but I am considering perhaps a slight reduction in AC or hitpoints in favor of more wisdom.<br />
<br />
Here is my current setup:<br />
<br />
Left earing: Orc Fang Earring <br />
Necklace: Ry`Gorr Chain Collar <br />
Face: Silvery Mask <br />
Head: Jaundiced Bone Helm <br />
Right earing: Orc Fang Earring <br />
  <br />
Left finger: Velium Fire Wedding Ring <br />
Left wrist: Ry`Gorr Chain Bracer <br />
Arms: Jaundiced Bone Vambraces <br />
Hands: Iksar Scaled Gloves <br />
Right wrist: Totemic Bracers <br />
Right finger: Velium Fire Wedding Ring <br />
  <br />
Shoulders: Tattered Mantle <br />
Chest: Ry`Gorr Battle Mail <br />
Back: Hooded Black Cloak <br />
Waist: Spider Fur Belt <br />
Legs: Totemic Greaves <br />
Feet: Totemic Boots <br />
  <br />
Melee 1: Dark Ember or Slime Coated Harpoon<br />
Melee 2: Clay Guardian Shield <br />
Range: Goranga Idol <br />
<br />
<br />
Thoughts, ideas, comments?? <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading this, sorry if this sounds foolish but I am trying to be the best shaman that I can :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Id go for the Tribunal only earrings, imbued  ivory earrings.  They are 2ac, 4wis, 4 SV cold, and you can pick em up for under100pp on Saryrn.  Your orc fang earrings are prob the easiest things to chuck out, though the 15hp is helpfull...<br />
<br />
At the moment i have a reasonably big mana pool, as i wastwinked w/ alot of wis.  I can tell you that if you dont go oom, then keep doing what you do, because i get low on mana anyway, and dont have the HP's to work w/ as of yet.  Luckily solb is an uber money zone, and i should have all the upgrades i need in a few more days^^;<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think your gear is ok, if you dont go oom much whats the problem?  The earrings are great though, and if you want more wis, as 115 is pretty low, then get those</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mez think joo just fine.<br />
<br />
Over time joo wis will start to increase as joo improve da equipment slot buy slot.  Lots of upgrades have both better<br />
ac and some wis on dem.<br />
<br />
Sounds like joo doing a guud job with mana management in group and when Solo your rack shines.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jesus man.  I think I have decent equip and at lvl 50 i'm like 780ac, 1150hp hehe.  My wis is 188 though.  I really don't know what to recommend.  I think you'll find after lvl 51 (sup heal/turgur's) you'll run out of mana quickly with 110 WIS.  I don't have many equipment upgrade recommendations, especially cuse I don't know what kind of money you have laying around.  My suggestion is keep doin what you're doin.  HP/AC is never a bad thing.  A few items that will jump your wis up, but could get a little pricey are: (mind you these also have decent AC, so consider them upgrades)<br />
<br />
Ivory Imbued Collar - Lose like 1 ac for 5wis + other stats.<br />
Earring of Twisted Leaves<br />
Earring of Woven Bark<br />
Coldain Skin Gloves<br />
Smiter's Girdle<br />
Bracelet of Sense<br />
<br />
All of these are pretty pricey, with the Gloves being like 3k, and the Bracer being like 15k, but like I said, I think you're doin a good job so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think your question is stupid at all.  Not every shaman is lev 60 and this question does pertain to shamans of all levels.<br />
<br />
A very unscientific answer is that Wis=/ mana.  While Wis does largely determine your mana pool, it does have some other uses as well.  I do think it determines  how quickly you will get skill increases in some trades, and most importantly in your casting skills.  So the danger exists to fall behind in some of the important skills, which in turn will lead to increased fizzles.  Fizzles = wasted mana = bad.  Your equipment is very nice for your level, and you seem to have access to at least some higher level gear.  Some very easy suggestions to improve your Wis, without sacrificing too much ac would be as follow:<br />
<br />
<br />
Earings, get Forrest Loops (decent ac, some stats, and most importantly some wis).  oops, just saw you are a barbi, Imbued Ivory are BEST.<br />
<br />
Bracer, Get yourself a RMB,or Arctic Wyvern Bracer.  Both have Wis, semi decent ac, AND I think they are a focus item now too (RMBs).  <br />
<br />
Mask, I am not familiar with the stats of the silvery mask, but and Arctic Wyvern Mask has good wis, ac and stats.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Range item:  Medicine Totem has wis AND ac<br />
<br />
Utilizing all these upgrades, you should be able to raise your WIS by close to 20 points without sacrificing too much hp and ac.  At level 32, I have (Fully self Buffed) 737 ac and 140 Wis with bear form.  If I swap out my crappy (Ac5) cloak (with Arctic Wyvern) and finally get a med totem, I should easily reach 800 Ac by the time I am 35, while gaining another 15 Wis.<br />
<br />
By the way (this incarnation of Widda is my second time around) when I started my original character, at lev 44, I had 785 ac (fully buffed) and 175 wis (that got better once I started the OOT circuit)   Now that was pre kunark, but I did allright )]<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wihle AC/HP vs WIS is definitely a scale that needs attention- you're leaving out a couple really important factors.  To me, HP/mana regeneration and mana-free damage are the most important stats.  Your biggest real upgrades will come from an Iksar BP, a horse, a fungi staff, a fungi tunic and (at 45) a JBB.  Of course, these are all expensive... but better to spend a lot on these then on a bunch of little stat increases.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think your equipment looks good.  At 51 I routinely run around with 120-130 WIS, and have no problems with mana (of course, I'm a regen/canni fiend.)  In case you do want to shift your focus a bit, let me make some suggestions that won't break your bank, offer nice wisdom upgrades, and don't totally trash your AC.  Also,  I'm going to throw one more consideration in there... focus effects.<br />
<br />
Neck:  Get a BA Medallion (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6020).  Stats aren't bad (ac 6, +5 wis, +5 int- so you'll lose a couple AC points, and gain 5 WIS.)  You'll also get &quot;Mana preservation II&quot;, which will cause all spells you cast under level 45 to cost 10% less.  These should also be pretty reasonably priced (few hundred PP.)<br />
<br />
Wrist:  Swap out the totemic bracer for a Chipped Bone Bracelet (CBB) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=809).  I know, I know... but hear me out.  You'll lose 5 AC, you'll gain 5 Wisdom, and you'll get &quot;Affliction Efficiency II&quot; - which will cause all DoTs under level 45 to cost 25% less mana to cast.  Again, this should just cost a few hundred PP.<br />
<br />
Waist:   Swap out the spider fur belt for a Reed Belt (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=959) - you'll lose 4 AC, you'll gain 5 WIS, and you'll get the effect &quot;Extended Affliction II&quot; which will cause all DoTs below level 45 to last 20% longer.  Probably be a bit tougher to find one of these- and it might run you 1k, so this might be a longer-term change.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that I think you need to make these swaps- I'm a bit of a AC/HP junkie myself, but if I were going to make changes I'd try to make them where I could also get focus effects.<br />
<br />
Other nice upgrades for you:<br />
<br />
Imbued Golden Ivory Earring (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4930) <br />
<br />
Arctic Wyvern Mask (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5289) - few hundred PP and great combination of stats.  The Enshrouded Veil (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1899) also makes a nice choice (nice stats, and has &quot;Summoning Efficiency III&quot;, which will cause your pet to take 25% less mana to cast) but will be a bit pricier.  I still wear the AW mask.  :)<br />
<br />
JB boots (nice AC boost, only a few hundred PP.)<br />
<br />
Good hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh yeah, you can go to SOLB at this level, thats where i am hunting at 37.  Not only is there an insane amount of cash there, mostly from finesteel drops, but the king is pretty easy to drop, and drops an RMB, which i looted of him last night.  RMB's are quite good wrist slots for wis.  <br />
btw, if you do go to solb, be sure to loot everything.  Everything the kolbolds drop sells for a couple plat, and the flowers sell for like 1-2 plat, and are stackable.  Everything else is bronze/fine steel, and quite nice to sell to the vendors.  <br />
<br />

Btw, where does earrings of the twisted leaves drop? the 1 ac, stats, and scale effect thingy.<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So far, I think the best suggestion is to stick with what you have and work toward an Iksar BP and/or JBB.  Wisdom is one of the easiest stats to get.  I went through the mid-50's with 135 WIS.  I'm over 200 now, but I never once tried to upgrade it.  It just kinda happened.  +15 wis here, +10 wis there adds up even when all you're looking at is AC/HP/resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Czakoriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One poster stated &quot;Wrist: Swap out the totemic bracer for a Chipped Bone Bracelet (CBB).

<br />
Are the affects of EACH CBB stackable to the other...ie....if I got 2 CBB my DoTs will cost 50% less.<br />
<br />
If this is the case...this is an awesome affect to the junior shaman.<br />

You are right, you need to base your equipment on how you play.  I am less of a meeleeer than buffer/healer.  I also have a son that is a real wheeler/dealer in the EC tunnel.  In 4 hours, he got my wisdom from 146 to 195.  My ac is around the 700 area non buffed.  At this point, i am going to lower my wis a little, knowing that the epic boots and spear will bring it up alot, and will concentrate on some ac/hp.  Good luck and good hunting...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for all the feedback, everybody!!<br />
<br />
This gives me some great ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the same focus effect won't stack, but different effects that work on the same type of spell will stack.  i borrowed an extended afflicition III and afflicition efficiency item and every time i cast a DoT or debuff both items &quot;glowed&quot; and had some effect on the spells.<br />
<br />
as for the original poster... i went a similar route around level 30-35.  all AC / HP (not much HP stuff available prekunark...).  my wisdom was around 120-130.  i don't remember hit points but AC was around 700.  since this was prekunark, there wasn't anywhere near the selection of ac/hp items.  <br />
<br />
but instead of just ac/hp/wis/resists in whatever order is preferred, the key seems to be worn and click effects.  items that have see invis (sabretooth amulet, fingerbone hoop), infravision/ultravision (tranix crown, velious bracers), regeneration (fungi tunic, iksar bp), flowing thought, focus effects, direct damage (jbb), etc seem to be more sought after than an item with good ac or good wisdom.  look at the &quot;best shield&quot; debate on another thread.  there's people that like the shield with 75 AC.  there's people that like the shield(s) with 100 hit points.  there's people that like the shield(s) with 10+ to each resist.  but the general consensus seems to be that EVERYONE likes the shields with worn effects - especially flowing thought VI. (i don't recall if another effect was mentioned on a shield).<br />
<br />
the bottom line is that gear doesn't really matter in the end.  if you're in a guild or will be joining a guild that does the ueber raids, you'll end up with some of the ueber equipment.  if you're not and you just play with a few friends, fret not.  there's still a lot of quests that can be completed by a single group and net some decent stuff.  with all the equipment available today, i'm sure you'll be able to hit 2000 hp, 1000 ac, 200+ wisdom and 100+ in each resist by the time you're level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1)  809 ac is good for 35.  If you drop about 6 raw ac, you're going to fall below 800 ac.  There's a school of thought that says (correctly, as far as I can tell) that the game looks at ac in discrete chunks, 700, 750, 800, etc, and makes no distinction for melee purposes between, say, 802 ac and 809.  This also means that there isn't any difference between 799 ac and 751.  The upshot is, dropping &quot;a few&quot; points of ac in favor of wis may be costing you more than you think.<br />
<br />
2)  Skill raises.  The only way (unless you're being PL'd) you're NOT going to max your inportant skills is if you don't use them.  If you don't use them, then having 180 wis isn't going to make any difference.<br />
<br />
3)  At 35, each point of wis is worth about 6 mana.  That means, if you raise your wis by 20 points, you get 120 mana.  Thats 2/3rds of a Greater Healing or 2/3rds of a Scourge.  If that extra 20 wis were free, that'd be great.  It won't be, though, it's likely gonna cost you 40 or so ac, possibly more.<br />
<br />
4)  Wis has NO effect on how fast you can pump out mana.  None.  Zilch.  Zero.  You don't med faster, cann faster, or regen faster.  ALL it does is give you a bigger bucket of mana to pour from, and the ONLY time that's useful is if you're mana-dumping because you got a bad pull.  If you got a bad pull, it's more than likely that you're taking some hits yourself, because you're either healing the other people in your party or debuffing the mobs.  If you're taking hits, it's fairly important that you stay alive, at least until you finish debuffing/go oom from healing.  AC/HP gear helps this (duh).  From a mana standpoint, AC helps preserve your hp so you can turn it into mana if you need to.<br />
<br />
5)  Focus Items.  Most of the focus effects that are useful to shamans are on druid crap.  This kind of sucks.  To be fair, there are some sexy-as-hell effects out there (mana efficiency 3, please-and-thank-you), but staying alive remains job one, so how these will effect the game is still less clearly defined for shamans than it is for those classes that would be wearing this stuff even if it didn't have effects.  If using one doesn't drop you below an ac threshold, sure, go for it.  Otherwise, I dunno...tough choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
A quick-and-dirty rule of thumb is, do you (or others) tend to die while you still have mana in your pool?  If so, more wis won't help.  On the other hand, if you run OOM every pull, just from normal heals/debuffs, then maybe more mana is the key.  I know for me, people rarely die because I didn't have enough mana.  When they do, which isn't often, it's usually because spells take so damn long to cast, or the person I was casting on ran out of range (it amazes me, at 55 people still do this).  I am admittedly biased.  I like to be right in there, and I like to cast slow, etc when it needs to be cast, rather than when it's safe (for me) to do so, so ac, etc, may figure more for my play style than for some others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Although the Ac/Wis/Hp/mana debate rages on, it is nowhere near as polarized as it used to be. People are starting to realise that the relative merits of AC, wis and hp are entirely situational. There will be different times when each is the most important.<br />
<br />
As a young shaman it is important to try to keep your defense maxed. To do this you need to melee, and the easiest way to melee is to solo - in this situation AC &amp; Hp are more important than mana. However, in a good group you should rarely get hit, and in this situation wis/mana (and to an extent hp) are more important than AC<br />
<br />
Balance, I think, is the key. You should solo enough to keep your melee skill up (especially defense), and you should group enough to learn how to function efficiently in groups of different compositions of classes. <br />
<br />
Without being too anally retentive about it all, and being limited by my small budget (damn you alchemy), I solve this problem by carrying around various pieves of gear that I will swap depending on the situation: For example, I carry a Thunder Runed War Spear for meleeing when I am soloing (13/30 +5AC +hp +various other stats), but for large group raids I use a runed shell pestle (not a weapon, 5AC 5wis 50mana). For small grouping where I may have to tank adds a bit, I use a spine chill spear because it is an OK weapon and it has wis. <br />
<br />
Obviously there is a limit on how many different pieces of equipment that you can realistically carry around, especially if, like me, you play one a PvP server where you are obliged to carry around resist gear anyway). So, realistically, you try to achieve a balance in your gear that may not give you the absolute best solution for soloing or small grouping or large grouping, but that does allow you to function in any of those situations without compromising your performance significantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heh, not me, I still think that hitpoints and AC are much more valuable than wis.  Due to the nature of cannabalize, shaman have an incredible ability to regen mana, a way that is completely unavailable to the other priests.  The very nature of cannabalize relies on hitpoints, AC and regen.<br />
<br />
If you want wis to count, play a druid and sit on your butt when you run out of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have been in raids where I was the 3rd or even 4th Shaman, with the higher ranking ones being a few level shigher than me. In that situation I was little more than a buff monkey and a poor man's cleric. I was not required to slow, nor debuff. I would buff everyone who wanted and heal the chanters who were mezzing adds because the clerics were too busy CHing the MTs. In between whiles I threw a few of our weak DDs.<br />
<br />
During a 4 or 5 hour raid I never managed to get aggro even once - I took a grand total of ZERO hits. So, in that particular situation, mana and wisdom and hp are all significantly more important than AC. In fact, AC is completely irrelevant. Wisdom and mana both give direct mana, and in the situation where hp are not actually being lost via anything other than canni, hp are less important than wis or mana, and are less convenient than mana for direct use. Obviously, in this particular situation,  the rate of regeneration of HP is the crucial factor: i.e. hp regen &gt; mana &gt;  wis &gt; hp &gt; AC. Obviously this is quite a rare occurence,  nevertheless it does illustrate my point that the AC / wis debate is situational.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong Gloriana, I am a commited AC Junky, and I always look to hp and Ac ahead of Wis and mana - I am not a druid. In fact if I were to post my gear, I would defy you to find a single piece that could not be justified from the point of view of the AC/hp point of view, when compared to alternative pieces for that slot  (given my small budget). For general use I wear my AC gear, and for certain situations I change certain bits of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hmmm, during our raids, all the shaman attempt slow.  When you're fighting a really hard hitting mob (like an NTOV flurry drake) getting the mob slowed as quickly as possible is key.  Not to mention, multiple people sharing the slowing duties spreads out the death a little bit.  Also, if I attempt a slow, get a resist, get a pissed off Flurry drake on me, I will probably be interrupted, I couldn't get a slow off, luckily, since we have multiple slowers, one of my fellow guild shaman would probably save me by landing the slow.</div></div><hr />
