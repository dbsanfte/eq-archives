<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you must have missed all of the advice to go for hp/ac rather than wis.<br />
keep the helm, the weapons and the shield.<br />
<br />
the worst?  the neck, I think.  or the shoulders - tough choice.  both need to go - and soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">earrings should go.  grab 2 bse's instead. swap 1 ring for a velium fire ring.  you can pickuip a tattered mantle or something else pretty cheap as well for the shoulders.  Those really must go. grab a pair of gator legs at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You might want to check out this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=2353) and this one (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=2532) (similar level shaman asking gear questions.)  <br />
<br />
It appears that on the AC/HP vs WIS scale, you've leaned heavily on the WIS side.  I think you'll find the conventional wisdom here is that while a shaman can be effectively played either way, the AC/HP orientation is generally the preferred way to go.  Check out  this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2533) for details on why.<br />
<br />
Recommendations: <br />
<br />
Ears:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4930&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Imbued Golden Ivory Earring&lt;/a&gt; (cheap- under 100 pp, maybe much less if you provide the ivories- and a great combination of AC and WIS.)<br />
<br />
Neck:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Black Alloy Medallion&lt;/a&gt; - stats are pretty good (ac 6, +5 wis), it's cheap (couple hundred PP), and it will make every spell you cast under level 44 cost 10% less mana. That's a good thing! <br />
<br />
Face:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5289&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arctic Wyvern Mask&lt;/a&gt;.  You get a nice balance of AC and WIS with the mask, for just a few hundred pp.<br />
<br />
Head: Totemic helm is fine.  :)<br />
<br />
Fingers:  Ideally, you'd like to get some 6 AC, 65 HP rings, but if on a budget 4/45 or 5/55 rings will be cheaper and provide similar benefits.<br />
<br />
Wrist:  For one wrist, get a totemic or ry'gorr bracer, for the other a &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=809&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chipped Bone Bracelet (CBB)&lt;/a&gt; (with the CBB you get &quot;Affliction Efficiency II&quot; - which will cause all DoTs under level 45 to cost 25% less mana to cast.  Again, this should just cost a few hundred PP.)<br />
<br />
Arms:  JB arms provide great AC for a few hundred pp<br />
<br />
Hands:  JB gloves (few hundred pp)<br />
<br />
Shoulder:  Tattered mantle (100 pp or so, maybe less.)<br />
<br />
Chest:  Imbued Northman, Ry'gorr (few hundred pp) or a Tree Weave (1k or a little less) are decent chest slot items<br />
<br />
Back:  You're fine here<br />
<br />
Waist:  Spider fur belt (100-200 pp) is a great belt for the price.  A straw belt is a great super-cheap alternative (like 10 pp)<br />
<br />
Legs:  Your legs are fine- this is a tough spot to upgrade, especially on a budget.<br />
<br />
Boots:  JB boots are your next upgrade<br />
<br />
Your weapons and shield are great- no need to upgrade here.</div></div><hr />
