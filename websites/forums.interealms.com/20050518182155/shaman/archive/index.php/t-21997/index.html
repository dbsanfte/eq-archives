Pamela Anderson : I would like some more acting lessons.<br />
Agent : Why would you want more acting lessons?. Everyone thinks you are great as you are.<br />
Pamela Anderson : Well Nicole Kidman is getting all the best offers. It seems nobody makes a film without her.<br />
Agent : Aww c'mon, you were awesome in Baywatch, Nicole was never in Playboy, and besides, you have bigger breasts.<br />
Pamela Anderson : But Baywatch was over years ago, its only reruns now and thats kinda boring. Playboy may have been my big solo, but now lots of actresses are doing it. Also I've come to the conclusion that bigger breasts may look good, but they don't actually do anything useful. I've had expansion after expansion, but after each one I seem to be worse off compared to the real talent.<br />
Agent : Hmm, well let me take your concerns to our next Actors Guild meeting and I will get back to you soon.<br />
Pamela Anderson : Great! thanks.<br />
Time passes...<br />
Time slows down...<br />
Time speeds up to normal again...<br />
 <br />
Pamela Anderson : You still there?<br />
Agent : Sure, what's up<br />
Pamela Anderson : (sighs) What are you doing about my concerns.<br />
Agent : Don't worry, I'm still on it, its just that theres been a lot on my plate lately. Why just last night I got invited to a party with Nicole Kidman and her oscar.You're not the only celebrity you know. Try to be patient.<br />
More time passes....<br />
Pamela Anderson : Hey Agent, any danger of getting an answer round here, I won't be young forever you know.<br />
Agent : (rolls eyes) Well it wont do any good getting rude you know, as a matter of fact I have an answer for you.<br />
Pamela Anderson : Great! sorry about being rude, but I am starting to feel like im being ignored.<br />
Agent :<br />
Agent :<br />
Pamela Anderson : /poke<br />
Agent : Hmmm? Oh right (you still here?), Ok I took your concerns to the Actors Guild and they disagree that you need any more acting lessons.<br />
Pamela Anderson : But why?<br />
Agent : Perhaps if you gave some reasons for your concerns they might be more reciprocal.<br />
Pamela Anderson : But I just freaking did that!<br />
Agent : Well its no wonder nobody listens to you when you use language like that.<br />
Pamela Anderson : &lt;calms down and explains it all again&gt;<br />
Agent : Well that sounds reasonable, let me take your concerns to our next Actors Guild meeting and I will get back to you soon.<br />
Pamela Anderson : /simmers.<br />
More time passes...<br />
Agent : Hey Pam, come over for lunch, I've some great news for you.<br />
Pamela Anderson : (goes to lunch)<br />
Agent : Wow, you look really down, are you in character for that new movie part as a dejected has been?<br />
Pamela Anderson : No, whats the great news?<br />
Agent : I just signed up Nicole KIdman!<br />
Pamela Anderson : No, I meant the great news for me.<br />
Agent : Oh for you? Well after much discussion it was decided that if you got acting lessons, then Nicole would also have to get more acting lessons to make up for the fact that she has smaller breasts. Can you imagine the problems that would cause? The scriptwriters would have to change whole scripts to suit her. It would put all our schedules out of whack. <br />
However, its not all doom and gloom. The Actors Guild did agree that your concerns were legitimate so they have decided to help you out by offering you...<br />
Pamela Anderson : yes?<br />
Agent : offering you....<br />
Pamela Anderson : yes?<br />
Agent : Bigger Breasts!<br />
Agent : Heh, what are you gunna do with that baseball bat, I'm not casting for any films about sports.</div></div><hr />

I fall back on the dialog from &quot;When Harry met Sally.&quot; (not exact)<br />
<br />
Sally: So what you're saying is that you could only be just friends with ugly women?<br />
<br />
Harry: No you pretty much want to nail them too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK Faern, can go along with the first 3, however, Julianne Moore is definitely doable.  I don't know, maybe it's the cat eyes.  I found her very appealing in the awful Sly Stallone/Antonio Banderas 1995 hit man movie, &quot;Assassins&quot;.  Granted, that was 9 years ago, so I should say I would have done her then.  ;)<br />

I swear some of those women must be paying their publicists serious BANK to be getting on these Maxim Hot 100 lists.<br />
<br />
Faern's Barbarian Hot List (Or hey, wanna see my Spear of Fate?):<br />
<br />

2) Elizabeth Hurley:  Austin Powers 1 &amp; 2 <br />
3) Jenny McCarthy:  MTV <br />
4) Halle Berry:  James Bond   MOnsters Ball <br />

8) Kathryn Bell :  JAG <br />
9) Beyonce:  Everywhere <br />

Yes, that was depressingly accurate in its parallels to the current situation here.<br />

Also, I HATE Janine Garafelo.  She won't shut up about her one sided political views that she never backs up, she just has a tiny bit of fame that she shoves down everyones throat, and she's all annoying, and stuff.<br />

No doubt she is drop-dead gorgeous.<br />
<br />
But any woman who has had Dennis Rodman inside of her is auto-disqualified.<br />
<br />
Such philosophy, as much as it pains me to admit, also eliminates Stephanie Seymour (Victoria Secrets) after her tryst with one Axl Rose.<br />
<br />
A fella just have to have standards.<br />

Or as somebody much wiser than me once said:<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't feel safe having sex with Madonna unless she was shellacked.&quot;</div></div><hr />

To recap;<br />
<br />
1. Madonna<br />

<br />
I'll add;<br />
<br />
3. Pam Anderson, can't name all the guys she has been with, not even just the ones I've seen on video.<br />
4. Paulina Porizkova, OK, showing my age.  Hot model, did some acting, married the lead singer of the Cars, Ric Ocasek.  Can't get into chicks that do the undead.<br />

<br />
Might we include those with &quot;documented chemical imbalances&quot; resulting in aberrational behaviour?<br />
<br />
1. Angelina Jolie.  LOVE your work with the kids around the world. Adopt yourself a village Angie. Hel.l. adopt your brother too so you can make out with him and not freak us out. TOO wierd for color tv.  How messed up is Angelina Jolie?<br />
<br />
Billy Bob Thornton, not exactly Tom Selleck, left HER.<br />
<br />
2.  Tawny Kitaen.  Bachelor Party .  Ok, not only was she passed from rock star (Well, it was  Whitesnake  so maybe rock GROUP) to rock star, but she used to go nuts on her ex-husband Chuck Finley. (Baseball Player)<br />
<br />
When you can't find a rocker that will do you - that speaks VOLUMES.<br />
<br />
3.  Dixie Chicks.  Hey Freedom of Speech is great.  But Freedom of Speech does not mean Freedom from responsibility or repercussions.  Speaking up is one thing, but whining when fans stop buying your albums and radio stations stop playing your records is just weak.  <br />
<br />
4. Courtney Love.  Did you know that she was a STRIPPER in Alaska? Yeah, I was shocked too.  Yo Courtney - here's $20.00, put your clothes BACK on.  And please don't have me killed like your ex-husband.<br />
<br />
5.  Lisa Marie Presley.  Ok, one, she falls in the category (along with Kate Hudson and Gwyneth Paltrow) of being less hot than her mom.  But then she goes and MARRIES Michael Jackson?<br />
<br />
Yeah, Nicholas Cage wasn't man enough for her so she weds a 125 pound child-molesting, nose disappearing, skin-lightening - FU-REAK.<br />
<br />
6.  Susan Powter.  You may remember her from the &quot;Stop the Insanity&quot; diet commercials.  Basically the premise was: &quot;My husband left my fat a55 for a younger, thinner woman, so I decided to show him, hit the gym, and got super toned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Note: The STI fad was something like five YEARS afterwards.  Susan, sweety, obsession is a perfume, not a way of life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed, all of these are undoable from past behavior or being nuts.  But, all of them are nasty anyway aside from Angelina.  Tawny used to be hot, but hit the wall at 100 mph about 10 years ago.<br />
<br />
And, rep me down, but that pic of Kate Hudson is not hot.  Her boops are no bigger than Chris Robinson's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are right.  I'm not experienced enough... I'm married.<br />
<br />
I was just keeping the language clean.  And, I certainly didn't say I thought they were the best assest of a woman.  I just prefer it when women look like...<br />
<br />
...women.</div></div><hr />

True dat.  <br />
<br />
I dated a woman whose personality would change (/e snaps fingers) like that.  Not moody - complete personality.  MAD bedroom skillz.  It was like dating three different women.</div></div><hr />

This was an interesting thread before this post ... now it's better. MUCH better :)  Bless you Cascet.  You've restored my faith in porn (j/k).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Hey I remember seeing Goldie Hawn live when she would have seemed to be past her prime, in the mid-80's, right up close in movie theater at a showing of Blue Velvet.  She was wearing a tight white t-shirt and jeans and you just can't imagine how incredibly perfect her body was.  I mean insane.  I'll put one in for (and put one in) Goldie Hawn in her prime any day.  Funny thing was, I didn't even like her in her Laugh In days, when she was young, the time when most women really look their best by far.<br />
<br />
Nicole Kidman?  Yecch.  Too bony and smug, and she was married to the king of smug guys, Mr. Scientology, Tom Cruise.  No thanks, don't need the eerie freak-outs.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't do -- Angelina Jolie.  Hmm, I have no husband, so let's adopt a kid so he only has half a family.  I'm sure I'LL be more than enough to compensate and be a male role model for a boy -- after all, not only am I a not a man in the first place, but I'm a Hollywood movie star!  Reality is....elastic...for people like me.  Screw it, the kid will be fine!  Plus, I'm kind of crazy.  :)<br />
<br />
Otherwise on her -- unbelievable body, yet another unbelievably stupid tattoo, but teeth that look like she's wearing oversize dentures in a shrunken head already or maybe left her moutguard in from her football helmet.  <br />
<br />
Courtney Love -  pure skank, plus husband murdering is not really a super plus.  <br />
<br />
Carmen Electra -- extremely dopey and the Dennis Rodman thing is about the biggest turn-off on the planet -- besides maybe cannibalism or something.  Still, I dunno...she seems almost designed by computer to do the nasty.  Torn between hell no and hell yes.  Would have to see what would happen when I got the chance -- yeah, right.<br />
<br />
Dixie Chicks -- please, keep politics out of it, that's just dumb.  That being said -- they're not that cute anyway, so who cares?<br />
<br />
Barbara Bush and Nancy Reagan -- they give me dry dreams<br />
<br />
Lisa Marie - pure nutball.  Why does someone so rich have to waste so much of their life doing so many stupid things?  It's not like she needs the money<br />
<br />
Susan Powter -- oh my god you've got to be kidding, I'd rather date my sweat sock<br />
<br />
Madonna -- the most hugely overhyped phoney of the past two decades(political figures aside).  And the whole world's been there first.  Word is she had nipple reconstructive surgery because she abused them so much.  No thanks.  Too too much of much too little.<br />
<br />
Madeleine Albright -- sure, she knows everything about Czechoslovakia, but it's a cruel world, and brains will only take you so far.<br />
<br />
Some I would like? <br />
<br />
Queen Eliz before she died, if I could put it on closed circuit T.V. for my friends.  God Save The Queen!  Just for the notoriety.  I'd put some spurs on and make her say MOO!<br />
<br />
Hmm, most everyone else who doesn't need a bag over their head or body or both(high standards indeed these days in America, the most obese nation on earth and in history) and I'm not related to?  Especially if I'm allowed to hold my breath and there's no talking, and I have an escape route plotted out?  Okay, sounds good.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, she adopted her son while she was still married. Anyway, I'm sure growing up as the son of a single, super rich hollywood star can't POSSIBLY be as great as growing up in a Cambodian orphanage.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Anyway, back to incredibly hot women:<br />
<br />
Catherine Zeta Jones - she was a GODDESS in Chicago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Didn't know the kid came from an orphanage.  Still, adopting kids as a single is a trend in Hollywood that I think runs a little closer to having a bitchin' car and a groovy house in the hills than virtue and charity.  Especially when it's pitched as something that's a fantastic idea to do no matter what your income level.  A lot of times the idea is approached as if there were neither selfishness of any kind nor any economic concerns in it.<br />
<br />
Catherine Zeta Jones -- Incredibly beautiful but ye gods!  She's on a full page ad in the L.A. Times smirking coyly into the camera every day, trying to put over some weird sexual come-on related to - cellular phones?  Those ads are just too much already, and they're more than borderline creepy.  If a guy put on that expression and walked around town for five minutes, he'd be either beaten up and taken to jail or the looney bin.  Certainly both children and adults would run away in fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Catherine Zeta Jones makes me want to buy cellular phones :(</div></div><hr />

(Even though she doesn't know who Philip Rivers is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">That big old cheesy leering, &quot;I know what it is...you want to **** me!&quot; expression gets really old.  It's basically pretty demeaning and condescending, too.  &quot;You idiot!&quot; is the other unspoken tag line that goes with the first.  What the hell either of those sentiments could possibly have to do with cellular phones, I don't know.<br />
<br />
It seems there's nothing that isn't advertised with sex these days, but sometimes it's more ridiculous or badly done than others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">(Even though she doesn't know who Philip Rivers is)<br />
<br />
He's ****ed in San Diego anyway, so it doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Back on topic:<br />
<br />
Eliza Dushku, Elisha Cuthbert, and Jennifer Love Hewitt are so far beyond hot it's not fair.<br />
<br />
IMHO if they do Playboy or whatever, it sort of kills that mystery factor and puts them in that &quot;seen it&quot; category. Dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Hehe pretty funny when you see guys saying they would turn down a hollywood piece of tail. Not sure what they are basing that decision on, unless its some sort of political mind control or Mr Johnson is also turned on by some the Leading Men in some of those movies. Cmon, ugly women need lovin too, and once the lights are out who cares its not like they care what YOU look like hehe Heck i would even do Sandra Burghart well for some cash and a new car maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Besides you should see what some of those you have called ultimately desirable look like without their make up. Some celeb ugly shots on joked.com.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Killer bod - Wicked Witch of the West UGLY.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know, I know, &quot;When the lights go out - they all look the same,&quot; but I'd have to be pulling a Michael Flatferatu &quot;Lord of the MidNight Skeedadle&quot; on that face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Faern - where ya going? It's still night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm yeah, that's the general idea. No need to turn on the lights. I can find my way out.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
My vote goes to the already mentioned Sandra Bernhardt.  Killer bod, got to cover with the pillow face.  I guess Madonna did not have to look at her face too often. :)<br />
