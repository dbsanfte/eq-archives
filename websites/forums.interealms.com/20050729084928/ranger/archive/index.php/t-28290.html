My concern is that if I add on an aumentation that it may overwrite the haste on Swifty, and as I have no other haste item, would defeat the purpose of having swifty equipped.  <br />
I'd love to add on the lifetap proc, but as I said, don't want to run the risk of losing haste.<br />
<br />
Also, if you tack on a proc to a weapon that already has one, does the weapon then have two seperate procs, or does the added one overwrite the one you already have on said weapon?</div></div><hr />

Spell effects that add procs will stack. The proc effects themselves will not. The first spell in the buff list will proc (IE, NDT in the third slot will proc, over CoT in the 6th).</div></div><hr />

I've heard several folks say this, based entirely on part of the patch message that's kind of ambiguous, and I've had others refute it, one saying he tested it and it didn't work (a type 1 in a type 8 slot I think it was).  Would be nice to know for sure.</div></div><hr />

Heh, sorry, but that's wrong.  I've proc'ed both Trickster's Augmentation and Call of Sky on the same mob.  You can have several procs effects going, if you can stack them.</div></div><hr />

Heh, sorry, Trickster's Augmentation and Call of Sky don't stack. Try again when you have two procs effects that actually stack (ex. Call of Something and Boon/NDT).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyre of FV</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it a good idea to augment a weapon that already has a proc?  Executive Summary:  Nobody knows yet, and imbued procs (e.g. Cry of Thunder) are not an issue.<br />
<br />
There's a largish thread in the general forum about this issue.  The conclusions so far are:<br />
<br />
1) An inherent proc (e.g., AHB's lifetap) and an imbued proc (CoT) do not interfere with each other, except that...<br />
<br />
2) It's not clear that an inherent proc and an imbued proc can fire on the same swing of the same weapon -- but that would be such a rare occurence anyway, it's negligible if they cannot.<br />
<br />
So, imbued procs really aren't part of the debate.  Several people have parsed this, and it's clear that imbued procs and inherent procs get along quite well.<br />
<br />
However, the big question remaining is:<br />
<br />
3) If a weapon has an inherent proc and you add a second inherent proc (via an augment), will the two inherent procs interfere with each other?  In other words, if you add Vampire's Kiss (75-point lifetap) to your AHB, will you now get, overall, twice as many lifetap procs as before?  Or will you get EITHER the AHB's normal proc OR the vampire's kiss proc, but with the total # of procs remaining the same as it was before you augmented.<br />
<br />
Simply stated, do you get anything out of adding an augmented proc to a weapon that already has a proc?<br />
<br />
Nobody has posted any serious tests of this issue on the glade.  Somebody's going to have to go guinea pig ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guille</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly Gyre, I have told several people in the guild that it would be in their best interest to hold off a bit until the EQ community has this solved. It would be a darn shame to have your warrios with Blades of War save up 1150 points to find out they just ruined the best aggro weapon in the game.<br />
<br />
It sure would be nice if the developers came out and told us how their system worked (that's assuming they even know how it works). If procs are that way I may just be saving up for spells and that extremely expensive armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn Veryien</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question - if we added 3 damage to Swiftwind, turning it from 13/21 to 16/21, how many players would consider that to be a good offhander again?<br />
<br />
Yes, I am aware that damage mods are type 6 and Swiftwind does not have a type-6 slot in it.<br />
<br />
However, I think a good case could be made across the general player base that epics might get an additional slot (type 6) allowing them to be &quot;upgraded&quot;. There are many players who, if they could push Earthcaller to 17/24 and Swiftwind to 16/21 would be quite happy with that pair of blades. Highest end players will always seek out the optimal performance weapons but those may not be a viable choice for all players.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if there would be sufficient interest across all classes to ask for such a mod?</div></div><hr />

I dont have parses to back this up, but when under the effects of all of these, I would proc all three procs, with approximately the same regularity as if I only had one proc type up.  As in I completely agree with the people who say that there is one calculation to see if the weapon procs, and then it randomly picks one of the proc effects that you have on you.  Having 3 different proc abilities did not noticeably increase my proc rate, except for the fact that the WWH is only on my primary and the NDT and CoF apply to both weapons.<br />

As is often the case, anecdotes and parses don't agree. Please refer to this (http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=28410&amp;pagenumber=1) thread in General, particularly the quote Ladas posted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Went and did some parses myself for the whole Imbue procs Vs. Natural procs thing like Ladas.<br />
<br />
Did 2 half-hour parses on a mob, one without CoT up, one with CoT up. Using Ivory Hilted Cleaver in mainhand, Grandmaster Fletcher's Knife in offhand so the offhand wouldn't swing. 305 dex, 41% haste from shoulders, no spell haste.<br />
<br />
First parse:<br />
2182 swings<br />
52 Wrath of Ice - 2.38%<br />
52 Cry of Thunder - 2.38%<br />
<br />
Second parse:<br />
2186 swings<br />
56 Wrath of Ice - 2.56%<br />
<br />
Like Ladas said, looks to me like Imbue procs do not effect natural weapon proc rates at all.<br />

Imbued (CoT, NDT, CoF) procs do not interfere with innate procs like Wrath of Ice, and it doesn't make much sense for augment procs and innate procs to compete either. A programmer would have to create extra code/calculations to create such a system, which wouldn't be done by accident. I doubt that they'd intentionally make the augment procs detrimental when (a) it's easier to program innate and augment procs to work independently, and (b) it makes sense.</div></div><hr />

Oo Oo- Data!<br />
<br />
Great- I yield to data.  It was only a 30 minute parse, but 30 minutes is a lot more than zero minutes.  Although i dont agree with your opinion on the ease of the programming, it would be just as easy to set it up either way.  But as i said, I yield to the data you put forth.<br />
