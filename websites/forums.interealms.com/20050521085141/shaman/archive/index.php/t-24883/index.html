<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To start, at level 12 you get to choose Orcs or Gnolls.<br />
<br />
Which enemy do you want to pick to specialize in killing? Will Orcs take you father as a Mystic? Or will Gnolls?<br />
<br />
Later (40's and 50's) what race of mobs are likely to still give exp and loot that higher levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only real reason to pick one over the other depends on your starting city. Seems to be more Orcs around Freeport and more Gnolls around Qeynos (from what I could find in beta that is).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Enemy Tactics replaced the old Mastery system, so there's an enemy tactic for many of the major mob races in the game:  gnolls, orc, skeletons, centaurs, elementals, treants, etc...<br />
<br />
It'll just grant you a smite spell/kick skill that you can use against enemies of that race.  Choosing one over the other isn't really going to be very different; and regardless, if you choose orc, you can always get the gnoll mastery quest by finding it in the game...*wink*<br />
<br />
Anyways, you'll eventually have 'em all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since Isle of Zek is mostly Orcs, I usually recommended that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What level and where is the Isle of Zek? Will I likely have the chance to to Gnolls AND Orcs by the time I'm there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What level and where is the Isle of Zek? Will I likely have the chance to to Gnolls AND Orcs by the time I'm there?<br />
<br />
Isle of Zek is a 30+ zone. Don't know if you still need a quest to access it. In beta, it was reached from the bells at Thundering Steppes.</div></div><hr />

I thought the old mastery quests now returned furniture or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought the old mastery quests now returned furniture or something?<br />
yes. A book and some decorative item (a halberd in case of the gnolls).<br />
<br />
Until level 20 the spell against the mobs that are around your hometown seems to be most usefull. After that I do not know yet. This probably depends on how it scales up with levels, at say level 15 it actually sucks because of the recast time.</div></div><hr />
