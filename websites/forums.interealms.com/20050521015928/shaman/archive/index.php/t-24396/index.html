<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the NDA has been lifted I thought I'd copy a post I just mode to the EQII beta forums:<br />
<br />
In response to a post against the rarity of spells Eviljim posted:<br />
 <br />
&quot;What I am saying is there is not a distinction in your above argument between a spell and a weapon. Both have easily or freely available versions that are usable, but you have to achieve (in some fashion... adventure, craft, socialize... or all of them) better things. This is core to games that have acquisition and advancement as an element, whether it be an MMO or otherwise.&quot;<br />
<br />
 <br />
This is a recent development of flawed reasoning that is threatening both EQLive and EQII.  The melee correspondent to caster skills is _abilities_ not weapons.  There are many abilities but let's just focus on one.  If a rogue had to have a high level guild raid to acquire the ability to backstab at the highest level it would be equivalent to the rare drops for spells or the &quot;ancient&quot; spells in EQLive.  Melees get their abilities automatically instead of having to buy them like casters do spells.  <br />
 <br />
Both casters and melee are equally dependent on obtaining higher level equipment and need to progress similarly to obtain higher level gear.  How much healing or damage a caster can do is dependent on gear -- not on the spell that lets them heal or damage.  Eviljim your argument would have merit if casters only had to cast once but they need to cast repeatedly.  Their ability is measured in how often they can cast over a period of time and that is dependent on gear.<br />
 <br />
If you wish to balance casters and melee then make the melees buy their abilities and make the higher levels harder to obtain in the same way that spells are.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd have to agree.  All melee abilities, even core ones like backstab, should be dropped/sold.  However, in order for it to be balanced, you'd want melee to have more abilities to obtain.  <br />
<br />
Even if a rogue had to buy a new backstab every 5 levels (or get a dropped &quot;tome of backstab lvl X&quot;), he's still about 7 things shy of what I have to buy/get dropped as a caster.  <br />
<br />
The thing is.. the rogue is still going to get better and better daggers.  Whereas after I get my one spell plus some focus item, I'm done.  Finding that endgame balance is the tricky part.  <br />
<br />
Using a rogue again:  As dagger ratio's get better and better from dropped raid mobs.. do you offer better and better caster focus as the equivalent?  Rather than 1-3 focus in the game for spell X, do you maybe have 10 levels of focus?  Then I think you've dug yourself into a pit of complexity in terms of upgrade paths.  <br />
<br />
Its a really tricky situation, and not one I've ever found a decent solution to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do we function with out Ancients????<br />
<br />
Do rogues function without Raid Weapons???<br />
<br />
The answer to both questions is YES.<br />
<br />
Ancient spells and Raid Dropped weapons just increase your efficiency but you can function without either!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its not about ancients, or uber raid weapons.<br />
<br />
In the devs eyes, casters get a spell, then they can get any number of raid items to focus it.  In their eyes, this makes the endgame caster easier to equip than the endgame rogue.  The rogue HAS to get one particular dagger to get to level X in terms of dmg.  A caster can get 30% nuke focus from multiple items.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, casters complain that they must get tons of spells first before they even begin seeing that advantage in terms of raid loot.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, rogues get perpertual, incremental upgrades to their function (dmg) over time, by getting better and better weapons.  Casters get one spell set, thats it.  <br />
<br />
etc, etc..  its not about function, its about endgame perfection.  Who has the easier route to being powerful?  Still undecided on that one personally.  Lots of variables involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think in this situation it's pretty balanced how it is right now. Yes we do have to get many many spells, but to make up for it melees are sooo much more gear dependent than casters. It is possible to still be a good caster without time/god gear on pop/god raids. You can't say that for a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Let me be clear, I am NOT saying we need to change melees to balance things.  What I am arguing against is the idea that it is only weapons that make a difference to melees and therefore it is right to make spells almost impossible to get.  This is bad logic and terrible design.  <br />
<br />
The worst of these design flaws is making a spell like Balance of the Nihil almost unobtainable by most shaman.  This spell is _different in kind_ than our other spells and has no corresponding OoW spell.  I got very lucky and was able to get Nihil and I can tell you it is very different in how it works in practice compared to Turgurs.<br />
<br />
Even regular spells though should be reasonably obtainable.  Just because a higher level spell can heal for more or nuke for more doesn't mean the caster doesn't need to have the equipment to use it over and over again.  We don't heal _once_ or nuke _once_ we do it repeatedly.  Without the mana pool and focus items we just can't do as much with the spells.<br />
<br />
Both melee abilities and caster spells are the basics we need to be able to do our job and should be available.  Our overall equipment relates to how well we can use weapons or spells and that is where the progression should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As someone who's had this discussion with my best friend who's a Rogue.<br />
<br />
I actually think Rogues end up in a worse state then casters. This is because Rogues need a good 1H piercing weapon in there main hand to do up there Dps with backstab, if you do a search of weapons that they can use, unless they are in a EP or better guild they are completely stuck due to a fact that they only really get one section so to speak. They new epic will help this a bit but it's still not easy to get, I'm not sure how many weapon choices other melee have but I guess it's better.<br />
<br />
That said I wish they would add more certain ways of getting spells, i.e. more quested ones/bought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They used the completely worthless weapons to spells analogy before this expansion came out as a reason for limiting access to spells. Well hell to that as a few quick examples from two classes I know my non raiding Pally friend just upgraded to a blade of disruption which blew away anything he could have posibly every owned without raiding pre omens for only 45k. This weapon will be perfect for him until he either has time to raid or a new better tradeable weapon comes along in another expansion. On the other hand one single spell costs 70-80k to get. Last night I killed 8 named in RCoD and didn't see a single spell rune the entire night. *** is up with that? And I don't just need one rune, I need dozens. <br />
<br />
Monks same way, the staff of fury or whatever its name is costs less then 10k but would be a huge upgrade for what most non raiding monks had prior to omens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally I think they need to mimic the spell research with weapons. Example find items that when crafted by a high level smith or tailor equal those raid level weapons.<br />
<br />
Now its no longer a raid event but it will take longer and cost more money buying the components to make the item.</div></div><hr />

Staff of the Eternal?  (Slightly better stats than Staff of Flowing Water).</div></div><hr />

A rogue can get top end weapons from multiple sources also where the difference in effectiveness is insignificant.<br />
<br />

<br />
Historically it hasn't been the spells that have limited progression but the gear and levels.  For example, a guild warrior that can barely tank with 8khp will not likely be able to tank new guild targets until he levels, gets more aa, or gets more hp.  A guild wizard will most likely continue contribution without gaining a single spell, level, aa, or piece of gear.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, rogues get perpertual, incremental upgrades to their function (dmg) over time, by getting better and better weapons.  Casters get one spell set, thats it.<br />
<br />
Casters get incremental upgrades to their function through spells just as melee do through disciplines and gear.  The main difference is that it is generally much easier to complete the majority of a level spellset than it is for melee to obtain new gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its been exactly the opposite this expansion though. My groups tank has gained over 1200 hp and about 100 ac for the same price I paid for three of my spells. <br />
<br />
As much as I like pained memories, those upgrades mean much more of a difference to his effectiveness then the spells made for mine.</div></div><hr />
