<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crodak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Coming back to EQ, and starting my first shaman.  After loving the support role in groups (cleric) and the fun of solo (necro &amp; SK), shaman seems like the perfect combination from what I've read.<br />
<br />
I've got everything picked out and ready to go, but now I'm stuck on the race issue.  (I swear I spend more time picking race and name than playing whenever I start a new character :p)<br />
<br />
I know I want to be either a troll or an ogre.  I've done all the research; I know the pros and cons of exp penalties and cool abilities like regen, snare, and stun immunity.  I'm well beyond that - now it really boils down to what I like roleplay wise.<br />
<br />
And I can't decide.  I would normally probably lean toward troll, but there are a few issues pushing me away from that:<br />
<br />
1)  I'm tired of having a low polycount, so I'm using the new luclin models, and while I think the old world model troll kicks the ogre one's butt, I like the new ogre over new troll.<br />
2)  Grobb, the coolest city in all of Norrath and Space and Beyond, is gone.  :(<br />
3)  I've always wanted to try an ogre, and this would be my chance (I have a troll sk.)<br />
<br />
So I made an ogre and got to 11, but now I've stopped and am having second thoughts.<br />
<br />
No, this isn't a 'what race should i play' post, this board has plenty of them and I know only I can make the decision.  This is more of a venting my frustration, cause I want to get started on my shaman career, but have hit a snag... one that I'm rather obsessive about too, hehe.<br />
<br />
In the words of Charlie Brown - ARRRRRG!</div></div><hr />

Play the ogre then, cause you will need them on, for a horse. :)<br />
<br />
Of cource you can get an illusion item, but thats a pain in the ass hehe.</div></div><hr />

Race hybrid? You know, a luclin ogre model with green troll skin would look like the Hulk.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ogre. You like that look better, so go with it. :) Have fun and play what you enjoy!! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a troll shaman and I bagged my snare necklace, its just as easy to root runners imo<br />
<br />
Regen, I'm into my 50's now and I have regrowth which is 15% regen, plus Stocism<br />
<br />
So innate regen just has never been that great of a plus to me, ever even in the lower levels<br />
<br />
If I had to do it all over again, I would Ogre<br />
<br />
Frontal Stun immune... would be nice<br />

But dam Frogs look so Freakin Cooooool</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pick the race you wish to be for roleplaying reasons.  The differences between them are not significant enough to make one race or the other a &quot;mandate&quot; or whatever.  Consider that the top shamans on almost every server are Barbarians, where Barbarian is arguably the weakest race in terms of stats and racial abilities.  It really doesn't matter.  Go with whatever you &quot;feel&quot; like you wanna be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">heh Landragoran<br />
<br />
I agree with you 100% about it not mattering as far as abilities and stats, I think that you will find that a reason why most high level shamans are barbarian is because their a good race with no exp penalty.<br />
<br />
I am a troll and I suffer a 20% exp penalty<br />
<br />
That means it will take me twice as long to reach lvl 65 as a frog or a barbarian.<br />
<br />
For all who are asking yourselves exp penalty or not, I can only say from my personal experience the advantages don't outweigh the significant amount of time you will have to spend killing the 100th golem or goblin more than your barbarian bretheran to get a lvl raise.<br />
<br />
Dam at lvl 52 I am sick to death of exping. I can only imagine what it will be like at 60.<br />
<br />
IMO I have had to rethink my answer I don't think exp penalty races are worth the meager benefits over faster lvling and spell/aa ability acquisition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
How does 20% make it twice as long to get 65? And Barbarian's have 5% exp penalty i thought....</div></div><hr />

Well not 100%.  There is also race history and gods to consider...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, that sticky thread is useless if no one reads it.. kinda like how you must have not read or only skimmed my post and missed the disclaimer that it wasn't a question, just a vent.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">20% does equal twice as long to get to 65<br />
<br />
20% might not sound like much, but that's for every level, you have to kill 20% more mobs than the guy without an exp penalty.<br />
<br />
When you are talking about the levels that need a million exp to level your talking about you yourself needing 200,000 more exp to lvl and that ratio just keeps getting steeper and steeper.<br />
<br />
As well, my said example only talks about one level, you have to consider each and every level like that.<br />
<br />
At 1-50 it don't matter to much, but after 50 it's serious exp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Wow If it really is 2X longer to get to 65, then just think how many AA i could have if i wasnt iksar.....*dreams*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it's a 5% penalty.  Though, until Vah Shir, it was the race with the LOWEST XP penalty for a shaman.<br />
<br />
20% does equal twice as long to get to 65<br />
<br />
Maybe I learned some kind of weird wacky-math, but wouldn't 20% equal ... err... 20% longer to get to 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;Wow If it really is 2X longer to get to 65, then just think how many AA i could have if i wasnt iksar.....*dreams*&quot;<br />
<br />
almost positive racial penalties are not calculated in aaxp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Today in Maths... how 12 is twice as big as 10!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Man your guys math skills really do the suck<br />
<br />
Did you know that our 75% slow mitigates damage by over 40% compared to a BL slow at 65%<br />
<br />
Duh, think its 10% don't you, so do alot of BL's<br />
<br />
Here is some simple math for ya...<br />
starting mob DPS 100<br />
After shamans slow its 25DPS<br />
After ench slow its 30DPS <br />
After beast its 35DPS <br />
<br />
Thus... (35-25)/25 = 0.4 so after BL slow mob produce 40% more DPS then after shamans slow<br />
<br />
10-20% can be very deceiving, I think you guys should take math over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tiorr, this is an old argument. Few groups care about the percentage difference between Shaman and Beastlord on a slowed MOB. What matters is the difference vs. the DPS of an unslowed MOB, and for that we have a 10% edge over Beastlords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;Wow If it really is 2X longer to get to 65, then just think how many AA i could have if i wasnt iksar.....*dreams*&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
I know but if it wasnt for the penatly i would have been 65 much much sooner, which would have let me start aaxp much sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ogre.  I've been in your situation before with my twinks as well.  It comes down to which ones look the coolest and if you already have a troll sk, a troll shaman won't make you happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The differences between them are not significant enough to make one race or the other a &quot;mandate&quot; or whatever<br />
<br />
Yes, especially since PoP: the differences between races is less significant now for a number of reasons:<br />
<br />
1.  The massive improvement in gear now, compared with what was originally in the game, makes racial stats differences much less significant.<br />
<br />
2.  At high level I don't find it very efficient for my shaman to tank anymore.  If my exp. group gets adds nowadays one of the 'real' tanks will off-tank it (if we can't mez or park it), so I can continue chain nuking without any interruption.  So extra regen or immunity to stun isn't such a big issue.<br />
<br />
3.  Flowing thought/KEI makes extra regen for conversion to mana via cannibilisation less important.  If I have to canni, I'm not casting an offensive spell.  This would invalidate one of Thott's graphs so no one would ever speak to me again.<br />
<br />
And trolls/ogres still pay the same race exp penalty on levelling as we used to.</div></div><hr />
