<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need a break from the shaman every once and a while, so I decide to make an SK alt.<br />
<br />
Gnome, level 16.  Like 175 STA, 200 STR, 150 DEX.  1,500 H.P. atm.<br />
<br />
I want to PL him to level 46 or so, but it's going really slow as a shaman.  Is my best bet to find a druid to help me?  At what level (if at all) does PL'ing with a shaman become faster than a druid, or will the DS always win out?<br />
<br />
The only good thing is that my melee skills and all are maxed.  But that's about the only good thing.  Is my strategy wrong:<br />
<br />
Buff the twink to hell with IoS, Talisman, all stat buffs, regen, haste.<br />
Pull a mob or two with twink.<br />
Get mob to 49%, then finish with shaman.<br />
Rinse.<br />
Repeat.<br />
<br />
Is this the only / fastest way?<br />
<br />
...help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yup thats the fastest way, until he gets a few more levels than ya can take him someplace like upperguk and use the shammy to pull, pull a tona nd let the sk peel em off ya one at a time to kill. I've found shaman can start pl'ing as good as a druid around mid 20's, unless your pl'ing a class that can use point blank ae's with no mob number restrictions. Then I'm not sure if shammy ever will be a better pl'er. <br />
I've pl'ed with my 58 druid, and with my shaman and usually it becomes moot around 24-26 ImHO. A buffed dog tears mobs up faster than druid ds for that last 49%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pull a few at a time. Whilst SK beats down one, have the others hitting you. DS potion does about 30/hit so it adds up, esp at lower levels. <br />
<br />
Also, cripple everything, SK will hit much better. Once you get SK pet, remember you can buff pets with level 65 spells :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Extraor Dinary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I power leveled a gnome SK and had him to 50 in 24hrs and 54 in 36hrs.  The place you PL makes a huge difference.  From 1 - 20 I did Paludal Caverns, then hit Marus Seru till 30, Sol A gnomes till 40, The Hole till 53, and finished in Nurga.  Most places are pretty empty so you never have to wait for spawns.  Just murder stuff nonstop.  Exp modifier makes a huge difference when your DPS isn't so great.  I used a reaver (40/40) until level 40 and then used a WMBS (31/28) and just dealt with the lower damage as I leveled up.  <br />
<br />
And do as posted before, always have a pet buffed to the max.  The DPS helps a lot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought a patch made it to where you had to do 90% of the damage with your lower toon to get exp? I know it used to be 51%, but we have to keep things fresh so 90% was enacted..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think you're going about it the right way Foramorm. There are many ways to do this stuff, this is the one I use.<br />
<br />
Buff like hell (suggest Temperence from PoK, well worth it, it makes you're healing so much more efficient). I'm assuming no DS as potions aren't worth the price till you get a few more levels.<br />
<br />
1-24 in Paludal<br />
24-26 in Merus Seru<br />
26-40 in Overthere (STAY till 40! Exp is nutz in the late 30's)<br />
40- 46 in City of Mist<br />
<br />
Technique below 44:<br />
<br />
Shaman pulling. Hotkeys for assisting PL'ee and for targeting PL'ee.<br />
<br />
Pull mob with Burst of Flame. (caution don't let mob hit you)<br />
Root mob near PL'ee.<br />
PL'ee engages Mob.<br />
Pull next mob with Burst of Flame<br />
Root mob near (but not on top) of PL'ee<br />
Target PL'ee to check health heal if necessary<br />
Assist PL'ee to check Mob's health, if 49pct or below sick dogdog<br />
As soon as dogdog is on the mob PL'ee switches to next target.<br />
rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
Trick I've found is that the PL'ee should always be fighting a mob... never idle. PL'ee should never actually kill the mob... that's dogdog's job. Shaman's job is simply to heal, keep mobs in the camp and send the dog at the right time.<br />
<br />
44-46 is when you start grouping up with the PL'ee. Technique changes a bit then. I use CoM cause there are mobs a plenty and they just plain go down quick. DS yourself and PL'ee with potions have him pull a train and just slaughter them. Be sure to focus DPS to put em down. If you really wanna roll your dude through the low 40's find a 65 warrior that is willing to hang out in CoM for awhile. group him with PL'ee and you stand outside group and heal. It's nutz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First thing I do when making a new toon is spend a little while getting them an 8th coldain ring. (Usually I have one ready to MQ to an alt anyway)<br />
<br />
DS makes things a lot faster, it's especially nice since it doesn't take up space like DS Potions and you don't have to keep making more.<br />
<br />
My usual route is;<br />
<br />
FOB; 1-5<br />
Kurns; 5-20 (Not Paludal because there are too many people here on Aro)<br />
SolA; 20-36 or 37 (Depending how I feel :P)<br />
CoM; 37-50 (Sometimes I head earlier)<br />
<br />
FOB: Just killing trash, just fully buff the twink and let him hit stuff without slow on.<br />
<br />
Kurns; Kill everything in sight, avoid the basement (burynai casters) til at least 15 (they get annoying when they heal eachother through the walls, and at this point your DPS isn't that great to bring them down efficiently)<br />
<br />
SolA; I start with goblins til about 28 (I pull 10 or so at a time with slow on shaman, let them beat on me and puck em away with alt.) Then I do gnome castle til high 30s. Just do the same thing pretty much, I usually set up camp on the second floor, in the corner with the 1 clockwork spawn) Take shaman and go pull 6-8 mobs (note; I kill the mages / curators with my shaman as it's not worth the time killing them with alt) and pull them off 1 by 1 with alt.<br />
<br />
CoM; Stables. Pull 2 at a time with slow, same thing as SolA. Can stay here for decent XP (and pull outer areas if you run out of mobs) til 50.<br />
<br />
<br />
Forgot to add; If you come up against a tough mob that has a lot of hp (Like a named in COM for instance) Use spirit call right away if you have it. Keep alt away from the mob til the dogs poof, then attack. Alt will get 100% of the xp regardless of how much damage the spirit call pets did to it, provided the shaman doesn't do any damage to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1-10 any spot you like, buff twink, let him kill stuff.<br />
10 - 16 Paluadial. Could hold the first camp solo with buffs and full cultural.<br />
<br />
*** Change of tactic****<br />
Epic dotting.<br />
Pull mob.<br />
Cast epic.<br />
Blast with clicky bracer.<br />
Zone.<br />
<br />
16 - 30. OT. save up them war braids so you can get your gate overthere hammer! Stand on the base of the hill near the sarnak ruins and accumilate braids.<br />
<br />
30-40. LOY - Zoneline from the entrance zone to the crypt. Lava entrance. Kill a lava elemental, then zone. Follow with PL toon and kill a troll or something else.<br />
<br />
40-46 Slows here a bit. I went to Karnors and took toon to the basement where I let him smack down mobs till they were 45% then sent in dogdog. /pet hold here is essential.<br />
<br />
46- POI dot/zone till 50, then he should tank effectively.<br />
<br />
***** Change of tactic******<br />
Group with shaman and kill chit 8)<br />
<br />
62- BOT. He can tank at 62 if reasonable gear.<br />
<br />
I made it to 65 in about three weeks, but took time off for a few ldons etc.<br />
<br />
Anyway retired now, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
I PL'd a cleric recently to 46 (now almost 48 and not powering through anymore) and I honestly see no way in heck a shaman could do it anywhere near as fast or efficiently as a druid can at low-mid levels.  I used a druid instead of my 400+ AA shaman. :eek:  You can use a shaman to do it - and it will be very safe - but it won't be nearly as fast.<br />
<br />
The PL'ee only needs to hit the mob ONCE using the DS method.<br />
Priest &amp; caster classes all have ceramic bands available at level 20.   Click the band from inventory &amp; PL'ee is done (if not resisted) so they don't even have to land a swing.  Sadly, I don't know if SK's have anything similar to that which has unlimited charges.  Not much of an issue really because even a 1pt barehanded punch will work.<br />
<br />
Legacy of Bracken + Brackencoat is a 53pt DS that costs nothing but mana.  The druid sits on a mount so even while getting whacked by 10 mobs she is meditating at the sitting rate.  Your PL'ee pulls so initial damage is almost guaranteed.  Shield of Thorns can be cast on the PL'ee for a 24pt DS to help while bringing mobs to the PL'er.  Druid casts Bonds of Tunare (AE snare - no damage) to draw aggro and adds to it with heal spell aggro (chloroblast early on, Nature's Infusion later.<br />
<br />
I'm by no means a pro at this (was my first real try at 'from scratch' PL'ing, it was more of a brute force attempt than anything else but it was effective.) but I just can't see my shaman PLing anywhere near as fast.  Maybe in the 40's it would be easier, but exp went so quick (pulled Mistmoore castle upper 30's-44) it was crazy.  <br />
<br />
Shaman DS using Kilva's Skin of flame potions is expensive to maintain &amp; even with Coldain ring click &amp; Bramblecoat Kunark BP clicky it just can't compare to a druid in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Finding the right spots is also a major component of it.  Once you get your SK to 46 it won't matter, then he can tagalong almost anywhere.  I've been duoing Innovation with my baby cleric + a 65 enchanter.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Generally I found I had to do 10-20pts dmg to ensure I didnt get corpse poof when I was dot zoning.<br />
<br />
Never tried a druid, dont have one 8)<br />
<br />
I have heard from some friends of mine, druid is great till 30, then the buffs and slow tends to make more difference and the dmg taken verses dmg dished from the DS drops significantly in ratio, making the healing load very high.<br />
<br />
Clerics are tough to PL. I have a 47 one I pl'd. Ended up getting me one of the dawnfires, combat buffing him to buggery and taking him undead hunting once root/dooting got hard (post 40).<br />
<br />
He was killing the skellies in karnors almost as fast as the SK was with his proc-o-matic. Auged with a cold dd thingey tooooo.<br />
<br />
Found that it was best just to get a tank, park the cleric in the corner and use him when healing was required, and go sick on the dots with the sham.<br />
<br />
Used to dual bot a cleric and a sham all the time, sure, instant group, walk into zone and get mobbed, but its a lot of responsibility slowing and healing and if it gets difficult, you dont have the time to run both effectively.<br />
<br />
/Ramble off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I found a way to pl with my 65 ranger thats faster than i can pl with my 65 shammy. Ranger uses all his self ds buffs and a potion, gets him to around 70 or so ds, pulls a train, pl'ee hits each mob once, ranger keeps agro by pulling with snare and healing himself. Got my cleric to 44 in 1 day 17 hours played by doing this method from 35-41, then switched to grouping with my 61 necro to 43 then partnered with my ranger at 43. did the normal druid pl from 1-30, did a dou with a 37 sk from 30-35 with shammy pl'ing the two of em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bufflo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another good method is using the mojo stick that casts that AoE damage spell. It should have &quot;cast force&quot; as its right click, if i remember correctly. Anyhow, buff up the shaman and chug a kilva's DS potion and click your JBBP if you have it. Then pull all the patog fiends in PC and stand next to your twink. Cast torpor on yourself and proceed to mash the sit button. Have your twink stand in the middle and click the mojo stick. The sit aggro should be enough to keep all the mobs on you and the mojo stick's click can hit an unlimited amount of things, so you should be set no matter how many you pull. It will take about 3 pulls to get to 12ish, but your twink will have no skills. It works better with casters and bards because of this, but I have done it with a paladin before and just worked out his skills later. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, you can continue to do this with deminishing results until you hit 24 and then you must move elsewhere. From there your only really viable option is either the kill and zone method, or the way you've been doing it. You can try the DS method longer, but Kilva's alone wont be enough to kill things efficiently past 25ish. <br />
<br />
Also, if your shaman lacks hp, grab a virtue before you try this method... You'll look awfully foolish dieing in PC at 60+ :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Waalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Here is what I am currently doing (using 65 shm to pwr lvl a 27th necro)<br />
<br />
 I find a spot like Guards in HHK. Pull 5-10 with agro (or no dmg spell if needed) then leat them beat on me (33 dmg DS potion on me).  When they widdle down a little bit necro hits them all with lvl 1 dmg spell.<br />
<br />
They all die and necro goes up 20+% of his lvl. Then I rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
Not sure how high of a lvl I can do this to but I will be doin it untill at least 34ish :)<br />
<br />
<br />
  GL on lvlin the toon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What I did With my Warrior, was take him to the high ZEM dungeons that are not used alot, and let him pull trains. Have him fully buffed and hasted, while the shaman is near by his back to a wall. Then use tirgir's on the train and heal the toon being PLed. With the shaman's back to the wall if he does get hit by these mobs the don't interupt a heal. And with all the mobs from the train you don't have to worry about runners. Warrens, Netherbain, Paw, TFOS, Nurga, and Karnors are some of the zones I used. The war hit 50 with 4 days played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey guys I have my berzerker PLed to 50 with 3 days played.  What I  did was level out of my league.  I did hard side of echo caverns from 25-47.  Root teh mob you pull and then they proxy agro, as long as your shammy is closer he's always get hit as long as mob is rooted, great for PLing rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">From 16 to mid-30's take him to Unrest. Undead mobs, zone xp modifier. 16 - move into house, first floor working your way up as you level. This tops out about 29-30 when you head into the basement until 34 or so.<br />
<br />
Unrest is best with a druid for pure ds/pull a room to beat on you ... and, more importantly, wolf form (non-aggro in wolf form in unrest - without it, everything will aggro you.)<br />
<br />
Gunthak beach undead after that until 44.</div></div><hr />
