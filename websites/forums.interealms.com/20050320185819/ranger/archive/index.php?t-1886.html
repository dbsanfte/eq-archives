It's considered kinda low-brow TV I suppose, but I enjoy it, it's like a class on human nature and behaivor. You throw a bunch of varied personalities together and give them a set of rules to follow, then watch nature take its course. If you major in psychology or socialogy it would be very helpful.<br />
<br />
I missed the 2nd and 3rd season, mostly cause I was watching Friends, but the 4th season they occaisonally(sp) have it on wednesdays. So far, it's been kinda dumb, cause they voted off the interesting people like Hunter and Rob. I was especially saddened by the loss of Rob, cause he would use godfather(nod to Kullaas) tactics and would pull a lot of strings and control and manipulate many people.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts on it?</div></div><hr />

He and his alliance thought they had things wrapped up but Pascal and his chicky friend lowered the boom on him.  LOVED IT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smokimon Trailblazer</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the show, watch every week. My wife and I think this is the best any of them have been out of the series. Very interesting twists, group dynamics, etc. The relationships and intereactions seem to be more real or something with this group than they ahve been in the past. I was SO happy to see Rob get voted off. He was a fool and had no idea how to play/win the game. His tactics are what sunk him. It was John who got voted off Nitefox, Sean was &quot;supposed&quot; to go. I loved it too. Biggest &quot;Power Swing&quot; I have ever seen in the game. Should be interesting to see where things go now..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah Rob was a fool.  He is idea to win was to vote off the strongest people(this after they had yet to win a single challenge).  Dumb guy.</div></div><hr />

The boston accent replaces the r with an h. Heehee, it's such fun saying Pahk the cah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drexel</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, It was great that John got voted off last week.  He and his lackeys The General and ferret-faced Zoie thought they were the rulers of the island.  It will be fun to watch those two tonight.<br />
<br />
Rob was one of the more interesting people on the show, but all of his lies and manipulations caught up with him.  With the exception of the first season, the best strategy seems to be keeping a low profile while the more dynamic personalities pick each other off.</div></div><hr />

I will say the setting for this one looks like the best yet.</div></div><hr />

I tried to watch one episode from the first season.  Then I tried to watch the opener for the second season.  I guess it's just not for some people or something.</div></div><hr />

I watched that episode, which was when I made my final decision that none of those people deserved an hour of my time every week.</div></div><hr />

Yes.  He and that brown haired chick(not Sara) were the only ones that actually worked and they were the ones voted off.</div></div><hr />

If the stupid show was about actually determining self worth and not collusion and backstabbing I'd actually be interested in watching it.  Of course, I'd like to think of Survivor as The Darwin Award Nominees Wins show.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, the show is just starting.  One of my favs to win is V (the black girl), she is cruising along nicely under the radar, and doesn't seem to have any enemies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drexel</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Later, ferret-face!<br />

Go V!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think so Kullaas, it irks me that you have a little superiority complex, you should learn to enjoy Survivor for what it is, entertainment.<br />
<br />
I used to think that certain shows and movies were stupid, but it really depends on what you're expecting when you walk in or turn on your television. There are two types of movies, the thought-provoking artistic movies that win the awards (usually) and the movies that are just for entertainment value. Each type appeals to different types of people. I walked into the recent Time Machine not expecting a good interpretation of H.G. Wells masterpiece, but a good fun movie. I was not disappointed. I wouldn't walk into Scorpion King expecting to see a future oscar winner. The same applies to TV.<br />
<br />
The problem lies in when people begin to believe there should only be one type of movie or show, and try to convince others of the same.</div></div><hr />

In your post, you said lowest common denominator strikes again, infering that the people who watch it are morons, which I highly doubt. Thus, superiority complex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, half naked woman are a good thing....:D</div></div><hr />

Just ignore the men.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cedren</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watched some of the first Survivor but after being an Army Ranger for 5 years, I just couldn't understand why they called it Survivor.  After all, there had to be a big camera crew and medical personnel close by in case someone got into trouble.  Not like when you drop behind enemy lines with one other to scout installations, living off the land with no support.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just to cynical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rykar</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Next Season: Survivor Iraq<br />
See how 2 tribes survive the desert dunes and military ordnance of Saddam Hussein until only one remains to win the 1 million dollars heheh.<br />
<br />
Ok this I might watch.<br />
<br />
Or Survivor Antartica.  Hehe, this is for those who can't stand seeing people in bikinis all the time.  Whoever loses the least extremities in 3 months is the winner :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rykar, I was thinking about survivor in cold weather, and came to the conclusion that a good chunk of the U.S. experiences snow or frigid temperatures, and being reminded of that in a TV show is not very good on ratings.</div></div><hr />
