Your right they should patch every day and make you pay to beta test it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My only problem with the downtime is it doesn't seem to be fixing the problems the game is having - namely server lag spikes where nothing happens for several minutes and the heinous lag in the auction house zones!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya know, when I do an upgrade at work we follow a routine.<br />
Think.<br />

Rollout.<br />
<br />
I think someone at Blizzard jumped the gun with the latest 16 hour upgrade.  They claimed it was a major architecture change and that is why it would take 16 hours.  With something that large you don't just push it out.  You pilot it first and see if the results warrant spending all that time upgrading.<br />
<br />
The lag is annoying, but I will continue to play because I like the game and I know that it will eventually be fixed.</div></div><hr />

For those of you paying attention, in a recent post they admitted they're having architectural issues.  Using my intel background I also did a little checking and noticed they're advertising for an Oracle DBA position.  Surprise, surprise, they hosed the server architecture exactly as we predicted in OB but by then it was too late to do anything about it.  Sadly it'll be awhile before they re-architect this and get everything straightened out. :(</div></div><hr />

They flubbed about 20 servers on their opening day gaffe of separating them into time zones.  There are 20+ servers that probably have over 8-10k people playing at once and that's probably twice the recommended specification load.  Those servers crash daily now and are always under repair.  The only solution is to allow server transfers.  I'm pretty sure they designed the game to allow transfers from one server to another, though I'm kind of puzzled at why they haven't made it live yet. <br />
<br />
From outside observation I'm certain the auction house, mail system and looting system are tied closely together and are handled separately from the play server.  I think they have multiple realms per loot-mail-AH server, because I'm on a medium-population server and during primetime (and sometimes outside primetime) the auction house is lagged out and you'll often get loot lag.  I can't believe that just a couple thousand people on the server could cause that much of a latency increase if each had its own dedicated server.<br />
<br />
Anyway, a lot of poor decisions have led up to these problems.  I hope someone gets fired. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">FYI, they are working up plans to allow servers transfers, but haven't released any details on it yet.<br />
<br />
No one knows what will/won't be allowed (like PVE &lt;-&gt; PVP or vice versa), nor does anyone know if it will be limited to a &quot;FROM specific servers and only TO specific servers&quot;. <br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet they will allow transfer FROM PVP to PVE, but not the other way. I'm also willing to bet it will only be allowed FROM servers deemed to be over crowded by Blizzard and only TO the absolute lowest population servers.<br />
<br />
Probably safe to say that it won't be a &quot;free for all&quot; server transfer. There *will* be some specific rules and criteria announced and followed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">be cool if 400 of the 1000 level 60 pallies on our server went to farm azshara somewhere else :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why would it matter if you went PvP to PvE or vice versa?  Or to RP for that matter?  Your character (and you) will have to conform to whatever rule sets apply anyway.  And it's not like in EQ where server rule sets actually effected the way you may have gotten items (e.g., no NO DROP items on FV).<br />
<br />
So what would the big deal be?<br />
<br />
Incidentally, as I was waiting in a queue to get on $&amp;%$ Silver Hand (the worst server ever), I wanted to make an alt on a LOW pop server (obviously their intent by putting a queue in place).  Well, lo and behold, the only low pop servers were PvP.  This should give Blizzard a clue as to how the majority of their customer base prefers to play and they need a whole lot more Normal servers and a whole lot less PvP servers.  Yes I know there are many high pop PvP servers, but there were about 20 LOW pop PvP servers last night and ZERO low pop Normal servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no means of proving or disproving this but it's my theory that they thought they could get away with scaling the db architecture vertically (single big Oracle db) instead of horizontally (many smaller db instances).  It appears it's not just too few db's per realm servers but I think it's 1 db per entire game.  Nothing else explains why item lag is simultaneous across all realms at the same time.  <br />
<br />
Other than ease of maintenance (and given that it's Oracle, there's no such thing) I don't know why other than licensing you wouldn't split up say 1 db/10 realms or something.  Basically based upon the performance testing you should have gotten from beta and stress tests. Very sad.<br />
<br />
I'll throw out another technical issue that's completely unnecessary- tying your forum message board logins to the game's actual login server.  Replication was invented for just such a task- why on earth would you increase load on the login server for something that's not critical like a message board? And why can't you post on the message boards during scheduled maintenance?  ARGH.  Keystone Cops Architecture all the way.<br />
<br />
Okay, I feel better now.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Macheras,<br />
<br />
because it is much, much easier to level on a pve server, be kind of unfair to let somone get all leveled out and geared up and skip all the struggles.<br />
<br />
Also, the pvp servers were the most strained during launch and shotly after, I would not put a single shred of belief in their &quot;low&quot; status anyway. Alot more people play pvp than you would like to think. Might want to count pvp vs normal servers.<br />

Ok, yeah, good point.  And yeah, I should do a count of PvP versus PvE servers I suppose.  But seeing all 20 LOW choices as PvP sort of annoyed me last night.  So did trying to log into HIGH pop servers and not finding a queue, yet finding a queue on my MED pop server.  I wish they would just post the population numbers, that would allow for a much better judgement on what server to go on.  Low, med, and high doesn't offer much resolution :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ya, I do not understand why EQ stopped doing it, and others do not do it anymore, what would it hurt? It would help people make more informed server choices. If your game was tanking maybe not a bright idea, but WoW is doing very well. Would be good advertisement.<br />

North American Servers work out to:<br />
<br />
PVP = 43<br />
PVE = 40<br />
RP = 5<br />
<br />
And Mill hit the nail on the head on both counts (influx of high level players who levelled quickly in PVE, and PVP server pops are generally higher than PVE).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Jesus, 90 ish servers? Wow. I mean amazing.<br />
<br />
There are times I must admit, leveling an alt, where pvp can get annoying, gotta give you guys that, but I cannot imagine not having the sense of excitement.<br />
<br />
I have been on a high pop server the whole time, and queues can bite me. Gets laggy at night, especially in town and newbie lands. Alliance numbers are starting to hurt too, and we are one of the more balanced, relatively, servers hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">But still, half of those PvP servers were LOW pop last night (whatever that means hehe).<br />
<br />
Oh and btw, Silver Hand is down again grrr.  Not sure if everything came down this morning or not, but either way, Silver Hand is STILL down.  /em glares at his friends for picking that server!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">They did implement lower population caps on some servers temporarily, by the way, not sure exact post, but might be why alot of servers are low.<br />

I was like ummmm wth is going on.... I picked Uther because it was a low population server.... up to last night I NEVER had to wait to get in... then in one day im 400 plus people from getting on?<br />
<br />
Id just like to know whats going on....They say pick a different server dont do a high server so I pick a low one and within a month and a half its a high pop server and I have to wait in Q.. to me thats ridiculous in the extreme... sorry about the complaining ..... Im sure lots of u deal with Q every night to get in.... I just on purpose went to a low pop server so I wouldnt have these problems....<br />

During the server maintenance last Thursday, we performed a major upgrade to some of our database servers. At first the new servers performed flawlessly, but under heavy load at peak times, the new database servers are experiencing performance issues which have resulted in stability problems on certain realms, minor rollbacks and a problem with character retrieval upon login that some of you have reported. <br />
<br />
Naturally we do not consider this an acceptable state of play for our customers. We are working around the clock to diagnose and remedy these problems. As a temporary solution, we have placed lower population restrictions on the affected realms; this results in queues when the population reaches a certain number. This is a short-term solution and, while undesirable, is in place to keep the realms more stable while we work on the main cause of the issues. <br />
<br />
During the regular maintenance window that is scheduled for tomorrow, we will be making some additional changes that should allow us to increase the population restrictions on the affected realms. Our team is committed to resolving these issues as quickly and efficiently as they can. In the meantime, we appreciate your patience and understanding. <br />

I went to help defend against a horde attack on refugee point and there was probably 50 people per side there. Server lag made casting times 10-20 seconds and attacks 10 seconds apart. It was sad.</div></div><hr />

On a side note, has anyone else noticed a huge increase in the number of times you crash?  I keep getting a &quot;memory cannot be 'read'&quot; error every few hours.  I crashed 5 times yesterday, and I crashed once today.  <br />
<br />
I'm not usually one to complain, but the rampant crashing and terrible lag is making me seriously doubt continuing on much longer.  I do realize that they will eventually fix these problems, but things are getting worse rather than better right now...</div></div><hr />

The overwhelming success of World of Warcraft has brought hundreds of thousands of people together to adventure in Azeroth, and concurrency numbers are well beyond what we expected or even hoped for. Unfortunately, this high concurrency, especially when concentrated on a small number of realms, initially caused issues with our hardware infrastructure. We were able to streamline our code to increase performance in the weeks following launch. However, the holiday season nearly doubled our player base, and it quickly became apparent that in order to handle not only the current player base, but all future players as well, we needed to make some upgrades to our infrastructure. <br />
<br />
Last Thursday we made our first such upgrade. 20 of our 88 realms were moved off of the original hardware and placed on a new hardware configuration. These 20 servers initially performed very well, up until we reached our maximum concurrency Friday evening. The high population numbers uncovered an issue in the new backend shared infrastructure. This issue caused some players to experience severe lag and disconnects on a few of the realms, making them virtually unplayable. <br />
<br />
In order to stabilize the affected realms and allow as many players as possible the ability to continue playing, we lowered the population caps by 30%. This stabilized the realms to the point where 70% of the players on the realms in question could play, but it also resulted in large queues. <br />
<br />
The problems were attributed to high concurrency numbers on individual realms putting extreme stress on the backend infrastructure. We were able to address this problem by implementing additional hardware into the infrastructure this afternoon. This additional hardware has allowed us to stabilize the affected realms, and thus increase the server caps. We will continue to monitor the performance throughout the evening. If we notice any of the performance issues starting up again we will lower the population cap level enough to stabilize performance. <br />
<br />
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this caused our players this weekend. This process coincides with our constant efforts to improve the current performance of World of Warcraft, and sometimes issues can arise when implementing these improvements. We will do our best to prevent similar situations from happening in the future, and we once again thank you for your patience and understanding.</div></div><hr />
