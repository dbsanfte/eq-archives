<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just saw the newest trailer for EQ II and was wondering what everyone's thoughts were on it. <br />
<br />
Personally, I look at EQ as a game set in a fantasy type realm, and I like graphics and animations and such to have that feel. By the looks of it, it looks as if they took a step toward more &quot;life like&quot; graphics for the sequel. What I would have rather had was how WoW looks, I love those kinds of animations and graphics. <br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with what they did really, I'm still going to buy it and try it. (something to hold me over until WoW anyway :) ) Just curious how others feel about the new graphics and such.<br />
<br />
<br />

EDIT: a link in case you haven't seen it (don't know when it came out, I just saw it recently myself) EQ II trailer (http://www.gamershell.com/download_2906.shtml)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't read anything that leads me to believe the people behind EQ2 understand fun.  They understand the living hell out of bloated, dull textured, bump mapped models.  This is not the same dev team that did cool things like Unrest and the Kunark expansion.<br />
<br />
The new playable race is a RAT?   I mean come on.  Cats, frogs, and rats?  What's next?  Hamsters?  Heck, seamonkeys sounds better than ratangas.<br />
<br />
I think it will be technologically complex like SWG, but exceptionally dull, also like SWG.<br />
<br />
I predict the EQ2 killer will be EQ1.  I read a rumor that EQ1 might be getting a whole new graphics engine with highly optimized, low polygon models (ala Worlds of Warcraft).  That could be really sweet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Really not that interested in EQ2 right now.  I'm semi-interested in WoW, but mainly I'm wanting to see what Sigil comes out with.  Till then, unless GoD really tanks hard core, I'll stick to EQ1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been looking forward to EQ2 since it was announced, as it sounded like they were going to fix alot of what I didn't like about eq1... but then I came back after they fixed alot of what I didn't like about EQ1 and I'm thoroughly hooked again. I've been planning on getting EQ2, but we'll just have to see how I feel when it comes out... right now, I love EQ1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As with any game you can't write anything and put any pictures you want on the box or in a video. For only a brief moment a while ago I was looking forward to EQ2. I imagine I will try it but I don't see anything that makes me very excited yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SOE will have or has already some major issues:<br />
(1) The top or one of the top guilds of EQ is beta testing WoW. Their webpage who gets a crapload of hits has WoW information. At least 25% of my guild will be jumping ship to WoW. This is definitely not scientific statistics, but there is a LOT of talk about WoW, very little about EQ2.<br />
(2) A lot of people know how pathetic, no wait, non-existant SOE customer support is. I doubt many of these people will play EQ2.<br />
(3) EQ2 is being designed partially by the same idiots who thought having VT shard camp is actually ... fun.    Just as SOE proved again with SWG, they will ship an incomplete game. Promiss heaven, deliver not much ...<br />
(4) SWG, wich was supposed to have eclipsed EQ in term of subscribers, has barely half of EQ's subscriber numbers (even some people doubt it), this can indicate many things: people no longer trust SOE for a good game, the market is saturated, people hate SOE and refuse to buy more products from them, the game sucks.<br />
(5) A lot of people had to endure the incompetent monkey coders from SOE, this was proved again perfectly before XMas. This leads to more negative effects for EQ2, because many EQ coders are working full time on EQ2.<br />
<br />
If SOE can't make a blockbuster game out one of the most popular if not the most popular franchise (Star Wars) then they will never be able to make EQ2 a good game. EQ2 will fail.<br />
<br />
EQ currently is:<br />
- Competition for entertainment in a PvE game (aka mentally retarded game designers)<br />
- Grind, grind, grind and more grind.<br />
- Nonexistant customer support.<br />
<br />
When people who play EQ look at EQ2, many will  say: EQ2 is designed/run by the same morons. No thank you.</div></div><hr />

Just keep in mind that EQ2 was due pretty quick after initial release up till they figured out what a money tree expansions were. =p</div></div><hr />

2) Buy ANOTHER on-line game from SOE? Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.<br />
<br />
Heard EQ2 was gonna have item decay. May or may not be true, but no thanks.<br />
<br />
Can't take any of my toons to EQ2?  Oh sure, as Zorlac said, nothing like doing the level grind ALL OVER AGAIN.<br />
<br />
EQ may be a dysfuncational version of electronic sport, but doggone it, it's MY dysfunctional sport.  I'll try Wow in 2005 (or whenever), but EQ2? No way in Hades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The problem with all MMO games has been the grind.  Any company that makes every race/class combo fun throughout every level will pwn the market.  No other game company but Blizzard has stated this as the goal of their game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">About 75% of my small guild left EQ for Horizions.  I'm not leaving one half finished game for another so I'll wait and see what happens with it before I even give it a second glance.<br />
<br />
EQ2 ... no way.  Ok, OK MAYBE if someone holds a gun to my head, but don't bank on it.  I have no love for what I've seen so far, nothing that leads me to believe that CS or the creative process will be any better than it is in EQ currently.  Hastened rapidity ... LAME.    They haven't done anything really creative with the shaman class since Kunark and I have little hope that they will use their grey matter any more than they are now.<br />
<br />
WoW looks really impressive. The graphics are intense, but I'm not totally sold on the art itself ... the characters look a little too fantasyish.  That said the feature sheets read like a wet dream.<br />
-guild instanced dungeons<br />
-unique race characteristics (ie: treasure finding, water breathing ...)<br />
-all classes can solo<br />
-some incredible gameplaying ideas (ie: rogue stealth will be based on positioning, skill, calculated on a mob by mob basis based on detection attribute/skill ... OR ... warriors will have skills based on rage that is built over the course of the fight and they spend the rage like mana)<br />
-intuitive quest system<br />
-gameplay that minimises the benefit to griefers<br />
-blizzard itself ... a company that has always produced solid products with all sorts of fantastic new and creative ideas.  Ever wonder where SoE got the idea for item augments ... D2.<br />

Here's an update  (http://www.battle.net/forums/wow/thread.aspx?FN=wow-general&amp;T=874204&amp;P=1&amp;ReplyCount=156#post874204)  from the community relationship manager, who just started with blizzard FYI.  Absor could learn a few things from her, she gives straight answers that don't sound like they were pulled out of her backside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can't take any of my toons to EQ2?  Oh sure, as Zorlac said, nothing like doing the level grind ALL OVER AGAIN.<br />
<br />
But it wont be a grind.  If you were one of the people that started playing EQ way back in 99 it was an adventure.  It wasnt grinding because everything you did and everwhere you went was new to you.  It only becomes a grind after you have done it a few times and already know everything that can/will happen, so its just mindless plowing through old content.<br />
<br />
I dont think that EQ2 will tank.  I dont think that it will share in the same success that EQ did, but that was different time.  I know of many EQers that are looking forward to EQ2 with excitement.  Yes, there will be things that you remember from EQ.  And yes, EQ2 wont remain as fresh as EQ did because the spoiler sites that support EQ are already waiting for EQ2.  <br />
<br />
But disregarding all of those things, the one thing that can kill a game for you faster than anything is the attitude that you take with you into the game.  Im quite sure that the same people that are telling us how much better WoW is now will be the same folks telling you every problem and inconsistancy they have found 5 months after the game is released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well this is my view.<br />
<br />
EQ is currently broke.<br />
<br />
EQ has ALOT of wonderful ideas, im talking the best in the RPG field, but its poorly implemented. They have advanced and advanced and created and created and now they have so much they dont know how to put it together properly.<br />
<br />
My &quot;hope&quot; is that in EQ2 they will start from scratch and take all the ideas and abilities and tools and impletment then in a more balanced gameplay from level 1 to 65 or whatever the limit is. My hope is that they will follow their usual path and pick up and learn from upcoming games, they are known for that.<br />
<br />
With luck, EQ2 will be basicly a refined and smooth running everquest on a  nice new pretty graphics engine. They have a long time to watch what works for others and implement them in the game, they truly have the potential of making another winner cause the only thing that can topple EQ in any sense of the phrase is WoW. For the American gamers i dont think FFXI ( even though it is great ) cant surpass EQ in any sense other then it is simply different and that alone is making it a winner cause EQ has been around and played by people for so long. They need a change.<br />
<br />
 So gimme a silky smooth EQ2 with refined controls and more quests that dont force you to level by grinding alone ( ala WoW ) and balance out the lower levels so they are fun also and make the game about more then racing to 65 so you can raid with the ubers and ill be hooked all over again. Take the PoK and LDoN dungeons and bring it along with a kunark, pre-kunark mentality and you got a game that is going to suck people in so deep all over again. <br />
<br />
Power gamers arent where it is at SoE. Power gamers come and conquer and move on to the next conquest.  I hope they keep that im mind when making EQ2 content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think EQ2 is going to be asstastic just like SWG. If LDoN raids are any indication of the kind of crap that is to come I won't be buying the next expansion or EQ2. Doubt I would buy EQ2 on general principle since they blew up Luclin, but then again I won't make final judgement until I actually see the game. <br />
<br />
What I find funny is people that think its going to be incredible and kill EQ like one of the shaman in my guild does. That isn't going to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's all just a suspicion until the games out and real gamers can kick the tires. That said a lot of the things i've been hearing about WoW have made me think there's some fun to be had. Whereas almost everything i've heard about EQ2 has sounded at worst misguided and at best uninspired.<br />
<br />
If nothing else those EQ2 screenshots are miserable. An impressive technical acheivement but a bad idea. The fact that EQ2 showed demo's at a games show while WoW allowed almost unrestricted play also says a lot, especially since EQ2 is supposed to be out first!</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
I have 2 theories on this. A) SOE is running out of ideas, or B) They aren't even trying.  I played about 2 1/2 years ago, then quit. Back then EQ was SOE's main thing. It was CHALLENGING! And there were accually GM's on!!! /gasp  Came back round september, you do a /w gm all, I see at most 3...  I don't know where the staff went, or when they dissapeared, but if EQII starts out as bad as EQ is now, why bother?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My beef is with degrading armor/weapons.<br />
<br />
EQ 2 is supposed to have degrading weapons and armor, ( unless I've been misinformed). <br />
<br />
Ok, so what do you do after you hit the level cap? Do you go on endless raids to get armor upgrades that will eventually degrade into dust? Raid, raid, raid, and then raid some more till you get enough merit points to loot that special piece of armor, only to realize that 1 month from now your special piece of armor will be nothing but a pile of dust in your hands and you'll have to do it all over again? How would you feel if you finally got your epic but you have to keep it bagged because you know if you use it, it will eventually degrade into nothing? Does this sound like a game that the hardcore EQ player will enjoy?<br />
<br />
In my humble opinion, this is a bad way to go. EQ players are very much into upgrading their armor. In the high end game, every piece of armor obtained through raiding represents an achievement. It's a symbol of the hard work and dedication of many like-minded individuals.<br />
<br />
Does this appeal to you...?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, I only have second hand information about degrading weapons/armor. If you have any additional information, please feel free to post here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">No EQ2 for me.  I only keep playing EQ1 for friends and the homey feeling I get running through old, familiar zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">On item decay - I don't have a problem with it in general.  Instead of 2-4 pieces of loot dropping from a big boss, you could have 10-15 pieces dropping... meaning you'd get to loot a lot more often on big raids.  It's not possible to look at the EQ system, which clamps down hard on the rate at which nice gear enters the game, and draw conclusions about item decay.<br />
<br />
However - I don't see that EQ2 has much of an advantage over WOW, Horizons, SWG, or any other MMPORG out there.  The honest diehard EQ1 fans who haven't reached PoTime - most of them - are going to stick with EQ1.  The casual EQ1 players who have a lot invested in their characters are going to stay with EQ1.  The ones who are &quot;done&quot; with EQ1, either due to finishing PoTime or just being over it, are not necessarily going to choose EQ2 or any swords-and-sorcery MMP when there is a world of possibilities out there to try.<br />
<br />
SOE is going to have to provide MUCH more incentive to EQ1 players to switch over.<br />
<br />
I know it's going to be a hard sell to get my wife to play ANY other game.  She's got a lot invested in her char, we don't have a lot of time to play, and she is just not interested in playing catch-up with a whole server again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think EQ2 looks interesting.  EQ is a great game but it has some severe flaws - mostly gameplay mechanics that have been abused by players from the beginning.  Sadly, so many people have only ever played EQ for MMORPGs and have grown used to enjoying exploitive gaming as part of their MMORPG experience.  I like how the EQ2 team has recognized and seeks to do away with the flaws of EQ, while also learing from the growth and development of EQ, adding new ideas and modern tech stuff, and combining it all.  It remains to be seen if their approaches to said flaws will produce fun gameplay and if the overall product will be fun.<br />
<br />
I've played many MMORPGs and seen plenty of good, bad, and indifferent folks, but I swear that EQ brings out the worst in people more than any other game I've ever played.  EQ breeds so much greed that it makes me sick.  This is the main reason that I look forward to trying a new and different MMORPG, be it EQ2 or WoW.  I'm actually most interested in WoW since a totally fresh MMORPG would be the most enjoyable.<br />
<br />
It's really amusing to see some of the commentary here.  My advice is to go to some of the EQ2 sites that have what limited info is available and read up before making comments that have no foundation.<br />
<br />
All MMORPGs will have level grinds, just like almost every PnP RPG did - it's a core concept of the genre.  It's amusing to see people write that they don't want to level again.  So, you'd rather be at max level, with all the best gear available, and do what?  Farm lesser loot?  Kill gods with ease?  What's the point?  The only game that's somewhat like a MMROPG that has no real leveling that I know of is PlanetSide - which is already consolodating servers due to subscription loss.  Leveling is a part of character development is a core part of RPGs.<br />
<br />
Item decay is not a bad thing.  It's good for player economy.  Having tons of items constantly entering the economy while zero items leave it wrecks a player based economy.  Just look at some of the most popular shaman items, like Leaf Scale Gauntlets (20p maybe) or Metal Linked Crwon (50p maybe) for examples of how great items can be nearly worthless once they're readily available.  The best items in EQ are usually NO DROP, so they don't enter the economy.  It's unlikely that they would make NO DROPs or any other supreme high end loot degrade to the point of destruction - that isn't fun.  The point with item decay is to be a money sink (you pay for repairs to keep your gear fine tuned) and/or to eventually remove some items from the economy to stimulate economic growth vs decline.  Check out DAoC if you want to see a game where item decay is very well implemented.<br />
<br />
Gee, I just slaughtered about 2000 critters and my sword never lost it's edge - it's a miracle!  Gee, I just got brutalized repeatedly by hordes of critters and my armor isn't scratched in the least - isn't that amazing?!<br />
<br />
Graphics don't make a great game, but since the majority of us do own a decent computer with a decent graphics card then we might as well be playing games that use that power, eh?  EQ graphics aren't completely horrible but they are dated and they aren't very efficient.  DAoC has arguably (sp?) better graphics but you often get horrific graphical lag/lockups.  I don't play that many games that really use my graphics card to its potential, but I am currenly finishing up Knights of the Old Republic for PC and let me tell you, it has some damn spiffy graphics that seem to be using the full power of my video card - and I haven't had ANY graphical lag issues at all playing the game despite some wicked effects being used.  I would love to see a new MMORPG that came close to having the scenery, player animations, and magic (force) effects that KOTOR has.  And KOTOR probably isn't even the most graphically amazing game out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">im looking forward to eq2, and any eq expansions<br />

WoW has me drooling but i fear a expansion from blizzard will take a long ass time,  even if sonys expansions are half finished, it keeps me busy with new things to do, and they always release on time.<br />
<br />
Who cares about expansions if the content is already there. Get off the Chump Train. SOE is selling you content you SHOULD be getting for free as part of you monthly subscription. The ONLY price you should pay for an expansion is media and shipping if you want the install media instead of downloading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">EQ has some huge flaws eh? I think i'd be willing to put money that a good many of those huge flaws are someone elses favourite elements.<br />
<br />
The warriors sword should decay after killing 1000 orcs? not really, see we can *assume* the warrior sharpens and maintains his blade without having to explicitly game it. After 1000 orcs he probably really needs to relieve himself too, but we (thankfully) don't have to explicitly game through that.<br />
<br />
I see little originality, no fun and much mis-design associated with EQII.</div></div><hr />

Fool me once, shame on you: fool me twice, shame on me. <br />
I'll never buy another game from SOE or Verant. I remember when SWG was announced, I was actually excited over it. Then I heard that it was being designed by my old friends at Verants, and I steered well clear. I can congratulate myself on making a good choice there, I don't see anything being different in EQII.<br />
One thing that disappoints me is that everyone is always talking about WoW, but no one ever mentions Middle Earth Online. If ever a world was crying out to be made into an online game, that is the one. <br />
EQII is a definate no, WoW is a definate maybe, MEO is a definate must for me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">my biggest beaf with EQ2 is the limitation of raids to 24, as stated by the EQ2 team at the last fan faire.  What I love to do with EQ now is log on, say hello guild, and see my page turn green with &quot;hello shamu&quot;.  If I artificially cap raids, and therefore guilds, at a very low number it will be impossible to get the same soicially immersive fealing, the &quot;log on to see your friends&quot; we enjoy in EQ.<br />
Most raid guilds have approximately 150 to 200 % of their usual raid strength in members.  That means you can get a max of 36 - 48 people together and still do meaningfull play together in EQ2, without half your troops sitting out every other night.  This will mean a lot of random LFG outside your prime time. /shudder<br />
This might appeal to the casual player, but for the hard core adventurer this kind of restricted number game is rather unattractive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>dams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">my bet is that every single person who takes the time to read eq shaman boards and post on a thread titled &quot;thoughts on EQ II&quot; will buy EQ II regardless of what they post here.  just like i have seen the same people retire from eq 3 or 4 times and still have post counts in the thousands.  they can't leave this world alone.  they will buy it, play it religously and then say it sucks even though they will continue playing it.  seeing EQ addicts state they will not buy EQ II is rather amusing.  it is a sad extension of their &quot;verant is evil&quot; world view.  they won't allow themselves to praise their work, work that created a game has dominated their lives for years.  strange phenomenon.</div></div><hr />
