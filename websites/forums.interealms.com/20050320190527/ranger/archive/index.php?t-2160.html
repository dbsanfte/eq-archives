In a nutshell, approximately every 250,000 years, according to solid scientific research, the Earth's magnetic pole flip-flops (for reference, the magnetic pole of the Sun flip-flops approximately every 11 to 13 years and did so last year). Well, it's been about 860,000 years or so since the last flip, so we're way overdue.<br />
<br />
Until now.<br />
<br />
According to the data, the strength of the magnetic field at the poles is about 10% less than it was 25 years ago. Conversely, there is an area of Africa that is currently experiencing a magnetic field bubble that points in the opposite direction as the polar field. If the African field continues to grow in strength, and it's growing a lot faster than scientists originally thought, it may indeed force a polar shift within the next 200 to 500 years.<br />
<br />
Weaker magnetic field = more solar particles reach the surface of the Earth = global warming. There you have it, folks. It has nothing to do with us.</div></div><hr />

I knew I shouldn't have added my own interpretation of the information.<br />
<br />
The point of the article and my posting it here has nothing to do with global warming.<br />
<br />
It has everything to do with the magnetic field of the Earth flipping.<br />
<br />
It's an interesting topic. What happens to life as we know it if the Earth's magnetic field should weaken for a period of time and then flip? Solar radiation anybody? Ever wonder why we need stronger and stronger sunscreen when we go out doors these days?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was under the impression that cloud cover and the ozone layer did the vast majority of protecting the earth from solar radiation, not the magnetic field.<br />
<br />
It is an interesting topic, which I said in my initial post.  It will be interesting to see how gradual the effect is.  I suspect that if it takes, for instance, several years to make the switch, that airlines and other industries that rely heavily on compasses, etc.  will have an interesting time.  Hopefully GPS systems can alleviate most/all of those problems.  Could you imagine what would have happened if this took place say in the 30's and 40's?<br />
<br />
I do however, require more proof than your opinion to attribute global warming to this phenomenon and no other.<br />
<br />
I also find it interesting that in previous threads on global warming you've sworn up and down that it doesn't exist and that all the scientists who claim it does are just wrong.  Now that you have an explaination that doesn't involve restricting our ability to pollute suddenly you think there is global warming?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I'm not insinuation that this is the cause of global warming &quot;and no other.&quot; Nor have I ever suggested a single cause. My arguments in the past have always centered around the theme that global warming, if it is occurring is not a man-made phenomenon. That's different from a blanket statement that it does not exist or that it can be attributable to a single natural cause.<br />
<br />
As for the blocking of solar radiation, it is a well documented scientific fact that the vast majority of solar radiation is in fact trapped and/or blocked by the Earth's magnetic field.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The leading natural cause of it being caught: water vapor.<br />
Man made (mostly): CO2<br />
<br />
And to clear things up, damage to the Ozone Layer doesn't casue global warming. It allows more ultraviolet radiation through. Two different problems.<br />
<br />
The Earth's magnetic field does cause radiation to oscilate back and forth from pole to pole in the upper atmosphere, causing the Aurora Borealis. The wavelength of most of the trapped radiation is shorter, not longer, than visible light.<br />

<br />
As I understand it, the Van Allen Belts, which are generated by the Earth's magnetic field serve to block the planet from solar winds. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what extra solar wind hitting the planet would do. There is some data to suggest that increased solar winds would result in increased temperatures.<br />
<br />
However, I firmly maintain that man has had a negative effect on the Eath's environment, and even if global warming is a natural trend, our tendency to use and abuse our planet may well make it impossible to recover the natural order, and cycle back to lower temperatures in time as the Earth has done in the past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see absolutely no grouds for that type of personal attack levelled against her. It merely serves to reduce your credibility around here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Myrea, if Man is so all-powerful that we have the capacity to destroy the planet, how do you explain the complete and utter destruction of man-made areas by various, random acts of nature? The asteroid that plunged into the Gulf of Mexico millions of years ago is theorized to have unleashed in a concentrated area more power that the sum-total of all nuclear weapons currently existing on the planet. Yet, Earth and life both survived. A moderate class 3 hurricane unleashes more power than is required to supply the entire world for a decade. Nature is, by its very nature, violent and destructive. Moreso than humanity. There is scientific evidence that strongly suggests that the Earth has undergone massive temperature fluctuations in the past, over very short periods of time, that make current trends pale by comparisson. There is really only one thing that we are doing to the planet that cannot be undone or will not be undone by nature itself, and that is the creation of drug-resistant bacteria through genetic manipulation, over-use and incorrect-use of antibiotics.</div></div><hr />

Could it be that it sounded like an attack to you due to personal insecurities?</div></div><hr />

If it were a real concerned comment, that the internet is not the place to have someone validate your knowledge it was at best poorly phrased.<br />
<br />
As for your comment Smokimon, the same could be asked of you, me, Nitefox, Tevyn and a host of others who immediately assume the worst from folks that post different views from us.  We have each bristled or risen to defend ourselves from perceived attacks at one time or another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed, it could be asked of any of us, by any of us. I ask it of myself often when I read replies to my posts if they are &quot;aggressive&quot; in nature. I try to be objective of the posters motivation, look at if it is a reply that is an attack on me or one of my ideas. Believe it or not I can only think of one person, who no longer posts here, that I ever felt was attacking me and not my ideas.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I was simply asking Kullaas a question that only he knows the answer too. This is in no way a dig at you or your age Kullas, just an explanation to my motives. In my years of working with people in Kullaas's age group (not to mention my own experiences as a teenager /wink) I have noticed that Teenagers tend to be defensive at times and think that all people over the age of 20 look down on them or their ideas. <br />
<br />
I hope I did not offend you by bringing it up Kullaas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smokimon Trailblazer</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing that just occurred to me. As an &quot;above Average Intelligence&quot; Teenager I assume (since I do not think I was one! /grin) it would be even more prevalent due to having to deal with adults who are not as intelligent as you are but think they are just based on age. All those factors together are a good recipe for defensiveness.</div></div><hr />

Comments like the above are obvious attempts to try and prove something. &quot;I'm smart. Now let's see who's as smart at I am.&quot; The concept is completely off-topic for the thread, and was brought in exclusively to try and make someone's brain look bigger.<br />
<br />
Actually, the tone of my comment comes off exactly as intended. *****-footing around the issue seldom gets one noticed. I thought it was about time someone pointed out how arrogant things like that sound.<br />
<br />
For the record, I DO actually know what false vacuum decay is. In 1992, when I was taking quantum mechanics, I didn't really have the math background I needed to understand it completely. When I was studying the theory it had a lot more to do with the quantum geometry of the origins of the universe than with supercolliders. However, if I recall correctly, the theory was that in the presence of gravity it would create a singularity, which, on or near Earth, would be, as Igon Spengler says &quot;Bad&quot;.<br />
<br />
I was simply trying to point out that trying to start a battle of the brains around here is not going to make you look any smarter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tev, does a change in the magnetic field necessarily lead to a weakening of it?<br />
<br />
Just because the magnetic field is changing doesn't mean it's becoming weaker.  If it's weaker at the poles it doesn't affect us much.  It's only a problem if the weakening occurs over the rest of the planet.<br />
<br />
Since the magnetic poles are shifting, doesn't it make sense that if it's weakening at the poles, it'd be stronger in other areas?</div></div><hr />

I should have said:<br />
&quot;Our tendency to use and abuse our planet may well make it impossible to recover the natural order, and cycle back to lower temperatures in time as the Earth has done in the past in time to save our own race.&quot;<br />
<br />
The planet, given millions of years, will recover and erase all evidence of what we have done to it. However, we DO need to think about what we're going to be living with until that happens. To the human perspective, the effect may as well be forever, if it reders our planet, even for a geologically short time, uninhabitable.</div></div><hr />
