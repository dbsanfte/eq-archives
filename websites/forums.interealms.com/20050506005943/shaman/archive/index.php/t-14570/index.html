<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kekenewah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently returned from a long break from EQ.  My main is a 59 wizard, but I would rather play a different class for awhile.  I have two accounts and 16 toons total, all personally leveled by myself (not ebayed.)  I have a question about dots, which I am not familar with since Wizards don't have dots.  I know there have been some changes to dot stacking since I played my shaman/druid/necro 2 years ago.<br />
I have been playing my druid for the past two weeks.  He has gone from level 20 to level 28.  At level 28 I can stack 3 dots, which kills things pretty quick.  I also have a level 24 shaman on my second account I could duo with.  I was wondering how many dots shamans can stack at one time, and can I dot the mob with my 3 druid dots and add the shaman dots on top?  Sorry for the stupid question but the search function for this board will not let you search on a word under 4 letters.  I also have a level 24 necro on the same account as the druid.  Would shaman dots mesh better with the necro dots?  Thanks for any advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Two casters can now stack 2 of the same dot on the same mob, BUT lesser dots of the same line will not then stack. Unless you have another of the same class in your group, you needn't even worry about it, you can stack all of your chips on the mob, no sweat. If you have 2 shaman or a shaman and a necro trying to stack poison DoTs, then note that although both the shaman and necro can stack VoS or E-bolt, you cannot stack VoS AND E-bolt. <br />
<br />
My head hurts. I think that how it is now though, read on for more thoughts or corrections.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Druid and shaman dots stack completely, I believe.  Also, shaman dots stack by name (you can't land Venom of Snake twice, but you can land Venom of Snake and Bane of Nife, both poison dots).  You can layer as many of our dots as you have spells scribed.<br />
<br />
I've never had stacking issues with necros, but I don't work with necros very often in dot mode.<br />
<br />
Mobs have 15 slots for spell icons, iirc.  So, a full party of 6 shaman would be able to land 2 each plus 3 more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe you kinda lost me in the wording there Kkrush maybe cause I have a headache too lol.<br />
Anyway, you can stack ANY of your single target dots or ae dots on a mob. All spell lvl ranges work.<br />
you can stack bon and sicken and both would work.<br />
Imo necro and shaman is just about the most powerful duo in eq. I used to duo my lvl 58 shammie with my friends 60 necro pre luclin and we could tear through mobs people thought were impossible. In dungeons though i might go with the druid for evac. hope this helps !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kekenewah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the pointers.  I will move my shaman and necro to EW this week and do some duoing on the walruses and Ulthork hunters.  They will be red, but my druid had no problem soloing them.  The duo should tear thru them.  Necro will go out and snare and bring back to camp and shammie will root, then I will root dot them.  May also try some fear kiting using necro pet to add some dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats a good spot. Thats where my new shammy &lt;woon&gt; soloed ulthorks and walruses from 32-38ish.<br />
now i solo or group in dulaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">necro/shaman duo is just awesome.  fighting reds you might have problems with root.  a slowed mob versus a regenned/HoS necro pet means very little healing for you.  Throw dog-dog in there with taunt off.  The necro will steal aggro from the shaman very easily so feign death is your friend.  limitless mana between those classes.  My brother and I duo ALOT and were almost never low on mana unless we have to fight multis, where screaming terror is your friend. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dont listen to the retired guy.<br />
<br />
Different casters dots stack with each other completely.<br />
<br />
All shaman dots stack with one another as long as they are different dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep, all dots stack except of the same one casted by yourself (so no doubling out on BoN)<br />
<br />
When I solo something I stack BoU+Poxx+Epic+Bon the spam looks than like a chain nuking by 4 people :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh, and the 15 buff rule thing for a mob has flat out got to be BS. Its way more than that. I can't remember a single time in the last 6-9 months I got a &quot;your spell cannot take hold&quot; message from a raidmob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It used to be 15. This was changed a year ago and it's rumored to be 30 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">a shaman's dots all stack with ever one they have and another shaman  has. ours dots wont stack with there selves  2 blood or saryn  wont stack  cast by 1 shaman second cast would over wright the first but  2 shaman could both cast Blood of saryn on a mob for double the effect<br />
<br />
a shaman solo could if he/she wants stack on 30 dots(resists/mana aside with a mob we can stand toe to toe with) grouped/raid any thing more then 3 maybe 4 and we will be tanking the mob<br />
<br />
argo and resists are the shamans only limitation where dots are consernd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just a thought since you've been away for a while. The movement penalty on DoTs has been removed - i.e. your DoTs will now do full damage even if the critter is running after you<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">then note that although both the shaman and necro can stack VoS or E-bolt, you cannot stack VoS AND E-bolt. <br />
<br />
This is false. All shaman dots stack. Period. VoS and Ebolt are shared by necros and shamans. Because they are cast by different people, a necro/shaman pair could each have both spells running at the same time.<br />
<br />
The all-dots-stack thing is EXCLUSIVE to shamans! Necros can only stack the poison dots which they share with us. Druid insect dots, necro heat blood dots do NOT internally stack with each other.<br />
<br />
A shaman could run envenomed breath, venom of the snake, envenomed bolt, bane of nife, ancient: scourge of nife. and blood of saryrn all on the same mob at the same time. A second shaman could run all of these spells on the same mob at the same time.<br />
<br />
A necro could run venom of the snake and envenomed bolt on the same mob at the same time, but they could not run heat blood and boil blood at the same time...the higher level one will overwrite the lesser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gawd my head hurts worse now. But this thread proves one thing: The grouping of dot-casting casters like 2 shaman and 2 necros is just too damned under-utilized. A full group of 65 shaman with good spellbooks could probably manage to survive alot of encounters that were meant for raid forces. A 56 and 54 shaman in DN used to be the phase spider's bane, BEFORE the dot-stacking was allowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">THere is a max number of debuff/dots that can be on the mob though its pretty high.<br />
<br />
I remeber on my last VT run the shamans (we had a few) where have competitions on who would be the first to be summoned by aten's blobs so we had a TON of dots going and with the necros all runing there dots there was the &quot;this spell will not take hold&quot; issue.  but in normal circumstances this isnt anything to worry about.  and a side note i won on Aten died in the first minute, slow and 7 dots got her pissed :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Winipo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A necro could run venom of the snake and envenomed bolt on the same mob at the same time, but they could not run heat blood and boil blood at the same time...the higher level one will overwrite the lesser.<br />
<br />
This is true up to a point.  It not longer applies after a certain point (50+ I believe). I can stack ignite blood (49), pyrocruor (58), and funeral pyre (60).  I don't remember the exact rules, but it's something along the lines of 50+ dots of the same line will stack, along with one pre-50 dot of the same line, or something like that.<br />
<br />
I don't think the reason that ebolt and VoS stack is because they are also shaman spells, but because ebolt is 51 (for necro) and VoS is pre-50.  You are right about heat blood and boil blood, though.</div></div><hr />
