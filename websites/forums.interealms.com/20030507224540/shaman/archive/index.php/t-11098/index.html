<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vandalls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all<br />
There so many equipment threads…<br />
My 20 Ogre Shaman has no idea?<br />
Would any more knowledge player be willing to put together a bit of  an equipment guide<br />
example<br />
equip FAQ post on different board (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.showMessage?topicID=118.topic)<br />
I understand that each need can be different &amp; there are no hard rules, but for those of us going up the levels, it would be something to aim for<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think it would be great to do this because that way people dont need to keep asking the same questions. adding in info about horses, the debated between HP/Wisdom would be great. I would do this, however I really do not consider myself an unbiased source =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vandalls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hi kiteless<br />
I don't see that as a problem.<br />
If more knowledgable players starting offering some suggestions, the FAQ will get started.<br />
For less knowledge players it would be a great help.<br />
A few suggestions &amp; ideas are offered &amp; players can suggest different ideas.<br />
Before we know it the guide is worth making 'sticky'.<br />
Maybe it could slow down everyone's &quot;The dreaded equipment suggestions&quot; post.<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
