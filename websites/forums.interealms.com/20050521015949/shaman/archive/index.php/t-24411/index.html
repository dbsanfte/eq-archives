<br />
I was in PoV last night and I was the MH for my group.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Lets find a Cleric&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm 63, so no Q yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or at least a Druid&quot;<br />
<br />
So using only Kragg and Tnargs, I not only healed successfully, I slowed,doted and nuked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I have a Cleric coming, lets wait a while...please!&quot;<br />
<br />
And after about 15 min of fast pulling and the Monk asked &quot;How Mana&quot; and I replied<br />
<br />
&quot;4m&quot;<br />
<br />
The only thing else they said was.......&quot;WOW&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When people talk about a shaman not healing, they are referring to zones where stuff isn't fully slowable and damage spikes/procs can't be overcome by a 1785 direct heal. I duoed in PoV with a SK friend of mine at level 60 when PoP first came out, with like 2k unbuffed hit points and maybe 3300 mana pool. It's pretty easy stuff.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty content in my ability to heal. I've kept warriors alive nondisc in Riftseekers when the other healer has gone LD. I can Mainheal MPG with no problems. I've tanked WoS on self heals with the rest of the group being DPS.<br />
<br />
Would a bigger blast heal be handy to cover those &quot;Oh ****&quot; moments? hell yeah. But the picture is definitely not as bleak as it was when all we had was a 1300 direct heal and a 300/tick HoT when Gates first came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree, but.<br />
<br />
I'm in a lot of groups where the &quot;perception&quot; is that we need a Cleric or at least a Druid to heal.<br />
<br />
My op should come to no surprise to any here.  My reason for posting was poke fun at the group of players that are stuck in the mind set of been Cleric or Druid dependant.  To us Shaman, healing in PoV is not a great accomplishment, BUT to the people in my group it came as a major surprise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First I am glad you had a positive experience.<br />
You however left out some important details.<br />
Like classes levels and gear of the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
At level 70 PoV is completely trivial to me in some post-Time gear for example and heals on me tanking I require 1 BoT every 2-3 mobs or so.<br />
There is one level 70 Warrior I know that did levels 66-70 in PoV.<br />
He started there soloing but he had downtime for a few seconds every 3-4 mobs so botted a Cleric after that. Yes at 66 he was SOLOing in PoV without ANY heals at all and didnt need all that long of a break.<br />
<br />
You have yet to hit the point where healing is an issue really.<br />
Your still in content and of a level where it isnt much of an issue.<br />
<br />
I will even say this try that again in Vxed, Tipt (especially without a charmed pet) or heck even Barindu with the same group, and you will find out very quickly the difference between your experience and what others have complained about.<br />
<br />
Again I very happy you had a positive experience but PoV is not what others were talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If by mainheal you mean with a druid or shammy backup I agree.  If you mean solo healer/slower sure we can do a few mobs in a row with a good group but that mana stock goes down in one heck of a hurry.  The group would have to be pulling very slowly for any Shaman to be capable of sustained solo healing/slowing.<br />
<br />
But I agree with your message, with our Omens heal I get 5k crits often and that doesn't suck.  Fully focused and fully aa'd we heal fine IMHO for spot healing, its the other little things (like no real cc) that hurt our desireabiliy to get groups.<br />

For me to do that I need to generate 6k Mana before every pull (If I solely focused on healing).</div></div><hr />

Every single thread where healing is discussed, someone has to post a &quot;ra! ra! go go shaman!  I can heal in Bot or PoV&quot; message, at which point everyone patiently explains that yes, we are aware that shaman can heal in trivial content.<br />
<br />
Why is it that after every one of those threads, someone still has to 'disprove' the myths about shaman being unable to heal well by again posting their ability to heal in trivial content?  I mean, seriously, if they're trying to disprove the 'myth' then they have to have read those threads, right?  They know that we're talking about non-trivial content.  Is there some esoteric point I'm missing here?  Or are people genuinely unable to comprehend those threads?<br />

<br />
If I get a string of non resistant mobs, using Balance with out malos, and it lands on first cast. I have zero trouble keeping a tank up and group exp for a while before I need a break too can a few ancients and can 5 to pop then I am back up and running.<br />
<br />
I actually think we have come a long ways with healing. I have the healing shoulders from Time, all the healing AA's through Omens and get many many 5k+ critical heals off Yoppa. <br />

On raids I know for a fact my heals have asved the day when the tank is in the purple club and bam a critical pops him into the red again then a CH will land.<br />

I was simply saying that the people I was grouping with didn't think a Shaman could be MH in PoV.  They didn't have to read any of our threads to understand that.  They saw it in game.<br />

It really is that simple.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'll say that much, Shaman healing for Omens is fine(yeah!).<br />
<br />
The reason is that Omens mobs didn't gain a lot of DPS over Gates. Further proof that we, Shamans, were right when we were asking for a 1800 heal for Gates, back in, uh, Gates.<br />
<br />
However, this doesn't mean that we are balanced healing wise, because all this did is making healing trivial for Druids and Clerics. When a Shaman can heal, it's easier for a Druid and beyond trivial for a Cleric. Such is the issue with having such a healing gap seperating the 3 Priests. <br />
You basically can't design content that is challenging for all 3 healers without making it too hard for the one end(Shamans) or trivial for the other end(Clerics).<br />
The problem that persists, though, is the fact that Shamans still need to land Slow early to be able to heal adequately for the content. This is a inherent flaw, that we, the Shamans that actually play the class, tried to counter with the implementation of an AA called &quot;Spirit Shifting&quot; that would have allowed us to bridge heal the tank in case of a Slow resist.<br />
<br />
Of course the Devs knew better than us how to balance the game and didn't consider it.<br />
<br />
Vindictive Spirit was a step in the right direction I think. I give props to Rytan for this spell(the -100 MR check part, not the way too low damage cap to be precise), but I reserve my final judgement till when I get ahold of it.<br />
Spirit Shifting or the Cleric epic effect would have gone a long way to solve the issues we face with the need to rely on a resistable spell in order to fullfil the healer role.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The bottom line is that the average shaman cannot main heal &quot;hard&quot; content (whatever is hard for given expansion X).  <br />
<br />
I'm above average I suppose (mix of time, god, vt).  I cannot main heal PG or KT or Ikkinz trials or Riftseekers or Ruined City or Vxed, etc...<br />
<br />
I can, however, main heal hard ldon, bot, pov, etc.. which I now consider trivial.  <br />
<br />
For the last 3 expansions SOE has consistently forced us into a support healing role.  We backup a 'real' healer.  At one point I thought things might change, but I've given up. Shaman are backup healers so we might as well get used to it.</div></div><hr />

I kept the group alive while we killed the first/rooted the add, then rezzed the cleric back in with call of the wild. The cleric then divine rezzed himself, and off we went ;)<br />
<br />
I've also healed in MPG when losing a cleric for a few mobs. very nearly died to a 70 partial kyv that spawned on us (we were dragging cleric to another group for rez at the time)<br />
<br />
Neither of these zones I can main heal 'all night' while slowing, but in a pinch I can chain daludas with the best of them and save the group, or fill the gaps an AFk/LD cleric leaves.<br />
<br />
For lower OOW zones (WoS etc) I can slow/mainheal with no problems. But I've also tanked 3 named in WoS since mitigation patch with no problems, so any zone we can main heal/slow in generally doesnt require proper tanks and stuff with a cleric healing ;)</div></div><hr />

For lack of anything better to do, me (playing war and shm) and two friends (wiz and rng) did the murkgliders in Noble's Causeway last night.  We're all pretty far from uber, and I was working pretty hard to keep up, but it was managable, and I guess that's all I ask really.  I think if I had healing gift and could've gotten a few crit heals, that would've bought me quite a bit of time to do more stuff, and I'm sure getting my OoW heal will help a fair bit as well.</div></div><hr />

I think the worst part for shaman heals is we depend on slow to land to keep a tank up. Put in something to negate this and we would be as good of a healer as any for non raid targets.<br />
<br />
personaly an aa that allowed shaman to crit heal on all heals for 1 minute (no extra mana cost) usable every 10 minutes would solve alot of problems with using a shaman in a group as a main healer in any instance... hell make this aa only buyable after purchasing all the crit heal aa</div></div><hr />

<br />
i havent had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of fighting these mobs that regular hit in the 1k-1.5k per hit range yet, but i have to say, people are kind of going about this in the wrong direction.<br />
<br />
if they beef up our heals, then you're saying, yes, for every expansion yet to come, we want all mobs to mitigate slow.  which i think is an absurd way to deal with this.<br />
<br />
i think a more constructive approach would be to address two aspects that deal directly with our &quot;heals are related to our slows&quot;, concept.  <br />
<br />
1) how about someone with any type of &quot;input&quot; to SoE request they &quot;investigate&quot; whether its truly necessary for ALL mobs to mitigate slow.   why not, similar to zones like BoT and other PoP zones, have mobs that suffer slow normally, some that &quot;generally mitigate&quot; and others that &quot;always/almost always mitigate&quot;.  that way they can maintain content that is challenging for the ubers who can field 12k+ tanks, and the &quot;mere mortals&quot; can camp/hunt the less oppressive mobs.<br />
<br />
2) same avenue.  suggest to anyone as SoE who is listening, to create a new AA for shamans, fairly expensive, since AA's have gotten pretty cheap as new expansions roll out, that would allow a shaman to increase the percentage of slow by a modest amount, say 2,5 and 10 percent.  this would stack AFTER any save/mitigation effects, thus allowing shamans at the high end to preserve their slowing advantage.<br />
<br />
not sure on the codability of the second proposal given the engine, but the first one is definitely doable with very little effort, and merely require man-hours to do the per-mob massaging of data.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Lolanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you want to aproach it from a side of making shaman keep an equal balance with slows then yeah I would have to say make an aa slow that is unresistable 75% slow at the base lvl of it and work up to a 90% slow at the upper end of the aa. also make it so that mobs that are 1 group content and are unslowable by other slows are able to be 25% slowed with this aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">While DPS in OoW may be up over GoD in the higher end zones, the means that the DPS increase was done allows us to heal better for the same reason it allows non-warriors to tank better.  In GoD, DPS was bumped by mobs hitting like mac trucks being pushed by a freight train.  A lucky quad of 1500+ hits makes things difficult.  Mobs in OoW dont really hit as hard, but they hit faster.  Hitting faster allows skills such as dodge, parry, reposte along with avoidance to be checked more often.  This reduces the chances of some high damage spikes which tend to eat any non-plate tank folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The healing required is enough to prevent the tank from dieing to burst damage from the worst burst dps mob expected to be encountered. <br />
<br />
Shaman can heal almost as good as clerics and better than druids in most content that contains fully slowable mobs with minimal resists. <br />
<br />
The problem with shaman healing is that slow is irrelevant for most interesting new content. Slow only helps if it applies to the mob with the worst burst dps damage expected to be encountered. Slow applying to yard trash is essentially meaningless.<br />
<br />
Slow is worthless unless it works on the baddest dps mob expected by the group or raid. <br />
<br />
Heals over time are worthless unless they stack up enough to prevent tank death or aoe death for other fighting force members.<br />
<br />
The idea of balancing our heals against junk content/yard trash is ludicrous. The idea of getting rid of slow mitigation could work since so many classes have slow--however the solution would be for there to be less of a difference between slows at the cutting edge content not more.<br />
<br />
The worst thing for the shaman would be for the shaman to be as required for tough group content as the cleric is now. &quot;No go unless we get the shaman.&quot; &quot;You must drop what youre doing our group has to have you.&quot; <br />
<br />
What I would like is for a well played shaman to equal a well played druid or cleric in group healing ability--so that player ability is the most important factor regarding which priest you bring, then the mob and area type and group make up.</div></div><hr />

Keeping trushar on the main tank with an occasional Daluda's is enough to keep a tank up even in places like Kodtaz and MPG, again it all depends on the hitpoints of the tank. I consider shamans pretty balanced healers at the time, also i crit heals alot, and with the new healing boon aa's, it leaves shamans as even better healers.

To survive:  (hps * s) + HP &gt; dps * s<br />
<br />
If you can overheal in a situation, great. More power to you, I am glad you are happy to be a 47% healer in what should be trivial content for your group.<br />
<br />
For a shaman with all focus effects, daluda, and spiritual serenity, I calculate 820 healed per 6 seconds from Spiritual Serenity and 4000 healed per 10 seconds from Daludas (taken from Samanna), which is 535 hps for a shaman with about 300 AAs and best Foci, level 70 best hot, and Daludas. Yoppa would be slightly better.  Also, crits might make a difference, but I would hate to rely on crits because you cannot control them. (I may be wrong on research--please correct me if you know better. Every shaman should calculate his or her maximum healing per second to determine rather than guess the mob dps the shaman can handle.) <br />
<br />
Lets say you have a 14000 hit point tank, and a 60 second fight. Then 32100 healed and 14000 hit points equals 46,100 damage survivable.   So you can only take on mobs who cannot dish out in excess of 768 dps for 60 seconds. <br />
<br />
Lets say a similarly levelled, equipped, spelled and aa'd cleric can heal 1070 hps. (This is taken from the ratio--not calculated, and I would appreciate a calculation on similar level cleric healing if anyone has one). Then the healing in 60 seconds is 64200 plus the 14000 hit points is 78200 damage survivable. This allows this group to survive a mob that dishes out 1303 dps for 60 seconds.<br />
<br />
Only a 50% slow would even out the odds, and only if it hit before engagement. However, if your group is trying more difficult content, the hardest mobs to be fought cannot be slowed by 50%. The group is tuned to the hardest mob, not the easiest mob. So, your group gives up about 50% of the hardest content if they choose you over a cleric.<br />
<br />
You may be able to play closer to the vest than any cleric in the game, with absolutely perfect timing and mana management. Still, you cannot exceed your maximum theoretical hps. Thus, there is a major amount of content you cannot heal that a cleric can heal.  If they put in some fully slowable end single group content whose fully slowed dps equalled or slightly exceeded our maximum hps, then there would be mobs you could heal in a group that a cleric could not touch because his heal would be 25% too low, unless the cleric had a bard, enchanter or beastlord or in some situations a necro in the group, where again he or she would surpass the shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hint....<br />
<br />
<br />
Throw SS on tank before inc. / Slow mob.<br />
<br />
Than throw on another SS and one or two Yoppa's heal should get you through most content.<br />
<br />
Is a shaman with no healing aas healing a tank with crappy ac and defensive aas and little to no armor mitigation an effective healer? No.<br />
<br />
Does that make the class broken? No.<br />
<br />
Work your aas and gear and get your tanks to do the same.<br />
<br />
Oh the typical high end player response. First, many of the people that could use spiritual serenity the most (being those without high end tanks) will never see it because you can't get lvl 70 spells without a high end tank. The work on your gear and aa's remark was another nice one too. Even with pretty much the best tradable gear in almost every slot my pally friend is just over 8k hp fully buffed (which in vastly improved since omens came out). Unless we were doing completely trivial content which we don't, there is no way I'd be able to keep him healed at all with my shaman. On a lot of named fights (basically anything that hits for 1k+) We have a cleric chaining cheals while another cleric spams while I spam too when needed. <br />
<br />
Getting aa's is definately easier in the new content, but groups without the huge gear advantages are still doing it much more slowly then you probably do. Even with two dps characters out of group, my group is lucky to get an aa an hour in RCoD. Judging from the guy that started this post being 63 and hunting in PoV he's probably grouping with average tanks at his level which are no where near anything you're used too. AA's don't come that fast, and the tank probably has less buffed hp then you have unbuffed. He did fine on old mobs which is great for him, nice to see someone proud of what they can do. <br />
<br />
My point is just telling people to just go get better gear or more aa's because you can do fine in places is not a very good way to look a problem. Everything may be great doing trivial content, or fine if you're wearing the best of the best with all your spells and aa's. Its the people smack dab in the middle that would like to do some challenging content and don't have the best of everything that have life the hardest.</div></div><hr />

No, the point is should the disparity on healing ability be what it currently is at? If you told me you could heal solo against the level 1 skeletons in Everfrost, I would not be too impressed. They are not level appropriate. <br />
<br />
The beef is that a same level/equipment/aa/skill cleric is always a better choice as healer than a shaman unless either (a) slows hit for better than 50% on the hardest mob to be killed, or (b) the content is trivial for the group (no danger of tank dieing) and the shaman adds more dps.<br />
<br />
Here is the math (although correct me if I am wrong):<br />
<br />
Survival: (healing per second * seconds) + tank hit points &gt; mob damage per second * seconds<br />
<br />
Tnargs 260 hps<br />
Tnargs (aas) 335.4 hps<br />
Daludas 310 hps<br />
Daludas (aas) 466.6 hps<br />
Yoppa 357 hps<br />
Yoppa (aas) 537.2 hps<br />
<br />
Q 70 hps<br />
Trushar 105 hps<br />
Serenity 136.7 hps<br />
<br />
<br />
Q+Tnargs = 330 hps<br />
Q + Tnargs + aas = 405.4 hps<br />
Trushar + Daludas = 415 hps<br />
Trushar + Daludas + aas = 571.6 dps<br />
Serenity + Yoppa = 493.7 hps<br />
Serenity + Yoppa + aas = 673.9 hps<br />
<br />
Thus for a 60 second fight with a 15000 hit point tank, with best possible shaman healing:<br />
(673.9 hps * 60) + 15000<br />
(40434) + 15000<br />
55434 = hps useable by healed tank before death =<br />
/60 = 923.9 maximum mob dps against tank over 60 secs.<br />
<br />
Thus, by determining your maximum hps per fight, you can determine the hardest hitting mob you can attack with shaman healing.<br />
<br />
Shaman to cleric healing ratio is 47/100 so an equal cleric can heal against a mob with 2.12 times the dps as may a shaman, or against a mob which hits for 1958 dps in the above example.<br />
<br />
Shaman to Druid healing ratio is 47/64 so an equal druid can heal against a mob with 1.36 times the dps as may a shaman, or a mob which hits for 1258 dps in the above example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Hm. I've never actually main-healed in POV or BOT. I tried to avoid those zones. But what I can do is main-heal in Kod'Taz. Yep, no backup.<br />
<br />
A couple of weeks ago, I was main heal in Kod Taz (at the north crag camp) for three hours. I have Daluda's Mending and Breath of Trushar, all my POP healing AA's and the first level of Advanced Healing Adept and Healing Boon (by the way, I have yet to see a crit HOT tick). I have no OOW heal spells. I'm relatively well-equipped, I suppose, but I don't consider myself &quot;uber.&quot; Just over 5200 mana unbuffed, with leadership/tribute/VOQ, a touch over 6k mana.<br />
<br />
I didn't have too bad a time with it, honestly, except when the monk brought a Ra'Tuk. Flurry and enrage make it hard on a shaman, lol. But hynids and cragbeasts and the golems were MUCH easier, with hardly any downtime for cannibalizing (except after Ra'Tuks, lol). I did load Tnarg's and Q to see whether shaman without GOD spells could handle healing. It was *MUCH* tougher (more downtime for cannibalizing every 5-6 pulls to be sure I was around 80m), but I managed.<br />
<br />
Group was composed of myself (68/255 shaman), a roughly 9.5k 70 monk tanking, a 70 enchanter, a 66 wizard, and a 66 ranger. Nobody died. I was pleased. Flame if you feel like you have to, but I have to say I was pretty pleased with my performance. Gave me a bit of extra confidence.<br />

You pulled these numbers right out of your ass. <br />
The average heal with Yoppas and Discordant Healing isn't even 2700, let alone 2800-3300. The max non crit is 3052 iirc(crit 6104 obviously). I sometimes crit for 4.5k.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crits often&quot; is great...do you have numbers for HB crit %? Even with HB 3 you are hard pressed to actually notice a crit. If I had to guess, I'd say it's far less than 15%, which can't be considered often.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to clarify. I still stand by what I said that Shaman healing, apart from the slow resist issue, is adequate for Omens, but only because the content is trivial, if you were going to compare it to a Cleric's healing abilities.</div></div><hr />

I am REALLY getting sick of these types of posts. Hey buddy, guess what, you can't do higher end content. Sorry. Thats life. What the hell do you want? WoS, RCDS and MPG are already half-way to Diablo 2. If I have any one, single complaint about OoW its that it is TOO EASY to get spells and gear. Hell I have added 500 hps to my 57 Paladin with drops in WoS, Ruined City, and PG over the past month, and he hasnt swung his new 45/28 1HS 100 hp/mana sword once yet. <br />
<br />
Gear up in the lower zones. Get your spells in NC and WoS. Get some levels. Levels &gt; all. Get some AA. AA can make up a HUGE margin in deficient gear. Then, when you are ready, move into PG. Lvl 70 runes drop there. Move into Ruined City, lvl 70 Runes drop there off mobs I have Duo-Trioed. (Dragorn Laborer dropped my Talisman of Wunshi! WOO!! There was much rejoicing among the guilds shamans, let me tell ya). But most of all STOP BITCHING ABOUT YOUR STUFF. If you cant get better stuff, YOU CANT GO FARTHER. Thats the game man, its HOW you play it. Non-raiders have more gear available to them now than EVERY in this games history. Go get some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">With regard to the topic, I am content with my healing ability, but Giac is 100% right. It was when he pointed out this fact of the game to me that I began to see the BIGGER picture. Any content that a Shaman can main-heal on, ESPECIALLY mobs that mitigate to &quot;partially&quot;, is trivial for a Cleric and simple for a Druid, while we Shamans have to work our asses off. <br />
<br />
Also, I have noticed a HUGE differnce in healing based on the tank. A 12K warrior with 300 aa is MUCH easier to heal than a 12K warrior with 100, thats for SURE. Agro  control is huge as well. If I land a slow too early, I am gonna get splattered (hence my current dedication to maxing the new LR aa).<br />
<br />
The bottom line is yes, I can main heal in almost all of the current higher-end content of OoW, but I dont want too. I like my role as back-up. Groups FLY through AA with a Druid-Shaman or Cleric-Shaman combo. Heck we have started going Druid-Druid-Shaman, for the bonus of DPS, 3 group HoTs (4 after I finish my Epic today), and all kinds of extra bonuses. Giac may be right, the balance between the healing classes is still pretty huge, but to me, thats become less of an issue. I feel I now have a VERY legitimate role in almost every XP group in OoW, and my raid stackability is WAY up with the new Rain (note, they did NOT link it to Tears, you can chain cast them), with my MGBable HoT, with my 2400ish blast heal, and my 820/tic HoT. Wunshi is the single best new buff in the game. Spiritual Channeling may just become the next &quot;I am GOD&quot; AA (starting another thread on this), and life is good.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind this is for reference purposes when looking at a bazaar geared Shaman without Aura of Reverence or any level 5+ focii.  Looking at the numbers, I would make sure to have an OoW Mage summoned ring if I planned on using Yoppas  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sure does, unfortunately Shaman with Time+ focii aren't the ones having difficulty main healing in &quot;trivial&quot; WoS and even in the instanced Dranik's Hallows zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Thanks Jaidin--excellent and important numbers. Group HPS and tank durability directly determine what mobs a group/raid can take on more than almost any other factor. <br />
<br />
I think an HPS chart would be a nice addition to the Medicine Cabinet--Jaidins would be great. Our HPS as shaman imho is much more important than our DPS numbers. Such a chart in the medicine cabinet would provide a numerical basis to determine what mob targets are possible, if you knew the mobs average dps against your tank. (Everyone does this on an informal basis--can we take on this mob with the tank we have and the healing we have?)<br />
<br />
For longer fights, of course, you would have to adjust for loss of the Heal Over Time, or for the recast of the Heal Over Time. <br />
<br />
In terms of Jaidin's questions re: assumptions, I put in my assumptions in the healing balance post--they do make a big difference in dps. I assumed 30% spell haste, and with/without aas was based on base/best average heal from Samanna's web site tables. <br />
<br />
You provide a range for each burst heal. Does the range include crits? <br />
Personally, I feel crit heals are dangerous to count on in planning a fight unless you are sure they will hit during the fight before the tank runs out of hit points.  Perhaps I am wrong.<br />
<br />
In reviewing your post again, you state that you select the mean, obviously because the  48% improvement in healing is sporadic, and actually provides 0 to 48% improvement on any particular heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought that the AA improvements were all guaranteed and the Focus effects were the ones that were random.  In that case you would need to figure on a 28% guaranteed bonus if the player has the AA's, and 0-20% random bonus on top of that.  Also, 65 capped focus effects still work on 66-70 spells, but they are just less of a bonus as the level of the spell increases.  Samanna has a pretty good diagram of how it works.<br />
<br />
I would think the numbers would be more like this for Yoppa's with all of the variables Jaidin listed:<br />
<br />
Yoppa's Mending: (2285 hp - 2535 hp, 407 - 447 mana)<br />
3.225s cast time, 2.25s recast time<br />
28% Guaranteed Healing Improvement from AA's<br />
20% Guaranteed Mana Preservation from AA's + Alteration Specialization<br />
14% Spell Haste since Quickening of Mith scales down after level 65 <br />
14% Random Improved Healing since IH4 scales down after level 65<br />
7% (Random?) Mana Preservation since MP4 scales down after level 65<br />
Hitpoints healed per second: 417.35 - 463.01<br />
Hitpoints healed per mana: 5.11 - 6.22<br />
Mana per second: 74.33 - 81.64<br />
<br />
For the rest of the spells, I think the numbers would look more like this:<br />
<br />
Tnarg's Mending: (1664 - 1924 hitpoints, 315 - 360 mana)<br />
<br />
Daluda's Mending: (1984 - 2333 hitpoints, 358 - 392 mana)<br />
<br />
I may be wrong, but I this is how I understood (and hope) that it works.<br />

20% Guaranteed Mana Preservation from AA's + Alteration Specialization<br />
14% Spell Haste since Quickening of Mith scales down after level 65 <br />
14% Random Improved Healing since IH4 scales down after level 65<br />
7% (Random?) Mana Preservation since MP4 scales down after level 65<br />
Hitpoints healed per second: 417.35 - 463.01<br />
Hitpoints healed per mana: 5.11 - 6.22<br />

<br />
For the rest of the spells, I think the numbers would look more like this:<br />
<br />
Tnarg's Mending: (1664 - 1924 hitpoints, 315 - 360 mana)<br />
<br />
Daluda's Mending: (1984 - 2333 hitpoints, 358 - 392 mana)<br />

Fixed some of my math<br />
<br />
Ok, after some testing it turns out that what I thought (and I know many others had too) about specialization checks and SCM is incorrect because we have visible mana numbers now, yay! :)  Thanks for bringing it up Tobyus!  I had no idea that SCM and specialization percentages are fixed.  I'll make a quick post here and then clean my previous one up tomorrow.<br />
<br />
For the record, I tested chloroblast and tnargs after taking off my IH4 items.  Chloroblast hit for 509 every time as it should with HA3 and AHA3, which totals 19% improved healing, since it bases at 428.  Tnargs hit for 1547 every time, again a 19% improvement.<br />
<br />
Then I tested chloroblast without mp4 and it cost 138 mana every time.  I have SCM3 and specialize:alteration 200 which apparently saves 21% mana.  Tnargs cost 355 every time again 21% less than it's base cost of 450.<br />
<br />
This is really good stuff :)  I hadn't played with the shown mana numbers any until tonight.  Also, I couldn't cast a spell unless I had enough mana to cover the base cost, 450 in the case of tnargs and 175 in the case of chloroblast.  That would probably explain why spiritual channeling doesn't work unless you can actually cover the cost of the spell in mana since maybe it's some sort of 100% mana preservation or something.<br />
<br />
eximius,<br />
<br />
I didn't include crits for any of the numbers as they really aren't reliable.  I took the mean of the calculated min/max values (which turned out to be incorrect min's anyway).  The numbers really show how valuable focus items and aa's are :)<br />
<br />
Actually I think I'll publish a little excel spreadsheet so anyone can plug in their aa's, spell haste, improved healing, and mana pres to calculate how their heals function.<br />
<br />

<br />
Do you take into account Replenishment. Or The new regen? The new regen is 10 more HPS. But much much longer duration. (Also anyone know if we get heal crits on regen spells? they are HoT's after all)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Not to derail all the stat posts, but wanted to go back to near the beginning when someone asked if we could heal in the proving grounds.<br />
<br />
It is possible...  I've done it in pinches.  We had the Taskfiend camp and our cleric had to bail... took our replacement cleric about 30 mins to get there and Taskfiend popped twice in that time.  I was the only slower and healer.  They were hesitant to pull it with only me, but we did in fear of getting KS'd.  We had a fairly normal PoTime-geared SK tanking.  Even time-geared people lose hps pretty quickly in this zone.  I was able to keep him healed through 2 named fights (won the Soul-Imbued Ring on 2nd pop :)). There's been a few times the main healer has dropped and I was able to keep people on their feet.  Those mobs have high DPS... to say the least.<br />
<br />
Crit heals come in very handy...  Q the tank on INC...  epic effect comes in handy also.  I can go 3-4 fights before I need a mana break.  Too bad we can't use horsies in there...<br />
<br />
As a side note...  I dumbly/blindly went into PG just after the expansion was released for the first time and was probly the only person in the zone... I conned the entrance mob there, saw that he was yellow to me, and curiosity got the best of me.  I wanted to see how tough it was.<br />
<br />
So I buffed up my non-uber monk/shaman duo, pulled the mofo, and proceeded to see if I could take him down.  Took me about 3 mins, but he finally got into flee mode...  had to use all my monk's discs and had to spam heal and Q on the shaman, but I didn't die, even from a couple nasty spikes of damage.  Didn't think much of it, even considered possibly using the zone as a good duo spot for me.<br />
<br />
Amazing what you can do when you're ignorant and stupid.  I never even tried to duo again, just got in xp groups as my shaman, and what I've learned is that either 1) I'm really damn good or 2) I'm really damn lucky, because tanks get pwned in that zone...  clerics go oom quick.  It's not common for a group member to die once ever 5-6 pulls in the pickup groups I get in there... elemental and Time-geared tanks get chewed up quick.  Now that I've spent much more time in there in groups and seen how difficult these mobs can be, it amazes me that I duo'd one.  I wonder if it has something to do with monk ability to make a mob completely miss more than other classes...   In my pick-up groups a monk never tanks.. it's always a plate-class.  It seems OOW mobs have high ATK and rarely miss.. and they quad... so perhaps making a mob miss more is more valuable than just having a ton of hps and mitigation.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps I just got freakin lucky...  most likely option #2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Monks get block.<br />
<br />
Block is the best defensive skill by far.<br />
<br />
I belive many years ago FoH did a test. Block fires off 2 times as much as dodge and such. And is the catch all. It is tested right before damage is applied. So you go through to Hit, Dodge. and parry. And Ac mitagation then right before damage is given. Block fires. No damage.<br />
<br />
If sheild block is the same way. (No clue yet) It will Make SK and Paladin Fantastic tanks for high damage applications where defensive is not as useful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Also, 65 capped focus effects still work on 66-70 spells, but they are just less of a bonus as the level of the spell increases.<br />
<br />
Not all level 4 or above focus effects extend to 66+ spells.  None of my level IV effects do, such as Mana Preservation IV and Improved Damage IV as they all state, in game, that they work on spells up to level 65.  Haste of Mithaniel even states that it works up to level 65 spells, so it's not just the generically named focii.  However, Conservation of Solusek works up to level 67 spells and the Discordant focii work up to level 68 spells.<br />
<br />
I don't have any 66+ spells yet so I can't test the reduction of effectiveness above the listed spell range for focii, but Samanna says this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Note: Pre-OoW Focus Effects scale down 5% of their original modification percentage <br />
for each spell level the spell they modify is over thier rated range. For example, <br />
if you cast a level 69 spell with a level 65 +10% effect, you get +8% net effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
I remember the focus announcement stating that the effect would scale down 10% per level above the cap for the effect, not 5%.  I searched and searched for the announcement but couldnt find it, I did find it quoted somewhere else but that doesnt do much good.  I plan to test it for sure using lower level foci but for now will use 10%.<br />
<br />
Snoww, great questions!<br />
<br />
Do you take into account Replenishment. Or The new regen? The new regen is 10 more HPS. But much much longer duration.<br />
<br />
When figuring HPS required to heal X mob, usually any HoTs and regen spells are included.  Some players feel they are negligible  to the point they are not even cast, but I disagree.<br />
<br />
Blessing of Replenishment heals 40hp/tick and Talisman of Perseverance heals 60hp/tick.  Both the single target and group Perseverance are the same duration as Replenishment, ~21minutes at level 70.  I would consider Perseverance a useful tool for healing, at 10hp/s, mostly because its just always running.<br />
<br />
 (Also anyone know if we get heal crits on regen spells? they are HoT's after all)<br />
<br />
While technically our regen spells may be heal over time spells, Sony does not consider them to be by definition of their spell category, Heal [Duration] which covers spells such as Torpor (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1576&amp;source=Live) and Spiritual Serenity (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5416&amp;source=Live).  Notice the Category field and compare it to that of Spirit of Perseverance (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5393&amp;source=Live) and Talisman of Perseverance (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5406&amp;source=Live).  Most likely, Healing Boon covers heal spells of the Heal [Duration] category and not of the Regen [Single] or Regen [Group] categories.  I dont know for sure since I dont have Healing Boon, however it should be pretty easy for anyone with the AA to test.<br />
<br />
Also the Bard song healy thingys with AA. How High do they go per tick. And will they crit heal as well.?<br />
<br />
Bards make my head hurt! :)<br />
<br />
Heres what I can gather about bards regen spells.  The two I will refer to are:<br />
<br />
Chorus of Life (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5384&amp;source=Live)  Level 69, AE, category Regen [Group], String, 25hp/tick, 22mana/tick<br />
Cantana of Life (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5377&amp;source=Live)  Level 67, Group, category Regen [Group], String, 25hp/tick, 22mana/tick<br />
<br />
Both spells are of the regen category and not duration heals so its likely they do not crit.  Bards can affect the #s in their songs by modifiers provided by AAs and instruments up to a certain cap and can raise that cap with AAs as well.  Take a level 70 Bard with the following AAs:<br />
<br />
Instrument Mastery 3 (Luclin) - 0.2 modifier per trained level, 3 levels<br />
Improved Instrument Mastery (GoD)  0.2 modifier, 1 level<br />
Ayonaes Tutelage 3 (PoP)  0.1 cap raise per trained level, 3 levels<br />
Echo of Taelosia (GoD)  0.1 cap raise per trained level, 3 levels<br />
<br />
Also, instruments and other items can have modifiers on them as well and they stack.  Here (http://p196.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm59.showMessage?topicID=203.topic) is a list of items with Bard modifiers.  Some affect only one type such as String, others like the Bard epic, affect all types.<br />
<br />
Take the above example Bard with a base modifier cap of 3.6 and a base modifier of 0, apply the AAs to get a 0.8 String modifier and 4.2 String cap then give him say an item that has a String mod of 2.0 for a total String modifier of 2.8.  If that bard sings Cantana of Life it will regen 70hp/tick 22mana/tick.<br />
<br />
Yes, Bards rock!  Now Im sure some of this is a bit off but I think thats the gist of em :)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the information. Once we have solid healilng per second numbers, if we can get solid mob dps numbers we can know exactly where it makes sense for us to hunt, and what the best progression is in terms of sustaining hps. I am looking forward to the excel spreadsheet, and maybe even a chart can be set up for Samanna's site, since she has already done the average healing per cast chart. I am not so much interested in the max heal with crit per cast--wonderful when it happens and life or mana saving I am sure, but I would not want to lset up a group counting on those. <br />
<br />
The numbers will also show that we are equal or superior healers when we can reduce mob dps through slow and the other healers do not bring a slower. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, with four slowing classes, plus melee slow effects, such a condition seems unlikely.</div></div><hr />

The mana regen component of bardsong is unaffected by instrument / singing modifiers - only the health regen is boosted for the combo health / mana songs.<br />
<br />
Level 32 manasong used to be affected by voice modifiers, but that was changed some while back.<br />
<br />
Similarly, for bard haste / atk / ds songs, the haste component isn't affected by the instrument used, but the atk and damage shield components take advantage of it.</div></div><hr />

Aye they should be affected but at a 10% decrease for the 61 buff and 20% for the 62 buff, according to Sony at least.<br />

Shaman Healing (http://12.99.5.43/temp/Shaman%20Healing.htm)<br />
<br />
Plug numbers into the Modifier categories and adjust for AA's, items, and skills as necessary.  It's a little rough but functional at least.  I tried to match SCM3 and Spec:Alt(200) as close as I could but I haven't been able to really test them seperately.  Actually, I'm sure with the mana numbers there are available percentages on Graffe's.  I took a look around Graffe's but could only find statements about SCM3 being 10% and 200 in specialization being another 10%, but my personal tests were a little over 21% combined.  20% though is a good round figure, 10% for each.<br />
<br />

<br />
What you suggest reminds me of the old chart on EQAtlas that showed what zones to hunt in by level :)  I vision a nifty asp.net page that any Shaman can plug in his level, aa, mana pool, hp, and relevant focus effects to get &quot;where to hunt&quot; suggestions!<br />
<br />
The numbers will also show that we are equal or superior healers when we can reduce mob dps through slow and the other healers do not bring a slower.<br />
<br />
Well, that's already been proven for the most part.  We can generally outheal Druids and Clerics under Shamanistic ideal circumstances, in so far as the &quot;sweet spot&quot; for Shaman between mob dps, tank mitigation effectiveness, and max slow percentage.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, with four slowing classes, plus melee slow effects, such a condition seems unlikely.<br />
<br />
That's the killer.  Realistically, a group with a tank and a priest will also have a slower.  Although at last I think many more Shaman nowadays are accepting a backup or second healer role, opening up more time to focus on pulling and damage.<br />

<br />
I figured that mana regen was a bit high ;)  Thanks for the clarification on which songs are affected by mods!  I do remember reading some specific songs / categories of songs but really wasn't too sure.<br />
<br />
Do you happen to know if there is a base modifier and cap for bards and if those increase naturally?  The best I could do was infer from AA descriptions that the base cap is 3.6 at level 65 and the base modifier is 0.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

A lot depends on who is tanking these days, and it's not as much about your own healing power as you might think.  It has as much to do with the tank and his gear as it does with your own healing foci/etc.<br />

I have also healed PG with a warrior tank who was just supreme... he was hardly taking damage except from kyvs and lightning dudes.  Sometimes you wind up in chain-fast-heal-mode, but most of the time, it wasn't that bad, really.<br />

chif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">My thought with all of this is simple. <br />
<br />
If you devoted nothing else but time to become the best shaman healer you could be. Spent all the aa in healing gift and adept and boon. Had the Best regen spell. Had the Group heal AA. had the Epic 1.5 or 2.0  and had the call of the aincents full up  and the leadership regen aa. <br />
<br />
And the Extended enhancement stuff and healing focuses. <br />
<br />
Could we even keep up with a bazzar geared Cleric?<br />
<br />
Probably not. With slow mitagation it cripples us. And the clerics have the ace in the hole. When things go wrong. They save you time with a 96 or even 100% xp res. We have nothing that even comes close. <br />
<br />
The call of the wild AA is not enough. It should be 45% xp returned. And stackable witha  druids call of the wild ability so that when you use both you intergrate the spirit with the material and the target gets back 90% of xp lost. <br />
<br />
Shaman healing should stack with a clerics. Our hot's should be a suppliment to the clerics. Not overwritten. But ours should have a 2 tick longer duration than a clerics We are slow and measured where clerics are raw and pure. <br />
<br />
When You replace a beastlord with a shaman the overall safety of the group should go up since the kill rate will go down. (cleric grouped already) As it stands now The effect of the shaman adding is not as effective as it should be. Our Hot's are overwritten. Our Bard boxed Call of the aincents is overwritten/ blocked by the cleric one. And our slow while quite effective is marginalized by the effects of mitagation to such an extent that The others classes advantages when grouped with a cleric tend to outweigh our advantages. Clerics are the building blocks of groups and they overwrite much of our advantages to groups. <br />
<br />
I love having clerics in groups. It makes me feel safe. But it also makes me feel less useful. And that should not be the case.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">There are 4 sides to survivability: hp/s by healers, mob dp/s -- affected by cc/slow/ac/defense, hp cushion, and prevalence of silly mistakes by group members. <br />
<br />
To see what is possible we need to know healing, damage, and hit points. Healing is best characterized by sustained hps. Damage is defined by mob characteristic vs. ac/defense of our tank. There is a sweet spot on a/c for mobs though--if your tank is below the level/ac needed for the sweet spot it makes a huge difference. The sweet spot tends to be by expansion, if I recall correctly. There is a lot of stuff in Steel Warrior about this. Moral is your tank needs to be equipped for the expansion. The tank's aa's and disciplines can reduce damage too, just like our aa's can increase healing. This should be an average percentage and affects what a group can hit. <br />
<br />
Reducing mob dps through level, ac and defensive skills of your tank substantially reduces required hp/s, and a larger hp buffer on tank also increases safety. <br />
<br />
Why focus on our healing hp/s? Because keeping the group alive by healing or slowing mob dp/s is our role in any group. That is where we come in, our contribution is either as main or secondary healer.  Our slow, when it works at 75%, is the single biggest factor in any encounter. That is why it has been mitigated to near uselessness in bleeding edge content. The big mobs arent slowable. If the biggest mob is not slowable, you need healing for an unslowed situation, and slow is not necessary--in short fights it is a waste of mana.</div></div><hr />

the fool who gets so jacked about doin' good in pov that he immediately runs over to shaman's crucible to basically post I KICK ASS AS A SHAMAN<br />
<br />
because, let's be honest, this guy says he clearly that understands it's not end-game stuff.  obviously he knows that his healing in pov doesn't speak at all to harder zones, other situations or any sort of class balance stuff<br />
<br />
on the other hand:<br />
<br />
you have 30 posters (for none of whom this sort of post is new) to independently yet in unison come back with the hackneyed &quot;wait till you fight some hard stuff&quot; yadda yadda etc<br />
<br />
both points are equally stupid and you're talking past each other.<br />
<br />
obviously, his healing in a 3 year old, 5 expansion old zone, which was reknowned for the lego-block easiness even when PoP first opened has no bearing on how your healing works end-game<br />
<br />
yet your deficiency in the end game has no bearing on his healing in pov either does it?<br />
<br />
it's a bit hypocritical for you to criticize this mentally challenged dude for being short sighted and situational when you're doing the exact thing in reverse.<br />
<br />
other than the annoying and misleading title... and the stupid part where Scy pulls down his pants for the BIG reveal and everyone in PoV comes to stare and go WOW! there isn't anything in there about the overall state of the class<br />
<br />
guy obviously got spastic excited about himself and had to brag.  came here to do it</div></div><hr />

This thread isn't about the state of the Shaman class it's a post stating that &quot;Shaman can't heal, my a$$.&quot;  Clearly, if you are top end, you can argue that &quot;Shaman can't heal my a$$&quot; whereas if you are healing in PoV it's equally easy to argue &quot;Shaman can't heal, my a$$.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not that the two arguments don't meet each other, it's that the latter argument has no clue where to meet the first argument as it's too far stuck in the past and irrelevant to the first, just as the first is irrelevant to the second.<br />
<br />
Considering Scy did say that he knew it wasn't high end content leads me to believe he is aware of the healing matters in high end content, which also suggests he knows about the inverse situation of trivial content - in so far as it being just that, trivial.  Now, he knows he's in trivial content and feels the need to post that it is, well, trivial...<br />
<br />
We all understand where he's coming from and just like to point out the other side of that story.  A &quot;grats, keep on trucking bro, but it gets tougher&quot; by no means suggests any discontent.</div></div><hr />

Couldn't agree more that healing at the end game is radically different then healing in just about anything pre-GoD.  <br />
<br />
What is frustrating to this casual gamer is that most people outside of the shaman community incorrectly assume that shaman can't heal in any content that a group of 60+ toons would venture into.<br />
<br />
Case in point - last night, after our cleric went LD prior to gettting the adventure, it took me 45 minutes to convince the group leader (a guildie of mine) that a shaman could do the job just fine in a Hard LDON as there were  no clerics or druids LFG.  At that time, our group was a 65 shaman (me), 2x66 pally, 66 bard, and 63 ranger.  We added a 66 shaman to the mix and the group hesitantly headed out.<br />
<br />
The tank never went below 50%; we finished in 45 minutes; and we killed 3 named.  The group was ecstatic and gave the 2 of us big kudos.  We just shrugged and laughed.  It was no big deal.  <br />
<br />
It's frustrating that most people are shocked when a bazaar-equipped shaman can actually heal in non-endgame encounters.  They hear, &quot;shaman can't heal worth @%#$ !!&quot; and believe it applies to all content.</div></div><hr />
