<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Viking827</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've tried downloading several UI's such as drakahtking's and icyblue. I followed the instructions that came with them, however I can't seem to load the UI's. I've done the thing where you replace the eqclient file or whatever, and that doesn't work. I've also tried loading the UI in-game by typing &quot;/loadskin icyblue&quot; for example, but it just loads default instead. I'm sure I typed in the right things and the folders are named correctly and in the uifiles folder. Is there something I'm missing? My EQ seems to refuse to load any new UI!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance if anyone can help =(<br />

When it loads default do you see an error message? The files may be bad and unable to load in which case EQ will go back to default</div></div><hr />
