<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>/\/\ajin \/egeta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I am playing everquest in luclin or any of the new planes in PoP, I lag horribly (probably like a lot of people). But im pulling like 4 - 10 frames per sec and this is just plain annoying when all im trying to do is click in my inventory. I know i can turn clipping all the way down and turn off all spell effects and all the other wonderful stuff but it still doesn't help a whole bunch.<br />
<br />
On to the question, I just recently got some money and Im going to upgrade my computer so i might be able to solve this annoyance. I have a 700mhz AMD duran and some crappy mobo from Gigabyte. I have 576megs of RAM (Most likely not the problem) and i have a 32meg Nvidia 2 video card. The recommendation on the back of the PoP Box says +800mhz processor and at least 32meg video card. <br />
<br />
I am looking mainly to get rid of the annoying frame rate but i don't know if a higher end video card because I will still have the crappy processor, or if having a great CPU but still a crappy video card will solve the problem. Now what should i upgrade the processor or the video card? (If you could give me some ideas as to what i should buy like names and links if you could) And if i should buy a processor please give me a name of a nice Mobo, i don't remember what good anymore, everything keeps changing on me =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My system<br />
<br />
PIII 500, 256 meg SD RAM, 64 meg DDR GForce 4 vid card, windows 98 SE<br />
<br />
My settings<br />
<br />
half luclin models are on, all spell effects are on, clip pane is maxxed, and running 1280x1024 resolution<br />
<br />
Lag is not a problem anywhere but bazaar and when 75+ people are casting spells right in front of me.<br />
<br />
Buy the best damn video card you can reasonably afford (Radeon 9700 is wicked, but not worth the price, yet).<br />
<br />
As with anything computer related, buying middle to better quality hardware is never a mistake, tho what's best bang for your buck depends on what the price of components are on any given day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">700mhz AMD duran <br />
<br />
The Duron may be holding you back (fair cpu's, but basically a Celeron).  You could probably get a 900 Athlon fairly cheaply if your board will support it (check the website and manual, BIOS update may be required).  Might also want to make sure your fan is decent with the uppage in temperature.<br />
<br />
32meg Nvidia 2 video card <br />
<br />
PCI or AGP?  The AGP Radeon 8500's and Nvidia G3 Ti200's have gone cost effective and make for a nice upgrade as well.<br />
<br />
Or you can do what I did for my wife:  Buy a Intel 1.8 (or higher) Celeron (boxed) and an 845G board for around $150 together.  It was a cheap solution and I was able to use all her existing hardware.  Make sure you get a P4 based Celeron though, the performance is much better than any of the P3 based Celery's.</div></div><hr />
