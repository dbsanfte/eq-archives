<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many folks here in the Shaman Community have retired their Shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am curently retired, but didn't roll back.<br />
I may come back in 3 months, depends on the game evolution, for the moment, it seems that I won't come back ......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">too many choices...<br />
I have problems with my shaman main but keep on fighting<br />
I have given up on PoP or Luclin keys<br />
I gave up Gates trials when I was told by a 5 person group, &quot;we're looking for a healer, we have a slower (enchanter)&quot;<br />
I have multiple alts for when I can't find a group, or dont want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm, there isn't an option for me.<br />
<br />
I'm a 65 shaman in a Time guild. We just hit Time, so I'm currently happy finishing off POP. Everything I hear about GoD (more trials, long trials, difficult to get to trials, difficult to CR from trials, hard to get groups for trials, uninspired new spells) completely turns me off.<br />
<br />
I've now been to GoD exactly three times:<br />
<br />
1) Abysmal - max alchemy<br />
2) Vext trial - guild group, I had to leave before we finished as we approached the 4 hour mark (real life obligations). I can't imagine when I'll have the time/inclination to complete a 4+ hour trial.<br />
3) Absymal - buy casserole sketches to get pottery to 199<br />
<br />
No real desire to go back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, lots of choices that apply, none of &quot;Seriously thinking about it after the content all being staler than croutons&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You all can pick more than one.  <br />
<br />
That may make some of the stats a bit strange since some of the reponses are mutually exclusive like &quot;My Shaman is fine&quot; and &quot;I have deleted my Shaman&quot; but I wanted to give folks the chance to hit all that apply.<br />
<br />
This is also not another way to whine, but I thought it was important to see how the course of the game has changed the way people look at their Shaman.<br />
<br />
A year ago I would have never thought that Sionnach would have been anything but my sole character inching his way toward latest content, &quot;slowly&quot; but surely.  Now I find that I have had to make radical changes to my game to keep from getting frustrated.  I have always been the type of player who only wanted one character (maybe a bazaar mule but that is all).  Now I am finding that I have to have another character if I want to experience all of the game content and stay social (group and raid).<br />
<br />
I am not saying that there are not some very skilled and smart folks who play Shaman who can find their way into every aspect of the game, but I am just not that talented.<br />
<br />
This is just a way to gauge how folks feel about their Shaman characters and if they have also made some radical changes in their 'Toon line up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm still not too far in my 2nd run with EQ, love my shaman, and almost always play my shaman over my many alts.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say that I've given up on flagging, but it's not easy to get flagged without being guilded and I have no desire to join a guild (enjoying NOT being in a guild after years of being in and/or leading guilds in various MMORPGs including 1st run of EQ).  So, I get flags when I can, mostly just to improve my charm, but it's not a high priority and I don't really give a crap.<br />
<br />
I have friends I could try GoD with but it's not a super high priority to us and we haven't got around to making a serious attempt yet.<br />
<br />
I've turned down several offers to do GoD trials because I either didn't think I'd have enough time or I felt like doing something else (pushing hard for LDoN points to get beefy augs for my LDoN armor, for ex).  Some of the GoD content is tougher than I can probably handle - and I can deal with that.<br />
<br />
I very, very rarely have troubles finding a group.  The only time I really have troubles is at off hours when there just aren't many groups to be had in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">GoD broke the back of my group of friends.  We as a group loved challenges and attempting difficult encounters.<br />
<br />
In GoD we found only dissappointment.  Pre-GoD we would have 8 or so online a night actively playing their mains.  After our initial failed excursions into GoD only 2 or 3 log on per night and most play alts.<br />
<br />
As a group of very proficient players we made many attempts into several GoD zones.  The usual result was a night filled with CRs.  Not a single one of our group minds a wipe while attempting something difficult.  However, most of the deaths in GoD are pointless and lead to the GoD CR loop (TM) (dying on the way to a camp, dragger dies getting your corpse, second dragger dies, somehow cleric dies, Pally tries to drag and is killed, rinse wash repeat).<br />
<br />
I think that PoP has somewhat spoiled my group of friends (myself included), but regardless of the convenience of PoP, GoD is still poorly executed.<br />
<br />
My view of EQ has changed over time.  In the beginning (Jan '00) I played because the content and concept were new and fresh.  Around LoY I became less interested in the content and more inclined to play to keep up with the doings of my friends.  Today I only log on to hang out with friends and EQ is basically a colorful IM chat box.<br />
<br />
With the current state of the game and my attitude towards it, I find that I have more fun in EQ playing my lvl 31 gnome SK than my lvl 65 Shaman.<br />
<br />
So have I retired, basically yes.  My Shaman is now a buff bot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have 2 alts who both see more play time than my main...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cabe is now a potion whore, for my new bard :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You didn't put my option.<br />
<br />
I quit<br />
<br />
THE number one reason being is that my power as a shaman did not scale with the game.<br />
<br />
At lvl 65 with all my spells including the 64 Bane and 206 aa the mobs in pop and gates are 100 times harder and have scaled exponentially in power compared to me. In fact many mitigate or are outright immune to speed changes now. <br />
<br />
So what is the use of having slow or root?<br />
<br />
Instead of whining and moaning which doesn't do anything!<br />
(I'm still reading the same posts 2 months later about SOE making <br />
stupid changes on test server - ie. new Q)<br />
<br />
So I quit, and cancelled my account.<br />
<br />
I am Happily giving my money to another game, that has tons of quests you can do solo or in small groups in 1-2 hours, has really cool combat styles with animations that go with the attacks. Imagine slowing a mob and its animation actually slows along with it, you have to see it to believe it!<br />
My eyes just popped the first time I seen it.<br />
<br />
and yes I am having FUN again!<br />
<br />
there's just so much more about it that I like...</div></div><hr />

What makes it difficult in any way is that stupid people that think that they need to run through the middle of the zone and don't pay attention to what they are doing.  Seriously, I don't think that I've died more than 2 times in Barindu, and that was only because of idiot people training six mobs to the HP or whatever.  When I hear of some people saying they've died 20 times in one day there I just laugh my ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There was no sole &quot;I retired&quot; option. Deleteing and retiring are two different things.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I retired my shaman to alt status for all intents and purposes.  Ever since I started playing, I've ALWAYS preferred playing my bard, but for a number of reasons my shaman was played as my main, more out of necessity than preference.  As my shaman has become less and less necessary for my situation, I have been phasing him out.  I still play him sometimes (mostly if my hands hurt from twisting too much) but he is definitely more of an &quot;alt&quot; than a main these days.</div></div><hr />

I just transferred servers to play with a RL friend (the 5 I started with have all quit the game; also, the pickup raid culture on MM sealed the deal. I find myself moving forward within content, but I honestly don't expect to reach Time or high-end GoD. I'll consider myself lucky to get to Elementals.<br />

The game is still fun for me most of the time.</div></div><hr />

Eq has turned into a huge massive timesink no longer can you just pop on and play a short amount of time you have log and play hours straight, and with ldon no way in hell can you abbandand group or find replacement even.<br />
If Sony comes up with a way to play eq short time again, maybe even short LDON missions, bah I'm wishing<br />

P.S. No..I don't find much fun in the fact that at 61 I cannot go play in the Gates zones effectively. Just grinding exp. or AAs is NOT fun...grouping in a new area would have been , but I don't get invited to groups for Gates zones. I will not call it GoD...cause no god would so hate one of his children so badly that he would leave them behind  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
There should be an option for already HAVE an alt(or three) and will or might just start playing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I have a level 52 Shaman with 1 AA (and proud of it :-)). When I group I usually slow, debuff, buff the meleers, haste the meleers when we don't have an Enchanter, use dogdog for additional DPS, backup heal and root-park adds. At this level, meleers love HoS, Sta, Agi and haste. Everyone loves to be SoWed and the meleers prefer Bih'Li over other group SoWs due to the additional attack bonus. I'm not a MH by any stretch of the imagination but being able to apply a quick Superior Heal to keep the MT alive before CH kicks in is constantly appreciated by the whole group. I am perfectly happy doing this and no one I have grouped with has ever thought otherwise.  When you think about it, that is a lot of stuff to do and, with canny and a reasonable pull rate, I can usually keep this up almost indefinitely without KEI or a mount. I can't think of any class that can do as much as this. Admittedly, dogdog isn't the best DPS, Ench haste is better, Shammy heals suck compared to Cleric and Druid heals, and so on, but you get all this in one package with a Shaman! I can also solo well in areas like Dulak, buff for donations in PoK and have a class specific skill (Alchemy) whose products are in demand. In short, I love my Shaman at this level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still surf the messageboards because, as a professional programmer working in the games industry, I'm fascinated by what is happening to EQ.<br />
<br />
Hummmmm I used to be fascinated, EQ has been a really nice game, but recently, I just couldn't stand with the way SOE treat their customers, so I decided to have a break.<br />
Could someone tell me why it took them so much time to consider answering our proposal for shaman improvements after so many feedback ?<br />
<br />
Also, look at the mage canni pet fix ( good or bad thing, it isn't the point ), they fixed it without a word, and when they got caught by magicians on test server they said: &quot;Oh canni pet isn't working as intended, we are removing it, but we will refund your Improved Reclaim energy AA ( AA that wasn't used for canni pet, so once again, are they playing the same game than us ? )&quot; they also said that mage might have a compensation in the GoD expansion, mage are still waiting for the compensation, and they finally said that they had to fix canni pet in order to make their pet more powerfull ( ie more HP ), here again mage are still waiting.<br />
<br />
Now about shamans, didn't they say they were currently working on our healing abilities in order to come back to our priest role with GoD ? The BoT change makes me think that we are on the same boat than mages, and that we will still be waiting untill the end of EQ.<br />
They just know a lot of us won't play EQ2, but the old reputation of EQ may be enough to get new players for EQ2, and this way, changing their customers, so why bothering with us ?<br />
<br />
Heh, so why giving them money if they don't consider you ? That's what I did by clicking End billing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Unbelievable how many people can sit and find ways to bitch about a &lt;i&gt;video game&lt;/i&gt; as if it's all that's important in their life.  As if the condition of a freakin' class inside a freakin' video game has any relevance to their individual well-being.  You people make the game unenjoyable all by yourself.  It's only what you take out of it or what you make of it.  There is a ton of fun to be had in EQ if you just sat back and relaxed.  EverRaid?  Excuse me, raiding takes up about 2% of my play-time.  Customer service sucks?  More like &quot;customers suck&quot;.  I've submitted 2 petitions in the past half a year and both were responded to within an hour.  And they were friendly both times.  You guys don't even provide instances of when customer service sucked... you just say &quot;customer service sucks&quot;.  Well, that's it: I'm sold!  Just 'cause you said it was, I gotta believe it.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I don't ever want someone to retire their shaman, but this is getting out of hand.  If these piddly reasons are all you need to quit a class then perhaps it's best you did move on.<br />
<br />
My two main characters are classes that have perhaps the most whiny members I've ever seen.  Between the Shaman's Crucible and Monkly Business you'd think that a meteor was on a collision-course for Earth.  To most &quot;EQ-guru&quot; standards, I play two characters that are &quot;broken beyond repair&quot;, yet I still enjoy my monk and shaman immensely despite the millions of short-comings pointed out to me on a daily basis.  In-game I have a lot of fun and I don't run across this ****.  Come on to these forums and you have to sift through the lemming masses spouting the end is near.  Jeezus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Chairman Meow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I have been playing Chairman as my main since April 2002.  I have no intention of switching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">When people put as much time into something as they have into EQ, they become passionate about it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the only part of that passion Sony understands is the &quot;they will continue to pay us monthly&quot; part. They do not understand the need for prompt and complete CS, they do not understand the need to fix bugs promptly. They do not understand most of the classes. Shaman are not alone in being ignored on key things in the game. Shaman have sucked at healing for years. Even when they gave Druids and shaman better heals, the shaman version was a red headed bastard step child in that line. The apparent logic was that shaman had slows. Which were then promptly mitigated to hell and back. Shaman need better nukes and better heals. We also need better pets.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I must say this, and I doubt there will be any disputing it. They completely and totally have the BILL THAT MOFO PROMPTLY part down! I know there is a bigshot at SOE thats running around the office every 20 minutes screaming, &quot;SHOW ME THE MONEY!!! SHOW ME THE MONEY!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

They build them how they want them to be, and most likely read moronic crap spewed forth on these forums with a smile on their face when some moron says &quot;shamans need an unresistable slow&quot;.  Do any of you really understand what it takes to operate a game of this magnitude?  You think it's 30 college interns picking their noses and throwing paper airplanes?

<br />
You are in a thread asking if &quot;you have deleted your shaman&quot; and those who have and posted added parting remarks that are not favorable to the game. What did you expect? Perhaps: &quot;Killa had all his spells including the ones from the next 2 expansions, 5000 aas and 4 sets of Time gear that could all be worn at the same time. I was having so much fun playing EQ it was just time to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
So ranting and getting worked up at those who have issues does nothing but make you look like the SOE PR poster boy. As I said, relax.<br />
<br />
You are enjoying the game still. That is a good thing. So are others ... like the ones not posting on this thread. Others are not having fun or lost the fun and quit ... yet linger on the various boards out of habit or some lingering nastaliga. Their comments are not etched in tablets that Moses will bring down the mountain to share with us. They are just comments.<br />
<br />
Posts I have made on other threads likely taint me a complainer since I am strongly in favor of being compensated for our nerfs. That said, there are times I still get a kick out of this game in ways I never considered. Example: 3 65 shaman are last standing in an MB raid attempt. MB is trying to beat on all of us and doing minimal damage. Whoever is not getting beat on is casting Q on ones getting hit. This switched aggro to the healer and roles reversed. Of course we were doing no damage, just - at this point - playing and laughing our collective butts off. Eventually we all loaded gate and left.<br />
<br />
3 shaman dancing with MB for a good 5 minutes with no loss and no gain. Very memorable event. Everyone has these special memories whether they happened in Crushbone or Time. It is the draw and addiction of EQ for most folks ... the unexpected and entertaining.<br />

After the time spent in this game and finally reaching the point where that charm and fun is gone makes you quit it is only natural, I think, to leave with a bitter taste. Ranting at those who have that bitter taste is kinda wasta time. Odds are, when you do leave the game, you also will have done so feeling a bit miffed.</div></div><hr />

I'll post here with my opinion, if only to show that there are actually people out there who enjoy the game in it's present state so that people don't come here and think that every shaman in the game hates the game.<br />

Sony didn't create the original game, but the classes that we have today are not at all similar to the classes we knew when Verant ran the show.  hdaana, you act like patches and expansions were so much smoother when Verant ran the show, and I only have one question for ya: what game are you playing?</div></div><hr />
