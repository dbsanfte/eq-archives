<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit lvl 42 as an iksar shaman. I am wondering what I should look to do, equip-wise. I have about 2k right now, but the pp seems to come pretty easily at this point. I will consider spending about 5k, as I should have about that much within a lvl or 2.<br />
<br />
Currently, My ac is 832 unbuffed and I have 1118 hp(haven't updated magelo in a couple days)<br />
<br />
My options, as I see them are to get a REIF. I do like to solo roughly half my exp time, so I assume this would make a big diff. Can someone give me an idea as to how much of a difference this upgrade would make? I can get a fungi staff(don't have epic boots atm, and don't really plan on it before lvl 50) Upgrade my general gear. I imagine I could get over 1300 hp and 900 ac if I spent 5k on upgrades. I play on ant bayle server, and the prices here are really low. I could get a pair of schw for about 2k, would this help me much soloin? I wouldn't think so, but I know some of you use haste items so I am lookin for some feedback.<br />
<br />
I am trying to get people together to go to orcs in ew to try for some ry/gorr, as about half of it is an upgrade. I imagine that I will be there within 3 lvls. I am aware that hate ikky shm armor is really nice. Should I just try to get up to hate a bunch at 46 and get some of that?<br />
<br />
Also, I haven't found a really good place to hunt yet so I am open to suggestions. Lookin for good exp, and some decent loot if possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rygorr gear is decent.<br />
You can look into getting a group together to hunt in Skyshrine and hope to get some Sentry armor.<br />
Iksar planar armor is gross in how good it is compared to other races' shaman planar armor.  You could just wait for the 3 more levels, and go raiding hate and getting your set in few trips.  That's my vote.  There's so few Iksar shaman around that probably every drop will be yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I vote for the fungi staff, or (if you want to bump up your budget a bit) a horse.<br />
<br />
Unlike the REIF or a little bit better AC, the staff should make a big contribution in both group and solo situations.  More regen = more mana and less downtime- and you don't really need the epic boots to be effective (let you in on a little secret- I still haven't bothered getting around to getting mine!  The snare speed isn't that bad, and you can always just root and step back.)<br />
<br />
My other suggestion is to think about a horse.  As far as I'm concerned (and maybe I'm just a newb being only 49) the big three (jbb, epic, fungi) should be expanded to &quot;the big four&quot; to include a horse.  Constantly medding while standing and casting is huge.  When grouped, you don't need to sit down (and get aggro) to med.  While solo'ing, the additional mana drastically reduced downtime.  Note, though, that medding while standing only seems to work if you're not moving and not swinging a weapon (great for JBB'ing, or root-rotting for handbags.)  The cheapest horse costs 8399 pp to buy, sells back for 7619 pp, and works mostly in outdoor zones.<br />

On the horse issue, a friend of mine ran the numbers and here's what she got, I haven't checked the math, but sure sounds solid: <br />
&quot;I take back all the nasty horrible things I've said about horses! (although they are still a huge pain in the tail). <br />
<br />
I Spent a few hours playing around with mine yesterday running oom/canni-torporing to full etc comparing mana regen times and erm.... <br />
<br />
For a shaman its an FT20 item outdoors.... <br />
<br />
Pre torpor its also a bonus bit of regen whilst you are chewing away. <br />
<br />
Some numbers.... <br />
<br />
Both runs were from total oom (not enough mana to cast root) and full hps to fom and full hps, only mind buff was potg (a little less than clarity 1) and I have ~3k mana / 2.9k hps. <br />
<br />
5 mins 1 second on foot. <br />
<br />
3 mins 53 seconds on horse back. =)&quot; <br />
<br />
EDIT to credit Sebazy for the calculations. /cheer<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't tested it myself, but if this is anywhere near accurate we're talking about a Flowing Thought 20 item for 8.4k (that you can sell back to the vendor for 90% of that if you change your mind.)  Definitely bears consideration.<br />
<br />
As for hunting spots, I did the FV giant camp (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=13258) through much of the 40's, and loved it!<br />
<br />
Good hunting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the comments, gives me some things to think about. Not sure on the horse, as I try to hunt indoors when I am grouping, I think that the staff would be of more help at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maias Lonewolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not sure what you've upgraded so here are some suggestions.<br />
<br />
Sentry Bracer 9ac 3dex 2 wis/int 2svm 5 svp/d 15 mana/hp <br />
and are tradeable so you won't have to hunt to SS and if your on dragon faction<br />
<br />
Kylong Gaunts 12 ac 4wis/agi 2svm/d<br />
Iksars and the only shaman that can use these.<br />
<br />
Coldain skin boots, or even the Iksar quest boots would be an upgrade. Seb scale, and the Kormiff Miltary leg quest (if it's not broken again) are also options. Shoulders Tattered mantle or Chokiai hide spauldres would be good.<br />
<br />
I soloed the Great Oowomp from 40-45. Five minute repop and as long as you resist his scrouge you should be fine. His rare drops are Chipped bone bracres, and Batskull earrings which still sell ok on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I were choosing between the fungi staff and a REIF, I would go fungi staff. I had a REIF, and I admit, it was a great weapon both with and without the proc, but its usefulness pales in comparison with the benefits of regrowth. Put that on top of your natural regen and you should never go OOM unless the **** really hits the fan. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, fate decided my direction. I was out exping in cc(really like that zone) and was also in the server-wide buy/sell channel. Noticed a post stationg only &quot;rune etched icewurm fang&quot; So I sent a tell asking what he is looking for. He replies with basically, I don't like selling stuff, what do you offer? So I tell him that I have only 2k to my name(the truth) he says &quot;where are you?&quot; Long story short, I got the fang for 2K!! Couldn't believe it. I was really happy, and I really love the weap, makes a big difference. <br />
<br />
As a side note, been getting pcs for a post nerf fungi at around 15k. If this is correct, gonna skip that.</div></div><hr />
