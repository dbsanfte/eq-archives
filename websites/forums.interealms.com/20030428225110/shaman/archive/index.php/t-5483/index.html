<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So... 11 PM CET, i was thinking on doing 2 things....<br />
<br />
1. Go to bed<br />
2. Petition for the bugged Avatar scroll... (had a petition in earlier on this, but there were only a Guide online then, so he said I had to send an email or contact a GM later.)<br />
<br />
I sent email 4 days ago - no response so far...<br />
<br />
I chose number 2...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I sent in my petition around 11:15 PM... started logging a bit later...<br />
<br />
I had already checked when i sent in my petition that both a GM-Admin and a Senior-Guide were online...<br />
<br />
<br />
[Sun Sep 15 23:41:01 2002] Logging to 'eqlog.txt' is now *ON*.<br />
[Sun Sep 15 23:41:55 2002] (Newbie 1) says, 'Hail, Hagaan'<br />
[Sun Sep 15 23:43:01 2002] (Newbie 2) tells you, 'Can you buff me PLZ if you would i am at the gate'<br />
