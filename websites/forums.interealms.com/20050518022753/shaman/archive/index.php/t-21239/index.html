<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all. I am now a level 9 Froglok Shaman on Stromm. I know that high end, Shaman suck. I do not plan going to the high end, as I will be playing EQ2 after I obtain my first ever epic (I think, after 4 months, I have FINALLY found my class). Even if I do continue on, many of these problems are likely to be fixed. What is the main role of a Shaman besides slowing? Any other Shaman information will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The best thing you could ever do is find someone to play with, a melee character preferably, but other class can work very well too.<br />
<br />
If you are not planning on racing to 65 then your buffs can and will be usefull for a long time.<br />
<br />
Maybe find a druid or wizard to play with too to get around easier and escape from bad situations. And a cleric to round out your group. You can do a lot of thing with that setup.<br />
<br />
If you have to solo some of the time be sure to keep your defense up by going head to head with some melee mobs as you level. This should keep your weaponskill up too. From 1 to 50 shamans can contribute some to fights by meleeing. And with the weapons available for cheap in the bazaar nowadays its even better.<br />
<br />
Find some quests that will keep you busy. When you get high enough you can do Nurga and later Droga where there are lots of items available through quests and killing there will get you good faction in Chardok which in itself opens up some interesting quests.<br />
<br />
Most importantly have fun - and dont grow too attached to your shaman because there is a big risk that you will someday feel like you are not contributing enough hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To answer your question a shaman is a debuffer / backup healer pretty much with the ocassional damage thrown in here and there ( this is a basic explanation. Ultimately its however you want to play the class and also depends on group makeup . but Shaman is versatile in the fact it can do many things and pretty much adapt to most situations. have fun play around with what you like and enjoy. But dont forget your a priest so healing is in your future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">first off, gimme back my city, GROBB!!!!!!....jk :)<br />
<br />
<br />
but seriously, shaman are a fun class and like others have said, probably the best class for adapting to situations.  It all depends on how you want to play tho.  When i first started Phats, it was because my guild needed shaman.  So 2 of my friends and myself all started our shams.  We all agreed on what our roles would be once we were all high enough lvl to raid with the guild, one too dps (dots/nukes), one too healing, and I took buffing.  The plan didnt work out exactly the way we wanted, but i did notice that we all played our shams differently.  I tend to like grping as i like to keep on my toes, while both of my friends like to solo, they like controling all aspects of thier kills.  It all depends on how you want to play, but you have chosen a very respected class, in a many different aspects of the game.  Blessings to you young Heyokah.<br />

<br />
This is a very true and important difference to note my young shaman frog.<br />
<br />
Engrain it in your mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
On to your role... well thats in question greatly right now. The thing is, shaman are very flexible and can fit in different ways, so let me just state what i feel.<br />
<br />
Shaman are primarily a debuff and buff class, we can heal also, but are not exactly the best in the game.<br />
<br />
I guess that about sums it up, thought i had more to say =)<br />
<br />
Good luck on your adventures through norrath.</div></div><hr />

OMG ... Fuda, I want that in my sig!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've solo'ed and basically group ed with at least one person the last 58 levels.<br />
<br />
My main playing partner is a lvl53 Paladin, and we do very well together (even better when fighting undead).  And now that my latest heal does somthing, we plan on being a little more daring.<br />
<br />
So having a playing partner helps a ton.  SK's and Paly's are great as partners because they can grab aggro like no one's business, they can heal themselves (we can heal, but a few levels after each heal level the heal is already wearing thin).<br />
<br />
Gotta say, coming from a rogue (who is still my main), the power of a shaman to solo and add group utility is AMAZING!</div></div><hr />
