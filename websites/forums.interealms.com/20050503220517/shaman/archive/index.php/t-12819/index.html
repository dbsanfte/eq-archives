<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gruel Dorfbeater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It depends on where you have the opportunity to hunt.  If you are in a fairly nice guild that can get you flags, then go for 65 and worry about AA later.  If, however, you are in a small guild with limited access to flags, then my suggestion is to stay 60 and get AA's.<br />
<br />
The question you would need to ask yourself is can you realistically get AA exp at 65... if the answer is yes... then level as fast as you can :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go for levels.  Levels mean more hps, more mana, less resists.  Crank out to 65, then kick back and go for AA, you won't regret it.<br />

I was a big advocate for staying 61 and burning AAs... but nowadays I'm not much of an xper... I like exploration, tackling difficult quests, etc.  The levels really help and it's nice to have a 20% buffer in 65 not really caring too much if you die, and really only needing to worry about building up your AAs now.  Also, being 65 meant being able to get Quiescence and Malos--  not having to waste 55k on Malo first...</div></div><hr />

I group all the time with a SK friend of mine that is 45 also at 65 will there be places for us to duo toghter and hunt if not flagged ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Realistically, going past 60 or 61 severely cuts down on your hunting options without flags.  I'm now PoV/PoS enabled, and I still hunt more often in tier 1 than 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">u wont even be able to get to 65 without being flagged really :-/</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's just my path though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got about 15-20 AAs before leveling to 65 when PoP first came out, you can get some really good AA experience in PoV at lvl 60.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the first shaman in my guild to reach 65 did so all in Tier one.  He swore by the Castle in PoD and Consorts in PoN.<br />
<br />
On topic though, I personally am 61 and stopping until I get MGB for raids, and Cani 5.  After that I am going on to 65.  When I group with 65's in my guild there is a noticable difference in my AA exp speed and theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On paper, it might look better to stop at 61 and do AA for a long time, then get to 65 later.  In reality, though, 65 is much better.  Those 4 levels really do make a big difference in your overall effectiveness.  In addition to this, people are more reluctant to group with you if you are only 61 or 62.  You are not really carrying your weight.  65 spells are all over the market now, and for reasonable (I laugh at the people that said &quot;I will never have my 65 spells because I am not in a big guild&quot; a few months ago) prices.  You want those spells.  I had canni5 and MGB before pop came out, but not even canni5 would be worth stopping for.  Canni5 is 23 AA, assuming you start with 0.  That is about like going from 61 to 64, I believe.  You ultimate goal should be: &quot;level 65 AND canni5&quot; and you will reach that goal faster if you do the levels first.<br />
<br />
Also, I would like to add:  I have NEVER met someone who stopped at 61 to do AA, and has anywhere near as many AA as me.  Most of them have in to 20's or 30's.  If you are level 61 and have over 102 AA (that you mostly earned since pop came out), please tell me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The way I did it, waqs 90% exp till 61, then 50% exp to 65....   Once I got one yellow in 65, I changed to 10% till I got a yellow and a half, then 0%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">At 61 I grouped with a 65 wiz in my guild and we kited frogs in PoS.<br />
<br />
He got 8% aa per solo kill.  Grouped, I got 5%, he got 4%.  So AA is about 20% faster at 61 than 65.<br />
<br />
However, quies, Fo7, FA, etc, all kick a lot of butt...I'd say stop at 61 for run3, regen3, MC3, and canni, then roll on to 65.<br />
<br />
I muddled around and got RC1 and SCM2 before I hit 65, and I don't regret it at all.  In retrospect, I should've gotten ND or CA first, but it was primarily the break from that ponderously slow regular exp that I needed, to feel like I was getting somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">65 aa spent, and finally letting myself get the last 1% real exp to ding 63 today.  Without the spells, I just don't feel right leveling.  Only really letting myself ding because I bought malosinia and tears of saryn, and we're almost done with BoT keys.<br />
<br />
It's really about the flags.  Once I had access to the zones where I could get my spells, I felt justified in leveling.  I don't regret the aa for one minute.<br />
<br />
As for buying the last round of spells, I'm not likely to have the 80k for quiescience any time soon, and I haven't even SEEN malos for sale.  :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At 60 I went straight aa to get Canni V.  Then once I got my level 61 spells I leveled to 61.  Same at 62.  I agree with Laughing Woman.  Until I have the $$$ to buy level 63 &amp; up spells or have access to where the parchments drop, why level?  Currently holding at 62, going 100% aa &amp; working on getting flagged for tier 3 zones &amp; making $$$ to buy the spells, IF I see them for sale.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's all where you hunt, really.<br />
<br />
61 is a sweet spot for AAxp.  PoS/PoV are letting xp just fly by.  My (very small) guild's not hunting anywhere beyond that at the moment, so this is working well for me.  I finally have my spells for 62, so the lure of the new heal is now fighting with the realization that I'll be stuck single-casting Focus of Soul and Endurance of the Boar all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't have a guild and don't have flags and I keep going back and forth between 60 and 61.<br />
<br />
I have 66 aaxp mostly earned at 53.<br />
<br />
I have no intention of leveling out of the 60 / 61 area untill I get flags / spells but I also have no great desire to get flags.<br />
<br />
I personaly don't realy care that much about having a guild anymore.  I just play for fun with some friends and do some exploring / grinding / farming / questing depending on mood.  Advice about what level to do your aaxp at is all very dependant on your situation and how you like to play EQ and what parts of the game you like to participate in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would say depends on your situation as well.  For me it was mostly about spells and access to them.  I came back to the game a week before PoP and had no AAs, so I worked on AAs to CannV, leveled to 61 (had most of my 61 &amp; 62 spells by this time) and worked on the trial of execution, I believe its easier at 61 with new pet and dd.<br />
<br />
Leveled to 63 becase I got flagged for HoH and started getting some spectral drops (and they started showing up in bazaar), stopped and worked on AAs again for a bit, getting RC1 and SCR3 (nothing like an 1800hp Torpor! and longer lasting buffs, less buffing=good).  <br />
<br />
Soon afterward finished my BoT key and guild is close to breaking in to a few other planes.  Now that I have a few 63 and 64 spells and prices are dropping every day on 65 spells in the bazaar (Q40k, Malos20k, Saryrn18k, FAvatar25k, 7th60k) Im going to go ahead and level to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Q40k, Malos20k, Saryrn18k, FAvatar25k, 7th60k<br />
<br />
Compared to terris:<br />
Q - about the same<br />
Malos - yours is hella lower<br />
Saryn - *shrug* never even paid attention to it<br />
FA - 15k tops on mine<br />
fo7 - Think it's still 90k, I could be wrong though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Spells are the limiting factor to me. Sure, I'll get more hp, more mana and less resists if I level to 65, but I'm getting big gains from my AA points too (canni V, SCR3, MGB, VP1, SC1, RC1) and they go nice and fast fighting even con mobs in PoV. <br />
<br />
I'm sticking at 62 until I get my BoT key finished, and start seeing speccy parchments dropping. To buy all my 63-64 spells on AB would cost in the region of 60-100k total (I saw group boar for 45k, ***!). Level 65 spells a further ~150k-200k. That's not money I'm willing to spend.<br />
<br />
As for being easier to get a group at 65 - I don't have much of a problem lfg in PoV/PoS at 62. I've got the fast heal, and can cast all the same buffs as a 65 shaman except quiesence, just takes a little longer but I never call down time because of it.<br />
<br />
Frankly the only spell that really excites me above 62 is quiessence. Group boar and Fo7 will be nice, but not game-changing. So I'll stay at 62 for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Get to 61/62 at least.  If you want to play with AA's, go ahead from there, especially if you are not pov/pos or better flagged.  I stayed 62 (with pos/pov flag) until I got a BoT flag, then moved on to 65 (took less than 2 weeks, isn't that hard to get to).  At 65 you'll have a MUCH easier time getting a group (again, if you're hunting in pov or better) than if you are lower.</div></div><hr />
