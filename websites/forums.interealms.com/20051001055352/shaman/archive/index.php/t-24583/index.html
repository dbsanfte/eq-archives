<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried it and to my expectation, I failed.   Actually I tried it 2 times.<br />
<br />
The First Time I buffed pet with FoS, Str, Haste, sow.  I had Virtue, Kei, All of my melee buffs, regen, haste, sow , etc.   The fight started. I pulled with Malo,  Ran back, only 1 mob came.  I slowed but the slow was resisted once it reached me.   CRAP talking about walking thru me with easy.  The Golem chewed me and spit me out.  It inturupted my slow 2 more times.  My hp is half or near half.  I  step back to let wolf pet take the aggro, it worked.  I re-slowed, it stuck. I rooted the mob.  My now my pet has been shredded to scooby snacks.    I healed pet, healed myself, root on the mob faded so I re-rooted the Golem mob, but wait, I Still had me targeted.  I'm now rooted.   Root on mob now convieniently faded and  the mob takes off after me, before it can reach me I gate.   <br />
<br />
I restarted the Process, determined to LVl my self up to lvl 64.  I pulled mob with slow this time.  I was resisted.  I re-attempted to slow, it resisted again.  IT hits me and interupts the crap out of me.  I let puppy take aggro but the mob follows me for a bit then puppy takes aggro. I re- Malo but that was resisted.  I re slow and that sticks. My Wolf pet is shreded again and is near death. I healed my pet then noticed hey I was shreded so I healed my self, rooted the mob and began hitting the mob with Pox, Bane. I set up my lizzy which only runs at the slowest speed.  Dang my pet is already almost dead?  (by now some of you may be asking why didnt you call back the pet?  I am using a UI that doesnt give you all the pet options.  I havent figured out how to get all the bank window, pet windows, merchant, Voice macros, etc to work yet)  I re-healed my pet,   began to canni, 4, but wait , my DoTs are fading.  Re-applied, and began to canni 4 again.  Im less then 1/4 mana, so I do Canni 5.  OH NICE I have some mana, thats a good thing, as Root fades, and the mob comes over to say hi once more.  It triple hits me, stunning me, I began to melee a bit, but realized, My mana cant take to much more of this.  I do need to canni but without HP canni is no good.  Melee anyway, giving my pet a break from the massive back lashing the golem gave to the wolf.  I Torped my self but realized the Dmg I was taking was above the HP I was getting healed.  I had to do a quick heal.   I did a quick heal which worked great. By now my Hp is near Max.  I continue to melee the golem.  DoTs fade, I re-applied them only to realize, I didnt have the mana to do the second DoT.  I attempt to re-root, it stuck  I backed up, Root faded, I reapplied, it stuck I backed up, Root faded, I re-applied it was resisted.<br />
<br />
By now I know I dont have enough HP to Canni, I dont have enough mana to keep DoTing, The mobs health is alittle below 1/2 and I am worn to crap.  I gated, hince ending the nightmare.<br />
<br />
I'm sure some of you level 65 to lvl 70s out there are just chuckling away and for good reason.  Point out the errors, what you would have pulled with and when to use what.  I didnt nuke at all.  Didnt think it was mana safe, wanted mana to last longer.  All of this is while I was lvl  63.  In fact I am currently lvl 63 but I am 4% from level 64 so I went ahead and marked my shaman up to 64. Currently my Wis unbuffed is 246.  Buffed I am around 266+ Wis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It sounds like you had a really bad run of resists to me.  I also noticed that you said at one point Malo resisted (it's unresistable), so I am thinking you were using Malosinia?  I would try again starting with Malo, then run and get some room between you and Golem, then try Turgur's.  I know there isn't much room to run there, but if you can keep him from damaging you until you get him slowed, that will give you the best results.  I would then use mount for mana and cast Malosinia to get the Golem's resists to the abolute lowest, then you may want to use your Disease resist debuff so you can use those DoT's.  Now I would probably root the Golem and step back to apply DoT's.  I would almost recommend not using your pet and just root rotting them, because 500+ hits are a little rough for Torpor to refresh even with Turgur's, so you really don't want to fight them toe to toe, but I could be wrong.  <br />
<br />
I've never solo'd a Crystalline Golem, but those would be my recommendations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hello Sudancia<br />
<br />
I have soloed about 20 AA's at the PoV golems, but I started at lvl 65 so it was easier for me.<br />
<br />
What I do is root&amp;rot all the way. Pull with malos and follow up with root and turgurs. Back away from the golem, summon horse and start dotting (Breath of Ultor, Blood of Saryrn, Bane and Anathema) - only dots that does not break root. As you are too low to cast several of these spells, it will take longer time for you.<br />
I recast root very frequently. I always use our lvl 14 Root spell. It is cheap to cast, short cast time and I find that the higher level root spells are broken just as often, so no gain from casting the more expensive roots.<br />
<br />
My preferred camp is LC (might be called something else on other servers). Get into golem land, turn left and turn around the corner. There are 6 golems - all single pulls at lvl 65.<br />
<br />
Forget the pet. Even our best pet buffed with Focus of Soul can go down in no time if the golem hits for max. The pet is waste of mana when soloing hard hittest like these.<br />
If your AC was high enough for you to tank the golem, the pet would be a help, but as you are lvl 63 I guess that is not the case.<br />

<br />
You are aware that you can type in pet commands right?<br />
/pet attack<br />
/pet report health<br />
/pet back off<br />
/pet guard here<br />
/pet taunt off<br />
<br />
There are a few more but those are the basics. Thats how we had to control pets a long time ago before they had their own UI. A Mage was my very first character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd look into getting VP3, Sud. Really helps the root/rot approach, especially if you disease debuff first. As has been said above, I'd personally not bother siccing Dogdog on the golems in Valor.<br />
<br />
When I was 62-63 or so, it was almost unheard of to get a slow bounce after Malo had landed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">a) make sure you have SoW.<br />

b) pull with Malicious Decay.<br />

<br />
Now mob is rooted with a timer, and won't break root ~90% of the time.<br />
<br />
Debuff, slow (for when it breaks root) and then pile on the dots.<br />
<br />
Thats it.  I understand you don't have VP, but thats the key.  Get VP before you spend another AA.<br />
<br />
Don't use your pet, he can't take a hit.  And get it rooted before you get it slowed.</div></div><hr />

I have soloed several AA using just this technique.  Works perfectly.  The duration of VP1 is sufficient to get the golem maloed, slowed and dotted.  Ornate pants, with clickie root, make the rest of this encounter even easier.  I alternate between canni and root, refreshing dots as they come due.  One canni v after the intial burst, and I end the battle full health, ful mana and ready for another.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I could have sworn I posted this already in another thread, but here it is again.  I levelled from 61-63 almost exclusively on these puppies.<br />
<br />
I am assuming you do NOT have VP3.  No pet.  SOW on.  Go to the NE corner of the zone, where you have plenty of wall space to kite on.<br />
<br />
Pull with Malo/Malos at maximum range (unresistable).<br />
<br />
Run directly to wall while spell gems are refreshing.<br />
<br />
Root the mob.  I use the level 14 plain ole root for 30 mana.  I usually turn to face the mob for a very practical reason - if I wait until I have turned to face, then I have been in that spot long enough that I won't get a spell interruption.  You should be able to root the mob before it gets to you, but I have VERY rarely had a root resisted after Malo/s was already in.  If you get a resist or interruption, just start running again along the wall and start over.<br />
<br />
Apply Malosi/nia.  It should land in 1-2 tries since Malo/s is already on.  This little bit of extra insurance lowers the MR a bit more and makes root stick a little better.<br />
<br />
Apply Turgur's and DR debuffer.<br />
<br />
Apply the DOTs that do not break root - Breath of Ultor, Blood of Saryryn, Bane/Anathema/Odium, Epic, whatever you have.  I always apply epic first because hey, it's free, and because you have to get REAL close to the mob to apply it.  After epic, retreat to maximum cast range to give yourself more time to react on a root break.  Refresh Root every once in a while, it only lasts 60 seconds.<br />
<br />
Now either just refresh your non-breaking DOTs if you have enough of them or start applying the root-breakers.  In either case, when root breaks you run away until your spells are refreshed and you have a good lead on the mob, then turn and root.  I heartily recommend the slower, more mana-efficient disease-based DOTs since the longer run time means less breaking of root when you have to recast compared to poison DOTs.<br />
<br />
I do not use a horse when root-rotting with regular Root since it is so unreliable and I may need to run at any time.  At all times while casting, have your fingers on the D key to interrupt your cast if root breaks, and reroot.  If you are at max cast range you can reroot before the mob gets to you.  If you have JUST cast the spell when root breaks, you may have to run away until the spell gems refresh.<br />
<br />
If you have VP, pull with DR debuffer instead and root with VP, but have regular root up as well since golems WILL break VP.</div></div><hr />

One problem for him, and anyone 61-63 is that the first 3 dots you listed are not available until 64 and 65 :(  I think it is still doable with root breaking DoT's, but you will probably have to do alot more kiting with those spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You beat me to the punch, I can't even find the lists of shaman spells that list all of these spell.  I have onoy seen a small handful of some of the spells you mention.  (Breath of Ultor, Blood of Saryryn, Bane)  Bane is a Extreme rare find in the bazaar, I think I have only seen it maybe, possible 1 time.   Anathema/Odium, Epic, I NEVER see in the bazar.  Obviously the epic is a quest that I have started.  I am on part 7 of the epic.  I now have a lvl 59 monk (who crit at 726 not 2 days ago, IM SO HAPPY) and my shaman which is NOW lvl 64 and has 4  1/2 yellows till lvl 65.  I tend to 2 box these 2 from time to time in Nadox.<br />
<br />
In my magelo link I do have the spells I have listed.  If you like plz use that list as to what is good to use for solo.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Just found out Bane is a LDON spell, no drop.  I must have seen another type of a Bane spell in Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">on slow nights I would solo a few of these in between groups if inner/outter were taken. this was at 61 with no real AAs except canni 5. just pulled with malo. ran to the wall and casted root or kited til it stuck. then would lay on malicious decay and plauge. then swap MD and plague for BoN and pox. then just reapply/swap as needed. takes awhile but better then wasteing time looking for a group. resist rate on slow was probably about 50% of the time. less if I cast malosini. mana isnt that big of an issue, unless it breaks root a lot or I get a ton of resists.<br />
<br />
for fun sometimes Id pull and cast spirit call and get it rooted/debuffed while the dogs get smacked on. might as well use the skill eh? =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jhaiisiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Real quick note on those spells that were mentioned...  Breath of Ultor and Blood of Saryryn are the only two you'll maybe find in the bazaar.  Bane (not Bane of Nife) is an LDoN Spell for around 650 points or so in East Commons.  Anathema and Odium are lower versions of that spell. Anathema is 410 points in Butcherblock, and I can't remember where Odium is, but part of me wants to say one of the Ro's...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">and I can't remember where Odium is, but part of me wants to say one of the Ro's...<br />
<br />
South Ro :)  72 points.  Just got it this past weekend by chance and it is a handy little spell in addition to Anathema.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nazbab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks, guys for giving me this tactic.  As a 65 shaman on Maelin, I was able to solo here the last couple nights and got something like 5% aa per kill...with one kill every 6 mins or so.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">True that at 61-63 you won't have most of the non-root-breaking DOTs.  However, the technique I listed doesn't require them; I just mentioned where to use them if you do have them.  If you're 65 and have Breath/Blood/Bane you probably don't need to use the root-breakers; if you're 61 you will certainly need them.  Obviously, I did not have them when I levelled from 61-63 on the golems.<br />
<br />
A range extension item is very useful for this business, btw.  Ceramic Sword of Valor is a fairly reasonably priced option that you can buy in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm sure I'm repeating alot of stuff here.<br />
First off. Yea.. ditch the pet, he's hardly a speed bump. The golemns hit pretty hard for doggy and your healing power is better spent on dots. If you have suspend minion, it wouldn't hurt to summon pet buff with hp's for emergencys.<br />
Second try to get anethema and odium, both are great dots (as long as there not resisted).<br />
Like everyone else said. Root Rott. Borring yes.. but unless you can pair up with a decent tank it's not worth doing it any other way. Alot of people said use the lvl 14 root, while I liked it alot vs any other root before 62 for it's fast casting time and low mana use, Greater Immobilize is much better. It has a -30 resist adjust on it ( http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3195&amp;source=Test ) paired with malo/malosiX makes for a dependable root. Or if you have ornate pants it's that much better.<br />
And from there pull with Malo and root rott.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just general tactics for any zone:<br />
The First Time I buffed pet with FoS, Str, Haste, sow.  I had Virtue, Kei, All of my melee buffs, regen, haste, sow , etc.   The fight started. I pulled with Malo,  Ran back, only 1 mob came.  I slowed but the slow was resisted once it reached me.It inturupted my slow 2 more times. I Still had me targeted.  I'm now rooted.<br />
<br />
1st, pet doesn't need str/haste/sow. Pet is good to take a round. Ie if mob is running at you and you send dog in, he will hit the dog 1 round, and buy you at least a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Regen/Sow = good, haste = bad, you will not be meleeing.<br />
<br />
Pulled with malo good. Slow next = bad. Always root. completely debuff, slow if you want to. <br />
<br />
When mob is on top of you, do not try to channel stuff, run away, that's what sow is for.<br />
<br />
Don't root yourself :) comes with experience.<br />
<br />
I pulled mob with slow this time.<br />
<br />
Never ever do that. Only use malos or MD. <br />
<br />
began to canni, 4, but wait , my DoTs are fading.  Re-applied, and began to canni 4 again.  Im less then 1/4 mana, so I do Canni 5.<br />
<br />
What is your rush in reapplying w/o having mana? I would rather just reroot and wait until I am comfortable enough.<br />
<br />
I began to melee a bit, but realized, My mana cant take to much more of this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">They dont hit as hard as the golems, and spend a fair bit of time casting. They summon though, so root rotting isnt an option.<br />
<br />
I agree with the malo first, then root, then slow, then dot dot dot.<br />
<br />
Oh, yes and ruppy puppy is a convenient waste of time.<br />
<br />
If you have lots of mojo, one of them snare hammers, and the mob is getting low, and you feel like some fun, sure run in there and smack it a few times then run away quickly.<br />
<br />
If snare lands you can save yourself a dot or two, but its a pretty risky strategy, and only worth doing if you have a pockett cleric 8)<br />
<br />
There used to be some area's in pov where mobs would have trouble walking up the walls, but you in bear form run up them like they are nadda. but that was wurms near the entrance.<br />
<br />
I reckon you would get better xp in oow than pov. In WOS you may be able to malo, slow then cripple. Although resists there are fairly steep.<br />
<br />
Should be able to get into a Nobles group.<br />
<br />
Unless there is a real reason to solo group xp is really much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok, while this question isn't about golems reading this made me wodner somethign about the technique I use on Murkgliders.  Namely I don't bother to slow.  I either solo pull with malos, root, dot dot, back off to reroot. Or I duo with a necro who aggros and kites while I malo dot dot and pet.  <br />
<br />
A lot of my experience has been just playing a bot for my monk, so i was wondering am I taking too much of a risk not slowing the mob?  I have generally thought that the extra safety in slowing was not worth the mana since we are not SUPPOSED to get hit, but rereading this makes me wonder.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Murks are pretty slow. That, coupled with good geography, lets you get away with not slowing them. I slow out of habit though, sure it sucks some mana but the added insurance is worth it imo; Adds, lag, resisted root, etc.... You'll be glad you're tanking a slowed mob for the moment you're trying to channel a root &amp; get the hell away from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you are looking for a snare item, there is a EASY quest in barrens that yields a 5 charge snare item.  You can get as many as you want, the drop comes off the priest and you turn it in as kejek village (?) to some cat.  Very handy if you can't afford the anklesmasher or if you don't have anything else that proc's snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hello Ughbash<br />
<br />
I always cast slow when I solo - period.<br />
It costs some mana, but that mana is regained with a canni or two - might cost me 15 seconds or so.<br />
If I do not slow, and the mob breaks root right after I have used Canni V, the mob might double or triple hit me + stun and then I am very close to a CR. The time wasted on dying and getting ready to start killing again can easily be 15 minutes (depending on where I solo). In 15 minutes I could have slowed a lot of mobs.<br />
<br />
This of course depends on your HP/AC. If you have 5000 hp unbuffed you probably won't get in trouble as easily as I do when root breaks.<br />

<br />
Er, Knew plenty of 6.5K + HP lvl 65 shaman before OOW came out myself. Rosrak's, Kanleku's, VT, &amp; even a few wearing the odd piece of Onyx Chain still. Not to mention VP quest items.<br />
<br />
A 5khp hp lvl 65 shaman is still pretty buff, but certainly not unheard of. I daresay one could get a lvl 65 shaman to 5k hps these days without even being flagged Tipt+ or ele.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Main point to remember is getting a group that can chain pull will get you more AAXP per hour than soloing can.  But at 5% AA per 6 min kill at lvl 65, now that sounds like a winner...<br />
<br />
I'm 65, but not Ele/VT/VP/GoD flagged at all.  With tribute, I can get 5.6k now self-buffed and with Conv + BSS/SV.  Only Ornate armor I have are the Scaled Avatar's Gloves.  I don't have one item on me that is 100+ HP, but I'm not afraid to tank.  So 5k  + buffed is very possible, Sudancia.<br />
<br />
Chain-pulling in BoT is my preferred method of AA grinding... it's relatively safe, easy, and quick to find decent grps.  I like to pull for the group, as well as MH, slow, and DOT to add DPS.  South or Deep south are easy to single pull.  My philosophy on shaman pulling is 1) you're in control of the situation, 2) by pulling with Malo/s, then running to camp, you can guarantee mob is slowed as soon as it's in camp, 3) you keep all DPS members at camp, and keep their hands full and busy = maximum DPS for group.  Just make sure to go and get next mob before the current one is dead (around 10-20%, depending on group DPS).  When first mob dies, group will have another in camp ready to kill.  Main exception to this is of course when you have mobs that gate....wait till it's dead to be safe.<br />
<br />
I park puppy in camp, pull with Malo (I only have MP3), sic puppy on mob in camp (faster than tank getting his aggro), then slow right away.  Group engages, I throw on a Bane, cap off the MT with Q, and either join in and melee for fun (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=43418 with http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=42118 and http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24753 and SCF1 and 280 max stats with Voice of the Berserker).  Or I pull up mount quick, cani4/5, unclick mount, then go and pull next.  Every few rounds you will not be able to afford a DOT, so throw in your puppy pack to make up for the DPS, or don't.  Not throwing on a DoT slows group DPS, which buys you more time that round to get mana back anyway.  You don't have to be near FM to keep going... push it until around 20% mana...more than likely your canni5 will refresh soon enough.<br />
