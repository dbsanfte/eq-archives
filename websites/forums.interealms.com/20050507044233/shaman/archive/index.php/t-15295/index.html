61 BRD<br />
56 MAGE and Pet<br />
<br />
We had no cleric.  I'm telling ya this was the craziest group.  I thought we were insane.  Sure whe had 2 CH capable Druids, but the DPS was patheic.  The druids could have been higher then 59 I'm not positive they were both 59.    We were doing WW.  After we wiped on the first pull and had to evac. After rezzing the bard quit and replaced him with a <br />
58 Monk.  This was a little better, and things were progressing along smoothly for about 4 pulls and the xp was awesome.  Then outta no were next to the wall a Crystalline Spider (something like that) Appeared and was quadding me for 508 each hit.  It killed most of the group except the monk (fd).  I logged at that point, LOL... I was tired.  Anyway I got rezzed this morning.  Anyone know what these spider things are and how the hell did it got there?<br />
<br />
Thanks...<br />

I'm sitting here in regular BOT type group, tank, cleric, ranger, rogue, bard and posting and reading a chapter in a book because of slow pulls - zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.<br />
<br />
Heck the best group I've had in the past month was bard, wizzy, wizzy, wizzy, pally (MA), shaman (me).  Oh we had a bot chanter backing us up, lol.  I just slowed and kept the Pally up - the wizzys boomed um down - very funny.  Don't underestimate a 65 wizzy with a bunch of aa's.<br />
<br />
Oh, and those darn spiders are difficult to see.  As the above poster says, you need to find a somewhat safe camp spot and a careful puller.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">when you are on either side of the castle if you are smart you stay off the walls. The spiders are out on the plains near the dd and ne camp in valor and they come to the castle from trains and if you guys are sitting on or in the wall it will aggro you through the wall. You have to then run to the door of the castle to draw it out to where you are in posisition to fight it. They cant be snared or rooted. That group was severly lacking for damage output so it anything would seem to be a struggle in valor for you. glad i did my exp in valor when you had to go through trials.</div></div><hr />

You should learn to die in pov, and die alot while you are leeching the xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Frankly, the class makeup of that party is perfectly fine.  You've got a tank, you've got a CH, you've got a slow, and at least one good DPS class in the Mage.  The bard's on cc, then became a monk for good DPS, and a redundant druid should be solid DPS.<br />
<br />
It's a perfectly normal makeup and you've got all the bases covered.  What went wrong?<br />
<br />
YOU'RE TOO SMALL.  A Valor group can handle one person in it who's on the low side (by which I mean under-60) if everything else is okay and chug along as long as the person isn't your tank (or frankly slower, since Malo and the levels help a ton out there) but if the golems (62) are red to almost everyone, you're just in over your head.<br />
<br />
Remember, PoV/S were designed to be tackled by people who could beat the PoJ trials.  The trials are difficult at best for a group of rank level 60.  It's not you -- go back to Nightmare or Disease -- XP is still really good there, and come back to Valor when it's time.<br />
<br />
The only pass I might give here is for clerics who generally don't have to cast on the mobs to do their primary duty.  If they're on the ball, with a solid group, they can slide in a few levels early.  Everyone else needs the seasoning though.<br />
<br />
BTW, this is really THE jump.  If you can handle the 440+proc hitting golems ok in a group of your peers, you can handle pretty much any pre-elemental plane at an acceptable level, they don't get THAT much harder.</div></div><hr />

IIRC they hit around 550, and no that doesn't mean you can handle anything prelemental plane... POV requires no CC and all mobs are fully slowable.</div></div><hr />

There's a difference between having a superiority complex and laughing at straight-up ignorance.   :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
True.  But even in, say, BoT where a lot of the zone mitigates, it's not really that much harder.  If you're handling PoV okay and everyone with you is at about your level, you can hunt in BoT too -- at least SOMETHING.<br />
<br />
Which makes sense -- who's supposed to be able to get into BoT?  People who can pass the quest of killing a few giants that frankly even semi-lost raids of 2-3 groups can handle.  As long as you can get TO Storms in the first place, it's not supposed to be a big jump to BoT.<br />
<br />
And HoH or Tactics or CoD is really not much harder.  I haven't really spent any time in Torment outside one raid there, so I can't speak to that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">nothing in bot but named mitigate...and if you kill any partially slowable mob you would know what i mean. I 3box the giants in POS with war/rog/shm and i have to chain CH the war... wihle a mob hitting for the same fully slowable 1 CH is enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sorry, misspoke.  HoH mitigates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So what was the point of the Trails?  I've heard of them but haven't researched it.  So is there any reason to do the Trails now?  Other than for xp ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You need the trials to progress in pop to the unavailable planes.  Winning the trials will also make your charm improve and may give you an aa point to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well...if you are looking to advance to the elemental planes, you must do the trials.  Getting in by level or even doing the quests to gain access won't help you progress through PoP.  You can also do the trials (and mob fights like AD, Grummus) to receive free AA points and bonuses to your charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There are two purposes to the trials:<br />
<br />
1. To open later zones.  There was a designed progression for these zones.  For instance, the trial opens Valor and Storms.  In Valor, you kill Aerrin'Dar, which opens Halls of Honor.  In Halls of Honor, you pass 3 trials there which opens HoHB (Mithaniel Marr's Lair) where you kill him as one of the prerequisites to the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
There's a similar progression from Storms.  Now even though Valor and Halls of Honor can be entered without flags at 55 and 62 respectively, you will not be able to get the progressive flags for the later zones without passing the PoJustice trial.<br />
<br />
2. Charm&amp;AA.  When they opened zones, so make passing the various flags more enticing and reward those who did it &quot;legit,&quot; there's now a charm you can get for free in PoK that gets better with each new plane you get access to (well, kind of).  It's pretty nice and since a lot of people had no charm, it's essentially free stats.  Also, for each one of these, you get a free AA point.<br />
<br />
IIRC you get this bump from:<br />
<br />
1. Passing PoJ trial (opens Valor/Storms)<br />
2. Killing Behemoth (opens Tactics)<br />
3. Killing Terris Thule (opens Torment) (also can be done by killing Bertoxx, but TT is much easier)<br />
4. Killing Grummus (opens Crypt of Decay)<br />
5. Killing Aerrin`Dar (opens Halls of Honor)<br />
6. Completing Askr's quest (opens Bastion of Thunder)<br />
7. Entering Temple of Solusek Ro (requires various kills)<br />
8. Entering Elemental Planes (similar to above).<br />
<br />
There are a lot of sub-steps in there too.  It's something close to that.  I have 5 of the first 6, still need Aerrin`Dar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">PoJ trials are and were a test of a single group to function as one. It was required to enter PoV and PoS. The trials were tough, which I think was a good thing. Groups of all level 60s struggled to beat the trials. Groups of level 63 characters were generally able to breeze on through.<br />
<br />
Then they opened up the tier 2 and some tier 3 planes to anyone level 55 or 62. And people under 60 walk in and get amazed by how quickly they die... I do not understand the shock here. These zones were not intended for level 50-something players. Many of the mobs are level 62. They hit hard and fast. Some have nasty little procs. I suppose that if a group of high 50 players that had worked together in the past, that also had a decently geared tank, crowd control, and good cleric went to PoV, that they could have a good time. But they would at best experience lots of downtime since the cleric would almost certainly be chain casting his CH. Hell, some level 65 clerics get low on mana with level 65 tanks. So level 50 something toons would be much worse off.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, EQ is a game where generally, your best exp comes from killing the most number of blue con mobs in the shortest period of time. For a group of players in their high 50s, PoV is not going to provide the mobs that would allow for this to happen. PoNightmares, PoDisease and probably PoInnovation would be far better. But hey, if people want to go try something new out, and die in the process, more power to them. Just dont expect alot of sympathy from people that have been there and done that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You basically did the equivalent of taking the Level 35-40 DL group with the 50 warrior into the KC basement.<br />
<br />
No big deal really, because your group obviously had no idea how hard parts of PoV are and did not realize the previous requirements that were in place.  Chock it up to experience and try your luck elsewhere until you level a tad. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The thing is, Valor sucked before the trials requirement was eliminated.  <br />
<br />
It was still filled with a lot of folks who weren't too bright, and essentially was just a continuation of the LIO/OT/DL school of development.  Sloppy outdoor play with easy pulls.  <br />
<br />
Inner Cave is less easy (but still easy), but it sure is an experience goldmine with the right group.  I did a fair bit of leveling there, that's for sure.  <br />
<br />
For some reason, it does now attract a lot of players who are probably not leveled for it.  I guess if they have fun, or it looks like the Dreadlands.  <br />
<br />
Maybe it's less boring if you are skittering on the edge of a wipeout with each pull.</div></div><hr />

I can't recall).<br />
<br />
You can get your charm upgrades/AA for doing the alt entry quests as well, but, of course, there isn't any alt entry quest for valor/storms or BoT; you have to progress through the storyline on those ones.</div></div><hr />

For tower of sol ro you don't need Rallos altho you do need rallos to enter sol ro's chamber inside the zone.<br />

Not to be stuck up but your group was underleveled and probably undergeared to handle PoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">EQ is a game.  Games are fun.  If he was having fun in this group then more power to him.  Sure, he came here to tell of his adventures and that might have been a mistake.  If dying doesnt bother you and seeing new places and trying new and hard things is fun feel free to explore.<br />
<br />
Most of the momorable times and groups that I have been in were those ones that most people would have said that I was crazy to do.  Most of the ones that were the most fun were the ones that people said that my group couldnt do it. /shrug<br />
<br />
Ive been douing with a SK in PoV since I got 58 and Tnarrgs.  Is the exp there really great?  No, because it takes awhile for us to kill things.  But I dont give a damn about exp, Im there for a good time.  And doing that is a hell of a lot more fun than a mindless grind group in PoN or PoI where nothing is a challenge anymore and its just hours and hours of the same mobs and casting the same spells.  Reaching out above your head makes you think in different directions and try things that might not be considered &quot;safe&quot;.<br />
<br />
My response to that is &quot; You play your game; Ill play mine.&quot;<br />

Remember, there are good reasons for not succeeding; there is no good reason not to try.</div></div><hr />

Me, My Shaman, 65 Mage, 65 Druid, 65 Cleric, and 65 chanter.   Mage Air Pet was mt, Had dogdog, some DC pets, bunch of nuking.  And the mage pet never died once and always held aggro on slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I just have lunch with a ingame friend (before I read this thread) and I told him it was fun to join a pickup group in PoV these days.<br />
<br />
If I want to get fast and efficient xp without death, I find a group with my guildies in elemental zones or Sol Ro Tower.<br />
<br />
If I want a lot of unexpected twists and excitement, I join the new PoV group because the following situations often arise:<br />
<br />
(1) Puller comes back with 2 or 3 mobs.  Or Mob suddenly appear...<br />
<br />
(2) MT cannot hold aggro or his HP is half before even the slower can get malo/slow in.  Worst...if cleric fizzles, he is close to heaven.  Imagine puller comes back with 2 or more mobs.<br />
<br />
(3) Chanter dies after a mob aggroes on him because his Mezz was resisted.<br />
<br />
(4) While the chanter managed to mezz 2 other mobs, the cleric declares himself LOM (or oom) while one last mob is still mezzed.<br />
<br />
(5) Many other situations.<br />
<br />
Basically I just root and heal like crazy.  Usually I just slow mob without malo to save time and it is ok.  But it is fun.<br />
<br />
In the worst scenario, I run to zone.  99% of the time I made it to the zone.<br />
<br />
It's fun but not time-efficient and it's adviseable only when you want something different on a non-raid day.<br />
<br />
Objectively, for a group of below 60s, likelihood is that CR time will be longer than grinding time.  At the minimum, you need a good MT (i.e. &gt;7000HP with LR5 and 1300 AC) and a reasonable slower/healer to keep a group going and handling unexpected situation.<br />
<br />
CR time is ok if you have mature players and willing to co-operate.  But at times, you get whinners who complain a lot and then simply log and this leads to time wasting.<br />
<br />
The new POV has a different appeal to me now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">At the minimum, you need a good MT (i.e. &gt;7000HP with LR5 and 1300 AC) and a reasonable slower/healer to keep a group going and handling unexpected situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or you could pick your battles.  Having not fought some of the mobs in PoV I bow to your superior wisdom of the zone.  My usual targets in my PoV duo are the undead vassels (Yellow and red to me at 59) or the worm things (even/yellow).  My 60 SK tank has a hair under 6K when buffed with Virtue and my buffs, with somewhere near 1200 AC.  Usually takes 2 Kraggs during the fight from me, and fights usually last about a 90 to 120 seconds.  We both usually end the fight with around 70 health and 80 mana, so we usually chain pull (unless we have to deal with a train of someones golems, then we need about 3 minutes of downtime.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I never raid, never group outside friends/guildies (usually 2 box) and started in PoV as soon as the zone was opened.  Sk then was 57 w/ &lt; 5k hps (buffed) and 1175ish AC, shaman was 60 w/ no epic, no torpor, no malo.  Had very few problems doing the larvae, frogs, vassals near GY, only trouble arose when slow would bounce a few times.<br />
<br />
Courtesy of PoV the shaman is now 63 and sk is 61- shaman got malo (which trivialized the fights to be honest) since then and sk now is &gt; 1300 AC/5.5k hps and have moved on to golems and spiders, which are more challenging than the GY trash but by no means difficult.  I add any 55+ friend/guildie at any time and they contribute just fine.  <br />
<br />
All I heard prior to the opening of the tier 2/3 zones was how hard they were going to be for a casual, how we didn't stand a chance, how we didn't belong there, etc... etc...  In reality they're not difficult if you have anyone but a monk tanking and have a slower, that's pretty much it.  I look forward to dinging 62 on the sk soon so that I can roll into tier 3, boy, I sure am terrified- mobs there hit for &gt; 500!!! hahahahahah, whatever.<br />
<br />
As always, slow uber alles.  My L51 vendor spell Turgur's &gt; raid gear for exping, thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I went to PoV for the first time last night at 56.  Had a 59 epic mage, 56 mage, 55 mage, 62 wiz and 62 druid with me.  The druid pulled and the 59 mage would debuff on the inc.  Once I saw his message he was maloXing, I would start casting slow.  If I jumped the gun and cast before he debuffed, I only slowed the mob about half the time on the first try.  When I waited, I don't remember getting a resist message at all.  The druid would CH the epic pet once and mob was dead.  A little communication and planning and you can do a lot of stuff before the &quot;normal&quot; timeline that most players adhere to.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying you cant kill them, but I am saying that you are stretching to kill them.  Expect to have problems.  Its not a totaly safe place, there are roamers and the pathing for returning trains tends to bring them thru the otherwise safe spots.<br />

The zoneout is a considerable distance from the zone in.  Sure, there could always be people trying to transit the zone or the castle, plus returning mobs can easily aggro the east wall of the castle (or RC, depending on server terminology) but you have to try really damned hard to train the ZI folks running to ZO in PoV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You answered your own question with 3 possible scenarios of why training is bad.  Granted, the &quot;lfg people&quot; arent likely to get tagged but they sometimes do.  I should have used a better example, &quot;undead campers, castle campers.&quot;<br />
<br />
And its not just a PoV issue.<br />
<br />
The point being, what good is it having the shaman live if the 5 others including cleric/pally are dead?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean seriously, folks should keep a lookout for mobs and be alert - and hollering at someone who has the gall to run for a zone is lame in my book.  <br />
<br />
Deliberate training to wipe people out is bad; racing to a zone with mobs running after you is not bad - it's part of the game and to me it's perfectly acceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Just yesterday I had reason to go back to Pov to try and get a crystalline carapace I was needing to finish the second level gate talisman. I remember seeing tons of these rot in the pickup groups I was in at WW because our groups could usually clear all the golems and run out of mobs fast enough that we were also pulling a ton of spiders and still wait for a respawn... this was before they removed the trials.<br />
<br />
Yesterday when I got there, I plopped down beside the group hunting WW, threw some buffs at em and asked if I could loot a rotting carapace, then settled down to wait, throwing in the occasional heal. I swear if I had been in a group with this much downtime back then, I would have found a reason to leave (OMG the cat's in the oven again, gotta go !). They had all the right classes but were obviously much too low level to even be there. They couldn't even keep the golems clear and when they got adds I had to step in and slow/tank/park 2 spiders and heal cause their cleric and chanter were dead in the first 30 seconds. They would have completely wiped. It boggles the mind that people will go through all this when that same group in nightmare or innovation would have been constant pulling and raking in the xp like dry leaves in automn. <br />
<br />
The trials had their bad side but they did what people don't seem to have enough sense to do themselves... they ensured that if you could enter the zone you were probably high enough to hunt there.</div></div><hr />

People who hunt at zone lines are just asking for trains.   I will never support intentional training of someone, no matter what they say or do... but if you're hunting at the zone line, trains are your problem.<br />
<br />
Goes right back to Unrest... or crushbone... people would hunt the zone line, then complain merrily when a train ran by.    <br />
<br />
I'm not saying you deserve to be trained, I'm just saying, trains are a reality at zone lines.   If you can't handle it, or don't want to, move away from zone and common train paths... that's what I generally do.<br />
<br />
My 1% is worth running to zone for the hassle of getting ressed, mana back, buffs, etc...  I wouldn't train a group intentionally for it... but I will run to zone... that's what it's there for, to escape mobs on your tail.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
I have more of a problem with people who get a mob on them, then run around to every camp hoping the mob will get off them.   Common with undead since they often latch on to the closest target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">A few questions here.<br />
<br />
For the MT with &gt;7000HP and LR5, I was refering to wasteland mobs and for handling more than 1 mobs inc without chanter and also not having to evac.  Running around to and fro your camp and PoV zone in is time wasting and a very boring way of spending your online time.<br />
<br />
Of course you can even kill Larvae at zone in solo or a group of 2 at lvl 55.<br />
<br />
With regards to the statement about running to zone in, let me explain a bit.  I only run when the whole group died.  I don't run even if there is someone in the group alive.  I usually heal the whole group when I grind, including the cleric.<br />
<br />
When I run to zone, I don't usually need to run to zone in.  I have my gate memmed most times.  And rest of the time, I camped out to remove aggro near the stream before zone in.<br />
<br />
The EW group probably still get my mobs but on my server, I have seen many EW group camping on the wasteland side instead of camping at the wall.  Usually EW is also being avoided on our server.<br />
<br />
I see no point in losing 1 % xp when I can gate out and the whole group is dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">See the problem Wispr is that mobs path back over campers heads in PoV.<br />
<br />
Its not about hunting at zone in.  People need somewhere to stand when lfg in a zone...even though the ZO/ZI arent *right* next to each other...its just takes one to agro someone jsut zoning and whack a bunch of people on the hill.<br />
<br />
The problem is worse in places like BoT where training is the norm.  In that case, the ZO/ZI are the same...why people dont bother to train up to the teleport pads is beyond me.<br />
<br />
My 1% is worth running to zone for the hassle of getting ressed, mana back, buffs<br />
<br />
If you're the sole survivor of your group...you're gonna have to cast em anways.  Its not going to be any faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Way I see it with folks that train the ZI/ZO areas, keep it up. This way I know who these folks are, and who to avoid in the future.<br />
<br />
Making the presumption that another group of strangers should pay for your own, and your groups mistakes, is simply not right. Is that 1% of yours, more valuable than their 1% to them?<br />
<br />
Yes, it's a game, and yes it's meant to be fun. Fun for everyone, not just 1 single self absorbed person. Respect the other people that are playing along side you. As one person that comes to mind from my server has found out, that reputation means a great deal. Get the wrong person mad, and all sorts of things may happen.<br />
<br />
As the other post about booting people out of groups shows, there are some long memories around the game, and people will recognize you for your actions. It's your choice how you want to be remembered.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">We have been over this before, but with PoP things changed.<br />
<br />
Camping the zone in/out is asking to get trained, but in PoP the zone in/out is where your corpse winds up... you cant move it away so you rez there.<br />
<br />
If you call a train to zone on my server, expect everyone else to shout back for you to just die...<br />
<br />
If you die, a_random_cleric will hapily click you and your group back... frequently without you even asking.  If you train out, you train the gy... where others are getting rezzed.  They get pissed.  They shout a lot.  You get a bad rep.  You dont get that random free rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I still hold that when you're standing on the tracks, you sound awfully silly complaining about all the trains in these parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">There are graveyards in PoP, there weren't graveyards before PoP.  <br />
<br />
Pre graveyards, training a zone was sometimes a necessity to avoid a lengthy CR or worse.  <br />
<br />
Most PoP zones, PoV being an exception, have the Zone Out and Zone In both right next to the graveyard.  There are no long CRs in PoP, period.  20ish mins tops and your corpses all pop to a convenient area that should be safe to res and recover.  BUT, then you have the dimwits that train those graveyards...<br />
<br />
As others have already mentioned, even in PoV training is still bad because while you may not train a single person on your way to the Zone out, those mobs path back strangely and oftentimes a nice group of 2 or 3 pops onto some xp group wiping them out.<br />
<br />
I'd hazard a guess and say that zone lines were NOT put in to give players an escape route, rather they were an unfortunate necessity when EQ was originally developed due to game limitations.  Note, most current MMOs have done away with zones.<br />
<br />
I still hold that when you're standing on the tracks, you sound awfully silly complaining about all the trains in these parts.<br />
<br />
You conveniently ignore the fact that those &quot;tracks&quot; usually run right dead smack into Graveyards where you don't really have a choice to move until after you've gotten a res.<br />
<br />
Summary : Training is for zones without GYs and even then only as an absolute last resort to avoid some of the more ridiculous CRs and such.   Quit being a baby and take a death when you screw up.  There are tons of clerics with click sticks in most every PoP zone and rarely will you have a problem getting a res.  Training those clerics trying to save your ass just gets you put into that mental black book...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Okay, I'll admit, I didn't really consider the GY factor as much as I should have.   I haven't actually hunted much in PoP until recently, and I've hardly had to run.   I've only been in PoV twice, and in that one case it's easy to see the ZI / ZO being far apart.<br />
<br />
Trains are just Trains.    I guess I just can't call someone an idiot for running to zone.  <br />
<br />
I have been in a dungeon before, had to run, and seen a group... and I'll stop and die... truly I will.   But if I shout that I have a train coming to zone... with 15-20s warning... I just don't feel bad about it.<br />
<br />
Maybe after I'm trained at the zone of a few GY's over and over, I'll feel different and start calling people idiots... but right now I just don't feel that way.<br />
<br />
You should always be aware of where you fight, where you are, and whats going on.<br />
<br />
I have bigger problems with people who run their trains all around, or don't call their trains.<br />
<br />
My 1% is not worth more than someone elses... I will never train someone on purpose.   I rarely ever train... when I have to run I try to root first... as I said, I have limited PoP experience outside of PoD, maybe that's just not feasable after Tier 1.</div></div><hr />

You cant remove your corpse from the graveyard.  It will automaticly resummon it back if you try.  You can shift your corpse around within the graveyard, but sometimes it will still summon it away from you even if you only move it around a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I guess I just dont understand the reasoning behind people wiping out x amount of people because they were so afraid to eat a death and get a rez. I have hunted PoP since release mostly tier 2 and 3 and I have never had a problem getting rezzed. When you and/or your group get in a situation where you cant hack it I think its really screwed up to mess up everyone who can. I see this in bot since they opened the flood gates and it just ruined an otherwise perfectly good zone. people training from deep south or deep east the center area which usually has 4 groups so you usually have 1 or 2 people totally messing up the hunting of 18 or 24. just eat your death and get rezzed its not the end of the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, you'll have to teach me that trick, since this &quot;cow&quot; is unable to pull his corpse from any graveyards - they immediately return.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, if I'm ever camping a ZI, I kind of expect to deal with trains, 'cause there are just too many inconsiderate people out there.  I do find it expecially annoying in PoP though, since as stated before, there's really no reason not to just die in place.  As for staying off &quot;the tracks&quot;, I guess that means nobody should camp anywhere in PoV (for example) except for the inner caves and the extreme northern end of the wastelands, because anywhere else in the zone is on the way to the GY, depending on how the person decides to run and how the mobs decide to path back home.</div></div><hr />

Meanwhile, in your path, those lfg at zone in get wiped.<br />

But hey, you saved yourself a precious 1% percent exp....GRATS!<br />
Well, let's see.<br />
You don't lose any xp at all.<br />
You don't have to wait for a res.<br />
You don't have to med you mana back.<br />
You don't have to rebuff yourself.<br />
You don't have to find an enchanter to give you a c3/c5 once again.<br />
You don't have to find a cleric or paladin in the first place to res you (not every group has a resser).<br />
You don't have to wait for the graveyard to grab you (depends what zone you are hunting and if stuff sees invis on the way)<br />
But no.  You are right.  It's much better just do stop and die like everyone else than try to preserve your own characters life.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, what setback...I might have to spend another MINUTE of killing to get it back<br />
<br />
 You don't have to wait for a res.<br />
<br />
Too bad the rest of the group does.  You arent any further ahead.<br />
<br />
 You don't have to med you mana back. <br />
<br />
And that takes what?  1-2 minutes tops?  What are going to do?  Pull while the rest of the group is medding?<br />
<br />
 You don't have to rebuff yourself.<br />
<br />
My group buffs hit me when i cast em...dont yours?<br />
<br />
 You don't have to find an enchanter to give you a c3/c5 once again.<br />
<br />
Ill give you that one.  Then again, im not the type to run off from my group when it fades either...<br />
<br />
 You don't have to find a cleric or paladin in the first place to res you (not every group has a resser). <br />
<br />
No but the rest of the group will.  Does that mean you'll ditch em and lfg?  If you're gonna wait around for em to get rezzed...why not get a rez for yourself at the same time?<br />
<br />
 You don't have to wait for the graveyard to grab you (depends what zone you are hunting and if stuff sees invis on the way)<br />
<br />
Again, if thats the case, the rest of the group does.  You are NOT any further ahead than had you taken the death.<br />

No, you are right...its much better to grief multiple players...</div></div><hr />

There are many options.  (1) Gate (2) Root mobs and camp.  Both options highly feasible at higher levels.  I always have gate and root spells memmed when I got into less than optimal group in PoV.<br />
<br />
I am not taking side, but arguing about whether to train or to die is SOOOoo old.  From May 99 in Unrest, May 2000 in KC and now both sides still giving same arguments over and over again.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I agree.  I learned back in the early days of PoP that after getting wacked in the GY right after someone rezed me that  I was NOT gonna train in the Planes no matter the cost.  It's too easy to get a rez now days and you have hours to find one...    So,  Take it like a man or gate/camp if ya can...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Wisey,<br />
<br />
Any of the options you mentioned are better than than booting for zoneline.<br />
<br />
As for the argument overall, yes its as old as dirt.  However, the training argument has not gained anything in its advantage.  There are more cleric epics out there now than in 99.  There are GYs now which didnt exist before.  There are no more lengthy CRs.  There are no more unrecuperable corpses.<br />
<br />
Its fine for everyone to have an opinion, but if it differs from mine, then you should know you are wrong...:)<br />
