<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,  I have the gem and I am ready to head to Erud's crossing.  I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions on the easiest route for an ogre shammy to go.  I'm more worried about the trip there then the killer sharks! :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SkegBlackwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi There Ouga,<br />
<br />
I did this recently and being an iksar was also KOS to most of Qeynos. The easiest route is to use the Qeynos catacombs underneath the city which eventually brings you out in the port area. A map is essential as its a maze down there! Once you zone in Qeynos you need to swim to the pier and wait invised until the boat arrives. I find that the boat actually arrives and waits at the pier before the one you zone near too, so you may need to swim round to it.<br />
<br />
As an alternative I suppose you could just run through Qeynos invis to the port area and just hope that invis doesn't drop!! hehe<br />
<br />
The killer sharks are a worry I had 5 swim past me whilst I was waiting. Luckily I took along some guildmates to deal with them. The sharks are dark blue to level 50 :D. Also it was black as pitch down there so I hope you underwater swimming is good! <br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I died twice getting past this one.  The secret is to use invis to animals while waiting, else the sharks will have thee for breakfast.  <br />
<br />
Its seems this spot is placed intentionally in the path of the sharks as they wander through these waters.  It was quite unnerving to see these sharks come slowly swimming up, and then stopping within feet of me before continuing on.<br />
<br />
My second death was because I intentionally dropped invis to animals while talking with the spirit (unnecessary, but I did NOT want to redo this step of the quest =P).  <br />
<br />
Obviously bring plenty of fish scales, as you will be under water for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I only needed one, count 'em, one fish scale.  Batwings, on the other hand, I needed about a dozen.  Go to the ogre, hand her the gem, Lev, SoW, and run to -1600, +4200...above the water.  Stand around, refreshing lev when necessary.  You will 'hear' the ghosts arrive, and you will hear them leave.  When you hear Abe leave, turn on EB and Invis vs. Animals, and jump in the water.  Look around, and your spirit should be in the area soon.  Talk to spirit, get gem, and either run back to the island or gate.  I had to do this part twice, 'cause the first time I couldn't find the spirit (the only real problem with this avenue..) and had to log right at that exact moment (isn't that always the way..?).  The second time I went back with much more time available, and saw the little ghostly dog swimming around.  Viola.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you know the way through qeynos (it's pretty easy), it's really easier to just invis and take off through the city.  Nothing sees invis on the main path, and it will only take a minute to cross.  I got lost in those damn catacombs for an hour before finally finding a way out (and i think that was a bug, i zoned out near the bank, went back in, went back through the same zone and ended up at the docks).  On the way back I just ran through the city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, did this last night.  A friend of mine, lvl 41 enchanter, joined me.  She invis'd me and guided me through Queynos right to the docks.  OMG there are a lot of guards there!  (Yes, first time here) But we made it through ok.  Got out to spot to wait for spirit and thought I'd use puppy instead of invis to animals, seeing as I'm lvl 50.  Wrong! use the invis! Those killer sharks are tougher then I expected, but still manageable.  Still easiest to just avoid the conflict.  Glad it's done and over with!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm KOS to the evil guards.  Invis was my friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i got there from erudin, actually. Used TD teleport to get me to erudin, catching a DMF from a necro who happened to log on at the exact same time that i did :). the fireport puts you right by the docks so you don't need to know the city at all, but make sure you are invis before you use it. after you get the port you can swim out a ways so you don't need to worry about invis dropping while you wait for the boat.<br />
<br />
once i got there i popped IvA to avoid the sharks (i was 39), but it didn't seem to matter as i evidently took the test on Shark Labor Day. Didn't see and couldn't target w/ f7 a single shark or killer shark -- one green pirhana was all that pathed near me while i took the test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Odaku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Be it that I just started EQ after Asheron's Call and UO, I don't have uber friends nor loot.   All I read is how hard the Epic is to do solo.  Well at 39 I started and by 40 I had the Black Fur Boots and stopped because I was happy.  Here is what I've done for Test of Patience.......<br />
<br />
Make hotkeys of ALL responses you must spurt out.<br />
<br />
<br />
1 Port to Tox (Either Odus Scion in nexus or player port)<br />
2 Run through Erudin (invis if KoS) to the dox area<br />
3 Take the boat to Qeynos (Broke atm but teleporter lady will send you to Erud'd Crossing on the Island.<br />
4 Hand Ogre Lady the Gem from Freeport<br />
5 SoW, Lev, Invis yourself.<br />
6. Run out to the loc from every guide out there.<br />
7. Put your feet in the water....(this is the key because you can HEAR everything that goes on with NO risk of shark attack)<br />
8. (REINVIS)Float there for about 30 minutes until Abe the Abandoned spawns and says something. (Debate on his usefulness to quest) and get the broken arrow from him.<br />
9. Return to the same spot on surface until you see something like this  &quot; a greater spirit begins to cast a spell &quot; You'll actually hear the noise of it if done right<br />
10 (REINVIS) Swim down and converse(prolly will have to uninvis due to new changes to invis rules<br />
11 GATE out quick <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Whole time I saw total of 4-5 sharks.  But you need not be afraid of this test if you have the above spells.  No uber friends needed.<br />
<br />
The black dire on the other hand may take you a group if you lack the uberness to take on the 5 mobs.<br />
<br />
My 2cp.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aside from the route you took, that's the way I did it.  However, I did not hear the spirit cast, nor did I see any message saying that it was casting.  So, after Abe left, I just un-lev'd, and sat in the water with IvA.</div></div><hr />
