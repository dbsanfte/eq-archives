<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My pet can now actaully taunt mushrooms off of me in Fungus Grove.  It consistantly was able to do so.  Combine that with the new pet resists, and the pet is much better for soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ictus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman pets use to be taunting fiends before that big hubbub in Kael with charmed pets and the resulting fix that no pet could taunt a mob off a PC that was in melee range.  Before that, I dueled with a rogue and just played healer for my pet, since my poor pet got smacked down alot since the rogue could evade so well onto poor fido.  It would be could if pets could taunt off PC's again, at least to a degree.<br />
