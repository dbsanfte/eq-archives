<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally took my horse back to the glue factory.  Now I'll try to convince myself it was because of the difficulty with cancelling spells(why make something that was a one step process a three step process?)  or maybe the acceleration thing.  But the real reason is that even after a few weeks, I CANNOT get past the butt-ugly troll models.  Now you would think ugly for a troll would be a good thing.  This isn't the sorta charming ugly of the old models though.  I'll take the big, fat, oddly proportioned troll over the sleek new model with no character whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Bye standing med, I'll miss you.  You too, no sit aggro.  Ah well, at least now I can pay off the last bit of my malo debt. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree the new troll models look really dumb but what can you do ? I still keep my horse just so I can get somewhere faster even thought I really dont have much distance to travel these days and I rarily use it for mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rumor has it if you have a froggy shaman or an amulet of necropotence - you can get away with only turning on the horse model.  You have to go illusion: skeleton before horsing if you are not a frog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Test the illusion thing preez ;)...<br />
<br />
Noticable loss of mana regen, now that I can't root/rot with as much as before without our dirty nasty exploit  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The new troll and ogre models suck sh!t.<br />
Nuff said.<br />
That is prob the reason i will never get a horse. It's ridiculous to be forced to look liek THAT.<br />
<br />
They completely changed the shape of the bodies of trolsl and ogres. The cuteness is gone :(<br />
<br />
Yes cutenes. those blank stares the ogres had and the funny talk which simply does not go with their new looks.<br />
<br />
And the evil stare of the trolsl is gone also /rude new models. The fps sucks with new models also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I disagree personaly , the new trolls look mean and ugly and evil , they arent supposed to have a charm to them , they are the slimmy smelly spawn of evil. I like them personaly , they look strong and mean which is why i made a troll SK. The old ogre/troll models looked like big retarded clowns . They were too big also , how many times have you been stuck in a zone in cause of one of them. My GF will lose  a whole night of sales cause some troll or ogre comes in and sits on her , cause the old models will complete cover a wood elf up.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do agree the old ogre had a certain charm , kinda a big dumb , but friendly face to them , almost like a big child , which is what they are usualy in my view of them anyway.  But yea , trolls , no way , the new model is way better in my opinion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I totally disagree. The new Troll models are awesome. I love how they slouch over and have wierd posture, with big noses and everything. Just a round ball of meat that's colored green has far less character than these new models. Same with the ogres. Every time I see an NPC still glued to an old world Ogre model I shudder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I first saw the new troll models I hated them: there was no attempt to retain the character of the original models.<br />
<br />
However, having now got used to them I don't have any problem with the the new models.<br />
<br />
The old trolls had a character that was specific to EQ.  The new models seem to fall more in line with the 'normal' idea of trolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Groumshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can confirm that clicking AoN and then using horse works...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You do realize that turning off Troll models only changes your perspective, right?  The rest of us see you in the new model form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah but *I* can't bear to look at myself liek that.<br />
Or other trolls.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh well, at least vah shir models are awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i play in 3rd person 95% of my game time ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>toradorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">LOL... You are going to throw away a Flowing Thought item that would cost hundred of thousands of plat in the bazaar, just because you don't want to look at yourself like that? Are you serious? <br />
<br />
 How often do you sit and stare lovingly at your troll? Do you really think it matters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ganonbum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The new troll models are way better IMO<br />
<br />
The new models have a tall, evil, strong appeal to them, while the old models just looked silly,<br />
<br />
I feel the same way about the ogre models as well, just look alot tougher than before</div></div><hr />
