<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Simple question on your main character what level is he/she and how much gold does he/she have at this moment? :)<br />

Level 25 Shaman 28 Gold on me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I started this post because I want to see where I stand compared to other shamans.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Level 34, 0 gold at the moment.<br />
<br />
I would have more but<br />
(1) I bought one thing at auction for 8 gold.<br />
(2) my junk tradeskill things have been going to a friend to disenchant which means i've been steadily draining my own funds for his tradeskill (no big deal).<br />
(3) spells start to cost close to and over 1 gold each starting at lvl 32.<br />
(4) I don't sell things at auction houses because I don't think its worth the time investment at this point when I can get at least 1/4th the auction price at the nearest vendor instantly for most items I find.<br />
<br />
Money comes easy though; most things I fight drop a few silver each and, when you have to kill around 300 monsters per level, that can add up fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lvl 31, 20g.  Alchemy don't make any money :)  But it has saved my life and my groups life many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Level 44, 30G.<br />
<br />
There are 46 Rogues on my server who have bought the 80G cat (he's a NE). I think Rogues can make cash by pick-pocketing. <br />
<br />
As long as I have enough to buy spells at the next level and repair my stuff I'm happy. <br />
<br />
Money in a MMORPG is like money in life - you can't take it with you when you die.  So die broke and leave nothing for the government.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have no idea how people have enough gold to buy their mounts at level 40.  I'm level 40 and have 12 gold.  I know where most of it goes, though:<br />
<br />
1)  Spells.  Expensive as hell, I stopped buying the worthless ones I never use like flametongue weapon and stoneclaw totem, etc...<br />
2)  Alchemy:  Lots of expenditure, zero income.  Every potion I make, I use.  I spend lots on vials now that I am up to crystals, and I have spent a small fortune on recipes.  It is almost as much as spells.<br />
3)  10g to design my guild's tabards.<br />
4)  15g on my ridiculously uber 35.5 dps unique axe that I equipped at level 35.  Was worth every copper, that thing is like the apocalypse coming when windfury goes off.<br />
5)  Probably 20ish buying a full set of mail armor that I put on when I hit 40.<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it, I bet I could have had 100g by now if I had put my mind to it.  If i had scrimped on my spells and alchemy, not bought anything from AH, and sold drops instead of giving them to lower level guildies, I would probably have a mount or close to it by now.  I can wolf form which is almost as fast, though, so I'm not too torn up about it.  I'm happier with my money spent on all this assorted stuff than on a mount - they seem more a prestige item than utility right now.  As long as I've got one once every alliance has one, I'll be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just hit level 25, and have 8 g, after buying my spells.<br />
<br />
I am leathercrafting, which breaks even (except for giving armor kits to guildees).<br />
<br />
Been mailing all my wool and silk to our tailor, and holding gold/silver bars for our blacksmith.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Level 36, something like 32 gold.  <br />
<br />
Some classes definitely have an advantage, but there is a fair amount of luck involved.  For hunters, skils + ammo + pet food would seem like a disadvantage, but I think other classes get it worse at the trainer.  <br />
<br />
I think if I had ditched leatherworking and just gone for gathering skills, I would be closer to 50 gold.  Tradeskills are at the very best, break-even endeavors at the moment.  You can't sell any crafted item in the AH (leather anyway), there are 20 of every crafted item up most of the time.<br />
<br />
Next time around I will know which skills are completely useless and save the money on training them, that will help too.  Even with cosmos and 20+ buttons on screen, some abilities stay in the book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand, I can't think of anything else they really need money for except, perhaps,  weapons upgrades in the future. But that's OK, the game is more fun that way :)</div></div><hr />

My shaman is 24, I think, and has 50 silver (just bought spells)... I'm probably -4 gold if you add up the spells I still have left to buy.<br />
<br />
I don't sell much of the good drops anymore.  I give it to friends, I feed it to my enchanting buddy, I mail it to alts... money isn't NEARLY so much fun as 9dps at level 8!!<br />
<br />
I could never save up money in EQ1, either (until the end, when there was nothing to buy), and I honestly never regretted it.  I'll find a way to make money if and when I ever care.</div></div><hr />

Update on gold:<br />
At 39 I only have 41 gold, looks like no mount for me at 40 since I also have to buy all my mail armor at 40.<br />

I am TS ho so I am perpetually broke. Plus I flush out my spells/skills. Oh and its painful to send all my green+ drops to my chanter for disenchanting.  But duoing with my 37 hunter is pretty much a cash cow (between them 240 mining, 265 skinning, 243 herb).<br />
<br />
But I am not rushing to 60 and a mount is gravy to +40% speed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Update - I see that at lvl 25 I ahd 8g after buying all my spells.  I am now about to hit lvl 33, and have 12g, after not training any feral skills for my druid for last 5 levels.  <br />
<br />
I was trying to save 1g per level in 20's, and was ahead of the curve in mid-twenties.  Topped out at 16g at level 28, then fell behind when my leathercrafting started demanding supplies from other professions.<br />
<br />
I am still contributing all wool/silk to a tailor in guild, which would have added up to about another gold by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I just dinged level 24 and have 1.5 gold to my name after buying my spells. My Skinning is around 190, so in the next few levels I will need 4.5 gold to train it to the Artisan level.<br />
<br />
One way to make money that I have found to be enjoyable is to do ALL quests in a certain area. For example, I have been doing various grey/green Ratchet quests that are raising my reputation with Ratchet. I have no idea if it will end up being useful or not, but Goblin quests tend to be a lot of fun and involve killing humanoids, which drop both money and items. You do get some XP from all this, but it's slow and a good way to make money if you realize that you are close to leveling and have no money in the bank to get your new skills/spells.<br />
<br />
Overall, I have been very happy with the money management aspect of the game. In EQ1, for someone like myself who did relatively little raiding for NO DROP items (and by the time we were doing, say, Luclin, you could find better items in the Bazaar anyway), it was all about farming tens of thousands of pp via gem drops, VT, etc while XPing. It did get me all my spells by the time my Shaman hit 65, but eventually it got to be somewhat tedious.<br />
<br />
In WoW, money management is a fun game in and of itself, but, like AHs, TSing, instances, you don't really have to concentrate on it if you don't want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Fight animals. Animal parts seem to sell better, stack well, and drop pretty often. I was making 20-25 gold per loot run off level 50-52 hippos, started doing humanoids to pickpocket chests, dropped to 5-10 gold per loot run.<br />
<br />
Seems to be the same way at all levels that I have seen.<br />

You might think that's a lot, but once a while a purple item will show up in AH that bid at 100g.   How those ppl can spend so much gold in an item is beyond me.  <br />
<br />
I think it is not worthwhile to spend too much money on armor/weapon once you hit 50.  Most of your drops will come from places like Zul, Temple of Hakkar, or Blackrock Deep.  <br />
<br />
Smithing yields me decent income.  My thorium belt sells mostly for 6g in AH, and it cost me simply 12 thorium bar and some free gems to make.  <br />

Just bought my mount :).<br />
<br />
Money comes much easier past 40.  I basically just stopped skilling up in leatherworking for 3-4 levels and sold the leather for cash.  That and a few random drops (never more than 5g) was all it really took.  I never really got any good instance loot either.  Upgraded to mostly full mail from the AH at 40 also.  <br />
<br />
I made a decent amount buying vendor recipes and selling them for 1g profit -  lots of people have not found thottbot yet I guess. That and they just haven't travelled much I spose.  All on the same two recipes that respawn on the vendor like every 2-4 hrs no less.  <br />
<br />
Much like EQ, there is good money in exploiting people's tradeskill addictions.</div></div><hr />

One thing I notice as you go up in level, the amount of money flux you encounter grows. You spend more because your needs grow but you gain access to higher paying quests, Vendor Trash, sellable items, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting! When I fight animals, I spend too much time on skinning and leatherworking and don't seem to make much money, but I'll have to start paying closer attention. Humanoids seem to drop more when you add dropped money (up to 1+ silver per kill from the mid-twenties on) to the items that they drop, but that was purely my impression plus what everybody else was saying on the message boards. Of course, in 1999 everybody knew that DEX affected spell interrupts :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">For those who are sub 40 and worrying about cash, it will come. The comment about 40+ is spot on. I was roaming doing my TS quests/upgrades past 225 yesterday and was killing 40-42 mobs (my duo are both 38) and was raking in the cash. Drops off of animals were selling for 6-15sp each (not a stack single items, not including thick skins, mithril, and herbs I came upon while roaming). I made like 1gp in like 10 minutes just screwing around killing bears and lions. Course that tends to happen when u spend more time finding mobs/lotting corpses than killing. There also seems to be a point where resists become less of an issue. I used to struggle to kill mobs 3 levels higher due to resists. Now I am whacking reds fairly easily (singles of course). Not as good xp/loot for effort but lets me hunt in higher areas then before relative to my level at the time.<br />
<br />
The other way to do it is to go a grey camp and murder it over and over again. The centaur camp in Thousand Needles is good for this (for me). They drop silk usually, and 50cp-3sp a mob and I you can knock em down REAL fast (taking em 3-4 at a time). Nother good camp (if u can take the faction hit) is the valley of bones in desolace. The undead/centaurs are like 37-39 and drop 2-3sp often and silk/mageweave frequently. Its quiet in both spots usually on my mid-high pop server.<br />

I've heard people mention thottbot and buying rare recipes from vendors.  Color me stupid, but I can't seem to figure out how they are seeing this on thottbot without looking at every single vendor.<br />
<br />
Some recipes have spawn cycles on the vendor, which means that only 1 can be purchased in a certain period of time. It took me 3 days of checking the alchemy vendor in orgrimmar for the free action recipe. I spent well under a gold for it. At the auction house I seen bids as high as 3gp for it.<br />
<br />
Thottbot will list the vendors name that has the recipe for sale.</div></div><hr />
