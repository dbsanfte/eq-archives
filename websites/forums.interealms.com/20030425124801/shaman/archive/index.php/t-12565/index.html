     Could some of you guys,who have bought or priced a REIF, please tell me what the average cost on your server was? I'm trying to do a price comparison.  Thanks for taking the time.  (I'll tell you what I paid after I find out how badly I was raked over the coals)!!</div></div><hr />

On Emarr they usually average from 8-10K. Every once in a while see one for 7k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On Bristlebane they run about 5k...   Although you can get lucky and pick them up cheaper, think I paid 3k for mine...   In my opinion it's the best weapon a lower level Shaman can get (pre 40 now)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've just started looking (since last week), and I've only seen 1 vendor selling this on Errolsi Marr - he wants 10k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They run 6 to 8k  on terris thule that i have seen, i paid 6k for mine,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tear44</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Been selling for around 4k to 5k on Dro</div></div><hr />

First off, thank you very much for the info.  I appreciate the people taking the time to respond.<br />
Secondly, it looks like I caught a break in the bazaar,  I paid 2.5K for mine last night.  I know I waited awhile, but i didn't decide to start working on piercing untill about 2 weeks ago.  For those of you who think that 44 is too high to start a new wepon skill, It isn't.  I used to think so also, but thanks to some great advise on this fourm, I started it, and I'm at about 100 right now.  I'm hoping the REIF's lower delay (was using a Spine Chill Spear) will help even more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Edarb Everbuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On D Ro I bought mine for 3k about 4 months ago and just sold like 2 weeks ago for 5k and bought a lizzy.  I thought it was an overpriced weapon.<br />
