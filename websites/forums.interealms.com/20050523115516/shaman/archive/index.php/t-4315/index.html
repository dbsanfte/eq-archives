now how can it be that the 55  heal spell  is worse then the 51 . the mana ratio isnt even better . i thought this was a upgrade to regrowth . doh =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Regrowth? This has nothing to do with regrowth, a looooong heal over time spell. Ratio may be worse but it's much faster casting so you CAN heal more damage in the same amount of time plus the range on chloroblast is way way longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not to mention that if you're maxxed Alt specialization, then more casts will ultimately mean less mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">actually, you are wrong, mana ratio IS better on chloroblast...<br />
<br />
583 / 250 = 2.332<br />
<br />
428 / 175 = 2.445<br />
<br />
and besides, the faster cast time makes it a very good spell...</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea i know it has nothing ot do with that . i was excited aobut getting close to it . i see its just a normal heal spell . but honeest . there is a 1.5 second difference . i cant see this helping in anyway . Sup heal for MORE hp should be the better route . anyone know this for sure ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Chloroblast is essentially a druid/shaman version of cleric Remedy, its fast casting and has double the range of Superior Heal.<br />
<br />
Yes it heals for less than Superior, thats the pay off for faster/longer range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have mem'd superior heal like, oh, once since I got chloroblast. It helps alot. Its a better spell, it costs less mana per cast and is a better ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Try it and see if you won't believe me. I tried switching to  superior heal at one point but it's way too slow casting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
to me it looks like its not a real upgrade. just a faster way to accomplish the same thing.<br />
<br />
well right on , would rather had a upgrade to regrowth ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">one thin no one has mentioned yet.<br />
<br />
The range on Chloroblast is larger than Sup. Heal.<br />
<br />
Damn useful for AE encounters and if your in velks you can heal one of your monks, he will FD and tada... auto pulling :)<br />
<br />
Not sure on how much further enhanced range 3 item gives tho..<br />
<br />
Believe me when you get chloroblast you'll find yourself using it as the main heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">right on . i try to not be the main healer anyway . actualy im seeing the point to it now.  less mana for the heals that jump in when the cleric forgets to cast or shouts OOM .<br />
<br />
<br />
ok i dont feel cheated . i guess my disapointment it wasnt a regrowth upgraded didnt help my clarity  either</div></div><hr />

Here's the numbers you want:<br />
<br />
Sup Heal is 583 hps every 4.5 sec, or 130hps per second.<br />
<br />
'blast is 428hps every 3 sec, or 143hps sec.<br />
<br />
If you are trying to hold a tank together in a tough fight (not something we're very good at) 'blast is better. If you are trying to save a battered chanter, speed counts, 'blast is better. <br />
<br />
As a cleric I dropped Sup Heal and never looked back when I got Remedy.  You'll love it :-)</div></div><hr />

i look foward to it then :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azazel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It generates less agro. Thats the best reason I know to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Superior Heal's range is 100. (same as CH)<br />
Chloroblast range is 200. Quite noticeable when you need it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But; all this time I though the Sup heal ratio was better than Chrolo.  I've been memming both! :/  Now i dont' have to. Thank god, a spell slot free!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I can confirm that the range on this is very very long. I accidently caused a wipeout on Itraer Vius one night because I didn't realize that the enchanter in my group had been knocked back into the far back corner of the room and adds were pummeling him. I thought he was just being rampaged. Anyhow, chloroblast hit him from the carpet, and the mobs all came arunnin'! Hehe, that was embarassing. Never noticed how long of a range it h ad before that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Chloroblast is all around better: better ratio, huge range, faster casting, and even the gimpiest, laggiest Shaman could squeeze it in between ticks.</div></div><hr />

For a single heal, yes this is true.  But if you have to heal a person more than once then sup heal actually heals more per second by about ~5hp per second.  The thing that was not considered is recast delay.<br />
<br />
Chloroblast is a better spell, and it is more mana efficient, and even has a better heal/sec ratio UNLESS you cast it twice in a row.  Not picking a fight, just making the facts clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">either way they bolth rock , and in the case of trying to make that life saving heal that you just barely have time to get off , blast is better . i do know there has been many time that the cleric forgot to say OOM or we didnt hear her and the driuid and me missed that life saving heal by what would seemingly feel like a plsit second . perhaps with this they would have lived</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tanilin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just because I'm a nitpicker:<br />
<br />
The hp/second is a bit more complicated than is being indicated above.<br />
<br />
In the following examples I assume recast delay is 2 seconds and that you cast instantly after that time is over.<br />
<br />
If you cast ONCE: Chloroblast at 142.7 hp/s vs Sup Heal at 129.6 hp/s<br />
If you cast TWICE: Chloroblast at 107 hp/s vs. Sup Heal at 106 hp/s<br />
If you cast THRICE: Chloroblast at 98.8 hp/sec vs. Sup Heal at 99.9 hp/sec<br />
<br />
(the asymptotic results are 85.6 hp/s vs 89.9 hp/s)<br />
<br />
The differences come about because you only care about recast delay inbetween casts, NOT after the last cast. <br />
<br />
Given these numbers, it should be clear that Superio Healing is not as good a spell as Chloroblast unless you cast superior healing at least 3 times in a row.<br />
<br />
Most of the time if you have to do that, things are going to pot anyway. :P</div></div><hr />
