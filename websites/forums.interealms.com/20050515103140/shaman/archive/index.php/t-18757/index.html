<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For ****s and giggles, went to veksar with a couple people last night. Only spent about an hour and a half there, but what I was amazed at during that short time, 2 Words of Agony and 107 Left dropped. I haven't been there in so long, I checked it out a bunch of times after the revamp, but that was it, and that was quite some time ago. <br />
<br />
For those that maybe hunt there frequently, is this common, or were we just extremely lucky? I'm thinking the latter but just wanted some opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I camp the warlock room with my necro for a few hours a day to support all my spending habits.<br />
<br />
I get about 3-4 agony's a week aswell as MANY other words.. still  no 73 right tho</div></div><hr />
