<br />
i have just logged in and wanted to go to my usual veksar spot ( highborn) and as runninng thro shop ( obviously IVU) i get attacked . well i zone out as i have a horde on my tail and retry thinking IVU must have faded . I go back and con each mob in the shop and well , now 2 mobs in there see thro IVU . I hope this is a bug but i have a feeling it isnt . has anyone else experienced this since last patch ? I have been to veksar 100's of times b4 and this has never happened in the shop area</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When i was last there the Summoning was a suprise.<br />
But did not have a See invis problem.<br />
<br />
Hope this has not been nerfed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went there yesterday afternoon and didn't have any see me while passing through the shop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a couple of friends that duo there quite a bit, a necro and a paladin, they basically can take any camp there up to and including pulling a few highborn if they are careful, they have never mentioned any troubles with random see invis mobs even after the patch....possible that you had someones ex-pet aggro you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stinki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There has always been a chance for a see invis mob starting from the shop and beyond.  It occurs very rarely, but I always con mobs before running through the shop.<br />
<br />

Stinki</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stinki's right.  Always con before progressing.  Otherwise, you might run into one that sees invis running through there.  While it's not crowded, there might be someone camping the haste belt mob, or down below at the highborn spot.  That could be one helluva train heading back to LoIO.<br />
<br />
Pally/Necro wouldn't have any problem with anything other than Guardon there.  I two box it all the time.  Only mob that causes a problem is Synthrax.  He can whoop ya if you're not on your game.  Other camps can be done easily by any melee/priest combo.  Veksar is a nice switch from Droga on occasions.</div></div><hr />

tommy back <br />

all is good in veksar as stinki says maybe very very rarely a see through invis undead mob may be there (in shops). I personally have spent 45aa's lvling in there ( and thats a long haul ) I know every nook and cranny and every spawn point of every named . have duoed sythrax with friend (my gear and hp wont allow me to try solo ) , so u could say i know the area , this is just a first for me in all that time . thnx for the heads up</div></div><hr />

ohh thanx Kromnik , but zone was empty (totally ) hence i trained it . if zone was crowded i would have used one of my many vials of swirling smoke to evac out ( they cost 1050pp) . can afford these as i have farmed the zone for a very very long time and have an abundance of pp (and i mean an abundance) whats a guys s'posed to do when he finds POP and GoD tedious beyond beleif . IMHO this was the last zone added which kept the old feel of eq going .<br />
anyway enough drunken saturday night ramblings  . take care all</div></div><hr />
