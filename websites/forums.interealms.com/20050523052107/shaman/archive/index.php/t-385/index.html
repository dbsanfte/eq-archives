<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hullo. I'm a mid 30s shammy, and I'm getting close to the level for can 2, and I'm thinking if I should even bother.. The difference between it and 1 seems to be downright minimal. I cann dance myself, so the only difference to me is in how many hops it takes for me to get my hitpoints low enough to stop dancing.<br />
<br />
Any higher ups want to comment on cann 2? Do the numbers lie about it's usefulness?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tiqua Sunrise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe it was when they finally changed it.  I was level 51 or 52 and still got it even though I would get Canni III at level 54.  Here is the basic stats that you get (info derived from EqCaster)<br />
<br />
Cannibalize I - 2.5 to 1.78 hp for every mana point<br />
Cannibalize II - 2.23 to 1.86 hp <br />
Cannibalize III - 1.89 to 1.80 hp<br />
Cannibalize IV - 1.83 to 1.80 hp<br />
<br />
*first number when you get the spell and 2nd number when you reach level 60.<br />
<br />
So judge for yourself it if is worth the hassle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Short answer, yes, it's worth it.  Got mine at like 50 or thereabouts, wished I got it sooner.  It's not about the ratio, it's about how fast it gets you mana back, and for that, Cann2&gt;Cann1.  Mind you, the quest is a serious pain...</div></div><hr />
