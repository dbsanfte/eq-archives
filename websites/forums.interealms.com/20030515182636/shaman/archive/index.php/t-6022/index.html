<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking for things to solo in the grey yesterday and wandered over to the sun rev camp at the pond in the nw (or was it ne?) corner. The revs are white to me at 55 but they dont summon, can be single pulled and are melee only. <br />
<br />
They dont have huge pr/dr, like most undead do, and are pretty easy to root rot on the zone wall behind the camp. One of my pulls went bad and I did get my butt handed to me once. Luckliy I had some guildies to help me out with a rez or I woulda been seriously sol. Its a good idea to keep some fish scales in the bank in case you need to do a cr hahahaha.<br />
<br />
Warning these guys are pretty tough and take quite a while to bring down. It was taking most of my bar of mana (170 wis) to kill them. Since the exp changes you get some pretty good exp for killin em though. I saw my bar move after each kill =). When they get low on health they do go berzerk kinda and can kill you fast so keep em rooted and well away from you (this is what caused my death as I ran low on mana and tried to run when it was almost dead.)<br />
<br />
Just another place to check out if you need a challenge and some exp.</div></div><hr />
