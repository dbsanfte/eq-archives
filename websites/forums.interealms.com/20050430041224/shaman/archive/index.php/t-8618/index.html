<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit level 35 today. But I realised how boring it was going to DSP every day for hours on end just for a few levels. I would like to do something, possibly solo, like a quest or something. Can I start Totemic questing at this level? Any ideas for different but equally as beneficial zones to hunt in aside from DSP (in groups or solo).?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can definitely do Totemic questing at your level.  Park yourself in SK near the ponies (1k, 1k i think) and start working on getting Grizzleknot to spawn.  Took me two weeks.<br />
<br />
Also start watching for the bear in the caves.  He has two PH ice bone skellys that roam.  Kill them, do something for 6 and a half hours, go back and repeat as necessary.<br />
<br />
Get those two out of the way and in comparison the rest is easy or green.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ebon War Spear camp in OOT is appropriate for your level iirc.  Totemic Armor quests as well.  At 35, you should also consider trying to hit some dungeons as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure I would do totemic now. I did it a couple years ago and it felt great, now I am trying to sell teh stuff and have to ask less then the price of the dufrenite to get rid of it. Use the plat for the dufrenite to buy it or better. If you are bored, try doing some dungeon crawls solo or with small group. That keeps you on your toes. Maybe permafrost. I didn't do too many quests, I like action more then running around looking for stuff. Do the ebon war spear if you don't have a good range wis piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hiya Lvl 36 shammy here (main char), and I've jumped up to cheap jb and Ry`Gorr to replace almost all my totemic (I like the ext buff on the BP).  From a utilty standpoint alone, go to the Bazarr and buy your gear, prbably non-totemic stuff 'cause the totemic seems to be at a slight premium to other comparable gear.<br />
<br />
That being said to be a &quot;real&quot; shamman do at least a few of the totemic quests ( I bought the BP and Helm).  They are fun, and at 35 all pretty easy, except the BP and Helm which are huge time-sinks for most.  Great walk-through at the EQShaman, I think (too lazy to check that or here).<br />
<br />
Also totemic looks cool :)<br />
<br />
I did lvl 35 at the Giant Fort in FM.  Dark blues mostly, fair loot, got 2 forest loops in about 3/4 of the lvl sell to vendor in FV for 280pp each maybe a bit more in the baz.  Parked dogdog on the hill then pulled with slow and meleed 'em down to max out  defense.  Very safe hunting once ya learn to pull safely from the fort.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did the totemic quests from 28-34, and I got all the pieces save the cloak (I had better).<br />
<br />
It was nicer than my banded, but shortly after, the bazaar opened and I was able to buy cheap jbb and other stuff for less than it cost for the dufrenite... I had to sell my stuff back for less than what I paid for it. <br />
<br />
I wore my totemic helm for 20 levels though, so that was worth it.<br />
<br />
But I wouldn't bother with the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Totemic quests are a very good way to break the daily grind. Yeah, the money could be better spent then the stones needed for the quest, but look at it as spending virtual money on something to keep the game interesting. :)</div></div><hr />
