<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Veakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question.  I have passed through the myconid area in Sebilis to hunt Juggs/reets a couple of times so I know the layout and route as well as what kind of class mobs to expect.  But I have never really killed off the king or it's ph area.  So I'm curious to know from others who may have tried this or who can offer some insight, if a 65 druid, 63 shammy both with all spells and a 65 rogue with about 6500hps/1275ac can hold the king camp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been doing it with a 65 shaman/65 monk combo for the last month.  It's not a hard camp as long as you don't get more than 2 priest/adepts in camp at the same time.  Don't expect to get a fungi anytime soon tho.  This camp reminds me of raster.  The king pop's fairly often but i've had about 10-12 robes so far.  The only savings grace is I've gotten one cobolt bracer and about 10 aa each durring this time.<br />
<br />
I get virt/kei to start as it makes it easier but it's still cake once you figure out the roamers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you can do it solo with outside buffs quite easily. Getting to camp is a PITA, but its definatly doable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Veakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wooo.  Things worked great.  With my 3 guys, I fought down to the rock, leapt off into the water, fell down, then had my rogue pull the froggies befor emoving into jail then moved into the corridor and sat in the corner just before the zone out door.  There, I had my rogue pull any wandering myconids and if there weren't any and it seems clear on both sides, I ran all three of my guys across the small pond water, moved to the south wall in the king area and omg, I can kill the wanderers without aggroing the three in the throne spot.  That was so tight to know.  So I killed off the wanderers by the south wall before having my shaman target the king ph (reaver).  My rogue then targetted the priest that was up (the third was just a warrior).  Then my rogue pulled, naturally all 3 came.  My rogue jacked the priest up while my shaman slowed them all, starting with the reaver.  I know these healers like to start healing at 50%, so around 55%, I had my druid cast moonfire before casting Storm Fury (which had a stun effect) and stunned it.  Then I had my druid cast a second moonfire and if the priest casted it's cheal again, I had my shaman use a clikky idol (5 charges Holy Might from Stonebrunt) and stun it again.  I smacked down so many healers this way, except the adepts, and it was great.  Once I cleared it, I was hecka happy.  Then next spawn, King popped and guess what?  Fungi Tunic!!!<br />
<br />
I stayed at this camp for another 8-9 hours and got 4 robes, a cobalt bracer, 2 different clikky mushrooms but no more tunics :(.  I also discovered that once I clear the three in the throne spot, if I didn't want to have to deal with wanderers, I could bring my three up onto the throne itself and wanderers never aggro me even if i sit down.  Man, I learned so much from this camp it was great.  Made 2k in loot from this camp before bringing my guys back to zone in and camping out for the night.  BUt tomorrow is a new day and man am I going back to farm more tunics!  Of course there is this path at 4am and once servers get back up in 3 hours, my guild's gonna raid.  /sigh.  I so wanna just farm more tunics, but a raid is a raid and better equip for my shamm or rogue or druid would be tight.<br />
<br />
Oh, the tunic sells for 75-100k on my server and the cobalt bracer 30-40k.  I was in desperate need of cash before attempting this camp and now I got one of each item.  Cash problem solved, time to get my 64 spells and ornate!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Before they nerfed the droprate, I used to solo that guy quite a bit. The trickiest part was the healing mushrooms, but using bash, and pet helped a lot with that. The corner was by far the best place to camp in. <br />
<br />
Now its pretty easy to split the mushrooms, the inital pull is always the hardest.<br />
<br />
Congrats on the tunic. The cash will come in handy for you :)</div></div><hr />

Oh and you're right.  The initial pull is nuts.  After my first visit, when I came back 3-4 times later, it was partially easier, partially difficult.  Easy since I go to the south wall this time to avoid most wanderers.  Difficult because of those darn healers just like you said.  Priests and adepts, god I hate them all.  The days over now, but I replenished my shammy's supply of forlorn totems with the 5 charge of holy might stuns and I managed to sell my first tunic for 80k which I used to proceed to get my Pox of Bertoxx spell for 2500pp, Breath of Ulthor for 4500pp and my Spiritstone of the Banished for 1500pp.  Good prices, and now I'm constantly checking up on my Ornate boots/bracer patterns, hoping to find a deal, as well as Fo7, Quisence, Malos, Talisman of Alacrity (my 64 spell I'm still lacking lol) and Replenishment/BoR.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow, after a quick morning haircut, it's back to Sebilis and hoping for a 2nd tunic.  Ornate is so expensive here on Inny :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Some items i've found on this is VP is king - VP3 is godly. Grummas is for kings.  Use Dog-Dog as an off tank and might as well use Yogi bear as a speed bump - dps is dps and pets help with interrupts.  I used my Cobalt bracer plus some cash I had for Ornate Boots (45k).  Well worth the cost.  You have snare so it's not so important but I was using GI for root as it's a 2 sec cast for the runners.  <br />
<br />
I killed the roamers both for XP and it let me clear everything out so the King and friends were not getting any help while I was killing them if I had anything to say on it.<br />
