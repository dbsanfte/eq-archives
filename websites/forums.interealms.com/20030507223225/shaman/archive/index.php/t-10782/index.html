<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking to start the Thurgadin armor quests, as I already am ally to the dorfs...  <br />
<br />
How often does the corroded armor drop in Kael, and is it only in the Kael arena I can get it?  Unfortunately, I can only rely on joining a pickup group or a raid in progress. Is it realistic to think I can get some corroded, or any very good pieces of armor here?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Chain drops are pretty rare in Kael, you'll mostly see plate and silk. Took me almost 10 arena raids before I finallly won the corroded chain legs. During that time I never saw a chain BP and only two other legs drop. Saw more damn torn enchanted silk than I care to remember.<br />
<br />
You can also hunt the bank area for drops. You need to kill lieutenants or above for any corroded drops. Lots of watchman spawn there and they don't drop any of it.<br />
<br />
Good luck, you'll need it :)</div></div><hr />

You didn't post your server. :(<br />
If you are on a mature server, you can probably buy Corroded Chain Multiquests (&quot;chainings&quot;) from those repairing their dragon faction if you have the money for it.<br />
<br />
Arena is usually camped by upper 40's and lower 50's working on armor upgrades, and also by a few 60's w/ some lower level friends leeching exp while the high 50's-low60's repair CoV faction.<br />
<br />
You have a good shot at getting the Gladiator Chain Leggings if you are raiding the Arena though.  These are decent enough legs.<br />
I just destroyed mine (had them banked as CR gear) today.<br />
<br />
The most common chain drops in Kael in my experience are the gloves, which are horrible for a shaman.<br />
<br />
I would work on staying in Kael Arena (praying for chain drops) until you are ally with Claws of Veeshan.  Then set your sights higher on the Skyshrine Armor.  Much better stuff overall.<br />
<br />
Expect to see 1 or 2 chain drops there in a rather full night of raiding if you are fortunate.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

 We also had leather and silk bp drop on that raid from same area.</div></div><hr />
