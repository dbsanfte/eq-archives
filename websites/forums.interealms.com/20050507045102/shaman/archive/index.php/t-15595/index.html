<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brindelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys I have read a few different posts about the canni macro but it seems to not be working for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do this <br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast slow<br />
/pause 2 or so<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
<br />
The only problem is my guy wont sit back down, I've tried /sit, /sit off again just about everything I can think of.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kvak1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Change pause to 35 and it should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You have to pause long enough for the spell to finish casting.  You are probably getting a message like &quot;cannot perform this action at this time&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
The /pause increments are approximately 1/10 of a second, so check the cast time of the spell and multiply by 10.<br />
<br />
Why are you casting slow in a canni macro?<br />
<br />
BTW I use a slightly different macro<br />
<br />
/stand<br />
/pause 8, /cast 7<br />
/pause xx, /cast 7<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
where xx is long enough to deal with the casting of your cannibalize (varies from Cann I - Cann IV).  This means that if I fizzle on the first attempt, or if I just hit the button a bit early, I still get the canni off.<br />
<br />
The gotcha here is that the /pause command takes place at the END of the line it's on, even though it appears at the BEGINNING of the line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>brindelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes I meant /cast canni<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok thank you for your help, I was not getting the error about not enough time to cast my spell I would just cast it then remain standing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will try the macro you gave me and see how it works, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Speyburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i use this micro for canni on downtime <br />
<br />
/pause 40, /cast 6<br />
/pause 40, /cast 6<br />
/pause 40, /cast 6<br />
/pause 40, /cast 6<br />
/cast 6<br />
<br />
i use it to practice my casting too:-)<br />
i hope it helps<br />
<br />
edit it to make &quot;downtime&quot; bold and underline so people can see it  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Remember that once you start the macro you can't interrupt it - it WILL run to completion and start casting canni for you.  Hence, I never use a multi-canni macro like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phroke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just use<br />
<br />
/cast 5<br />
/cast 5<br />
/cast 5<br />
/cast 5<br />
/cast 5<br />
<br />
Takes care of any fizzles, and it completes the macro commands very fast. Means I have to press the macro button once per canni, but at least i'm not stuck in a macro cycle I can't get out of if something comes up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mrwallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use the macro I read on this board some time ago:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 1  - (That's where I have it memmed)<br />
/cast 1  - (to catch the fizzle)<br />
/pause 15 - (I'm using cann2..you have to adjust for different levels)<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
Remember, if you have a mount, you always get the &quot;sitting&quot; tick so you don't have to dance anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually if you time the casting right you can cast another spell on the pause...  I use a similar macro to the downtime one and have had to cast another spell between castings...  Just got to time the casting...<br />

<br />
Exactly.  Canni-macros don't make you mediocre.  Not using them doesn't make you good or better.<br />
<br />
There's so many measures of a good shammy, this just isn't one of them.<br />
<br />
Neither is hydraing good or bad, it simply is.  Some people are good at, some are bad, it isn't a bad thing in itself, its in how you use it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Alright *******s, no need to twist my words, I said nothing about hydraing, or agro, or being anyones hero...<br />
<br />
I said The difference between being mediocre and being good is in paying attention.<br />
<br />
Whats wrong with that statement?  Do you need me to write a 3 paragragh explanation of my meaning so you can understand it? or will you just try to twist the explanation even further?  Pull your head out of your ass and stop trying to pick fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Alright *******s, no need to twist my words, I said nothing about hydraing, or agro, or being anyones hero...There was no twisting of words.  If you wanted someone to understand you differently than your two sentence statement, maybe you SHOULD have explained yourself.<br />
<br />
You made a statement not to do something, then you stated that the difference between a mediocre shaman is paying attention, in the same paragraph.  There is an implication that these two sentences are connected in some way.  Macros allow you to do things without necessarily paying attention to the details.  You're also giving inane advice(don't macro canni) that makes something more difficult than it should be(a macro removes some of the burden of this activity).  Doing something, &quot;the hard way&quot;, i.e. without a macro is often done to prove a person's masculinity.  You are clearly recommending the hard way, for no good reason, that you have explained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Perhaps instead of flaming me you could have disagreed? or questioned my meaning?<br />
<br />
You are the ******* who flamed.. go **** yourself if you cant figure out what I meant... if the original poster would like a longer explanation of my meaning I will give it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I no longer use any canni-dance macro. It really does slow down the mana regeneration process, because you can sit a tad bit before the spell actually goes off, and it will still go off while you are considered sitting for the tick. (The same goes for casting and then moving for kiting around those big bad yellow-red cons.)<br />
<br />
Having used macros a lot, I simply no longer trust them. I'm not so lazy and distracted that I can't push three little buttons to get just a slight edge out of the process.<br />
<br />
I'm old school, and still don't believe that horses exist (I do not use Luclin models, they're ****ing ugly).<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, Slurm is absolutely right. Those who are arguing against the idea that paying attention makes a better EQ player, are people who suck at this game and probably got where they are by holding hands with guildies. Anyone can get max level by sitting in a group and sucking.<br />
<br />
You won't know who I am, I don't use this name for a character anymore. (Which reminds me, it's time for a new account, my post count is getting too large.)<br />
<br />
So why is it when I group people tell me things like &quot;Damn! You're the best Shaman I've ever grouped with!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not because I'm uber l33t mad skillz OMG!!1!!!1111, but simply because I pay attention and have been doing this Shaman thing for over three years, not even counting my time away from the game. When I start over I come up from scratch, with no twinking, no multi-boxing, no power-leveling, no begging and no paying for outside buffs. EQ is not a hard game, but it does require attention.<br />
<br />
Also, unlike some of you that shouldn't even be playing these kinds of games, I LOVE the xp grind. If you hate it, leave and don't look back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Slurm... they are interpreting your statement exactly as it is written.<br />
<br />
As written, you are being a twit and giving 100% useless advice.<br />
<br />
If you meant something more, then say what you meant and don't expect people to read in something that isn't even vaguely implied by what you wrote</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except no one is actually arguing that not paying attention is a good thing.  If that is the case, please point it out to me.  If you don't use a macro to canni dance, good for you, that doesn't make you a better shaman, it just makes you inefficient and the type of person that likes to do things as difficult as possible so you can measure the length of your online peen by telling other people not to macro as well.<br />
<br />
If you can make any substantial argument as to why people that macro their canni suck comparative to the people that don't macro I'm all ears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Except no one is actually arguing that not paying attention is a good thing.

The problem is that unless my connection is absolutely perfect, Canni IV lasts like .3 seconds longer than a mana tick, so after about 3 cannis, I'm not longer in sync with the mana regen cycle.  It was way more efficient with canni3, so I just feel it out with my connection and decide when to use the dance with canni4 or not(that's paying attention, Slurm).<br />
<br />
If you can make any substantial argument as to why people that macro their canni suck comparative to the people that don't macro I'm all ears.There isn't one.<br />
<br />
And to Slurm.  If my original statement was inflammatory, then I guess your following statements have just been napalm fires, which doesn't say much about you.  Have the common courtesy to not swear at people.  It just makes you look like a child.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I use both, the macro and the &quot;paying attention&quot; mode.<br />
<br />
It is physically impossible to pay close attention for hours at a time.  Hence, in downtimes, I use a macro for ease of use (and to relieve carpal tunnel since I can hit the '6' key to invoke the macro instead of clicking the mouse).<br />
<br />
When someone's life is on the line, especially mine, I have the left hand on CTRL-S and the right hand ready to click Cannibalize.  CTRL-S, click, CTRL-S the instant the spell is done.<br />
<br />
Even in downtime, though, I won't use a multi-cann macro just because it ties me up for so long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Outdoor zones:  Use a mount.<br />
Indoor zones:  Get Kei, and never sit.  Just canni to your hearts content.<br />
<br />
Macros worked up until Canni 4, then its casting time was just too long.  One fizzle, and you get off with Canni 4.<br />
<br />
Easiest way to handle downtime, is to sit down somewhere safe.  Go away a few minutes, get a soda, make a sandwich, whatever.  Come back after sufficient amount of time, and you are full mana.<br />
<br />
To Slurm:  The difference in being a good shaman and a mediocre shaman, is not sucking at playing your class.  No matter how you do it.<br />
<br />
To gandalfh:  Just say no to one boxing  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">kei &gt; canni<br />
<br />
i think i have canni'd all of like once in my lifetime, though i will use the canni downtime one now..thanks! =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">kei &gt; canni<br />
<br />

<br />
kei AND canni &gt; all. If you don't cannibalize because you have kei up, you're missing the ungodly potential of our mana regen.<br />
<br />
As for the paying attention remarks; I find the canni macro actually HELPS me pay attention. By having a single hotkey to canni, I am much more capable of watching group chat, F9ing out to check surroundings, and timing a spell swap out without breaking the rhythm. All of the above CAN be done with user controlled stand, cast, catch fizzle, and sit but it's taking up a lot more of my attention than it needs to.<br />
<br />
So while I agree with the arguement that a good shaman is one who pays attention, I would argue that you're putting your attention in the wrong place.<br />
<br />
Now I have a horse so there is no canni dance. Instead, there's the melee dance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I don't bother with a canni dance macro...I sat there for like an hour trying to get the pause right, increasing it one increment (i.e. pause 30, 31, 32 ,33 etc.) and none ever worked properly...either it was too short , too long, id miss the sit regen part, etc. I got so pissed I said **** it, so I just do it myself. Although, I do have a chain cast canni hotkey when my fingers need a little break hehe.</div></div><hr />
