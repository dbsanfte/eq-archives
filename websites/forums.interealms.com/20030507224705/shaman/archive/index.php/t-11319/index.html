<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>seraphem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a thought for some of the admins/experienced residents.  I troll here occasionally and there seem to be quite a few posts asking questions about equipment.  One thing I’ve seen on the Druid’s Grove that I think might be helpful here is best of the best threads discussing each armor slot.  Scirroco(sp?), one of the veteran druids, usually starts these threads off with a comparison of the top items for a given slot.  Generally the items compared are no drop items, but usually a couple items are droppable and there is no reason that the post couldn’t be modified to include more tradable items etc.  I was thinking sticky the best of the best posts (or sticky a thread with links to them all) and when people have a question about upgrades they can refer to that thread.  Something like this might help cut down on the continuous posts asking for suggestions on gear.  Maybe I’m ignorant and something along those lines already exists.  If so please point it out to me. :)<br />
Thanks,<br />
