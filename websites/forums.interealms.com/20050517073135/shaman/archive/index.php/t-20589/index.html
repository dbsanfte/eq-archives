<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Litgruv, please don't make sweeping requests to SOE on behalf of the Crucible.<br />
<br />
When I edit a thread title, I would appreciate you not changing it back, I changed it for a reason.<br />
<br />
You could have called it &quot;Attention SOE, this is what I want to be&quot; that would have been a more accurate statement.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, it was MY thread, not yours , so the right is MINE not yours to name my thread. The mere fact that you had changed it is a level of censorship i really thought you were above. <br />
<br />
Secondly, if you dont agree with something i say, thats fine, but treating this OPEN forum like your personal playground where everyone has to fall in line to what you think or believe is very poor moding. Only sunmoon can reserve this right cause this is HIS forum. I dont recall anyone asking the thread to be closed nor was there any flaming.<br />
<br />
Again, the freedom of my posts is mine. If i wanna name it Google la la la hooza wee ha then its my right. I was adressing a serious topic which is that SoE lacks a vision for our  class cause they simply dont know what to do with us and it was IMHO sparking up a very real dialogue which i had typed a very LONG reply to. There was no &quot;sweeping requests&quot; to SoE, you thought the thread was about melee upgrades. It was not. Had you waited for me to respond before locking my thread you would have found this out. <br />
<br />
<br />
So to sum up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Open minded to others thoughts is good.<br />
<br />
Censorship is bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
I normaly respect you very much, you have shown me kindness in the past and please dont take this a personal attack, but merely a objection to your moding.<br />
<br />
I feel very strongly that it was over moding and moved into the realm of censorship. You may now lock and move this post as you see fit, my point has been made. Good day to you.</div></div><hr />

Since she's the board moderator, she has the right to change your thread title, and she has a right to enforce whatever rules she wants on these boards. She has these rights just as much as you have a right to name your thread how you like or post what you like. Some could argue her rights are greater, since she has the ability, should she care to, to delete your posts and ban you.<br />
<br />
The only accountability she has is to the community she works for. She has to take care to act in the community's best interests and to do things to keep them here and keep this forum useful to them.<br />
<br />
From everything I've seen in the past, she takes this responsibility quite seriously, and from what I've seen on this forum, the community appreciates her efforts and agree, for the most part, with her moderation.<br />
<br />
Just because she did something you didn't like, doesn't make her a bad moderator, and posts like this which basically try to say &quot;**** I'm such a martyr, the big bad evil mods are SO MEAN TO ME&quot; are pointless and amount to basically a baseless attack on the mod.<br />
<br />
If you don't like the rules, you have the right to leave; that's pretty much the only inalienable right you have here (despite what you think about your rights to posting).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If this was your forum, it would be right to name threads, but it's not. Sunmoon has in the past asked individuals not to directly address SOE in posts. <br />
<br />
My original change to your post was just to remove the &quot;SOE&quot; from your title. That you would dub that &quot;censorship&quot; and &quot;over-moderation&quot; is ludicrous. You don't speak for me, or 100% of the other shaman on this board. <br />
<br />
I only locked your post after you changed the title back. If you persist, I'll suspend you.<br />
<br />
PS PMs, learn to use them.</div></div><hr />
