<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got Canni 5 yesterday, and boy is that ability nice!  I should not have waited so long, but things just kept me from doing it.  And after wasting all those points on Mental Clarity, I had to think about something else besides AA for a bit.  :)<br />
<br />
Just tootin' my horn.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah its worth Crowing about....<br />
<br />
It Rocks... at least till that first time you kill yourself with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL!  I've used it about a dozen times so far, and been good about it so far.  Trying to make it a habit to have Torpor on before I hit my hotkey.  :)<br />
<br />
Bad thing is that I used a hotkey that is right next to my hotkey for my slow message.  Fat fingered once and hit the wrong button.  Luckily I was full HP at the time.  whew!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh.  I finally had to put my can5 hotkey in a separate bank.  Shift 4, torpor key, can5 key, shift 2.  Once you get used to the bank switching, it's not bad at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bank switching.... /shudder<br />
<br />
I've been trying to avoid it, but with Radiant Cure coming and then Virulent Paralysis later on it is going to be hard not to have to do switching.  Oh well, live and learn.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have it on my 3rd bank .. and I made a small hotkey telling the gorup i'm using it<br />
<br />
I didn't have that announcement for a while and trust me when i say this .. it seems like a minor courtesy .. but it really is appreciated by those druid/clerics in your group when you lose half hour life in a blink of an eye.<br />
<br />
so to sumarize, Congrats :) and make a hotkey telling your group you're canni-ing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I moved all my AA 'spell' abilities to a seperate bank.  Then the left button in each column is the announcement and /alt activate, and the right button is the raw key from the AA page.  That lets me tell at a glance whether an ability is up for reuse or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Interesting Twoflower.  So 1 would be the announcement and 2 would be Canni 5.  3 would be an announcement and 4 would be the abilitiy.<br />
<br />
Cool idea.  Gotta go find the /alt codes and try this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I never announce canni5; I just map the hotkey from aa window so I can always see when it pops, and I can mash the button to see how long before repop etc.<br />
<br />
I also map it to slot 10 in every hotkey bank I use, so I never have to go looking either ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm running out of slots on bank 1 though Grogbat.  And if I am going to have to switch banks regularly now, Twoflower's idea sounds like a good one.  Can use the real hotkey from the AA purchase window, and have the announcement next to it.<br />
<br />
Problem is that you have to switch banks just to see if it is ready or not... hmmm</div></div><hr />

Switching banks is a bit of pain but considering the alternative (a very embarrasing death), it's worth it imo. I've yet to die from a canni V, but I've ducked out of it a couple of times - thank god it's not an insta-cast. You can also hit the 'greyed out' button which will give you the time left til repop. I've almost gotten to the point where I 'know' when it's going to pop and just switch banks then, check it and come back in xx seconds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I keep two keys, one on my mainpage of the Can5 AA  Hotkey, so I know when it refreshes.<br />
<br />
Then I keep a second hotkey on page two with a warning.<br />
<br />
After about 30 minutes with a group I will start to fade out using the warning everytime.<br />
<br />
Most clerics get used to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Running out of room?<br />
<br />
Use you actions windo for targeting/assist/socials (the place where you create hotbuttons). Doing this gives you 10 slots of hotkeys plus 16 slots you can mouseclick ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Man playing my shaman on pvp with canni I (instead of canni V/canni III combo like usual with my shaman on blue server) is a real pain.<br />
<br />
It's time for SoE to upgrade our cannibalise spells line... canni I with 3khps isn't fun...<br />
<br />
like a semi-canni V at level 55 1khps for 500 mana...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Grogbat... the problem I have with using the mouse to click buttons (and I do not have this problem all the time) is video lag.  I've clicked the wrong button way too many times because the mouse pointer was slow.  Namely, killing my pet instead of telling him to attack.  :)</div></div><hr />
