<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DetourM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Iksar Shaman who I leveled to 15 last night.  I have him mostly in banded and have all my spells for my level.  I was told by a guy in my guild that Iksars can't wear the Jaundiced Bone gear.  He said that this gear is the major Kunark Shaman armor and I'd be crazy not to play a character that could use it.  If I should change, I should change soon before I get too deep.<br />
<br />
Should I abandon the Iksar for say a Troll?  I heard if I follow Innoruk (sp?) I can get a snare necklace that's suppose to be pretty good.  Do anyone know what it's called?<br />
<br />
Is the Jaundiced Bone gear essential?  Is there a good alternative for the Iksars?<br />
<br />
Any help and/or advice would be very appreciated.<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You don't need JB armor, it would be sweet to get a bracer down the road, but its definitely not essential. Trolls do rule because they get the same regen but can use JB armor. They can even get a clicky snare necklace if you worship Innouruuk.<br />
<br />
That said though, I'm glad I stuck with my Iksar. He rocks and its cool to be one of the very few Iksar shamans on the server. Up to you though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">your guy in your guild is full of crap.  play what you want.<br />
<br />
He is true that you cannot wear JB Armor.<br />
He is true that it is one of the main Kunark Armor.<br />
<br />
Reminder:  Kunkark is TWO (almost three) expansions OLD! :)<br />
Lots of good gear out there that you can wear.  Don't sweat it.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Troll will be slightly more powerful, but the lizard will always be more rare. JB gear is not essential by any means. So your stats wont be quite what the plate shammys are, owell. So you can't run around in circles and click a bracer, owell. If you dig being a lizard thats all that matters. Just do the Scaled Mystic Armor quests. I wore a few pieces of that until I was 50 and 51. I seemed to make it to 60 just fine with 0 twinking or powerleveling. (I bitched about it a little from 56-59 but hey, you will to :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You know, I play a cat shaman.  I was nervous at first because all I heard was &quot;cats can't wear a fungi&quot; and &quot;Cats don't get a snare necklace&quot; &quot;they can be stunned&quot; &quot;they don't have the hitpoints of an ogre&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
Know what I learned after 52 levels? - It doesn't matter.  I CAN use a JBB but I don't have one.  I don't have the cash for one either, and even if I had 15k to blow, I'd seriously think about other things first.  In a group I wouldn't use it because I'm too busy medding and canni dancing.  Torpor and cann 5 is still a long ways off, and I need mana :)  Sure it'd be nice, but I really don't NEED one.  :D <br />
<br />
Yes I do wear JB gear.  Helm, boots, arms, and gloves.  Yes they are nice AC - and the right clicky buffs are nice for quieting needy tanks :)  But JB gear isn't that great - there's plenty of stuff out there that I'd bag the JB gear for in a second.<br />
<br />
I'm still using a Jade Poker off the sarnack chancellor.  I have no regen breastplate.  I still wear forest loops (that I had to camp).  I wear a drolvarg mantle for shoulders and a braided cord thingy (10AC) for a belt.  I wear a tattered hopperhide cloak that dropped off a lvl 2 mob when I was a noob on the moon!  MY GEAR SUCKS!<br />
<br />
Know what?  it still doesn't matter - shamans are fun practically naked LOL.  <br />
<br />
Don't reroll your iksar if you're having fun with him - in the end it doesn't matter...<br />

But you'd be CRAZY to overlook the benefits of the mana-free damage that a JBB affords.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">End game lizzards are much more sexy than say a troll/ogre/barb IMHO :)<br />
If I redid my shaman I'd probably go iksar :)<br />
Just play what you like, it all evens out eventually...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Stick with the Iksar, we are very rare indeed. Why would you want to worry about getting a JBB, that's 15-20K you don't have to save . Iksars have inherent Fungi Tunics (that's a bit of a stretch but I think you get the point), plus we get an innate AC bonus. So what if we can't wear JB armor, as stated before JB is 2 expansions old. We can wear all the new high end armors from Velious, so it makes JB a moot point. Our Hate armor buries all others by far. And don't forget the cudgel quests which have once again peaked my interest. <br />
I did a /who all Iksar Shaman last night..I got a grand total of 9 including myself. <br />
I did the same for Barb and Troll, their list couldn't fit on the screen. Why follow the same path as everyone else ? In the end game race really doesn't matter. Play what is fun<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman are awesome and nearly a walking fortress with the right tools. No other class can do as many things as we can. Wanna lay the smackdown on a mob with a big hammer, feel free. Wanna watch a mob fall to its death from being poisoned..feel free. Wanna pet...here ya go. How about SoW, buffs, utility spells of all kinds...Shaman is it. Wanna solo or group ? The choice is yours...you can do both.<br />
Not much we can't do.........and all Shaman have these abilities regardless of race. <br />
<br />
Iksar are truly a rare breed and I think it takes a special kind of player to play an Iksar knowing they can't use a JBB or have limited armor choices. Strategy becomes more an assest than anything else. <br />
Stay with your lizard.....Why be a clumsy, lumbering Troll with a severe rectal problem. When you can be a sleek streamlined, scaly bringer of death !<br />
Fear the Iksar....and for those who don't know you better ask somebody !!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How much do you plan to solo? JBB + the snare necklace are primarily solo'ing tools IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">JBB + the snare necklace are primarily solo'ing tools IMO.<br />
<br />
Maybe for YOU, but not everyone plays that way.  Root/Rotting works just fine.  I rarely use my JBB, other than level 45 to 51 when it was great after that its a toy.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about the JB armor, most of it is crap compared to the stuff you can get in Velious/Luclin.  It has zero stats other than AC.  You are better off in choice pieces of Rygorr, Sentry, and Barbed Ringmail.   And Iksar get some nice quest armor as well as some very nice Hate planar armor.  And honestly, once you get to planar level you can get Velious Quest armor or armor from Plane of Growth that is far superior to JB gear.<br />
<br />
Don't restart, play what race you like.  They all are equally good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Iksar get some very nice armor from the kunark expansion that other shamans do not.  Sebilite Scale armor.  The legs are like 16 ac 6 wis and other stats.  The Tunic is like 24 ac 5 wis or something.  It drops in sebilis, often deep sebilis.  But it's twink armor that people sell pretty cheap, so you can definitely buy it.  Kinda like JB armor . . which sells for VERY cheap these days if it's not a rare piece like bracer, legs, or bp.  <br />
<br />
Honestly if I had it to do again I might go lizard.  The natural AC boost means that when you can acquire velious armor you will be AHEAD of the other shamanic races in the stats/AC department.  Up till then you won't be much behind.  <br />
<br />
One suggestion tho, and pay this careful heed.  WORK ON DEFENSE!  Spend the time each level to melee stuff and raise defense five points every single level until lvl 40 rolls around and you can laugh at all the lvl 50s with like 150 defense and absolute CRAP ac in their Jaundiced Bone armor.  Meanwhile you are wearing chain and have like 200 more ac than them.  Work defense . . . every level you need 5 points of defense.  Don't forget it or you WILL regret it.  <br />
<br />
Finally, iksar has the best overall package for a shaman.  Trolls fall behind with the AC thing.  The hp totals won't be much different . . . one nice piece of gear different most likely.  But iksars get 40 additional AC naturally, which is so nice.  Plus the regen makes for a smoother ride.  <br />
<br />
The only real downside IMHO is the exp penalty which is rather harsh.  You will be consoled however with the smoother playing offered by a race with so much regen.  Basically you will exp longer, but easier.  <br />
<br />
My monk is iksar instead of human.  The choice was easy and even the big exp penalty wouldn't make me change anything.</div></div><hr />

 (I bitched about it a little from 56-59 but hey, you will to  <br />
<br />
The above is QUITE the understatement. :)=<br />
<br />
Realize I complain too - not about suitcases being unable to wear the JBB - but other things.<br />
<br />
You are correct you can't use a JBB. It is a very nice item. If this is your first toon I'd concentrate more on having fun, seeing places rather than what L337 gear I am missing out on.<br />
<br />
Oh to return to the days of Blackburrow when a level 20 Troll  (Kedrom) seemed god-like to this young Barbarian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personally I never missed the JBB till I started soloing shrooms in FG. But I dont think it is class defining has some belive it to be. And dont forget that our Hate armor is better for the most part, I still use the boots and legs for resist gear to this day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Anithar AnachroniX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You'll notice at the start of the game, many ppl will come at you with 'oh this is uber so do this' and so on yada yada yada.<br />
<br />
I'm going through EQ for the first time with a Iksar shammy, and I'm having a blast. The only thing I didn't like was traveling pre-luclin. (now it's not a biggie at all).<br />
<br />
I started having a few doubts in my mid 30's, thinking do I really want to keep going when I keep getting 'iksar shams are gimps' type of thing. (hunting through LOIO, FM, OT didn't help that much I guess)<br />
<br />
But now, since I just dinged 48, and starting to hit the harder zones, you'll find that Shams are almost always wanted in a group. Heck, depending on gear of the melee, your slows can really make a huge impact on how the fight will go. Clerix will be loving you, and to top it off Rangers get the idea they can tank.. ;) hehe<br />
<br />
Anyhow, stay with what you like. There's always a way to get through the challenges. So you might not have it as easy as a Troll or Barb, but hey, making it as a rarer sham just shows you can handle not using one item to get u there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Birus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Imo I would do whatever race u think looks the coolest. True iksar get innate regen bonuses but it really doesn't matter once u get regrowth. Also jbb is a really fun toy to have :), but it's not gonna kill ya if you don't have it. Overall it all balances itself out. Just do whatever u think looks the coolest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">JBB is a tool that every shammy (that can equip it) should try to have.  It does not make or break your character, but it helps out and adds to your arsenal.  When I first turned 45 and was able to click it, I thought it was the greatest thing in the world.  Now that I am 60, though, mobs that I solo just have too many HP for strictly JBBing them to be time-efficient.  I have to rely mainly on DoTs to deal my damage, with JBB as a secondary supplement.  It's handy to have, but by no means necessary.<br />
<br />
I think iksar's are a great race, and their only real disadvantage imho is their innability to use JB bracer and the JB breastplate (effect adds 19ac, stacks with everything).  If I could do it over again, I would probably be an iksar.  I like their tails, and I have realized that JBB is not that big of a deal :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Stick with the scales, trust me.<br />
<br />
At level 55 with self buffs on, and set up for soloing... my &quot;vital&quot; stats are as follows:<br />
<br />
HP: 1989<br />
AC: 1046<br />
<br />
Sta: 169<br />
Agi: 207<br />
<br />
etc etc<br />
<br />
I regen ~50 HP/tick sitting, and can take a pretty large beating. Yes, the exp penalty hurts later on, but it's worth it for the regen and looks ;)<br />
<br />
And even on Tarew, there aren't *that* many Iksar Shammies 55+<br />
<br />
Rarity is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Conventional wisdom would suggest that a troll or barbarian would be a superior choice (as this is what the majority of shaman are) if you want to be a lizard, go for it.  I did.  You can't have that one item, but if that one item is enough to make you change your race, you are probably not exploring all of your options.<br />
<br />
Mana free nuke would be very very nice, but i get by just fine without it.  You can too</div></div><hr />
