<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been pretty much out of game since May and came back to find that while I was gone, most of my guild left for greener pastures in other games or in other guilds in EQ.  We were never a particularly uber guild to begin with and most of us who are left are looking for new digs.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I'm short an aa ability I need to get into most of the big elemental/time guilds on my server..namely MGB, which I never got cause I never really needed it in my previous guild.  I'm about 6.5 aa's shy of it, and would like to try and get it asap.  I'm level 65, tactics flagged, with SCRM, VP3, Canni5 (goes without saying really), CA3 and most of my pre-GoD spells (still haven't gotten malos..but then I do have the level 60 malo, so I never really saw an incentive).<br />
<br />
I've been doing droga mostly, but at about 20% aaxp per hour (give or take) it's just gonna take me a lot longer then I'd like to get those aa's.<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can solo in Valor, about 6-7% exp per kill solo, easy single pulls for the most part, you'll get xp pretty quick.<br />
<br />
You could also try grouping in BoT, pretty easy exp there if ya get a good group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i would say tactics its a cool zone and here you can also get the gems for the bloodmetal earring or farm the hell out of piglet (I dont know what the stuff would be worth after OOW)<br />
Also try and get into a sewer/mountain group good XP and can drop both spells and gear</div></div><hr />

With Nurga as a hot-zone AA'a take less that 1.5hours each at 65<br />
Sad but true.</div></div><hr />

Sad but true.Where do you go in Nurga for that kind of XP?  The very back portion?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

The highest critters are way back to the west.  My little troll is leveling like a human in there.  *grin*  <br />
<br />
I'm wondering when the hotspots change, though, it's gonna be a sad day in nurga when they move it back to normal.</div></div><hr />

I'm wondering when the hotspots change, though, it's gonna be a sad day in nurga when they move it back to normal.I've been powerleveing my 47 froggie in Nurga for a little while.  We tried Droga but she couldn't get slow to stick reliably so we came back to Nurga.  Hopefully with Malo (or whatever it is called :))she will be able to stick slow reliably.  I can mow through everything in the zone unslowed except the ones that are dark blue to me!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vikingvoyage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went to Nurga killing Dark Blue cons at level 65 (Barb) and got 1-2% AA xp. Not that great IMHO.</div></div><hr />

It's not the XP per mob that is important, it is the XP per hour that is.  I went to Nurga at level 66 to test it as a hot-spot.  Many of the mobs were light blue to me so I wasn't nearly getting the XP that I could have.  But I was still getting 2% of regular xp an hour duoing.  This is around 30% of an AA an hour.  About what I get in a zone where I am only hunting dark blues.<br />
<br />
Thing was, I was pulling 5-6 mobs back to my team and killing them there.  Even in these numbers they didn't provide much of a threat at all. Much of the time I was running around looking for more mobs to kill.<br />
<br />
So, I don't recommend Droga post-65.  But, if you still see a lot of dark blues there it could be a very nice place to grind.  Duoing for 40-50% of an AA per hour should be very possible.  Plus you get good plat, good faction, tribute items and run very little risk.<br />

BTW, another good spot to solo grind out the AA is near the pigpen in tactics.  Soloing 50-60% an hour there is reasonable.  Plus you can get the stampeding piglet when he's out.</div></div><hr />

Exactly... If you read what Thaymon wrote:<br />

I posted that it wasnt very good xp. Meaning compared to what you can get elsewhere. Someone posted they were getting 1 AA per 90 minutes in Nurga. I dont see it yeilding that  at 1-2% per kill from my personal experiance there as you as well found 30% AA per hour. Soloing in PoV  will net 1 AA per 1.5 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I posted getting an AA in 90 minutes in Nurga<br />
At 62 it happens<br />
<br />
Actually it's 100 minutes per AA solo and 80 minutes when duoing with a BL, so I averaged.</div></div><hr />
