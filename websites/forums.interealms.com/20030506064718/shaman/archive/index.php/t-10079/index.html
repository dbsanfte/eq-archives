<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kadira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There I was, in CoM.  I had made the run the EJ, leaving a trail of rooted, angry mobs in my wake.  After considerable wandering, voila---City of Mist. <br />
<br />
With a smile I zoned in and was greeted by a light blue shadow.  Die foulness!  I killed it, then began exploring the entry area..<br />
<br />
All LIGHT BLUE OR GREEN!!!  No!!!!  Did I wait to late?!?  (I am level 51) <br />
<br />
Dare I go deeper?  <br />
<br />
I did manage to get my pages 5 and 6 though.</div></div><hr />

It will take you back to the Goo house, then around the &quot;circuit&quot; as I call it. The gazeebo's/bridge area is still dark blue to my 55 Shaman. You might have trouble pulling singles (anywhere on this path) until you get to 53.<br />
<br />
G'luck, and enjoy!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kadira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have a lvl 53 ranger partner to help, so that should be good till I get strong enough to single pull ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hadnt explored the rear regions of the City yet, Ihad been hanging in the stables and temple areas.  Having dinged 53, most of the mobs in that area are lt blue now.  <br />
<br />
This gives me renewed hope for my soloing future!  Thanks Valgoth!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I exp'd 39 to 52 in CoM.  At 49+, go clear back to the back alleys and solo there, should be able to mostly single pull.  But that was back before Luclin, you would probably get much better exp in SoL or if you can get a group in PoP than you will in CoM at that level.  It's best from 40 - 48, but can be stretched to probably 53 if you wanna hunt really low level mobs.<br />
<br />
Best advice, unless you really want to explore, go somewhere else, you've outgrown CoM =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kadira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoP and SoL are well and good, but I still need the Merchant's Letter, and Student'd Log :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">student log camp suks bad...<br />
<br />
some of the mobs at castle area are 42-44 so still db at 56,  some are green to, but 50% are light blue<br />
<br />
I did most my soloing exp grind in com till i found out about HHK...no comparison between them imo<br />
<br />
but i still got soft spot for COM..  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I absolutely love CoM. The ambience and sound effects there are really soothing.<br />
<br />
I levelled my Warrior there from 40 to 52 pretty quickly. The exp in the zone is excellent for those levels and still pretty decent for my Shaman at 55. Now that exp in Kaesora has slowed significantly for my Cleric (gotta love that 18% ZEM) I'll be taking him over to CoM to finish 45 to 51. Gotta love those undead. :)<br />
<br />
Granted the exp there isn't as good as HHK, but for those who don't want to trash their faction (IE, me) it's an excellent alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gukky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have played in CoM for many, many levels on different toons. I went to HHK and could not get the camp because there we so many 51+ there waiting/KSing that I left. CoM is slower, but really easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ahh, noob question, what is HHK? I checked eqatlas and there is no zone that matches that, unless I missed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Holth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">HHK means HighHold Keep, I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If HHK is referring to High Keep, then this quote makes no since to me, that is a lower lvl zone, only the merchants are in their 40's. Are they killing merchants?<br />
<br />
confused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The nobles upstairs and the bards are good exp for 50+, and ridiculously easy.  (In HHK)</div></div><hr />
