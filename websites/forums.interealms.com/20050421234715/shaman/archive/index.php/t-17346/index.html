<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larul Wolfcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK in this zip file is the FOLDER Sars4wolfcaller as well as the NEEDED .INI file name UI_Player_SERVER.INI <br />
<br />
the folder Sars4wolfcaller goes in the folder Everquest\Uifiles<br />
so its Everquest\Uifiles\Sars4wolfcaller<br />
<br />
the file UI_Player_Server.INI  needs to be renamed with your characters name, and Server name. <br />
IE for Larul its UI_Larul_Karana.INI<br />
&amp; this file goes in the Everquest Folder<br />
<br />
<br />
any questions ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bmp is a really bad format to host pictures on the web.  Convert that screenshot to jpg or something and save a ton of bandwidth.  That screenshot is nearly 4 megs as is... should be able to get similar quality for less than 1/10th the size using jpg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Larul Wolfcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK its up, &amp; its a JPG pic... now feedback ??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seems to be a small error in the spell memorizing bar on the bottom of the spell book. When i memorize a spell i only get a white stipe that doesnt change and just disappears when the spell is memorized... Or maybe just an error on my comp.<br />
<br />
Other then that i really like it , great work :)<br />
<br />
/regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've always loved your UI's, Larul.  Especially the maps before we got them with LoY.  Keep up the great work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This UI looks great.  However, I have some pieces already that I prefer to some of the ones that you have.  I would like to separate out the buff bars and use those.  I looked at it for a bit last night and I could not get it to work.<br />
<br />
It looks like you use the Animations file extensively.  I would prefer not to use that one as it seems to get updated the most of any UI files by Sony.  It should simply be a matter of taking the required parts out of the Animations file and putting them in the Buff bar files.  I do not know what I need to pull out of the Animations file and put in the Buff Bar files.<br />
<br />
I am hoping that you can give me a bit of help in this.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Tarelan</div></div><hr />
