<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I debated whether to write a goodbye post but somehow it didn't feel right to just hang up Thurdar's Spear of Fate without a nod to the Crucible. <br />
<br />
It actually came as a surprise when I hit the cancel button. In many ways, OoW had put the spark back into EQ and I was looking forward to lvl 70. ... then WoW came along and managed to extinguish that spark without me even realizing it. <br />
<br />
From the perspective of a relatively hard-core player who never enjoyed raiding but always had fun exp groups of friends, I guess WoW just showed me what I'd been missing in EQ. Too much grinding (to lvl 70, for my runes, etc.) to look forward to and not enough fun. No complaints though, for all EQ's faults it's been a fun 5 years and I'm glad I went on the journey. <br />
<br />
So to those that are left in EQ, the best of luck to you. And to everyone here at the crucible that showed me the way to being a better shaman... /salute</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It was an honor playing with you T.  Fera has also had his final ctrl-x, and it was indeed tough hitting that cancel button.  Good luck to you in everything you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye - I also have been bitten by the WoW bug - have a lvl 24 shaman there (keeping the class alive I guess) - but not yet able to hit that cancel button on EQ after 5 years of history. <br />
<br />
Good Luck with WoW</div></div><hr />

I hadn't been around all that much lately and missed the fact that you'd also retired. Hope life is treating you well. <br />
<br />
Any plans to check out WoW? Gnar and company could probably use a shaman and I'm lagging far behind the bunch. Not really in any hurry to catch up either, I'm taking things slow and enjoying the ride for now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good luck you two.  Bristlebane will be worse off for your departures.<br />

I retired a while ago and am currently playing WoW with Khazz, Ronar, Tiny, Zzrod, Tuan and a few other former companions on a pvp server (sag something or other).  I'll likely roll up another char to play on PvE with Dohx and Kymma (can't remember the server name off the top of my head).</div></div><hr />

  Long time no see! I haven't checked out PvP yet but if your group isn't too hung up on whatever PvE server they're on, you might want to join us on Icecrown. House Arcanum reformed there and I'm sure you'd meet a lot of people you knew in Companions.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to ya, old bear! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now I'm having fun with Halo2 and attempting a social life.  I do have to keep my karaoke groupies satisfied, ya know.  :)  I'll probably end up trying WoW at some point, but I'm certainly in no hurry.<br />
<br />
/wave Tarthug!  Good to hear from you man.</div></div><hr />
