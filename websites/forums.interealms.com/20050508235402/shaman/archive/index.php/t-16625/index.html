<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently started two boxing. I have access to two computers but they're in seperate rooms which obviously means I lose control if I play them at the same time. I'd have to be running through the house. So I tried to do it on the same computer. It works for the most part. My machine is by no means a slow or old one, with a 2ghz processor and 512megs of ram, Geforce 4 card etc. etc. However I do find that when zoning it can take up to 10 minutes to zone, and furthermore there's a good chance it will lock up altogether and I will either have to crtl-alt-delete and end task one of my EQ clients, or reboot altogether.<br />
<br />
So, what I'm wondering is if there are any 3rd party programs that help you run 2 everquest clients on the same computer with more fluidity. If not, what options should I turn off or on to reduce leading times and overall performance? I already turned off most high quality character models and social animations.<br />
<br />
thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">www.eqwindows.com if you aren't already using it.<br />
<br />
I upgraded to a 128 MB video card and that seemed to make a difference, I have a similar configuration in memory and processor.  It doesn't take 10 minutes to zone, usually around 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
Also, I switched to 800X600, haven't tried higher resolutions, I like 8x6 because it leaves a lot of room around the edges for me to do other stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah Eqwindows runs eq much more stable than eq running in windows mode. Read a bit in the forums i think it is there and can find some of the suggestions like diabling sound. I just couldnt run eq in windowed mode very well at all without eqw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definately use EQW.  If you are still zoning slow after that, get another 512 stick of ram.  I have an athlon 1800 and a geforce 3, but a gig of ram, and two windows runs fine, and I can even run three, although it does get pretty laggy then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To upgrade the eqw performance on many systems, create a txt file called &quot;nosound.txt&quot;  it disables all sounds in game (obviously).  It can cut zone times from crazy stuff like 10min down to around normal zone times.  However, if you zone 2 at once it sometimes will kick 1 or take 1 an extreme amount of time to zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kullann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have much slower system then yours and I zone in less then 20 seconds usually</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used to 2 box with 2 computers but now use 1 even more effectively.<br />
<br />
Suggestions:<br />
1) run EQW for both<br />
2) use Windows XP (runs much better with EQW than 98 does... I upgraded recently)<br />
3) use a completely different installation of EQ on another disc for the second account. You can just copy all the files across to the second disc.<br />
4) put the nosound.txt file in the &quot;secondary&quot; account eq directory.<br />
5) turn off all unessential models on the second account<br />
6) install more RAM. It is cheap!<br />
<br />
Do a search on the EQW forums for this stuff. It is well documented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Defragging the hard drive *seems* to improving zoning times, too. I have no hard data to support that observation.<br />
<br />
I use a modem. Generally, if one of the characters takes more than half a minute or so to zone then it is going to crash. Last weekend I got a few zoning crashes that happened very quickly -- I suspect there was a problem with the server.<br />
<br />
Zoning into crowded zones like PoK and bazaar seems to take a lot longer than other zones. If I allow both characters to zone into one of those zones together I usually have problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just got a brand spankin' new machine and it is the best I could afford so I have been two boxing on one machine for a month or so now and HANDS DOWN the biggest asset to my two boxing is RAM count.  I went from 512 MB of 133 MHZ SDRAM to 2 Gigs of pc-3200 400MHZ dual channel DDR.  Biggest reason is that EQ was programed to devour system recources to hinder those how wanted to run programs in the back groud in order to gain an unfair advantage.  Thus RAW RAM count and processor power make all of the difference (thats the only reason the sub corperate G-Force FX cards can out perform the ATI Raedon 9000 series in EQ ... and only EQ).  Thus I would recomend going to a Gig of ram and if you are using SDRAM or any thing below 233 Mhz DDR, chainge the style of ram you are using al together.<br />
     Another HUGE asset to one machine 2 boxing is the use of the Logitech MX 300 mouse.  I know it sounds crazy but hear me out.  MX technology is one of the best laser eyes out there so it is a very accurate mouse (EXCEDINGLY important to me as an FPS fan).  At any rate the MX 300 has a tiny little button inbetween the two primary buttons that is a program swaper.  Click the button and it will bring up a menu, drag the cursor over the desired program and BAM! there it is.  EQ does not really like this feature so it will not be friendly to the swaping menu but if you double click the swap button it will switch you to your other EQ program so be sure the EQ was the last 2 things you computer opened.<br />

P.S. at work again, please forgive spelling  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I run two accounts on my pc and  use wineq.  I dont have many problems but I do tend to lag if there are a bunch of other players around me.  Gonna pickup some more RAM to take care of that problem though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Outkast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">KVM switch the two computers together. Easy as pie and all the heat from the two machines under my desk keeps me warm and toasty!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here is what I do when I 2 box.<br />
First get eqwindows a must. It is alot more reliable then eq alone. Second  turn off as many models as you can. Then as most other ppl said turn off sound with the nosound.txt on your secondary acount. I keep the sound on my main acount. A few other tips. My shaman I keep the clip plane very low, and my puller a bit higher, 3d sky off or at least on the 1 setting. Lastly, while following have the follower look at the floor this helps alot in zones like pok bazaar or other high graphic/traffic zones.<br />
That is about it. <br />
<br />
My computer is not a speed demon, but much better then what I had. amd 1.7ghz. 512 ddr ram(233mhz? maybe) dsl connection geoforce 3 ti. I can 2 boxing with eqw great no lag almost as good as one acount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just got a brand spankin' new machine and it is the best I could afford so I have been two boxing on one machine for a month or so now and HANDS DOWN the biggest asset to my two boxing is RAM count.  &lt;snip&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Absolutely. I've got a pretty beefy system (amd 3200+ (oc'd 2600 actually), radeon9700p, 1gig ddr 433, WD10k Sata HD, etc) and 2 instances of eq running on the current version of eqwindows uses more than a gig of ram. 2 gigs recommended definately. When running 2 windows its fine though when in a regular zone, but PoK/nexus/bazaar can get laggy. Slow zoneing times as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heh, how is this for irony.  I have been doing the dot and zone out thing to PL a cleric of late, and decided to set EQ up an my ancient P2 box so I could zone faster.  Installed EQ and right after server select, my video went haywire.  Tried several things to get it back working to no avail.  Soooo, I install eqw.  Works fine.  That's right, on my old system that is still in the min requirements for EQ, EQ ONLY WORKS IF EQW IS INSTALLED.  Nice work Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wobaku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have a quick question regarding EQWindow. Does the gamma slider work when using EQW?<br />
<br />
I've just started running 2 EQs on 1 comp yesterday with the standarded window mode and have noticed that the gamma slider doesn't work unless I switch to full screen. I've managed to get it playable by switching the gamma setting in my Nvidia card's properties, but is annoying to switch back and forth and doesn't seem to have quite as big of an effect in game seeing as the gamma slider does in full screen mode.</div></div><hr />
