It's been a long time...but 7 hours seems to ring a bell.  I could be wrong on this, hopefully someone will verify or correct me.<br />
<br />
edit:  of |= or!!</div></div><hr />

3 days +/- X hours with X being either 12 or 8.  I think it's 12.  I've run my share of PoF raids when I played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Are you absolutely sure you are answering the same question Tathug?   The about 7 hours is for repop after a server down, not in general.<br />
<br />
  I am pretty sure that the 7 hours or so is correct for after a server down.  I know that the 3 days (with possible minor variance) is correct in general.<br />
<br />
  I also have heard NUMEROUS times, but not confirmed, that on spawning of Cazic Thule, the entire zone respawns, including the golems.  Meaning if you clear them and then 15 minutes later CT spawns, the golems are also back (and you are probably hosed since you are in the middle of Fear, near a golem, and all the lovely little fiends are back).<br />
<br />
  I am pretty sure that CT comes up within 12 hours of a server reset, so that would mean for certain the golems would as well (possibly earlier on their own, then again with CT, but that isn't too likely IMO).<br />
<br />
<br />
  And if CT really does respawn the golems with him, he is on a week long timer, so that means in any week you can field the golem 3 times if you also clear out CT on the last of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What cannus said.  I do however agree that the +- is 12 hours.  In terms of CT spawning and golems repop....I seem to remember CT popping while I was in zone in the latest version of Fear, and nothing respawned that I noticed /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the replys. :)</div></div><hr />

I was on a Fear raid a few weeks back (I love Fear...I think it's a LOT of fun to raid and kill there) and we had cleared 90% of the zone and Cazic did spawn after we were almost done. The zone did not repop. Although, I've heard this rumor myself multiple times, but on this occasion at least, it was not correct.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I know what your saying and you're right (as is Naghite) that when CT pops following a server reset, all of PoF repops, and no, I have no clue on the respawn of CT (I ran raids for people to get epic bits, not to drop CT).  That said, if CT doesn't spawn (he hasn't on a couple of resets prior to raids I've run, either that or I was poorly informed on other guilds not hitting PoF on reset), or is taken down, respawn on the golems is 3 days +/- 12 hours.</div></div><hr />
