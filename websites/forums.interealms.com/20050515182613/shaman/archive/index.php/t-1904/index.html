<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you guys could do the jail, but I spent a lot of time exping in the Warlord area around level 54 and those guys hit pretty darned hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Like they told you on the monk boards bud.  It's doable, but the problem is your monk, is not going to have the dmg output to kill those things fast.  Since you're not 60, therefore no torpor, you'll waste ALOT of mana chain healing.  There's always clerics avail, so I would try it.  You have nothing to lose man.  You've posted on 2 boards already and gotten plenty of responses, just DO IT.  If you fail then come back and say why, if you're successful come and tell us how.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />
