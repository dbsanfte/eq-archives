<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">a while ago (44) i went to feerrott to camp specs, as i'd heard they are good exp. found one spec near a tree outside fear entry, dispatched it easy enough. looked around, not another spec in sight. so i go through the secret wall and tag the only spec i can see there, pull it back to where pet was waiting, turn around to fight and... THREE specs are bearing down on me, grinning and lifetapping like mad. Puppy valiantly gave his life so that i could make it to RM zone without difficulty, but i was so discouraged that i never came back to try more spec pulling.<br />
<br />
what was I doing wrong? is there more than one spec OUTSIDE the fear entrance, who will jump in when i pull a spec from behind the secret wall? or was i just too low level to single pull specs, thus netting me a whole bunch from inside? at the time it looked like they were spawning from nowhere, but that seems real unlikely.<br />
<br />
does anyone with more experience spec smashing at Fear entrance have some tricks for getting em one at a time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if i remember right, 2 pop right in the entrance and one right behind it.  I camped there for awhile but there was a slow pop sequence, they have a sorta high aggro range, and this tunnel is the only fear portal, so it is in constant use on my server, people like to pop spectres on their way through for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually theres only one that pop in that first alcove past the fake wall ,but what you failed to take into account was the fact there is a roamer spectre in those caves. That coupled with the big call for help range is what brought at least 2 on your head for sure and 3rd could very well of been repop from the single outside which spawns every 7 mins.<br />
Or perhaps you just pulled at that right and really bad moment where the roamer was close enough to agro a back spawn at the same time or maybe pathing in the cave is just strange.<br />
But as an option you can camp the single spawn if you wish since its on a fast repop timer.Otherwise youd do better off loading up the batwings and doing the spectres in oasis.</div></div><hr />
