<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've had alot of trouble getting into GoD groups. When I have done trials or Ferubi we have no luck on spell drops. Just wondered how many of us actually have any of our GoD spells and if so what you think of them. Are they ultra-rare or am I just unlucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They're rare all right.  I have all three.  Of the three, Breath of Trushar was the easiest to get.  Consider:<br />
<br />
Many nameds, especially in Kodtaz, have a chance to drop a geomancy stone.  If one drops, anyone the group can roll on them.  Each person only needs 1, since there is only 1 turn in spell.  That means that, assuming 1 in 3 drop a geomancy stone, you just roll for it.  Your chances of getting one go up as you spend more time in the zones since more and more people will have them and not need to roll.  Kodtaz named, in particular, are pretty easy to get to.  So, figure about a 33% chance of getting a spell drop if you get a named.<br />
<br />
Now, consider the other 2 drops.  They're off nameds that either have PHs, or require farming, etc.  The nameds are often in trials, where you now have to kill 20 mobs to see if one even spawns.  If you get one, they seem to have a spell no more often than 1 in 3, maybe less.  If you get a spell, the spells are also off a loot list that includes a lot of other class spells.  Figure 1 in 11.  1/3 * 1/11 = 1/33 = about a 3% chance of getting your spell IF you can get a named.  Those aren't good odds.<br />
<br />
The spells aren't bad.  Daluda's helps some, but it's not going to solve all your healing needs by any stretch of the imagination.  Breath of Trushar is good for topping off tanks inbetween pulls.  Nihil . . . is nihil.  not bad, but could be much better.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fezik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have all three as well.<br />
<br />
BoT- Rocks love it. Got it off a named in Kodtaz.<br />
<br />
Mending- Great. I didnt think this would be that big of an upgrade, but with focus I can hit 2100hps no crit and over 4k critted. Got it off a Ferubi named.<br />
<br />
Slow- Ok. Its not bad having a fast cast slow. But -40mr is nothing.  I have had this resisted many times and tugurs land. Over all if you dont have a TA from time its nice. But I dont see using this if you have a TA. -40mr isnt enough to loose a spell slot unless you are fighting SUPER resistant mobs or mobs that can do HUGE dps that first few seconds. Got it off a KodTaz named.<br />
<br />
<br />
Over all... Noting game breaking just ok upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">for sure, it used to be alot easier to get the spells than it is now.  I got BoT first, and is def. the easiest one to get if you are kod'taz flagged.  Next, i started farming the sewers.  This was back before they had a five min timer in between expeditions, and I got my slow from the 13th named fly kill.  In about 250+ fly kills, I've seen prob 5 Nihils (but no mage spells or cleric heals).  I'm sitting at about a 22% drop rate on spells to kills).  When they made the biC parts drop from named in the sewers, I got my heal from one of them in the crematory.  <br />
<br />
Now, I do like the heal, more would be been better, but it's server me nicely and I've been making full use of it (keeping tank alive in tipt without a cleric long enough to kill final archer.. doing ikk trial 2 and 3 with me as the second healer).  The new slow is nice, a bigger resist modifier would have been better, since i still get resisted plenty, however it's great for trash clearing while raiding, and for when there are two mobs in camp and you want to get theother slowed asap.  BoT.. just owns while soloing or duoing.  I can usually stick it on me or my ranger bot and not worry about needing heals when I'm in places like riwwi or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">New heal is not bad with max aas and heal focus. I still think it should be 1800 not 1550 or whatever though. New slow is nice as well, I have a TA and I alternate them on multiple pulls. It's good to have options, though people are right about it being resisted more than you would think. I don't have the other two yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no God spell and i have spell lot of time in GoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just pretend that the GoD spells dont exist. Makes me much happier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just got BoN a few nights ago and have found it very useful so far. I rarely get a resist in Tier1 or 2 of Time and it's nice to use in LDoN and on old-world content. I've only used it a bit in GoD and with the tank I had at the time I had to delay casting or I would pull agro every time (his discs are broken saying 37000 hours until usable again). Once I get my TA I'll be happier not having to situationally have Tugur's up as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Whoever thought up the way that GoD spells drop should be shot. Seriously, I've seen so many spells rot because it always seems that the class that isn't there gets the spell drop. The way Breath of Trushar works, should be how they all work. Theres multiple tiers of stones, and everyone can turn them in for their spell. Rotting spells is retarted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Easiest solution would be to have a trade-in NPC where you can &quot;exchange&quot; wrong-class spells for your class specific spell.  Would be nice for those berserker tomes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm probably a little unusual in that I have the GoD slow, but I'm not EP or even VT flagged...  Just starting to work on that though, and I've found Balance to be great for Ssra and for shard farming.  Now if C1 would ever show his face, I'd be all set. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have the slow and love it, keep it and Turgurs memmed now and alternate them.  Only complaint I have is I wish it were a little less resisted like most others.  Havent had a chance to pick up the others but I would love a new, higher heal, though again, more would be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">have daluda's mending and balance of the nihil.  actually, for me, breath of trushar has been the hardest to get because every single time a stone drops i lose in a cluster**** random.  haven't done many kt nameds or trial 9 yet, but at the moment on raids my guild is full randoming spells and i'm constantly losing to people that never play, which isn't tasty at all.  that being said, daluda's mending is great, with aa + focus i heal like the average PoP druid (1900-2200 non crit, 3800-4200 crit).  also balance of the nihil is a great spell, even before the 15% slow change.  often for ldon adventures or other situations where mobs die fast i equip a hammer of hours and melee instead of using TA.  great for slowing mobs that are annoyingly resistant, too, and balance just destroys any challenge to zlandicar solo heh.  <br />
