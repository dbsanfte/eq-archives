<br />
Improve our heals to be equal to druids.  There is NO justification for a 3 tiered system of priest classes.  None.  Nor is there any logic to it.  A hybrid class (pally) heals better than we do.  I can understand a 2 tiered system, but not 3.   We are priests, no less than druids are.<br />
<br />
Cut the casting time and recasting time on the debuff spell lines for shaman only.  We should be faster.  I can live with the mitigation, but to return us to our prime role, we should do it better than anyone else.  That means getting it out there fast, more efficiently.  Cut the casting time in half and remove the majority of the recasting time.<br />
<br />
Give us a DD with teeth to it.  Something like a Disease DD that hits in the 1500-2k range.  Our cold DD is weak at best.  900 damage just isn't going to cut it.  Or, add a big DD to the front end of Breath, say in the 500-800 range.<br />
<br />
None of this is game breaking, none of this would be over powering.  As it is, right now, Shaman are so under powered as to be a joke of a class.<br />
<br />
Instead of bitching about my bitching, add your voice to the cry for shaman improvements !  Our class is being marginalized in the game as it stands right now.  As we progress in GoD, our roles become less clear, and our usefulness as well<br />

<br />
Honestly, I think a 500 DD with a 3-tic 500 DOT attatched to it is a good idea. Keeps our offense as a DOT instead of a nuke, and gives us a chance to actually deal some damage in this new, ultra-fastEQ world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blazz, I agree that a DOT with a hefty DD aspect to it would be a good thing. I would rather have a new dot introduced with this, or an old dot upgraded. I do not want to see a DD portion added to a current dot that doesn't already have it. Right now Root Rotting in Fire is a viable method of xp'ing solo. This would be reduced somewhat if one of the dots had a dd effect added.<br />
<br />
I would prefer to make Tears of Saryn into a dot with a 500dd and make it 4 ticks than have Breath changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">A 3-tick dot is a good idea.  Re-attaching DD to the dots is a bad idea - which anyone who remembers actually trying to use the old DD-dots like Nife would already know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Wouldnt it be easier all around to just increase nukes?  Mucking around with dot/nuke combo just decreases the places where it would be useful.  In todays eq, nukes are good for groups/raid, dots are good for solo.  The old dots with a nuke on em make root/rot unmanageable, but it didn't matter since mobs hit so much softer.  Pop style dots were a good change.  Pop strength nukes however....</div></div><hr />

Was the bump red or grey? A grey bump means the bumper doesn't have sufficient rep altering ability to actually bump your rep one way or another, hence the grey color.<br />

Why we were given a downgrade to our main ability with GoD compared to everyone else getting upgrades, is beyond me.  I posted about this.  Basically noone cared.  Blame yourselves for not understanding *** your class does.  Sony knows even less about it.  You guys are whining about heals all the damn time, which is the least of our worries.  Our healing isn't going to get much better, it would severly overpower us in older content.  Making it so we can slow faster and easier isn't going to change much of a damn thing in older content.  Understand?<br />
<br />
We should have a questable spell with GoD, that is fairly easy to do.  Turgur's clone, with a -55 (or higher) resist adjust, 1.5s cast time, 3s recast time, 325mana.<br />
<br />
If they want to make certain mobs harder to slow, make them disease slowable only, and up the resist rate.  As it is, most disease only slowable mobs are fairly easy to slow with disease.  I don't mind having to do something extra or harder for a named mob here and there, what I do mind is having my main ability nulified left and right on every mob I encounter.<br />
<br />
We slow things.  We should be the best and most versatile at it.  You don't give us that, then we must be balanced in other ways, which is even harder to do.  Older content slowing is a joke.  Anyone with a slow spell can slow that stuff, except named, which they have a harder time.  And named should be hard.  They should also be easier with the right classes to meet the challenges that the named mob poses.  Not every named mob should be slowable to be easily beatable.  But creativity is something Sony seems to lack most of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I, for one, don't mind healing changes...cuz we need them, but I have been against healing changes as our PRIMARY focus. I've been saying that, too. I feel your pain.<br />
<br />
However, I don't consider us that class that slows things. I consider us the class that debuffs things. I don't mind if slow becomes less our focus as a class as long as I can bring SOMETHING to the encounter. There could be OTHER methods of debuffing a mob, but that would require some creative thinking. Some shaman on this forum have offered suggestions that I thought were at least interesting. If I could remember where those threads were, I'd link those suggestions here. Sadly, I don't have the time right now to go hunt for them. Maybe I will later and add it to this thread. <br />
<br />
We should have a questable spell with GoD, that is fairly easy to do.  Turgur's clone, with a -55 (or higher) resist adjust, 1.5s cast time, 3s recast time, 325mana.<br />
<br />
A questable (easy or not, I don't care) spell for a faster casting slow would be fine by me. Even mitigated slow if it can actually land before the mob is at 50% health or less would be an improvement. I do believe that such a spell should be Shaman only so that Shaman would regain the position as the &quot;best&quot; option for a slower if such a spell should be implemented.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a class based AA that decreased our cast time on debuff spells only could be implemented rather than a questable spell. Either way, dropping the cast time on our debuffs would be one way to &quot;help&quot; us along in the faster paced GoD content.<br />
<br />
Another option rather than a spell quest would be a focus item quest that decreased the cast time on debuffs. Item would be NO DROP Shaman only obtainable with, at maximum, a single group (no raid force requirements please) and equippable at level 65.  :p <br />
<br />
If they want to make certain mobs harder to slow, make them disease slowable only, and up the resist rate.  As it is, most disease only slowable mobs are fairly easy to slow with disease.  I don't mind having to do something extra or harder for a named mob here and there, what I do mind is having my main ability nulified left and right on every mob I encounter.<br />
<br />
I don't think that the resist rate would need to be upped. The fact that disease slowable mobs are fairly easy to slow balances nicely with the fact that disease based slows are inferior in slow %.<br />
<br />
We slow things.  We should be the best and most versatile at it.  You don't give us that, then we must be balanced in other ways, which is even harder to do.  Older content slowing is a joke.

But creativity is something Sony seems to lack most of the time.<br />
<br />
Yes, we do slow things. So do enchanters, beastlords, and even bards. We have done them better than anyone in the past, but that doesn't mean that is still the ONLY thing we can have. If not slowing....some OTHER form of creative debuff would be fun. I don't remember what those creative ideas were atm. I just remember reading them and thinking...now that sounds interesting!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Wouldnt it be easier all around to just increase nukes?  Mucking around with dot/nuke combo just decreases the places where it would be useful.<br />
<br />
I can't think of too many places a 3-tic DOT wouldnt be useful. The only reason I offer this suggestion rather than a pure nuke is to keep it &quot;shamanish&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
I consider us the class that debuffs things.<br />
<br />
Hear Hear!! This is what I have been trying to say. I know there are people on this board that would rather we focus our efforts in a SINGLE direction, and even Brenlo asked us to sort of do this himself, but the fact of the matter is we are a combination utility class. We needed to be able to heal better, no question about it. I didn't think the upgrade was enough, personally. I am not trying to argue this point.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, I would like to see our OTHER abilities also upgraded some. We have gotten nothing in the way of a new nuke. We got Bane from LDoN, but in a 10 second world a 30 second spell is only 1/3 effective (yeah, its not HORRIBLE, if it lands, and you get 2 500 tics for 500 mana or whatever it is, but still). I want to be a debuffer, a buffer, a back up healer, and a DOT damage dealer. I do not see a problem with fixing all these issues. A 1700 hp fast heal, a 10 second long DOT with a nuke at the front end (to make it less usable as a soloing tool, if they want balance there), a better debuff (I liked the &quot;straight 10% mitigation to a mobs DPS idea I suggested somewhere, a &quot;reverse&quot; BoV if you will), and a bigger pure HP buff, MGBable, make it unstackable with Focus, thats fine, but right now, Focus is 544 hps, and thats all its worth. The stat portion of that buff is worthless. Heck, I would rather replace STR and DEX in Focus with CHA, for better DIs on the tanks without having another buff slot for CHA. <br />
<br />
All in all, I think we are close. Honestly, we are a solid class. But we have been ignored for so long now. They obviously do not want us to be viable main-healers in the new content. So be it. Give us something else, then, please. Or a couple small somethings. Give us enough utility to at least COMPETE for group slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">NO DOT WITH NUKE PLEASE!<br />
<br />
If I remember correct, a DOT with Nuke will have 2 checks on the mobs before it lands, that make the DOT very hard to land.<br />
The hug argo problem will give you a very hard time to use the DOT with nuke also.<br />
And bigger chance to break root.<br />
That is nightmare.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Might as well face is we're bastard red headed step children. We aren't gonna get any real attention for our class all the great ideas and suggestions we may get at around level 80 when they increase levels to 100. Of course we will still be underpowered by then cause everyone else will get improvements of the same level in their 70's.<br />
<br />
This isn't realy a bitch post just stating what appears to be the facts as i see them. I will just continue on my merry way playing with friends and picking up little tiny improvments to my character from time to time, wont ever see time or elemental planes but then again I never put in the 80 hours a week play time to get there. I am only as far as I am from having fun and helping friends, in the end I guess I did have a good time. Will continue to run around being blissfully unaware of uberness and uber guilds, till I end up canceling my account. Till then see you around E-Marr if you call it home.</div></div><hr />
