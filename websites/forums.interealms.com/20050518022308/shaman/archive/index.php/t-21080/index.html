<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been looking at what is to come for me in terms of endgame and my role in groups for varying opinions and ideas for increase my over all usefulness.   What I have found is that there are a few items that need to be addressed in order for our survival in the future. I would to be implemented in one form or another in hopes of keeping the noble Shaman,   a viable class to play.<br />
<br />
1 – Cannibalize over Time.  A short duration spell, similar in duration to our ‘heal over time’ line. I know that this would take a buff slot, however I believe that this could be beneficial for movement and keeping up in a fast passed environment, while at the same time staying true to our class defining health to mana regeneration<br />
<br />
2 – Reverse Splurt DoT.  This spell would be fast to cast, 2-3 second range and would deal a majority of its damage in the first few ticks, gradually reducing until it’s effects are gone.  Since this spell would be cast soon after a slow, the agro would have to be relatively small, sort of like the disease Dot’s are.  No name suggestion here.<br />
<br />
3 – Thalger’s Spiritual Gift.  This spell would fall in line with the Enchanters Clarity line of spells, however, it would add Endurance, an improved Endurance regeneration rate, and a moderate boost to Attack.  To remain useful, this would have to stack with the Avatar line.   The spells should have similar duration and level restrictions as the Clarity line does.  This name I came up with, referring to the creator of the Spear of Fate, and the gift that he might grant through other Heyokah’s.<br />
<br />
4 – Rage Upgrade.  The Clerics can melee and efficiently regenerate mana with Yalup V.   I don’t think hath it would be to much to ask for an upgrade to the rage line of spells to slightly increase the Shaman’s mana regeneration to that of sitting for a short time during combat.  After all, we would definitely not out damage our melee hybrid cousins, Beastlords, nor would we mitigate damage as good as they can due to the limitations of our skills.  But the minor addition of DPS could help keep us in groups<br />
<br />
5 – Buff Restructure.  Now what I am hitting at here is to get some of the new abilities, like accuracy or strikethrough incorporated into our existing higher end buffs, as these are level restricted to the younger players, and make our buffs a little more meaningful when most players have their Stats already boosted to the 305 cap.  Granted, this one is vague to say the least, I would still like to see this in the near future.<br />
<br />
6 – Improved Healing.  I don’t want to be as good as the Druid as a healer, but I want to be at least somewhere in the ballpark on this one….  This can be done in a few ways, a group heal over time would be one.  Another could be just simple upgrades to the heals we do have, and a slight boost to the cap on Mending of Craig to name a few.<br />
<br />
In closing, I do not believe that the Shaman wants to be the healer in a group, so I do not place high importance on the healing aspect.  However, I do firmly believe that what Shaman need is a reasonable increase to our contribution of DPS.  Be it in the form of fairly efficient DD spells with a comparably long recast time, or in splurt type as I suggested above, or better buffs that make the overall group deal better damage than their stat caps restrict them to, or just better melee capabilities to get more involved while contributing more.<br />
<br />
This is my first post in these forums, so please add any constructive comments or suggestions to help me get a better picture in my dreams of what a Shaman in this era should be. <br />

<br />
Actually, what i was getting at was the short duration part, 4 ticks or so, not the long term, illusion like the necro.  My reasoning for this is a Shaman can cast a Canibalize over time, run to next spot, while in essesnce casting 3 successive Canniblaize's and running at the same time.... I would never suggest a Shaman to switch classes to a Druid to get the long lasting effects of SoE, rather than casting a SoW and a Levitation and a Spirit Sight.<br />
<br />
I asked for constructive comments.....  thanks though.<br />

Actually, I would have moved it from the Proposal thread. Additional ideas/suggestions were not the intent of that thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, they refuse to even fix the trivial, annoying things (that Brenlo even asked us about once, I believe)..such as;<br />
<br />
1 - We're still the only caster that doesnt have an improved version of the appropriate invis spell. Druids have improved camo and innate camo AA ability. Likewise, clerics have improved invis vs undead and innate invis vs undead, I believe. I believe all the robes have improved versions of their respective invis spells also. Hell, even rangers have innate camo AA ability.<br />
<br />
2 - Our stupid pet, even though it's a spirit wolf does not have innate Spirit of Wolf when summoned. Hell, mage pets now come fully equipped with phantom armor - which makes less sense than our pets running as fast as a wolf.<br />
<br />
3 - Talisman of Alacrity is still less haste than our best single target buff (at least, last time I cared to log in anyway). I heard they are planning to fix that though. <br />
<br />
4 - Buffs still poof if they land right as the old one wears off. And they still fade without warning randomly sometimes as well - i.e. without blinking to let you know first.<br />
<br />
None of these fixes would affect how 'balanced' we are in the least, and a couple of these annoyances have been around almost since day one. So if they cant, or wont, fix this stuff I wouldnt hold my breath for anything actually different. Especially with what we've been told about what our class is destined to be in the future in their eyes. Pretty much why I'm not playing anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1 – Cannibalize over Time.  A short duration spell, similar in duration to our ‘heal over time’ line. I know that this would take a buff slot, however I believe that this could be beneficial for movement and keeping up in a fast passed environment, while at the same time staying true to our class defining health to mana regeneration<br />
Mana regeneration is rarely a limiting factor in what I can do. I find myself limited by my casting times usually. That being said I would rather have our ancient cannibalize spell made available to everyone but everything that reduces my number of clicks is a good thing. It just will not effect class balance much if any.<br />
<br />
2 – Reverse Splurt DoT.  This spell would be fast to cast, 2-3 second range and would deal a majority of its damage in the first few ticks, gradually reducing until it’s effects are gone.  Since this spell would be cast soon after a slow, the agro would have to be relatively small, sort of like the disease Dot’s are.  No name suggestion here.<br />
Assuming you can not overwrite this spell with itself this seems like a decent spell.<br />
<br />

This spell would fall in line with the Enchanters Clarity line of spells, however, it would add Endurance, an improved Endurance regeneration rate, and a moderate boost to Attack.

This name I came up with, referring to the creator of the Spear of Fate, and the gift that he might grant through other Heyokah’s.<br />
Do melees run out of endurance at all? I know this has been fiddled with a lot but I have never actually heard someone saying they were out of endurance.<br />
<br />
4 – Rage Upgrade.  The Clerics can melee and efficiently regenerate mana with Yalup V.   I don’t think hath it would be to much to ask for an upgrade to the rage line of spells to slightly increase the Shaman’s mana regeneration to that of sitting for a short time during combat.  After all, we would definitely not out damage our melee hybrid cousins, Beastlords, nor would we mitigate damage as good as they can due to the limitations of our skills.  But the minor addition of DPS could help keep us in groups<br />
Doing an extra 5 damage per hour will not help us. Yaulp is not what lets cleric do semi-decent melee damage. And I certainly do not need more short term buffs that take up a buff slot, a spell gem and require a lot of clicking.<br />
<br />
5 – Buff Restructure.  Now what I am hitting at here is to get some of the new abilities, like accuracy or strikethrough incorporated into our existing higher end buffs, as these are level restricted to the younger players, and make our buffs a little more meaningful when most players have their Stats already boosted to the 305 cap.  Granted, this one is vague to say the least, I would still like to see this in the near future.<br />
Agreed. I do not even care if our pure stat buffs fade into uselessness as people max their stats but Focus and Avatar should remain useful.<br />
<br />
6 – Improved Healing.  I don’t want to be as good as the Druid as a healer, but I want to be at least somewhere in the ballpark on this one….  This can be done in a few ways, a group heal over time would be one.  Another could be just simple upgrades to the heals we do have, and a slight boost to the cap on Mending of Craig to name a few.<br />
We do not need more efficient long term healing, especially not in GoD. And Kragg's needs more then just a slight upgrade to be worth casting.<br />
<br />
In closing, I do not believe that the Shaman wants to be the healer in a group, so I do not place high importance on the healing aspect.<br />
I take it that is why healing is the number one issue in the very post you intended to add this to? You may not want to be a healer but we are a priest class, we have been healers from day one and a lot of us would like it to stay that way.<br />
<br />
However, I do firmly believe that what Shaman need is a reasonable increase to our contribution of DPS.  Be it in the form of fairly efficient DD spells with a comparably long recast time, or in splurt type as I suggested above, or better buffs that make the overall group deal better damage than their stat caps restrict them to, or just better melee capabilities to get more involved while contributing more.<br />
I am all for DDs as these are the easiest to balance. Why we would need recast times I do not know though. All that changes is that I have to alternate my top two nukes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also play a rogue, and with the revamped 'Sneak Attack' line I find myself running low or out of endurance quite often.  Many monks that I speak with have also stated that they run low or out of Endurance when chain pulling, and I have heard warriors complain that they need to wait for a bit for their Endurance to replenish.  I assume that if a melee is out of their 'melee mana' it is not critical to a group setting, and not announced like it would be if say the Cleric ran out of mana.  Also, I am under the impression that there will be new additions to the Endurance Disciplines as EQ progresses, in an attempt to trim the huge gap between melee and casters.<br />
<br />

<br />
I agree that healing is an issue.  Granted, a moderate boost to our current healing is a must, I think our days of being a secondary healer were gone after the release of PoP.  However, I do not agree that it is the primary reason that Shaman are losing our appeal to be invited into groups due to our poor healing.  We are evolving into a class of sub healers, but  unlike our predecessors, we are about as good as a Paladin.  At one point we were 'about as good' as a druid for our healing, but that is not what is needed to make us viable in the future.  I stand firm that Shaman need to add more DPS, one way or another. <br />
<br />
I am all for DDs as these are the easiest to balance. Why we would need recast times I do not know though. All that changes is that I have to alternate my top two nukes.<br />
<br />
I would love to see some more efficiency to our DD's, not to mention ones that actually deal a moderate amount of damage in comparison with the other priests.<br />
<br />
I get confused as the proposed changes would in essence make us Druids that slow instead of port, with a slightly better pet.  While not meaning to add more confusion to the hopefully solution to the growing uselessness problem, I ask....<br />
-What is it that makes us Shaman?  <br />
-What will help to keep us in the end/future game, while keeping us distinctly Shaman?<br />
-What did you like about being a Shaman before being rendered obsolete? <br />

<br />
Oh yeah.  I forgot to add in my dream Shaman...<br />
<br />
7 - Spirit of the Alpha.  An improvement to the SoW line of spells, with a movement bonus and duration similar to that of the FoE and SoE spells, with added abilities like an addition to Attack similar to Bih Li.  This movement buff would NOT be fragile.  Something along this line is not too much to ask, seeing as Shaman get SoW at level 9, it would seem that we should be a little better at it than our Druid counterparts and the Rangers, who get theirs a little later on.  The Spell name would be named after the wolf pack leader, called 'the Alpha', it seemed to fit, as an upgrade to SoW.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the comments :)<br />
OK, this is the end now.<br />
