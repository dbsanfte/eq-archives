<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xequecal</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is it perfectly ok for me to make extremely tasteless jokes about fat people, Mexicans, Poles, the French, the English, Arabs, Poles, Germans, Canadians, and Muslims in public, but even the slightest insulting remark about black people, women, Jews, or Christians makes the entire room quiet to a whisper. At that point about six people inform me I am a racist piece of worm excrement, and that if I don't shut up they'll pound my ass. These are the same people who were making Mexican jokes 2 minutes ago. This baffles me to no end. Why don't they make the same connection?</div></div><hr />

Double standards, just like taking it easy on one's son when he goes out on a date, but restrict/worry about one's daughter. (Talk to my nephew about girls and such, but told my niece she wasnt dating until she was 25, but her father said it would be 30 before she can :)</div></div><hr />

When you pick on the majority, people get upset, so steer clear about making jokes about african-american christian women.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The key answer is fear, many people fear that they will be tarred with the bigotry brush for being observed laughing at a joke that might be offensive to someone with some power.  <br />
<br />
The overall answer is that all of those jokes were wrong, tasteless, and offensive.  You just pushed it over the line into areas where they were not willing to go.<br />
<br />
Or maybe you just can't tell a joke.<br />
