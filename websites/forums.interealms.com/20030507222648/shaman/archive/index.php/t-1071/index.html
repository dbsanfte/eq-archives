<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bustyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is going to try to kill Ixblat for a couple of our clerics soon and I am the highest shaman in our guild. (lvl 57)  Is there any chance I can land a Malosini or slow on him?  Or do you have to be lvl 60 to pull this off?  Any info from you guys would be greatly appreciated, thanks!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Froosty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did slow him at 58 without malo,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've never managed to slow him before being level 60 even with someone else maloing. Your luck may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">malosini is hard to land until malo and tashed.<br />
<br />
slow...random almost.<br />
<br />
eventually it will land.....if you live long enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bustyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm sure you're all dying to hear what happened... ;)   I went into this taking Smasherr's advice, figuring I would cast slow over and over til I got aggro and died hehe.  But on cast number 3, it stuck.  &quot;Ixiblat Fer has been SLOWED&quot;  My guild about died!  I couldn't believe it.  We went on to kill Ix 2 more times, both times slow landed on the 3rd or 4th cast.  And I didnt get aggro once.  So for any of you that are wondering, you can slow Ix at 57.  He was tashed, but not malosied.  I looked like the hero (even though I was just doing my job!)  Thanks for your input guys.  :)</div></div><hr />
