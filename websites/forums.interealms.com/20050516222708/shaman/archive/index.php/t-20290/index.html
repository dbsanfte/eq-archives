<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since there seems to be a class war brewing here between the shamans and clerics, it's best to nip this in the bud right now.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it would be a good idea for a group of experienced shamans, druids, and clerics to meet in a serverwide chat channel and discuss the healing issues in GoD.  They might figure out some things we could present to the devs that would make all 3 priest classes content with how the other 2 classes work.  Remember, what the devs do to us DOES affect other classes.  What we need is a consensus, not a round of class-envy inspired cross-board flaming.<br />
<br />
Oh, and friends and neighbors:  please do be civil.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This could work if it were heavily moderated.  Maybe the priests could vote for a few representatives, so it didn't turn into a screaming mess.</div></div><hr />

Some of those clerics over there are utterly idotic and don't think before they open their yaps. I don't have class envy. I know clerics are superior healers.<br />
<br />
I've been playing Aruman Shaman since Day 1 of Veeshan. This was when no one really knew what classes were able to do at level 50.<br />
<br />
Would I change my choice of class with hindsight? Not a chance, but this does not mean I am not getting annoyed with what is happening to the Shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think a server wide &quot;all&quot; invited channel would work at all.  I think we should pick 3 to 5 of the best shaman to represent us and they can pick 3 to 5 of their best clerics to represent them.   Then there is no need for a moderator.  I think that would work much better.  Pick the oldest and the wisest, then there will not be as big of a pissing contest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To accept such a &quot;post&quot; in a summit representing your class should and would be an extreme compliment from your fellow peers. However, you would have to think long and hard along with being very cautious choosing such a position. Could you imagine the target that would be placed square between your eyes not only by the player base, specifically your class, but also by SOE.<br />
<br />
Just think should the decided changes from said summit fall flat on it's arse who do you think everyone would be pointing fingers at? Not only would your peers or other classes, that deemed themselves being nerfed, also the Devs. At least Brenlo and other SOE employees get compensated for taking the criticism and abuse from those who are so passionate about this game, as has been evidenced in many threads lately, they have choosen to put themselves in that position. Now you not only want to pay monthly for the ability to play the game but also want to develop content, might not be designing zone but it's still dealing with development of classes, and place yourself in front of the firing squad should things head South?<br />
<br />
Sure it could all work out and everyone ride off into the sunset living happily ever after. Just have to worry about the fact that your in the spotlight for mediating this &quot;Priest Balance&quot; with no control over the outcome or implementation. Just a word of caution should something actually come of it (Ok more than a word)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I may be becoming grumpy and cynical (sigh, yes I read the threat in the cleric rant forum), but I can see how a forum of the priests would go, at least in my own mind.<br />
<br />
The end result would be it would be agreed that clerics need to be given slow and dots so they can solo, druids need stronger heals so they can be secondary clerics in near all situations.  And it would be decided by a two to one margin that shamans are still over-powered, have unlimited mana, and need to have the cost of all their heals, not just BoT, raised to compensate, without any increase in the amount healed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">while we might get some positive support from other classes (for various reasons) do not give any other class input on our fate.<br />
<br />
we have enough &quot;what race makes the best shaman?&quot; daily thread as an example.<br />
<br />
besides, this is often framed in a lvl 65, +aa, debate.  (i think hard LDoN and PoJ trials also myself, but that is just me) tell me how other classes qualify for that.<br />
<br />
SoE started (and continues) the constant degradation of the shaman class.  we can beat them over the head with numbers, comparisons, with slow/without, expansion after expansion degradation, compare to Mob or other classes.<br />
<br />
imho, it actually won't make any difference.  SoE isn't going to make any changes; even if they did agree with us; not as long as the money comes in every monthy.<br />
<br />
or until we get to loud to be ignored.</div></div><hr />
