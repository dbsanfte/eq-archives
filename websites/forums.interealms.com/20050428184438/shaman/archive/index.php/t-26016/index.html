<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After reading the discussion on sta vs. spi for priests, i thought this might be of interest to the community.  Druids were generally very negative about spirit, but that is starting to change as they(we) are being forced in to a restoration talent build.  Innervate, the top talent in druid's restoration tree, gives 400% mana regen (100% while casting) for 20 seconds.  My experience appears to be typical, although my spi is higher than most posters there (193) - I can be almost OOM, fire Innervate, start casting non-stop, and be full mana when the icon flicks off (e.g. low mana with an add, spam moonfire to kill first, mixed with an instant cast HoT, then moonfire add, regrowth self, FF, spam moonfire till talent icon drops) (mana pool is 3900, as my int is only a few points higher than my spirit).<br />

This is from the realm boards on Thunderhorn (PvE).  Slithe, the OP, is the raid leader for a Horde guild that has by far the largest number of people at/near lvl 60. As you can see, he is very strong on what he expects from most classes.  No feral druids or shadow priests, for example.<br />
<br />
My take?  He has nailed my class, so I will give him the benefit of the doubt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was curious to see what he said about Shamans because I am interested in what I should be doing on raids at 60. He didn't have anything solid or fleshed out, just said restoration and enhancement. And that they should heal. In my experience Shaman healing is OK to save someone's bacon in an emergency but it in no way shape or form replaces Druid or Priest healing. I can't see that being a primary role on raids unless you are incredibly short on healers and you have no choice. To me, seems like our strengths lie in various totems that do things like increase melee dps, mitigate damage, and cures and raises resists. Plus I am keeping improved shocks no matter what! That is a must in my mind for any kind of pvping. I wanted enhancement even at 60 because of the extra durability it provides. Plus let's be honest, it is fun. The only restoration I have is increased speed on lesser healing wave. I had one point left over so I took that clear casting one in elemental. Haven't tested it out yet but seems like it would be nice occaisionally and nothing else really stood out. <br />
<br />
Serepi I know where you are coming from. My wife loves being a shadow priest and I doubt she will ever give it up. Too much fun for her, she feels like she can take things on now without being afraid of dying all the time. Hell she can out dps me easily. Course I whip her butt in duels, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman with restore does have tools, instant nature spell for one, can pop of a big heal instantly, or a instant chain lightning :) Tough to interupt small heal, and you still have all your shocks, just not as powerful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gee - is this the old Crucible?  I can't believe that you are rejecting advice from someone playing another class ... well, I think I did once see some negative comments in response to advice from a bard (Fansy?  or was it Thott?  I forget)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Since respec'ing is so ridiculously easy in WoW, I hardly see the point in what appears to be flat-out power-tripping - requiring set talent builds for guild membership?  Seems like that guild is going to lose a LOT in terms of exploring the possibilities of different builds.<br />
<br />
The hostility this post is experiencing might have a lot to do with someone trying to turn wow into eq1.  Nobody's &quot;forced&quot; into any build, unless you choose a guild like &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well, I think I did once see some negative comments in response to advice from a bard  <br />
<br />
Oh my.<br />
<br />
Yes. You saw &quot;some negative comments&quot; when Thott came in with his &quot;graphs&quot; and made some hyperbolic claims that weren't backed up in reality.<br />
<br />
He showed himself to be a complete a55 and utter idiot as he attempted to tell a four plus year old community aspects of their class which they knew not to be true.<br />
<br />
How bad was it?<br />
<br />
People in his own guild who routinely posted on the SC were DEAFENINGLY SILENT in their defense of Thott.<br />
<br />
So you are a &quot;zerg leader&quot; as Mill says. Your &quot;accomplishments&quot; include keeping 100 drones happy as you keep doing the same content over, and over, and over.  You were the first to kill Onyxia and you farm Molten core. You have 45 days played on your main. <br />

End game is just like EQ sadly, you need 40 screaming kids to spend 100's of hours getting a key, getting phat loots, and then rinse, repeat.<br />

Does anyone here actually think Afterlife and FoH and people like them have extra skill? No, they are like everyone else, but with alot more time and alot more dedication to a game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shaman are a ridiculously versitile class.  Speccing for one role might be fine on a PvE server ... practically speaking, but really it's limiting the possibilities.  Spirit is often overlooked, but in PvP it means next to jack.  Shaman have no mass mana return like we did in EQ1.  I don't get why he wants shaman to split specs in enhancement/rest though as on raids most shaman break out the shields and one handers.  I would think that an ele/rest build would be better for raids.  Personally I'm going 23 ele/7 enh/21 rest.  Gets me EF, NS and IGW (which I might ditch when I get 60).  I like my build, works well for my playstyle, but it's not for everyone.  A friend of mine has gone heavy specced in enchancement and he's a mower when WF procs.</div></div><hr />

No but Mill, one worry I have about PVP is the ongoing &quot;gear gap&quot; that raid gear and even instance gear grants someone over those unable to raid/instance.  Gear alone shouldn't supplant skill in PVP, but if EQ is any example it eventually will be gear &gt; skill.  When raid rogues are rolling at 8k hps with 400+ dps weapons and you're only around 5k and 250 dps, good luck.  That's the biggest long term downfall I see with any kind of PVP in MMORPG's- the complete inability to balance equipment over skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The gear gap is a big point. A huge point in fact. <br />
<br />
If raid gear turns out to be 3-4 times as good as available gear for non raiders like it was in EQ then there will be some huge grief coming. <br />
<br />
But for now. With my group of 5. we can do any zone with the exception of molten core. (and Onyexia) And with a workable raid limit of 40 rather than 72 Actually going on a raid might not be the migrane-maker that EQ's heyday was. <br />
<br />
I still think 32 should be more than enough. Or for the 5 man group system 30.  But I can probably live with tacking on another ten folks. as long as they are not twits. <br />
<br />
Also if the game is balanced for 8 Priests and 1 warrior with filler for everything else then (snore) But so far I see decent overlap with classes with druids being a huge filler class. I honestly belive you could have 10 druids in a raid and be very content. <br />
<br />
Hey what can I say I am having a ball. I just wish our 5th would get his computer working again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">LOL - Faern, I think you overlooked the sarcasm in my second post.  I thought the reference to Fansy made it pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
As a reminder, Fansy was a level 5 bard who trained people on one of the PvP servers, and wrote hilarious pre-teen commentaries about it.  Putting him in the same sentence with Thott was meant to stress that Thott was included as a negative example of one class commenting on the way to play another class.<br />
<br />
sorry if I wasn't clear enough.</div></div><hr />
