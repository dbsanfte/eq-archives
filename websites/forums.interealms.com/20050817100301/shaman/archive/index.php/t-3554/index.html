<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm debating over what shield to upgrade to. As of now I'm using a Testament ov Vanear heh. I know, it's pretty sad =\ Anyhow, I have been searching for a shield to to replace my Testament of Vanear, and the two that caught my eye so far are the Sarnak Battle Shield and the Skull Marked Shield. I'm not sure which one to get. They are both about the same price. I have 3k right now and both are around 2k. Some quick info about my char...I like to Solo a lot and rarely group/raid. My resists are kind of low and my wis at the moment is 161 only. Any suggestions on what shield to upgrade to would be much appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well i would go with SBS ... the stats are nice sta and hp and resists .. i use it at level 59 now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go for the SBS, it is a great shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, looks like I'll go for the SBS. Thanks for the input :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Am I the only one who uses a bladestopper?  25ac 50hps 15sta, got mine for 1k.  It doesn't have the resists of the sarnak shield, but for every day use I like it better (I just keep my sarnak shield in my bag of resist gear).  Ok, it does look like crap, but I'm convinced that looking like you dressed yourself in the dark out of a goodwill dumpter will be in fashion soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally I chose to not use a SBS (when I had money to upgrade shields)<br />
I went with clay guardian instead. 200p for 25ac 50hp or 2k for SBS.<br />
<br />
I used the rest of the cash to upgrade more stuff. :)</div></div><hr />
