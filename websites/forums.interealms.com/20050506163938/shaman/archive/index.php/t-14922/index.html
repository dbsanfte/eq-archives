I am interested in the comments of other classes and would appreciate any input, when posting please include your class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You won't get any love for kiters and the classes that do it from this forum I assure you :).  Two kinds of characters in EQ:  Kiters and victims.  I miss the kunark days when everything 51+ summoned :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My two cents: It's the problem of the person, and not the action.  If you can control what you're doing and be accomodating to those who need to use the area, fine, do it.<br />
<br />
I also agree on the special properties of HoH -- it's a small zone, it's easy to move around in invis, the graveyard is big, etc.<br />
<br />
Here's my checklist though:<br />
<br />
1. Can I control my kite?<br />
2. Is there not another reasonable available camp spot?<br />
3. Can I move my kite quickly if I need to to allow people to rez?<br />
4. Can I see an unannounced rez coming beforehand and make allowances?<br />
<br />
If you get 4 yes, go ahead.<br />
<br />
The problem with the original post was that the idiot in PoNB failed on counts 2 (there's plenty of other places in PoN to kite that are just as good) and 4 (you can't usually see a rez coming in the PoN GY from a mile off) and he was unwilling to do #3 (kiter was just an idiot).<br />
<br />
The only time I've killed in a graveyard was root-dotting with 2 druids in HoH.  There was nobody else around, all 3 of us had root, we could easily have seen and accounted for an incoming rez, and the zone in area was taken, and we didn't have the firepower to hold anything deeper in, though we could have pulled the mob out to the ZI area if need be.<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm perfectly ok with people hunting at zone in and out, you just have to recognize the tradeoffs. I find it pretty humorous that people complain about trains there.  My opinion is &quot;if you're standing on the tracks, you sound pretty dumb complaining about all the trains.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You pretty much have to watch out for your own azz in any PoP GY because they tend to be near zonelines and awareness is key.  Never assume that any zone entrance/exit is a safe area and always ask for an &quot;all clear&quot; before accepting res unless you are getting clicked by someone you trust.  <br />
<br />
The influx of people into many of the newly opened zones has definitely made the zoneline/GY areas dangerous spots to hang out in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>slownsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Training of the graveyard, pull spot, and zone lines is a perfectly valid tactic for surpressing enemy CR in a contested zone on Sullon Zek.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.  I've never minded people hunting at GY's or zone lines.  But if you do choose to hunt there, you assume the risk of trains and, heaven forfend, unannounced trains, etc.  I always get a chuckle from people who hunt at the zoneline and /ooc &quot;Thanks for the train!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not that I condone the trainers, or whatever, but if you choose to hunt zonelines, you gotta take the bad with the good.<br />
<br />
GY's in PoP are a little different in the fact that when a certain amount of time has elapsed, people are compelled to do their ressing there.  They have no choice, no matter where their camp was located in the zone.  Kiter's (a nasty lot generallly) should respect that fact.</div></div><hr />

And this is one of the main reasons I would never play on a PvP server. Its no wonder PvP servers are on the low end of the totem pole. People were getting tired of coming back to normal after a rez/etc when a 12 year old trained them because he could and thought it would be funny. <br />
<br />
Slow down an enemy CR.... I may play on a blue server but I at least respect my fellow players. Of course im an adult and have common sence and respect for everyone elses play time. Id hate it if i was trained 5 times back to back wasting a few hours of my night on nothing but getting rezzed/CRing myself so I wouldn't do it to another player. I see your a Troll anyways so im not even sure why im responding to you other than commmenting on your apparent lack of respect for other peoples feelings.</div></div><hr />

Although that happens, it isn't the only reason.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
When the enemy team comes in and disrupts your raid by trains or by manaburning/deathtouching the clerics or whatever on sullon, you kill them.  if you let them CR before your raid is complete, they will continue to disrupt you.  so, the idea is to surpress their CR until your raid is compete.<br />
<br />

I'm not a troll, i'm a barbarian.  why would that matter?  isn't this board for all shamen, regardless of race?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My opinions is this:<br />
<br />
If you fight at a ZONE LINE, you are doing something acceptable but you have to accept that you might get trained.  Its something of a trade-off.<br />
<br />
If you fight at a GRAVEYARD, you are doing something that is not acceptable.  There is the issue of low health agro on rezzes, to be sure, but there is also the isssue of evacuations.  In HoH, for example, when you evacuate you end up (guess where) in the graveyard.  There is no way to forsee that someone is about to pop there (or a group of someones).   Thats my reasoning for thinking graveyard kiting (or root-rotting for that matter) is not cool.<br />
<br />
Thats my two cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lokust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And this is one of the main reasons I would never play on a PvP server. <br />
<br />
This is your choice, but there is no need to be hostile toward those that enjoy this style of play.<br />
<br />
Its no wonder PvP servers are on the low end of the totem pole. <br />
<br />
PvP servers on most games tend to be lower population because there are fewer safe areas in which to safely hunt.  Generally speaking, a more aggressive population tends to lower the number of players a server can realistically support.<br />
<br />
People were getting tired of coming back to normal after a rez/etc when a 12 year old trained them because he could and thought it would be funny. <br />
<br />
Making generalizations about the age of the player behind the character is about as unbecoming as making generalizations about the race or gender of the player.  Don't assume that all people who enjoy competitive play are kids.<br />
<br />
Slow down an enemy CR.... I may play on a blue server but I at least respect my fellow players. <br />
<br />
On a PvP server, you're talking about enemy players who CAN and WILL KILL YOU.  There is no reason to allow them free reign so that they can do so.  It is, in fact, a very poor tactical decision to allow them free access.  <br />
<br />
Of course im an adult and have common sence and respect for everyone elses play time. <br />
<br />
Again, playing the &quot;age card.&quot;  I've seen plenty of adults that acted more childish than the teenagers I've seen in these games.  <br />
<br />
Id hate it if i was trained 5 times back to back wasting a few hours of my night on nothing but getting rezzed/CRing myself so I wouldn't do it to another player. QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Then I suppose the PvP servers are not for you.  No one forces you to play there, so stay blue, by all means.  <br />
<br />
[QUOTE='Meowlin']I see your a Troll anyways so im not even sure why im responding to you other than commmenting on your apparent lack of respect for other peoples feelings.<br />
<br />
I thought the original post was informative, letting people who do not experience that style of play know that there was more than one perspective.  You do not have to agree with that perspective, but responding with derogatory marks is essentially the same as trolling yourself.  I fail to understand what you mean by &quot;lack of respect for other people's feelings.&quot;  They knew what it was going to be like when they joined a PvP server.<br />
<br />
[edited for spelling]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PvP is irrelevant, because it applies to 10% of the population.  It is sometimes interesting to hear about the tactics, but they dont apply anywhere but on your server.<br />
<br />
Af for hunting in/kiting thru/trainign graveyards well.. I dont do it on purpose, but sh*t happens.  If you are running to an exit (anywhere, not just PoP) and someone is in the way, they are gonna have to deal with it.  You fight at/near the zone thats a risk you take.<br />
<br />
In PoP, graveyards are usualy at the zone in/out.  This complicates things.  You know that if you run the train there you will escape, but that you will be hurting others.  On the other hand if you just suck it up and take your death, you can likely get a rez and rebuff from one of the people zoning in.<br />
<br />
Kiting in the HoH graveyards is relatively safe... its a big place with plenty of room.  However; I have been rezzed there and pulled instant low-hp-agro from someones mob and died.  It was kind of funny, and I just got rezzed right back a second later, but it shows that its not completely safe.</div></div><hr />

Back in the day, my group was doing werewolves in PoN....a druid comes in and starts kiting RIGHT OVER US.  I asked him to stop.  He didn't reply...then he did it again, and the mob somehow became unsnared!   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for gy's. I dont train or hunt around them. After your body ends up there from the timer you cant take it out of the gy. People have to rez there not by choice.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree, if you train a gy ie you're running for your life, even if you don't give a sufficient train message &lt;-- (who is to say what's sufficient).. it's ok.. but if you are fighting close to the gy where someone who takes a rez will die, then I don't want to go on paper what I will do :) and as far as pvp goes, no one has a right to say anything about anything, you're there to basically make the lives of your enemies miserable and the lives of your friends/allies enjoyable..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Of course im an adult and have common sence and respect for everyone elses play time. Id.<br />
<br />
You know I'm slightly older then the people your acusing now at 19 but as long as I've heard statements like this I just have to shake my head. Since when does being an adult automatically mean you have common sense and that you respect other people? Since when does age have any effect on this at all? It's just a big generalization that really can't even come close to the truth when the fact is that human beings of any age can be disrespectful and stupid. <br />
<br />
I just don't like hearing statements like the above and to me thats just shows a disrespect for youth.<br />
<br />
Finished reading the rest of the posts and I come across this<br />
<br />
 People who pull to the GY are gimp 12 year punks. <br />
<br />
Again the above applies but on top of that I just have to wonder about the kind of people who think age makes them superior. It's the same line of thinking that all old people are useless, when in fact many of them can teach us a lot about life in general and for that matter just teach. To think that there is nothing youth can teach you is pure arrogance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Flash of Light also surprises those kiters very nicely, specially those quading.<br />
<br />
They may have the mana to take out 4 at once, but not all that often do they havethe mana to take out 3 then 1 that is still on their ass.<br />
<br />
Although that would be a rather bad tactic to do to someone training the GY since there would then be an uncontrolled mob hitting whatever is closest to it, cancel magic would work better.<br />
<br />
To those playing PvP, do whatcha gotta do guys.<br />
<br />
To those flaming the PvP'ers, you have the right to flame them when you play there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Graveyard kiting is a simple case of people seeing a mobless safe spot and kiting there regardless of the consequences simply because it's easier than looking for a less populated area. Some can do it all day and never have a mob aggro anyone else. Others are skilless threats to society. What really gets me is how many of these people just shrug it off and blame it on the person they just killed by saying it's his fault for being in a kiting area..... How hard can it be to understand that if you're Kiting, it's your responsibility to stay away from other groups.... Stay away from graveyards.... Stay away from people medding .... If you have to choose between taking it like a man and Killing a group....DIE !!!!!  And if you do train someone, then you have wronged them and the least you can do is apoligise.<br />
<br />
That reminds me, was stoicism ever fixed to only work in group ? It might actually still be worth questing for if it hasn't :)<br />

By implementing graveyards, they were hoping to eliminate the tracks in those zones.  People, with their wonderful sense of community, would rather train GY and kill 40 people, as long as they live.  <br />
<br />
People like that suck.</div></div><hr />
