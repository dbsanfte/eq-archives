<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone in the know of how much better VP gets at lvl 2 or 3? Is it just the duration it sticks or does it stick easier too (not counting you have to be higher level yourself to train them)? Worth going for or might as well stay at first level?<br />
<br />
Everyone doesn't seem to agree about the good of radiant cure - some say it's well worth the starting points and some say it doesn't get useful until lvl 2. Which is the more common oppinion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Radiant Cure isnt a bad purchase, particularly on a PvP server. I have it and use it to clear Tash, Disease and Poison DOTs, and it'll remove Malo as well (although for some reason, I can only clear Malo when I cast it on myself, but cant clear it if someone else casts it on me). I only have RC1, but plan to get RC2 when I get some more extra points.<br />
<br />
Going to get Virulent Paralysis soon, since all the melees in my guild curse whenever the topic of VP comes up. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there's another thread on RC.  Summary: it's pimp, get it, you will love it.  <br />
<br />
Dunno on VP, I like level one tho.  Seems to last plenty long enough for my purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's also a thread on VP, it's highly useful like RC.<br />
<br />
The only difference is, RC is easy to use, you press the button and things get cured. VP is a little bit more complicated because it's uses depends on what you are trying to accomplish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks :)<br />
<br />
I take it you all like RC from lvl 1 already which sounds great to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's also a thread on VP, it's highly useful like RC.  <br />
<br />
I was using search first and could not find anywhere discussed the differences of VP 1, 2 and 3... would you please point me to it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">RC's main use imho is for getting rid of roots/snares and other magic based debuffs (Ala malo) that can't be cured by regular poison/disease cures.  Level 1 is horridly unreliable, don't count on it to save you when your rooted, because it probably won't.  Level 2 is a lot more reliable though and its saved my tail several times.  Its not 100% reliable though.<br />
<br />
The curse counter element of it is just too small and too long a reuse to be much use other than quickly clearing a few ssra trap aoes if they get set off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I do have VP 1 and am very happy with it, especially as a PvP tool... heh<br />
My question is about comparing it with lvl2/lvl3 and how much better it gets, to help me in my decision on where to put my aa skill points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anything that saves mana is pretty damned nifty. I have RC2 and VP1 and am very satified. Especially in CoD where most mobs leave some kind of goo on you, even with 200+pr/dr. Tash, malo, dots, some curses all go bi bi. <br />
<br />
VP1 gets it's hotkey mashed the few occasions I see root resisted. Not often, but often enough to make me glad I have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use VP almost all the time instead of a regular root.  The only time I bring up a regular root is when I know I'm going to be doing a lot of crowd control.  I have VP 1, and it lasts a decent amount of time.  My understanding is that VP 2 &amp; 3 only improve duration, and nothing else.<br />
<br />
That said, the knockback feature of VP is so useful that I prefer it to regular roots whenever I can.  The only drawback is the 2 min recast delay, but for most situations, that's sufficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've been looking at these two skills as well. I'm currently working on SCM/SCR, but I'm to the point of having to save up 6 points for SCM3. When I get to 3 saved, I know I'll be tempted to spend them.<br />
<br />
The main reason I am thinking of getting Virulent Paralysis is to free up a spell slot. I almost always keep root memmed because it can flat out save your life, but it's not something that gets cast often.<br />
<br />
Is VP reliable enough to replace root for those emergency situations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Briony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I personally don't have RC3, but a few of my guildmates do.  It is very worth it.  Takes off curses that Remove Greater Curse won't, diseases that Abolish doesn't, and since we don't have Abolish Poison, gives us an option for curing that as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">anyone else find that with RC you need to target yourself or a group member for it to work on the whole group<br />
<br />
dont know if its a bug or just mind playing tricks on me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As for if VP can replace your root spell slot . . . maybe.  But only for traveling purposes.  If you're hunting you better have a root up.  Some things are immune to disease or just highly resistant to it and that can be a pain in the patootie.  <br />
Valorium guardians in HoH are resistant to Disease, and will often resist a VP.  However, I pull the two spawns by slapping one with Malicious Decay, then VP right after that.  VP always sticks after that and sticks for a while.  It's so reliable in doing that, that it's my primary method of pulling in HoH.  The other one has to be dealt with tho, and it's running at you.  I'll train it on the warrior, malo/slow and then go back for the malo/slow on the rooted one.  VP is great if you want reliable root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">VP 2 and 3 adds pushback range, height, and root duration.<br />
<br />
It's highly useful when you pull more than 1 mob--it's a free CC tool that can leave a mob parked out of camp, or push a mob who's already in camp out of it's melee range.<br />
<br />
On raids, when you have melees not watching where they position adds, VP's a great tool that you can use to &quot;help&quot; them.<br />
<br />
VP is an AA skill, so you do not have to wait for the 2.5 sec for spells to come back. Normally, it takes a shaman 3 sec to cast Turgur, wait 2.5 secs, then 2-3 sec to cast root (depending on which root you use). With VP, it takes you 3 sec to cast Turgur, and 2 secs to cast VP--the mob will be taken care of in 5 sec flat, instead of taking up to 7.5-8 secs.<br />
<br />
IMO, it's best use is for helping clerics/enchanters when they need to stand there and channel. Our normal roots would not work--mobs are already in melee range, so we'd normally have to agro, then park. With VP, just face the direction you want the mob to go, and push the button.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Abolish disease removes 36 disease counters. Radiant Cure 1 removes just 9, and Radiant Cure 3 removes just 16. Maybe you mean that Radiant removes some dots that are not disease or poison, like Pyrocuror, Splurt, etc. But I doubt it can remove more disease dots than Abolish Disease does.</div></div><hr />
