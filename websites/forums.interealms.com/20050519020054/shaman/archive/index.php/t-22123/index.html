<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I understand, Stat buffs have a minimal effect. Raw bumps like Focus which directly adds HP's, are far more effective or Ancestoral Guard for direct AC. And ofcourse Haste.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are a ton of threads about this.<br />
<br />
Basically:<br />
<br />
Stamina doesn't help our pets<br />
Strength marginally increases DPS (1 dps/50 str if I remember right)<br />
Agility marginally increases mitigation (generally thought not to be worth it)<br />
Dexterity helps them proc if you give them weapons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Does buffing my doggy's STA, AGI, DEX, etc...actually help at all?These things appear to me to matter most, for making dogdog more effective:<br />
<br />
1.  Haste (largest improvement to dps)<br />
2. (tie) HP buffs (largest improvement to survivability)<br />
2. (tie) Set of mage pet toys (improvement to survivability, small haste, good dual wield)<br />
4. Any 2 fast weapons [delay 20], such as sand daggers from Tak (decent dual wield)<br />
5. (tie) Ferine Avatar (small dps improvement, more hits at max)<br />
5. (tie) Regeneration (small increase in survivability)<br />
7. Any 2 1h weapons [delay &lt; 30] (adequate dual wield)<br />
8. other str or dex buffs (possible small increase in dps)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">pets ignore weapon delay unless I am forgeting something,<br />
if you are fighting mobs under lvl 55 your weapon of choice is probably the gnoll hide lariat, serrated bone dirks are also nice, polished granite tomahawk is good when you are lower lvl and dog dog is tanking alot.<br />
<br />
mage summoned weapons rock as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">4. Any 2 fast weapons [delay 20], such as sand daggers from Tak (decent dual wield)<br />
<br />
Weapon delay on pet toys making a difference? That was nerfed years ago, wasn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Weapon delay on pet toys making a difference? That was nerfed years ago, wasn't it?I have not timed it carefully.  But it appears to me that dogdog hits noticeably faster with a faster weapon.<br />
<br />
Will parse it sometime in the next day or two, maybe it is imaginary rather than real.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Weapon delay means nothing to pets.  Ferine Avatar is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;then regen for buffs don't know how you can have them tied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Regen is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FA on mobs that have DS (Tak LDoN)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No, weapon delay was factored out of pets a while back.  Weapon damage and procs still matter--a little.  A pet will never have their damage reduced by bad weapons, but if you give them a high enough base damage weapon, they can do more than their normal max hit.  I believe this was tested with blam sticks out of the old PoMischief.<br />
<br />
Procs are weapon dependent.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ferine Avatar is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;then regen for buffs don't know how you can have them tied.The new beefier regen means Dogdog doesn't need to be healed as often when tanking some mobs.  For example, with Dogdog tanking slowed fish or seahorse in Sirens, I need to Quiescence him once every two fights instead of once per fight.  That's not huge, but it's significant.  <br />
<br />
It's just a feel for it, but I rated that as being about equal to the modest increase in dps from FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Haste is the most obviously beneficial buff. Swift like the wind is a must for pet.<br />
<br />
More hp are of inarguable benefit to the pet - Focus is good for the +hp (and the marginal benefit of +str and +dex). Virtue, Brells, Pot9, etc are all good for pet (stack them if you can).<br />
<br />
Improved Atk is of noticeable benefit, so both +atk and +str buffs should, theoretically, be worthwhile. Ferine avatar has good +atk and +str (and using it on pet can be a timer for refreshing on your group members).<br />
<br />
If the pet is wielding proccing weapons, +dex will increase proc rate.<br />
<br />
Regen is good too.<br />
<br />
Both +AC and +agi should, in theory, help, but in practice, parsing seems to suggest that either there is no benefit, or that the benefit is very very small.<br />
<br />
As a general rule I always buff dogdog with<br />
SLTW + Focus.<br />
If I am not pushed for mana, I give FA and regen<br />
<br />
If I am pet pulling (using Spirit of the Howler), pet gets Spirit of the Shrew and, when about to pull, Quiesence.</div></div><hr />
