<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anybody remember EQ's first intro?  I can't get it to play anymore unless I go to a fresh machine and do an install with my original disc.<br />
<br />
I loved that intro when I first saw it, and it got me so psyched!  Loved when the skinny dude axed the big guy with his throwing weapon, and when the gnomes rescued their buddy from the cage in the dungeon. Granted after a few weeks I opted to turn it off... but I've often wondered...<br />
<br />
Why don't they put introductions in their expansions?  It would be even better timing to do it with the whole Morden/Tondal/Nedaria storyline going on.  Things like cinematics (Like in FFXI or ShadowBane, for instance), really give you that sense of awe and excitedness for logging in for the first time...<br />
<br />
It just saddens me to think that a new person joining EQ has to simply go through a cold series of logo's, and then an introduction screen which is no longer warm and inviting, but cold, dark, and digital-esque.  Not a very good first impression :(<br />
<br />
Would be nice if they could put together a fantastic cinematic for Omens of War.  I know some people may see it as trivial, but it would certainly make for some nice fakeout screenshots for the back of the box, as well as help to impress any crazy people who are actually joining EQ these days (if there even are any...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There were some good EQ movies floating around the internet, much like the red vs. blue idea. <br />
<br />
I'd love to see something like that for EQ. Would be entertaining, and easy for GMs to create.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">probably because making intro movies would cut into their profit margain.<br />
If they did make intro movies all we'd get would be draft copies of some tired concept and they'd run at 5 fps anyway.</div></div><hr />
