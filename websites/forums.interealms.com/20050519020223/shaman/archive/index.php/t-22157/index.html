All the ones at the bottom of the page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Magelo lists them all if you create a profile there. Vah Shir is #25; before the Luclin expansion there were 24.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For those really bored, you can teach yourself languages with an alt.  Put both you and your alt into the appropriate langage, make a hotkey, and spam away near a zone line.  If I recall correctly, someone can train you to one higher than their own skill.  Thus, bob (0) teaches joe to (1).  Then they have to zone.  Joe teaches bob to (2).  Then they have to zone.  Bob teaches joe to (3), etc.<br />
<br />
Tedious, but that's how people had to learn the languages originally for all those obscure ones!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know if you have to zone anymore. But the alt would have to be on a second account. And you can't get yourself to 1 if you're both at 0.<br />
<br />
This was the only productive thing you could do on boats, way back when...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I remember using training points to get a start in languages to help my wizzy friend learn them for research. Man that was a long time ago...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You don't need to zone out.  I did this for my shaman, and created an alt in each of the cities and learned all of the languages that way...gotta remember to make one a rogue to learn thieves cant...anyway, zoning is not required to do this, extreme boredom is however<br />
<br />
O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think they removed the zoning requirement about a year ago, when they started updating your language skill levels in real time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAHAHA!  YES!<br />
<br />
I remember that.  I remember learning a LOT of languages in traveling across OOT back in the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hah!  That should tell you the last time I did languages!  Thanks for the corrections, guys.<br />
<br />
That's one thing I love about these forums--lots of good info, even in the rant threads (something the anti-whiner whiners seem to overlook).<br />
