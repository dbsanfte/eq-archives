Do we really need another one of these? I honestly don't think so. <br />
<br />
I have read through a few posts below and seen the issue starting to come up again. <br />
<br />
I'll target a post made by Sunmoon because I agree with his view point. <br />
<br />
The Ranger class is pretty darn well off in the big picture. Rounded out and put us in the big high end situations and we are doing fairly well. A few other classes really have some issues to gripe about. We have a few, yes. BUt not nearly as many as some others do.<br />
<br />
I'll give you a list of things I would like to see yes. I'll grant you that.<br />
<br />
Warders stacking issues. very annoying adn yeah I would like to see that fixed. Having a slew of buffs overwrite it is more than just inconvenient. <br />
<br />
WOuld really love to see more Custom Graphics on bows. Is it important? No. But it would increase the enjoyment of the game for me. <br />
<br />
I am a little wary of the 2 handed damage on SK's and Paladins vs damage done by raners DW. I too think that they overcompensated a bit and now the margin is a bit too small. Is this an earthshattering mistake? No not really. But that is my opinion. Others may agree or disagree. <br />
<br />
I would like to see more Variety of choices in weapons and even armor at the end game. Not looking for &quot;better&quot; items necessarily but more items of about equal power. I don't like seeing cookie cutter rangers where everyone has the same thing. Again this is mostly a Flavor type of a gripe and not super important. <br />
<br />
Of all of those the only one I would really like to see changed is the Stacking with WP. And I don't mean stacking other buffs but I mean the overwriting issues with others casting on us. <br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents guys. Choose your battles wisely. Don't take for granted what we already have and in the best interest of the health of the game realise that we shouldn't be asking for too much. We are 95 % Balanced already, IMHO. Fix that stacking issue and it will get closer.</div></div><hr />

FIX ARCHERY (walls, line of site, poofing etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felixican Edger</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We'll never see an archery fix of the order everyone wants, simply because it seems to be a hardcoded thing.  If you have an intelligent raid crew with their heads in gear, positioning the mob for archery damage isnt too difficult, rooted mobs being the exception. duh.  And I'm pretty sure there was a posting by one of the tech guys from verant stating that the target too high/low issue would be extremely difficult and time consuming to fix. I agree with Vanidar, known him since the banded mail and combine sword days, he's one of the more level headed rangers out there. The 2h damage by paladins and SK's is pretty nuts, and one disparity i notice is the amount of high damage pal/sk weapons that are more easily obtainable than ranger/warrior analogues. It's annoying, but if you've been a ranger for a while, you'll know we're alot better off than we were, and the old addage about the squeekiest wheel getting nerfed is true here. shhh. go play. that is all.</div></div><hr />
