<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently 2-boxing oow runes using a 56-cleric on my 2nd box in the Murkgliders hive instance.  Strategy is fairly simple.  Root-rot PH mobs with the shaman:<br />
<br />
- pull with malicious decay, then root them with VP<br />
- stick breath of wunshi, breath of ultor, bane, blood, and epic<br />
- reapply dots and VP as they wear off<br />
- cleric sits around ITU and does nothing (can rez me in if i screw up)<br />
<br />
Then when nameds spawns:<br />
<br />
- unsuspend my pet<br />
- pull with petrifying earth, hoping it sticks<br />
- clicky malosini from VP neck + turgurs + cripple<br />
- epic<br />
- ancient nife, hoping for root break before summon<br />
- channel spirit call<br />
- keep Q up on myself<br />
- bane + blood as healing permits<br />
- cleric casts cheal spells like crazy<br />
- keep it rooted once it hits about 20% (no snare)<br />
<br />
Haven't lost yet, but pretty sure at my current gear/AA levels there's no way I could kill these solo without a drastic change of tactics.  Up until recently, the cleric as my boxed partner was a no brainer, since I wanted to level him to 56 for the 96% rez + he has invis2undead.  But now that he's 56, I have some other options, a 55 ogre SK in mediocre (blue diamond cultural) bazaar gear and a 65 druid in fairly decent bazaar gear.  I'm thinking about switching my 2nd box toon to one of those to get snare.  On the surface, the 65 druid seems obvious (despite having to use ITU potions), especially if I'm going to continue root-rotting, but I figured a melee partner might make this a bit easier if I could manage to keep a gimpy SK healed up versus the murkglider hive mobs (named and regular).<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?  Would you prefer the (55 sk + 67 shm), (56 cle + 67 shm), or (65 dru + 67 shm) for this?  Why?  What strats would you use for various combinations?  Should I be farming runes somewhere other than murkgliders with these duos?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm in a similar boat to you... have a 66 monk at disposal, but it's hard to heal him against named.<br />
<br />
waiting until i either get some better spells or monk gets another level or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you would have fairly good luck with the druid/shaman.  The druid has snare and a better root.  Additionally, the can provide some fairly decent DPS with both nukes and possibly charmed pets (command of tunare on lvl62 animals).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bearage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did the instances with my 67 Mage (67 Shaman here).  My mage has his GoD pet and all of the mitigation aa.  <br />
<br />
A mage GoD pet tanks better than a 200 aa warrior - no doubts.  In addition the pet stuns out agro moderate paladins and can hold agro through any dots and mage crit DDs.<br />
<br />
I can kill the named in around 2 minutes or less with hardly any mana loss just casting tnarg twice and 2 Qs on the pet.  The mage does 3-4 bolt nukes.<br />
<br />
I use potions to IVU and move to the other spawn on the mage. He CoHs the shaman.  We kill the next named/ph and repeat back to first spawn. <br />
<br />
I can honestly say in my opinion that a shaman/mage duo can take so much content - even content that doesn't slow.  The mage also has his epic but although the epic is better for taunts the GoD pet is the best mitigator.  In fact I managed to kill a BoT wing named with the pet as MT and just myself and a druid patching.  Its a mean combo - and the maintenance is low - setup some hot keys for /assist &lt;shm&gt; and /pet attack - sit back and Q the pet and watch the mobs die.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Id take a decent paladin. But im biased :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the Mage MS4 pet is a literal beast for a pet.  I learned the power of the mage pet back in my HoH xp days.  I would find a Mage, have him use Ward of Xegony and fill the rest of the group with casters/rangers.  The Air pet tanked better then most melees the time, never lost aggro on a slow.  The new Child of Air is a improvement on that pet, although I'm not sure on how it stacks compared to MS4.<br />
<br />
BTW, the main problem with the mage epic pet is its lvl 39.  It procs like crazy but the procs dont land on just about anything over 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Id take a decent paladin. But im biased :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a level 60 BL that I'm trying to 2box with, I also have a 55 mage I can level up quickly.  Which do you think would be hte better 2box partner?  I should have which either that I pick to 65+ shortly, so any suggestions?  The 65 monk just didn't work out so well. Couldn't keep agro well enough and took too much healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">don't you need 3 for the instanced hive zone?<br />
<br />
or can you do it with 2?<br />
<br />
Otani</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You need 3 to get the instance, but it stays around and is accessible with as few as one person after the instance is created.  When I want to do this and nobody's around to help me out with starting the instance, I log a character from my friend's account on that's permanantly parked in PoK, group that toon up to get the instance, then camp it out.  My system isn't really good enough to run 2 EQ instances on it at the same time or I guess I'd 3-box the things.</div></div><hr />
