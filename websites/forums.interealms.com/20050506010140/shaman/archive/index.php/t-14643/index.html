<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's a boat parked at a dock in Stonebrunt Mountains. Click on the big double doors on the boat's cabin and you'll be in Gunthak.<br />
<br />
If you dont know how to get to Stonebrunt Mountains, you should probably visit www.eqatlas.com or www.eqmaps.com.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">get a port to stonebrunt, or run through the warrens from the paineel portal stone. Or take the erudin wiz spires then head to paineel. If ya don't have pop or sol, but ya have LoY, then take the boat from qeynos to erudin then run to paineel. Once in stonebrunt follow steelbears advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you go through the warrens to get to stonebrunt go east and stay going east as soon as you get out of the cave.  It will take you to the water and nearly put you right on the docks to the boat.  On the dock you'll see the two doors in front of you that you have to click.<br />
<br />
A lot of folks wait 15 minutes for a port to stonebrunt.  With scale of wolf I think i make the run in 5-10 minutes with the stone to paineel.<br />
<br />
How to get through the warrens.  You take every left you can that's not a dead end.  On one of them you will come face to face with a building.  Go in the door on the right, it will take you into an open room with a throne on the far wall.  Their might be a named Kobold up or two.  Follow the left wall to the next door and take it.  This will bring you back outside.  Follow this tunnel down, go over the mound and through the small entrance.  In here take the small entrance on the right and that will lead you out to stonebrunt.  If you take the left it will dead end you at the mighty bear paw - assuming he is up.  I believe those are correct directions, but check eqatlas to be sure.<br />
