<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there is a tongue in cheek post going on about the changes to login, but I wanted to start a thread on something that has been bothering me for a while, to get feedback, or a solution from anyone here if possible.<br />
<br />
When I log in i have to sit through the file checking routine for a few minutes. It is slow, and totally unnecessary. We shouldn't have to go through it at all.... honestly....<br />
<br />
Instead of checking a whole plethora of files to see if anything has been changed, can't SoE just have a single file that they use for patching. Anytime they need to force an upload they can change the size of the file. Then, when we log in the patcher can just compare the size, and the date/timestamp of that 1 file. If they differ then upload away.<br />
<br />
I don't like having to sit through the checker for 5 minutes after going LD due to coding errors in a zone that hasn't been fixed yet, just to see it resolve to the play button....... yes, strangely enough I don't need to upload anything since the last time I ran the patcher (20 minutes prior)...<br />
<br />
This would speed things up drastically. I don't run eqwindows because my system can't hack it, and I don't want to have to run some third party code to get round the patcher, or make unofficial changes to it.<br />
<br />
I would just like to see it coded efficiently by SoE. Anyone else have any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Like the idea, but too logical and user friendly to ever be implemented by SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Make an icon that points to &quot;eqgame.exe patchme&quot; and run that if you're sure no patches are pending...<br />
<br />
I think they do the file scan to make sure no files have been modified by the user or anything though, really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Just to reduce the potential for support problems, the shortcut should point to (note the position of the quotes): <br />
<br />
&quot;c:\program files\sony\everquest trilogy\eqgame.exe&quot; patchme<br />
<br />
Obviously, change the path as necessary. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My dream &quot;login&quot; scenario:<br />
<br />
Link on my desktop that says Gloriana:Emarr<br />
<br />
I click the link, agree to the legal mumbo jumbo and immediately log in. No picking a server, no picking a character. The option would significantly reduce the cumbersome login process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make an icon that points to <br />
&quot;c:\program files\sony\everquest trilogy\eqgame.exe&quot; patchme<br />
<br />
<br />
So, if I do this by dragging the icon on the desktop and adding the word patchme to the end of the target address I will bypass the patcher?<br />
<br />
I'm happy to run it once a day, but not after a crash. Then, I want to get right back in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, dragging a shortcut for eqgame.exe to the desktop, then adding 'patchme' to the end of the target should do it.<br />
<br />
...and I agree Glori - that scenario would be ideal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great idea, Glori! <br />
<br />
For a long time, I've wanted an option that would allow me to quickly tab back and forth between alternate characters. I have three or four I use for extra bank space, and it's incredibly inefficient to have to log in and out just to change alts to check bank inventory. Perhaps an in-game option that would be something like /bank alternate_char_01 that would pop up that character's bank window? I don't know. All I know is I don't like keeping a guildy waiting forever for their new spell while I bump around bank accounts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I worry...is the new login system less secure now that it is web-based? I had someone try to log into mine yesterday, which had never happened before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I worry...is the new login system less secure now that it is web-based? I had someone try to log into mine yesterday, which had never happened before.<br />
<br />
I think it's only the account options that are web based the rest appears to be the same.<br />
<br />
As for Glori's ideas it may be possible in the future as the eqlsPlayerData.ini has sections in it for last server and user name.<br />
<br />
<br />
[MISC]<br />
LastServerID=-1<br />
LastServerName=<br />
HasReadSWarning=true<br />
OmensFirstOffer=1084993576<br />
OmensLastOffer=1084993576<br />
<br />
[UI]<br />
XMLFilename=EQLSUI.xml<br />
<br />
[PLAYER]<br />
Username=your_login_name<br />
<br />
[NEWS]<br />
LastViewed=457690660<br />
<br />
<br />
It wouldn't take a great deal on their part to add the following sort of lines to the player section.<br />
<br />
Password=your_password<br />
Character=Haleice<br />
<br />
and this maybe to the misc section.<br />
<br />
Autologin=true<br />
<br />
If they did this you could have the option of logging out and turning off the autologin option through the ingame options.<br />
I doubt that they would ever do the last part though :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks like Sony fails to read our existing preferences in the new login interface, simple things like user name and last server accessed. Since the user name is not automatically filled in for the first time in years, maybe someone else accidently typed yours in by accident while trying to guess theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Considering how SOE has seen no problem with 'stealing' ideas from other games, I'm very surprised that they havent got a login that takes you directly from your desktop to your logged in character.  DAOC had this feature on Release in '01.  One of the things I really liked about it.  In fact the drop down box listed the last 5 characters you had previously logged into.  <br />
