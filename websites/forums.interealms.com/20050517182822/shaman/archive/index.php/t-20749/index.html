Anyone else having a problem?<br />
<br />
At 52 i would like to try to solo in there, but if i cant get in it.... you know ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Winterfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, it's the rubberbanding effect you get when you hit a wall or a corner. You just bounce away and change direction. I can no longer get into the Hole as a result. I sure hope they get this fixed soe time soon...<br />

Try Erudin guards. Bigger factions hits, but they're all pallies so you have to kill em two to three times sometimes :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2 hours ???<br />
<br />
<br />
omg  /shoots self<br />
<br />
lol that makes me wanna cry, seriously i have spent multiple sessions each at hour or 2 each.  Guess its time to be KoS in in erudite. Not like they like me now anyway as im a troll heh</div></div><hr />

Kill the kobolds in the warrens.  It give good faction to both sides of the Erudite fence, and at 65 its a joke to clear it with a dog, point and sick, and watch the dead doggies drop nonstop.<br />
<br />
I got my key, and can now venture near both cities unharmed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Different races have different faction needs, remember.  It took my iksar monk many thousands of kills.  It's not that way with all race/class combos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It took me (Iksar Shaman) around 2 hours killing erudite guards in Erudin. Not to mention the personal satisfaction I gained slaughtering Erudites.  LoH just made it more fun, timing a nuke just right to kill 'em before they used it. Dock area is pretty safe, but if you do it at the Toxx side of erudin, be careful, as there are some nasty NPC's that add if you're not careful.  Of course, I did this pre-PoP; equipment and such being what it is now, those adds would probably be less of an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Step one:  Get KOS in Erudin.<br />
<br />
Step two: Go up to the top of the library where Tol Nicelot spawns.  Summon a dog.<br />
<br />
Step three:  Go away a while.<br />
<br />
I did this with a level 49 SK, and his gimpy green pet was enough to kill Tol, and an Iksar BP (5/tick regen) was enough to heal him up for the next Tol spawn.<br />
<br />
Everything else up there is a vendor and won't aggro or assist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you can 2 box, &amp; have space for a new toon, why not just roll an evil erudite &amp; buy the key? N.B. I'm not sure wether the door to the hole is a teleport or a rock that moves back - so not sure if it will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, playing an Iksar Shadow Knight in the Warrens, it took me 5 levels (11 through 16) to max out ally<br />
<br />
As a level 30 Beastlord, it took me, oh, three hours, running back and forth in the dungeon, making my pet kill EVERYTHING. i'm not sure where the level 52 Shadow Knight pet stands, but the level 30, unbuffed Beastlord pet can take down everything but the king and mugglewump</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you REALLY want to make it happen fast for you do this:<br />
<br />
Summon doggy (I did this at L55 with best pet I could summone).  Buff doggy.  Arm doggy with 2 Hand of Ixi . . . heck, rustys would probably be fine.<br />
<br />
Turn auto attack on.<br />
<br />
Run thru Warrens clicking on and hitting each mob to aggro it and keep moving.  Doggy will attack anything that takes a swing at you.<br />
<br />
The mobs probably aren't strong enough to hurt you and doggy will slaughter them en masse.<br />
<br />
Went from KoS to kindly in 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Trevurg has the right idea. Just kill that guy over and over in the library. He will aggro on you and attack and the pet will kill him.<br />

AFK overnight, wake up and grats on amiable Paineel faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dirtnap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We were having the same problem with the rubber band issue.  We did manage to finally get in.  You have to swim pretty much strait down and duck constantly.  Before you would kind of point yourself in the direction of the hole in the rocks but now you pretty much have to point strait down.  It took a bit but it is still possible.  I was shunken down as well.  3 out of 6 in the group got through so we ended up having to get a key anyway.  <br />
Another thing is that this key does not go on your key chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The next step in my epic is the Hole.  Could someone please explain what exactly is being discussed here?  What key?  What about swimming and ducking so you don't need a key? etc.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The Hole has a key required for entry to the zone.  This key can be purchased from a vendor in Paineel itself.<br />
<br />
Due to a glitch in the engine it was previously possible, and easy, to bypass the need for this key.  However with the advent of DX9 collision detection has been revamped and made this previous exploit more difficult to utilize.<br />
<br />
Long story short, easiest way to be certain of getting your entire group into the Hole is to spend some time using one of the various methods of improving Paineel faction and buy the darn key.<br />
<br />
Once inside The Hole there is another key you might want to get if you have no rogue.  It drops off various mobs, I got one off an Old Contruct.  I think this key is called &quot;A Sacred Key&quot; but I really don't remember for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
The pool in Paineel has a small hole that is obviously there by design. If you enter this hole, you find a tunnel that leads to a zone-in to The Hole. I could be wrong, but this doesn't strike me as a &quot;glitch in the engine&quot; or an &quot;exploit&quot;. It sounds more like one of the many examples of alternative entry points to the same zone.<br />
<br />
The only reason it doesn't work as reliably now as it used to is because of the collision detection problems with the new engine. You get bounced from the corner when you duck. Looks like a bug to me.<br />

<br />
The entrance to the zone of The Hole is an underwater rock door which is locked. You can either:<br />
shrink and wiggle/duck through a crack in the rocks, which is now more difficult, or<br />
have a rogue pick the door lock, or<br />
buy the key, sold in Paineel for 106pp on the vendor Rallia Hapera (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4893)<br />
<br />
To get into the city of Paineel to buy the Hole Key you need a Paineel key offered by the two skeleton guards. You need amiable Heretics faction to get them to give you a Paineel key. You can get Heretics faction either by killing Erudin guards or slaughtering kobolds.<br />
<br />
Within the zone of The Hole (now called Ruins of Old Paineel), mobs drop keys to access deeper areas of the zone including High Scale Kirn's lair.</div></div><hr />

I really doubt it is on purpose-- if you look at where you are after you squeeze through the hole, you're actually inside a rock I think.</div></div><hr />

OK Are these the two skellys in Tox forest just before the zone into Paineel? What do you need to say to them to get the Paineel key?<br />
<br />
BTW I spent 4 hours in the Warens killing everything with dogdog so I should have enough faction.<br />

<br />
Go to the Paineel newbie area, the big field you cross when going to The Warrens.<br />
<br />
There are two skeleton guards there.  Con them.  That will tell you how your faction is in Paineel.  If your faction is high enough you can tell them &quot;I need a key&quot; and they will give you the key to Paineel.</div></div><hr />

You actually have to keep that one on you.<br />

The key to The Hole is same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I squeeze through that hole I am in a tunnel, it's obviously meant as a zone tunnel, like many other zone tunnels in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">what you are failing to realize Winterfury is that the rock that is blocking the entrance to that tunnel is a door. It can be opened with a key. You could squeeze through the gaps (which was the exploit). <br />
<br />
The tunnel is an intended zone to the Hole, but bypassing the key to open the door, isnt the intended way to get in that tunnel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That may be, I wouldn't find it surprising to learn that you are correct, but it's certainly not obvious to me. Can you point me to some source that confirms your view that this is an exploit? The hole has been there for as long as I have been in the game and seems obviously intended to be able to be utilized (contrast with cosmetic holes that do nothing). I'm very open to the possibility that you are right, so just point me to a source. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">It was not meant to let you in with no key. Period. Think about it Winter, that would not be VI/SoE style to begin with and secondly why would there be a key in the first place if there was no need for it.<br />
<br />
When you stick your head in and see a tunnel, you are looking through the rock thats supposed to be blocking you. Have you ever been in bearform and looked through walls ? Some concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It was done this way because The Hole wasn't always in the game.<br />
<br />
It was *intended* to be there at launch, but wasn't.  It was added after launch.  Not long after launch, but post launch nonetheless.<br />
<br />
The rocks were put there to keep people out of The Hole while the zone was built.  My guess is that their initial intention was that there would be NO key needed to enter The Hole - they would simply remove the rocks.  When they turned the rocks into a door it introduced the ability to squeeze thru.<br />
<br />
I would further guess that the exploit is simply not important enough for them to put a fix in for.  Frankly, it's easier to just go get the *&amp;#@ key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Frankly, it's easier to just go get the *&amp;#@ key. <br />
<br />
While it sounds easy enough to kill stuff, faction up, get one key, zone into Paineel, get another key, and carry it around all the time... it is really, really, really easy to just shrink and go. At least, it used to be, pre-bounce; I haven't tried it post-bounce yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Another good point . . . Shrink was not introduced at launch, but significantly after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The key is also a post launch addition.<br />
<br />
And while I'm not 100% sure, I think Painel itself is post launch. Was added in shortly after the Planes were put in, I think.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yep, you're right.<br />
<br />
I remember when Erudite Necro's just had the one little shack in Tox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">And used to have to use a ant's potion for larger races before the shrink spell became outdoor usable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Wolf form worked fairly well for squeezing in also. Wolf form and shrink combined made it trivial.</div></div><hr />
