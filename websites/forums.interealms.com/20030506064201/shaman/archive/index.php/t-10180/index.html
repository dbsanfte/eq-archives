<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akaran_D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...being PL'd by a 62 paladin. (almost sounds like a bad joke, don't it? feh)<br />
<br />
Within the last few levels, i've been in OT, Dawnshroud, Echo, East FP guards, and even Mistmoore. I am not sure if there are any &quot;better&quot; spots accessable for my duo, but I figured it couldn't really hurt to ask.<br />
<br />
I've considered going back to CC, but given the general goal of my guild to call a raid whenever I get somewhere 15 minutes away from a porter.. heh.<br />
<br />
Advice appericated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zilkoril01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As an untwinked level 35 shaman, I found City of Mist to be great exp... It was tough to find a group, but you won't have that problem... ;)<br />

On a goof, I went and checked out Eastern Wastes, at the walrus / ulthork man o wars region. Abou 8hrs later, ding from 36 to 38.. :)</div></div><hr />

tell the paladin to use the deepwater helm (or bp) to heal you.<br />
<br />
Daring stacks on itself, and its free from the helm.  I used my paladin to twink up a druid quickly using a the deepwater armor and some mana when needed.<br />
<br />
too bad paladins don't get damage shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hawbes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At those lvls DL might be good too. Right outside the cave that leads from combine city towards the desert is a good place to set up....not too many wandering mobs up that high, and fairly steady p[athing just below on the plateu. Found it was great exp  for a small grp that couldnt get in down below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Akaran_D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thank you. :)<br />

I've gotten 'er up to 41 right now. Just another two levels and I can start grouping her with my main and geting some Real exp that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not to brag, but went from lvl35 to lvl40 in about 10 hours in SolA solo - no PL'ing.<br />
<br />
Best exp in the game, have to be willing to trash your Ak'Anon faction though.</div></div><hr />
