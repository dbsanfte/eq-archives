<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pleh1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have trolled the boards, done some searching and even tested out the recommended zones... So far here's what i've found:<br />
<br />
<br />
Sol B - Bugs &amp; Bats... Exp isnt great but is lots of fast killin when not packed so feels like i'm moving really good.<br />
<br />
Dulak Harbor - Seems so slow sometimes even though the exp is great (1% a kill, occasional .5% and  2%).  Just seems so slowed compared to Sol B.<br />
<br />
CoM - Can run the Gazeboo's well. Infact when given PoG &amp; C3 i gota kill a few of the side mobs if not all just to wait on respawn.<br />
<br />
Havent tried out many other zones, though the one before Dulak harbor with the Trolls &amp; Elementals (nagzal or whatever) would be great if there was just a room full of the elementals at the zone entrence... the Trolls suck cuz they resist alot and regen really fast...<br />
<br />
Wondering where else you might recommend for soloing.<br />
<br />
Also I sometimes box with a 52nd BM and thus we'd love to take on higher lvl mobs (Dulak Harbor great for this).<br />
<br />
Btw Have JBB for those wondering. Decent gear otherwise, as friend and I pooled our money for the JBB as it's helped us a ton since lvl 45 (264 Damg every 8 seconds = one awsome DoT).<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

At level 52/53 with JBB you can't beat nobles and bards in HHK for regular XP.  If someone's camping it, just tell them to send you a message when they're done.  Most people will oblige you.</div></div><hr />

I heard that there are new roamers (Revenants) that path up to the entrance area in the hole elsewhere (I think SK.org?) after the 4/8 patch. Anyone know first-hand if Hole ZI is still safe?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Hole entrance is NOT safe now.  I was there yesterday.  A revenant was standing right in the middle of the elementals.  And a lot of corpses littered the entrance.<br />
<br />
A GM showed up, killed the Revenant, and asked me to send a bug report, which I did.  She hoped that the revenant being there was merely a fluke and that when it respawned if would stay home deep down in the zone.  However, 20 minutes later, there was the revenant again.  I left at that point.<br />
<br />
BTW, for lv 52, Hole entrance is sadly a bit low.  Half the elementals are lite blue.<br />
