<br />
As a level 23 Mystic, I am curious as to what others will pick.<br />
<br />
I'm currently looking at the group cure for the level 10 for utility purposes.  As for the level 20, I'm torn between the better slow and the better ward, with the slow being the current winner.<br />
<br />
Just wonder how streaky the dmg. debuff portion of the new slow will be.<br />
<br />
Anyone tried these new skills yet?  If so, are these used in conjunction with the skills we have now, or are they replacements? Also, what level are these skills (Adept? Master? App?)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

It appears we have a bug that is preventing the intended prose from showing up in game for the Training abilities. You should be seeing the text I posted in my message.*Since that issue will take some time to*track down, I'll put together a list of the other available abilities and will post them. Sorry for the confusion.<br />
<br />
The level 50 Training options aren't in yet, but will be added in the future. We wanted to watch the balance of these abilities for a while before introducing the final set.<br />
<br />
As for recast timers being shared on the Training abilties, that is a deliberate*change. These abilities are intended to take the place of spells and arts on the same line, since the Training versions provide a greater benefit. The Training choices give you*a more powerful version of an ability you already have, and are not intended to give you an &quot;extra&quot; ability. If you have already obtained a higher-tier version of*a particular spell, it would probably be wise to select a Training option from a different line in which you have a lower-tier version of another ability.<br />
<br />
If a particular Training option does not match the description I posted, please be sure to /bug it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WSS is a VERY nice upgrade to Spectral.  It has made itself a place on my hotbar for SURE.  Even tho they are on the same timer, I may keep both on the hotbar, enabling me (I hope) to stack SW, WSS &amp; AW.<br />
<br />
For my other options, I took anything that gave me Wisdom, Power or Defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oluran's Ward of Totem because I was already level 28 when they introduced this and now have keening haste and ancestral ward anyways. <br />
If I would have gotten this at level 20, hmm, probably the slow. WSS is fine too.</div></div><hr />

Somethings, I really wish I knew in advanced. lol.  I got <br />
Aldalad's Mending Chant, but it is on the same timer as Healing Ritual (adept3)... I should have gone for Elianas' Salve of the Spiritist instead.<br />
<br />
Then, I also wished I got Oluran's Ward of Totem instead too.<br />
<br />
Oh well.  I'm going to outgrow these soon anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got Oluran's Ward of Totem (Power is God in this game, so any buff that increases it is a godly buff) and Elianas's Salve of the Spirit (AE Noxious cure is nice for chest pops).<br />
<br />
I would have gotten the slow if I didn't already have Keening Haze Adept 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is it worth getting the upgrade to spectral ward even though we get a new ward at 26?  My spectral ward is at app 4 atm.  Debating between this and the one to upgrade contagion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would upgrade the ward.  From what I see, the wards stack.  Contagion and Miasma (the new dot) don't stack.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That is what Im seeing as well.  I can stack SW, AW &amp; WSS but not Contagion / Miasma.<br />
<br />
Hmm that's strange, I don't think that SW and WSS are supposed to stack.  They should be considered &quot;linked&quot; going by EQ2Players.  My Inquisitor's level 12 reactive (Bestowal of Vitae) is linked to his trained level 20 spell (Vesagars Bulwark of Faith - btw, name sound familiar? :)).<br />
<br />
Just a heads up to anyone who hasn't picked their yet in case they decide to &quot;fix&quot; the linked spells again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">SW and AW are on the same timers, but they are stackable.  It helps to have a good tank (I play with a guardian every night) who can hold aggro very well, and stacking both wards not only has a shorter casting time, but a smaller power pool (53+25=77 vs 121).  I hardly ever use my group wards, as our MT always holds aggro.<br />

Ah yes, I forgot that the linked spell timer only lasts as long as the recast of the spell, so you can stack them as long as the first is still on the player.  Thanks for the reminder. :)<br />
<br />
As for the group ward, I have read (and experienced this with my Inq at least with his group reactive) that the group versions are actually a &quot;pool&quot; so to speak.  The group wards pool of hitpoint absorbtion can actually affect all group members, or three group members, or just one group member.  Since the pool is larger than the single target ward (well, Wards of Spirit protects vs more hp than Spectral Ward) it will last longer.  The power cost and cast time are heavy so it's best used pre-pull.<br />
<br />
Just an idea, give it a try a few times and test for yourself. :)  I really like to throw the group reactive up before each pull that I can with my Inq.</div></div><hr />
