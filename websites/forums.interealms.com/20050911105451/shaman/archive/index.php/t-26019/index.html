This thing is cool.  <br />
<br />
I'm surprised I don't see more of them about, although Divino-matic is not really an easy quest.  <br />
<br />
It's going to be hard bagging that when the time comes.<br />
<br />
I can't think of another piece of gear in EQ or WOW that is as cool as that.  Looks like a tribal skull face mask.  You can see the eyes blinking behind it.  Makes me laugh every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Big Voodoo Mask is one of my favorites too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Prolly epic weapons in EQ were more special ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The bad mojo mask on a gnome is the funniest thing in WoW to me. The deepdive helmet is second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The deepdive Helmet is a winner. One of my guildies has one and I think it looks ace, especially on his Tauren noggin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my vote for coolest item goes to the 'Six Demon Bag' trinket. don't know how useful it is, but the reference owns. also, that lightning hat from Thermaplugg is pretty sweet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Six Demon Bag!  LOL<br />
Just remember what old Jack Burton always says....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sword of Omen thanks<br />

Grant me sight beyond sight!</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the refresh on that?<br />
<br />
FWIW I finished up Linken's quest last night. Got the Sword and the Boomerang.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skarzon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Grizlocks Hypertech Buckler is pretty cool, mesmerizing even  :cool: <br />
<br />
I'd have to say both Ranger epics from EQ rank up there, Swiftwind and Earthcaller.  I never got rid of Swiftwind and I never was able to get the damn drop from hate for Earthcaller, still the lightning swords were not only secsi, they were very useful :D   I am a bit biased towards Ranger gear though...<br />
<br />
I don't think we've gotten far enough into WoW yet to see the really cool drops, but there are quite a few neat ones so far.</div></div><hr />
