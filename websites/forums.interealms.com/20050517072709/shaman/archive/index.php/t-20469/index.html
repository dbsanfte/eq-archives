<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for some way to make a box that just has FA messages in it, so i don't forget who I last FA'ed, etc.<br />
<br />
And is there any way to timestamp every message that flies by, like one can do in AOL instant messenger, I figure this one is a longshot, but maybe there is some way to code it with UI...<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, you should be able to set up an FA chatbox.  Make a new chat window, set it so only text from channel X goes there.  /join (or autojoin) TorpFA.  Set a macro hotkey /(TorpFA channel number) %t has been FAed.<br />
<br />
This will help you keep track of your position in your FA cycle, but I don't beleive`there is any way to timestamp the message with the default UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could also put a /time in your hotkey. Can you redirect the /time output (or it's parent class) to a particular window?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">autojoin a channel, say myfatimer.<br />
In your macro<br />
line 1 /cast x where x=your fa button<br />
line 2 /cast x, /pause 10 (to eliminate fizzles)<br />
line 3 /myfatimer casting ferine avatar on %t<br />
line 4 /time (not sure how to redirict this to the specified chat channel though)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll go on right now and see if I can find a way to make /time go to a certain chatbox...<br />
<br />
On a slightly different note, I cannot stress enough that if you really want to make your buffing life easier, get the group inspect buff leadership AA.  I SWEAR to you it's the best thing that ever happend to my shammy.  I always make my own groups, so I always get to use it.<br />
<br />
you target a group member, click the button, and you get a list of all the buffs they have on them (exactly like the pet health command).  At level 2 of the AA it will tell you how much time till each buff fades...  INVALUABLE.  Level one was less than exciting, but honestly level 2 has made me no longer regret getting GoD  -- just that one ability.<br />
<br />
I haven't had a buff blink much less fade since I recieved it, and going a whole group without ever hearing a melee complain a buff is down means an angel somewhere gets its wings... or at least it should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok... just tried it out.  here's whatcha do.<br />
<br />
right click on your chat window and select new chat window.<br />
<br />
Now /autojoin XXX (xxx being the name of your new channel).  Right click on the new chat window, scroll down to filters, scroll to chatchannel, and select your new channel... now it will go to this window.<br />
<br />
Rightclick again on the new chat window.  Drag down to filters, go across and select other.  This will have your /time messages go to the window also.  (there will be a few other random things going to this window like yells for help, but it's so rare it's really not gonna spam-flood your window at all.  just be aware that the /time message does take about 5 lines so you will most likely end up scrolling this window a bit.)<br />
<br />
now, just do what solastoru said:<br />
line 1 /cast x (where x is the number slot that FA is in -- numbers go top to bottom)<br />
line 2 /cast x, /pause 10 (to eliminate fizzles)<br />
line 3 /X casting ferine avatar on %t (X being the number of your FA chat channel) <br />
line 4 /time <br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry if I kinda overexplained some things (like how to select a filter) I just figured that alot of folks might want to use this for other buffs (like younger folks using it for haste) so I thought it would be helpful to be as basic as possible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rookz,<br />
<br />
Do you know if each group member needs to have GoD in order to benefit from the group leaders leadership AA's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Frankly, I'm impressed that you would:<br />
<br />
1.  Care enough to do that; and,<br />
2.  Actually do it.<br />
<br />
Lawd, it makes me feel lazy.  I hardly ever mem FA anymore, let alone set up a rotation system to minimize recasts.  The situations where I do have it up (LDoNs usually) I just go off memory to the best of my ability.<br />
<br />
You're a much better shaman than I.  I'm just lazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dandi, to your question, unfortunately yes.  You have to be groupleader for ANY of your leadership AA's to count.  This kinda sucks when you end up getting really use to an ability (like I have with group inspect buffs) and then you get gnabbed for a pickup group and can't use em.  Honestly though, most of the time if you send a polite tell to the group leader, they'll transfer leadership to you.  I have only run into one person in all my grouping that was also working on the leadership AA's, as most just seem to be inclined to use that Exp for leveling.<br />
<br />
Jaidin, the answer to your question is a little muddier... yes and no.  As far as I can tell, the hot-keyed type abilities like inspect buff, mark npc, etc.,  can only be used by people in the group with GoD.  To make the hoktkey you have to hit L to pull up the leadership window, select the ability, then click and hold on the little hotkey button.  Yet hitting L to pull up the leadership window doesn't work unless you have GoD...  so my guess is only group members with it can use it.<br />
<br />
However, if you have abilities like find path to PC (can be used by just typing /findpc), or offense enhancement for example, then anyone in the group can easily use it.  Health of target's target pops a window on everyone in the group's screen regardless of GoD, as does NPC health.  So really, if it doesn't require pulling up the leadership screen to use it (i.e. making a hotkey) then everyone, regardless of expansions, can use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This channel timer is a great idea.  I played around with a buff timer before I quit and couldn't get it to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you very much for the info Rookz!  A couple follow up questions :)<br />
<br />
From what you said it sounds like that a player must have GoD in order to use any hotkeyed GoD abilities.  What I was really looking for is whether the target player of said abilities needs to have GoD.  For example, you have GoD and have the leadership AA that allows you to inspect a groupmembers buffs.  If you target a groupmember and inspect his buffs, what if that groupmember does not have GoD?  Do you get an error message or is the key grayed out?<br />
<br />
Also, it sounds like all groupmembers benefit from the innate GoD leadership AA's regardless of whether they have GoD or not, as long as the group leader has GoD.  For example, if the group leader is the only member of the group that has GoD and he has offense enhancement leadership AA's, will the whole group will benefit from the offense enhancement?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sumitso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">after seeing this impressive idea, I was curious rookz if there was a way to tie this into the UI timer instead of having to create a new channel; that being when you cast FA or a slow, it starts the slider bar on the timer. This link (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp) is what I am refering to; I'd try it myself but my XML skills are sorely lacking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think that you could, but only for one buff, since on /loadskin &lt;uiname&gt; the whole timer gets reset. Plus, I wouldn't want that few seconds of freeze during a UI load all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">From what you said it sounds like that a player must have GoD in order to use any hotkeyed GoD abilities.

<br />
Yep, you can use this ability whethor or not the other folks have GoD.<br />
<br />
Also, it sounds like all groupmembers benefit from the innate GoD leadership AA's regardless of whether they have GoD or not, as long as the group leader has GoD. For example, if the group leader is the only member of the group that has GoD and he has offense enhancement leadership AA's, will the whole group will benefit from the offense enhancement?<br />
<br />
Yep again.  If the leader has the ability, it doesn't matter who has GoD.  They all benefit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, no one but the group leader needs GoD for any of the abilities (with one exception that I'll cover in a moment).  The group leader can still designate a main assist, even if MA doesn't have GoD...  they can tag mobs and everyone can see it, they can inspect the buffs of everyone regardless of their expansions...  The ONLY time someone other than the groupleader would need GoD is if they need a hotkey to use the ability (there might even be a way around this, to make a hotkey without using the leadership window... but I have yet to find it), for example, if I'm in a group with an enchanter, and I am leader, I can inspect everyone's buffs.  but if the Chanter want's to inspect their buffs they would need to have the hotkey, so the enchanter would need GoD.  <br />
<br />
Basically, it doesn't hurt you in any way if anyone in your group doesn't have GoD, it just means they might not get to use one or two of the nifties...  One exception...  There is an LA that allows you to tag the mobs (basically you can put a number over their head to distinguish what order they are to be killed in).  There is another LA that alows you to designate someone else to be the tagger (e.g. you give the enchanter the ability to tag the mobs in order, so they can tell the group which one's mez will break first, so you know which one to kill first).  In this case, I assume such ability is using a hotkey... so whoever you give the tagging ability to must have GoD in order to actually use it.<br />
<br />
In my mind, this ability was kinda back on the list in the first place... the fact that your chanter, or MA (whoever you were going to give tagging duties to) must have GoD in order for you to distribute it to them makes the ability dead last in my book.  Anyway, other than that one, other peoples lack of owning GoD really shouldn't hinder you in anyway.<br />
<br />
Also, sumitso, clever idea on the UI timer, but I tried it out, and it didn't run so well.  I got alot of lag, had a hard time setting the time up, and when I was done with it, I could only use it for one spell at a time.  I don't know if there is any way to set it up for multiple spells, but if so it illudes me.  Also, the lag would be horrible if I was doing this for say, haste, regen, and FA, so even if I could use it on several, I probably wouldn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Excellent!  Thank you rookz!<br />
<br />
Are there &quot;/alt activate&quot; numbers for the GoD aa's?  If so and they function like previous activated AA abilities then somebody without the leadership window may be able to use an available GoD leadership ability :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am unaware of /alt activate numbers for GoD AA's.  If anyone else knows of them PLEASE post it here =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've found a few people I couldn't delegate to be the main assist and in each case they didn't have GoD.... so it seems you can't delegate a non-GoD player as MA even though they don't need to press any hotkeys. Bit of a bummer really as quite a few people haven't got GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">well that's a heck of a bummer... guess I'm moving that one a bit back on the list.<br />
<br />
I'll go back through the leadership AA's tonight, and consult with my group leader junkies (got about 4 other friends that are all gnabbing these abilities.  and since we're all different classes, we're kinda grabbing them all in different order, so we should have them all by now).  I'll try and get a comprehensive list here of all the abilities that need GoD folks in order to use.  Pretty sure it'll only affect delegating abilties (and the hotkey issue of course), but I'll try and get some definitive tests for you folks by tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">/bump, this is a good tip, especially the part about how to get /time to go to a different chat window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Non GoD enabled members DO NOT benefit from leader aa's. I can tell you that from 1st hand as i bough GoD a bit later and have friends who didn't buy it at all and play with me daily.<br />
<br />
Basicly if you don't have GoD you get no hp, mana, atk, and can't use any abilities as you can't open leader aa window at all. You also won't see DMA ring nor any other LP abilities that are visible to others.</div></div><hr />
