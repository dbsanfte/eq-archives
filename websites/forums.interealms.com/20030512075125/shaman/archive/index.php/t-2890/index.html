<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I may have a chance to do Kirn soon.  Guild raid is going down there for another shaman, but we may have enough to do that we would still be down there in 2 hours when Kirn respawns.<br />
<br />
The &quot;normal&quot; progression is to turn in Ghiosk's books, pick up the icon off the floor in COM, and have the spirit send you to find Kirn.  I am still missing the student's log from the spectral courier, so I haven't even turned in the booklet yet, and I don't have Ghiosk's books.<br />
<br />
So the question is, will the icon turn-in work with Kirn if I haven't done all the preceding parts of the quest?  Will he just not aggro?  or what?  <br />
<br />
I guess all I'm risking is the icon, which is trivial to pick up.</div></div><hr />

You won't have the faction, so he won't respawn as the agro version and you won't get the ring you need.</div></div><hr />
