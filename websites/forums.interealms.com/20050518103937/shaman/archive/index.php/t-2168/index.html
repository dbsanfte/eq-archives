<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>woramorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no one has a extra cd key? MY RL friend wanted to play but did not want to buy the game. I should have suscribed to the eq news letter.:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think there is anything actually wrong with giving out cd-Keys that were free to begin with, since I believe that EQ mentioned the idea of giving one to a friend.<br />
<br />
However, I've already deleted that email...If I find it I'll see about getting it to ya.</div></div><hr />

I received one of the CD Keys via the News Letter as well. Seems like an okay deal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you don't like what you heard about the game enough to buy it then you arn't gonna like eq.  Seriously.</div></div><hr />
