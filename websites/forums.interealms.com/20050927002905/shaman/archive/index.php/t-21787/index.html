<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FuShnick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Due to work (on call 24/7) can not group... looking for someplace besides Katta... Going crazy there 6-7 kills per 1% exp. Has to be a camp where can log in and out without problems. Sometimes only have time to summon pet and buff up than get paged. :(<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be a lot of help...<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hard to find good solo spot at 55 to 59.<br />
<br />
if u know anyone whos after the urn in HS, tag along and have fun+exp.<br />
<br />
btw i have to say.....plz plz get rid of those druid legs ur wearing (eeek)  and get more ac on ya back/feet too. u can afford to lose 20-30 pts of wisdom.<br />
<br />
COM second floor is fairly good exp, most mobs are lvl45 ish. just fun of getting past the reaver! find grp 60+ need an epic drop and u soak up the exp nicely......tbh tho thats not easy to find atmo with low server populations.<br />
<br />
if u have a lvl 60 mage friend, u could go grp at pov outer(cave).  mage uses mala on inc beasty thenu slow, fairly good exp, VERy boring camp!<br />
<br />
probably some exp in loy, but imo takes toolong to get there.........<br />
<br />
i spent 57 duoing bugs in sebilis with a lvl 61 necro frind, not fastest exp, but loot is very good! soloing in sebilis is waste time btw.....too slow.<br />
<br />
56 to 59 is just a royal pain!  no easy solution i am afraid(<br />
<br />
if u were an alt twink id suggest soloing in hstones entrance, but with ur gear ud likely get killed(   and its not a good place to die if u dont know a keyed rezzer...........dont even try it!<br />
<br />
u could try and offer ur services to a lvl 65 melee and go farm in droga........or duo with a 65 farming necro in veksar....they dont say no to regen )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FuShnick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea have not even looked at my gear in a few lvls. Will do some research on them 3 spots and find more ac/hps for there.<br />
<br />
As far as grouping I can't. On sometimes for 5 mins than have to leave.<br />
<br />
But thanks for the response.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FuShnick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Hadorf<br />
<br />
Very nice spot... safe log in and out. Depending on the pops 2 to 5 kills per 1% exp. <br />
<br />
The only problem I have found is the 65th lvl mages/wizzies that come in and blast everything on thier way in.<br />
<br />
All I do is pull with slow then eb and tank them. <br />
<br />
Thanks Fushnick<br />
10% away from 58</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>hadorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In the past, I've just offered them an invis so they wouldn't screw up my spawns. Sometimes they get the hint, other times...well, you know!<br />

<br />
I just started in Nodox, and the EXp seems slow,  it could just be the fact at 55 it takes more exp, but I can tell my exp has slowed WAY down.   Nodox has 1 REALY GOOD factor and that is when the mobs get to 20% health,  THEY DON'T RUN!!!!!!!   They stay there and get beat on till they die.   The bad thing is they seem to have a TOn of HP, and I hate running thru the lava to get in.    <br />
<br />
I am Realy tempted to go to Chardok,  My monk needs some items there anyway.  I worry about the walkers and the Mobs that walk off after the 20% HP left.   That could cause some issues .   If you have exp in this area plz feel free to comment.   Also I have ben wondering about Kael.   Could a Shammy solo or 2 box her way to the areana?  What is the exp like there.  Anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>FuShnick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I do the zone in... There is 5 static mobs and 2 wanderers... I park dogdog by herol (spelling) and pull them back to him. They never run cause herol is there.<br />
<br />
There is no break in to speak of. All the static mobs can be single pulled. Just have to pay attension to the wanders.<br />
<br />
With 2 boxing you should have np at all. I have not hunted past these spawns yet, fear of getting a page and having to run back to safe spot at zone in to log out. <br />
<br />
I will be off this coming monday evening and will venture a little further in to see how much tougher the mobs get.<br />
<br />
If your on the Karana server give me a shout. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>hadorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At the ZI past the quest mob there are 2 spawns, if the one on the left isn't there he is wandering! If you pull back to the quest MOB, that is the only wanderer you will have to worry about! There are a total of 8 spawns before you hit the castle. Be careful when pulling the last 4 MOBs because there is the Drillmaster that wanders down by the castle and he will add.(The drillmaster will never wander to the ZI)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Droga might be a spot you want to try out.  I PL my rogue there a lot.  The loot and PP [ I think the avg drop is around 10-13pp ] is nice, and I think most mobs will be in your level range.  You can move around freely with invis.  For the most part, the mobs are evenly spaced, so you should not get adds.  Named hit a little harder than the regular trash mobs there.  I usually camp the named sk room.  There are various maps you can download that point out the camps.<br />
<br />
Casters like to gate, so I suggest you fight near their spawn point.  Be careful of roamer casters or you will have a train on your hands.<br />
<br />
Do you have stoicism?  If not, I suggest you work on the quest because it is a nice spell until you get Torpor at 60.<br />
<br />
Also, you can get faction if you ever want to do the Cord quest in Chardok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frogginator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i'm 57 myself right now and have found that Veksar is a great place to hunt solo, or with a group.<br />
<br />
I can hunt goblins near the zone in, and usually can pull singles.  at 57 they are darkblue and give me about 1% for 2 kills.  I have found that you can also get some decent loot just by finding a partner(mage,necro,melee) and camping named spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>FuShnick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yea I am 59 now... plus picked up 2 more aa's. I have tried veskar in the past.. but with the way I have to work it is a major pain, nice but a pain.<br />
<br />
I will check out droga, see if it is still decent at 59.<br />
<br />
Thanks again folks<br />

<br />
I know the lava route is faster, but the way I get to Nardox is through Dulak, up the lader to the catwalk to the Torg Mines. Through the mines (maze but easy with a map) to Nardox. Mobs at that entrance are blue to me at 50 (were at 46) but there are harder close by. Don't know if that helps avoid the lava, with invis my way is easy.<br />
<br />
*EDIT* I am having a real hard time finding Veksar. I look on Allakazam and nothing shows up. Is there another name for it? Where is it in relation to other zones? I'd love to go there if it's good exp, but can't find it. Thanks,<br />
