<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am, for the moment a 52nd shaman of the Firiona vie server and i would like to know how i should upgrade. At the moment i am looking to upgrade most slots. On firiona vie we have different nodrop rules, so i can buy almost anything, but with less people on the server, supplies aren't very high (JBBs and fungis are very rare, and iksar regen Bps sell for 30k).<br />
<br />
Here is my current Magelo profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=397889 )<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice you may offer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Balthag what kinda mobs do you hit or how powerful is your guild etc.  IMO you should start to do the Thurg quest or PoG killing for the velious upgrades if possible.  Also you should prolly get a shadel bandit ring instead of your diamond one or a velium fire opal one since hps are really good to have for a shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I gots me profile at the bottom if ya wanna glance at it, feel free to send me a tell ingame anytime.<br />

Oh BTW I picked up my ikky for 15k a few weeks ago, theyve dropped down to about 10-12. I bought Malycks for 12k 4 weeks ago and sold it for that 3 weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Ill start at the top...<br />
<br />
Head- I used one for abit, using a jaundiced bone right now. I only do that to keep my ac at 900 unbuffed, though, but its an option. 18 ac plus clicky.<br />
<br />
Ear- Ditch the Ivory for a Black Saphire Electrum Earring, or better yet, and earring of twisted leaves/purity/cleansing. The first is 2ac 25hp 35mana (or is it 35h 25m)? The last three are all 2 ac 1 wis 35hp/mana and clicky scale of wolf, cure poison, and cure disease respectively. The last three drop in Chardok I think. I bought my twisted leaves from celle for 1k or 1100.<br />
<br />
Fingers- Spend 450 or whatever on a 6/65 velium fire wedding ring. Or two of them. If ya got the cash, spend 3-3.5k on a shadel bandit ring. Makes summoning dogdog quicker too. In my profile.<br />
<br />
Wrist- If yer really stuck on extended range, then I guess stick with it. I personally didnt find much use for it, and I got my getto Jarsath Scale Wrist Guard for 40 plat. 8 ac 4wis/cha. Of course, Shanana wants 50k for a JBB (and the bad part is Im thinking about sellin some crap to get it).<br />
<br />
Hands- Most people recommend those or coldain skin or whatever. Im still at the point where the AC on my crystal chitin's is still sweet for me, and Im savin money for a JBB, otherwise Id probably have the same thing.<br />
<br />
Shoulders- Tattered Mantles are CHEAP. Like 200-250 at most, maybe 300 ifin yer desperate. 12 AC 20 HP 10 SVD. I use and elder wolf hide, they sell from anywhere from 1k to 2k, and some try to get 3k from them 10 ac 4 str/int/wis 30hp. If Ghowlik in the sonic wolf cave in hollowshade more is still Light blue to you, he drops them, albeit rarely.<br />
<br />
Chest- I love my ikky bp, and I dont think Ill give it up til I have a vindi BP.<br />
<br />
Waist- Pretty nice belt, I was lookin at getting one. I got me silvery belt of contention instead. What can I say I like haste. It looks like that Flayed Turmoilskin Belt or the Chitinous Belt (not sure about that one) might be worth looking into, but I might just keep that belt for the wisdom. Havent look at enough belts since I got mine.<br />
<br />
Feet- Sweet. Wish I had a pair.<br />
<br />
Arms- Not a biggie, I would keep them for now. Some of the other popular ones ive seen on FV are the Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves, 16 ac 25hp 6str/sta or somethin like that. I prefer the JB like I said, although someone was sellin some barbed ringmail sleeves (20 AC 3 wis/(dex or str cant remember) for 5k a few days ago. Probably gone now though.<br />
<br />
Spear- Hope ya have fun with it.<br />
<br />
Shield- I would stick with that. I paid 10k for my bone braced buckler and havent seen one since though, but if you can get yer hands on one of these puppies, they are sweet. Screw SBS (outside of raids at least), or that Bane Warding Shiled. 25 AC 10str/wis 55hp/mana.<br />
<br />
Range- Do the new quest for that planar travellers manual, then do the quest for the beginning book of magic or whatever. I use a gantru charm right now (2-4k), 7 AC 5 wis and a few others, 2 all saves. If you want to spend less, goranga idol. I think ya know the stats, like 8ac 25hp and some stamina.<br />
<br />
Oh well, hope this helps. Feel free to send me a tell, for feedback on my ideas if nothin else.<br />
