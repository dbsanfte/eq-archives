<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi!<br />
<br />
I've heard that slows can be 'cured' with cure disease. I tried, but didn't work...so figured it was just a rumor. Then someone tells me last nite that slows can be 'cured' with cure disease.<br />
<br />
What's the real story here?<br />
<br />
Thanks! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, you can cure someone who has been slowed since the last patch.<br />
<br />
Use counteract disease or disinfecting aura rather than cure disease as cure disease may not be 'powerful' enough to do it.<br />
<br />
I'm sure someone can explain how counters and cures work better than I can so I won't even try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hamesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the last patch they added disease counters to slows.  That means they can be cured with cure disease but might take a few casts I'm guessing if it's a higher level slow.  All my knowledge on this comes from the update on Castersrealm so if this isn't right someone please correct me.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Seredith's post wasn't there when I started mine:-( hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Somehow the effect on the Wolf Caller's Greaves seems that much better to me to now :D.  Abolish disease cures any slow I have been up against with a single cast.<br />
<br />
The melee classes in my regular groups are pretty happy about it to.<br />
<br />
Melee: &quot;Slowed&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;Mez pantz can cure anee dizeez!&quot;<br />
Melee: &quot;Err....&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorta funny the first 100 times : )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A quick comment on the cure disease for those of you not familiar with it.  Disease counters determine the 'severity' of the disease if you will.  I think shaman slow puts on 16 disease counters (very high) as Eoin noted in the prior post.  If you did a low level cure disease, it might 'cure' one or two disease counters.  That's why you have to cast cure disease like 3 or 4 times at low levels.  It removes counters, but won't 'cure' the disease until all the counters are removed.  I believe abolish disease automatically removes all disease counters--though I'm not sure if it only removes the first disease spell, or all disease spells currently on the target.  I can't remember the last time I had more than 1 disease spell on me!  :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chutoi is correct. <br />
 This means for us that we don't have to worry about people dispelling it once landed. <br />
<br />
 I love that new feature, just cant wait till they fix the aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've had great luck using disinfecting aura to clear both disease and poisons in a single shot. It even clears trakanon's poison in a single cast.</div></div><hr />

I can test it sometime, but I think the counters are assigned to each spell, i.e. that the counters put on you by Pox are kept separate from the ones created by stacking Plague with it. Then if you cure disease, the counters are removed from the most recent spell first, and when all of a spell's counters are removed, the spell is gone.<br />
<br />
So, with Pox and then Plague on you, one casting of Counteract Disease would take 8 of Plague's 9 counters, leaving both spells on you. Another casting would take the last of Plague's counters (removing it) and 7 of Pox's. A third casting would remove the last 2 counters and kill Pox.<br />
<br />
This is just my speculation, though. I think I will test it tonight since it's got me interested. :)<br />
<br />
BTW Abolish Disease removes 36 disease counters! Even if you could stack 2 Poxes and 2 Plagues on someone, a single casting of AD would kill them all. It's strong stuff.<br />
<br />
Disinfecting Aura removes 20 poison and 20 disease counters. Especially good for situations where you're getting hit with both, but it will kill any slow and pretty much any feasible amount of poison or disease in one casting. Also quite potent.</div></div><hr />

Am I wrong?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">abolish will only remove one effect.<br />

I got slowed and some crappy disease DOT on me, needed 2 clicks of the greaves, one to drop the slow and the other to break the disease.  And they were really low level ones too, so they're not over 36 disease counters.</div></div><hr />

It was a hypothetical. You're not wrong.</div></div><hr />

No and yes.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, you can stack 2 dots from the same line.  Envenomed Bolt and Venom of the Snake stack quite nicely together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, I tried it out last night. I was almost right. :p<br />
<br />
First thing I was wrong about: When curing spells with counters, the topmost spell is removed first. Time order has nothing to do with it; it's totally based on the icon position (which is kinda dumb, but fits the EQ spell system).<br />
<br />
The other thing I guessed wrong is how the counters are removed. Here's what I did:<br />
<br />
1) Cast Insidious Decay on myself (adding 9 disease counters and a spell icon).<br />
2) Cast Plague on myself (adding 9 more counters and another spell icon).<br />
3) Cast Counteract Disease on myself (removes 8 counters). 8 of the 9 counters from ID were removed. Both icons remained.<br />
4) Cast Counteract Disease on myself again. The last counter from ID was removed, and the icon was removed.<br />
5) Cast Counteract Disease on myself for the third time. Plague was not removed. This means that the second casting of CD only removed the last counter of ID. It did not apply its remaining 7 counters to Plague as I had guessed it would.<br />
6) Cast Counteract Disease on myself for the fourth time. Plague was removed.<br />
<br />
So, CD affected each spell in the exact same way, despite having counters left over from the second casting. Once enough counters were removed to kill the topmost spell, any excess curative power was wasted.<br />
<br />
However, the above phenomenon only applies to cures that don't have enough power to remove all of the topmost spell's counters. For example, I recast ID and Plague on myself, then cast Abolish Disease. Both spells were removed by it. So, if the cure has enough power to remove the topmost spell, its leftover counters will be applied to the next spell down.<br />
<br />
I hope that made sense. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for checking that out, Eoin! /cheer!<br />
<br />
And no, Daxon, Insidious Decay won't lower the resistance to slow.  The check to see if the slow lands is still magic resistance.  The only thing disease counters have to do with slow is in regards to REMOVING a slow.  Slow cane be'cured' as if it were a disease, but you still land it against a magic resistance check.<br />
