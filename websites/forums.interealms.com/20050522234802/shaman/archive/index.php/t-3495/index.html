<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought this discovery is worth a separate thread, because if verified this would make the Canni II quest alot easier:<br />
<br />
Farbzilla posted this in response to my other thread on this topic:<br />
<br />
&quot;maybe it's just my stupid luck......but: <br />
Every time i'm in CoM for xp or whatever there is strange ocre clay as a ground spawn in the stables area. if you head towards the stables and make a left you'll go under an arch way and past two rooms. ahead is a ramp with two spawns on the ground and one on the second floor (up the ramp). anyhoo at the feet of the mob on the right (lower area) there is always a ground spawn and i pick up...you guessed it: strange ocre clay. <br />
<br />
The area i'm talking about is basically the very lower right part of area &quot;6&quot; on the EQ Atlas map. Later on i did kill an army behemoth and attempting to loot the clay lead to a lore item message. No one else seems to be posting this so i hope i didn't just get lucky in a fluke...lemme know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anybody else been able to verify this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">C'mon, somebody has to have been able to test this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was in COM and checked it out.  No ground spawn.  It's always possible that the Behometh spawned in there, someone else killed it, and dropped the clay.... if it's droppable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, the clay is droppable and a lore item, so probably someone dropped it after killing the army behemeth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Took down the Behemoth Saturday nite heading up to Neh Ashiir.  Dropped the clay, so i'm guessing that's not true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree, I doubt it would be ground spawn, but you never know what VI is up too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wouldn't matter much anyway, because you've still got to get the bones from the Warlord in Karnors...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Despawn time for anything dropped on the ground by a player is 6 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The clay was always one of the easiest parts of the quest simply because it's the only trade-able one of the four items.  And no one else needs it for anything I know of.  I'd be amazed if it became a ground spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Worgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Item data mistake I'd guess.  There is a groundspawn there now and its a nodrop wicker basket thing marked as monk only (part of whistling fists maybe?).  Army Behemoth still drops the clay anyhow (this is as of yesterday :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yes, the basket is for one of the possible sub-quests for the shackle of tynnonium quest.</div></div><hr />
