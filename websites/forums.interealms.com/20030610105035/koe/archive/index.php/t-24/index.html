<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well...Aaeamdar (aka vowels) and myself were discussing how fun it would be to have an East Coast version of our gathering in St Louis. <br />
<br />
The proposed date: April 20-22<br />
Gathering area: Mechanicsburg (Harrisburg) PA<br />
<br />
I was thinking of trying to schedule us all reservations for a medieval feast that they hold in the area. (If all were interested.) In order to do this, though I would need to know who/how many were coming as these events fill up pretty fast. I will be calling them in the next day or so to make sure this is a feasible option.<br />
<br />
If that does not work out, I'm sure we can find some local activities to us to get us in trouble  <br />
<br />
There is a local airport here in Harrisburg and also a train that runs here too. (I would be glad to take taxi duty for anyone who needs a pick up). <br />
Also if anyone needs accomodations I can help out there too.<br />
<br />
So please post if you have an interest in attending!<br />
<br />
Addendum:<br />
<br />
Here is what I found out so far...<br />
<br />
Medievel feast...not out of the question, but may be difficult for schedules...Sundays are the normal feast days (usually run from 5-9 pm) Fridays can be scheduled for private groups..again..around the same time<br />
<br />
Gettysburg..close to here, if you like historical stuff..could be fun to tramp around on Saturday afternoon<br />
<br />
ABC Brewery...microbrewery and fun place..pool tables, dartboards, good food<br />
<br />
I am also calling a local winery that holds events to see if anything is happening that weekend.<br />
<br />
There are also other local places to just hang out and yak..<br />
<br />
If anyone has any special interests they would like me to check on or look up..would be glad to do so, just let me know!<br />
<br />
We've found some hotel information that I wanted to pass along to you all...it is as follows:<br />
<br />
Best Western $85.00/per night<br />
Hampton Inn $102/$109 per night (dbl/king)<br />
Travel Lodge $43.20/per night<br />
Holiday Inn $119/139 per night (depending on which HI you chose)<br />
<br />
There is a tradition in this area called The Carlisle Car Show which happens to be this weekend also. For those non-gearheads, this is one of the East Coast's largest car shows/auctions, so needless to say, hotel rooms are going to fill up fast. It's pretty important that you contact me ASAP with your reservation request if you'd like me to handle making your reservation. If not, feel free to contact any of those hotels directly through their '800' numbers. Most of those are located in New Cumberland, Pa (a small suburb of Mechanicsburg).<br />
<br />
If you'd like another choice for a hotel, or more information, drop me and email and I'll see what I can do to find more information. Remember, time is of the essence, so let me know soon.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Knarlz, a special message from Winnie...she says to get your chain smoking, beer drinking arse to Mechanicsburg, she misses you dearly.<br />
<br />
OK..got a request from someone to find out which hotel everyone is staying at in order for everyone to try and stay at the same place if possible.<br />
<br />
The one vote I got so far was for the travel lodge....I STRONGLY suggest that everyone get their reservations in as soon as possible as the hotels are filling up fast for that weekend!<br />
<br />
(I already have one person staying with me..so if you all dont want to be sleeping on the floor please get your reservations as soon as you can.)<br />
<br />
You can post here if you already got your reservation or email me at vze23n4w@verizon.net and I'll be glad to get you some help in doing so.<br />
<br />
As far as ages go..the places we are going serve food also..so if yer under 21 you can still go but may not be able to consume the alcoholic beverages..either that or we'll drop you at Chuckie Cheese along the way :P <br />
Heheh..actually..we'll make sure everyone can be included.<br />
<br />
Now..the feast...several of us have expressed interest in still attending the feast..it will be on Sunday of that weekend from around 5-9. It will, however be a pirate feast this time..never been to one of those, but its run by the same people so should still be a blast..BUT it is not for those who are easily offended as they can get a bit bawdy  (Also no age limit there) (I took Friday and Monday off from work also so anyone interested in staying till Monday will be no problem giving rides...and when you get your fight information please let me know as I will be the taxi service).<br />
