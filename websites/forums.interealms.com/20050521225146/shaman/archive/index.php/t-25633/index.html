<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently my guild has grown a whole lot.  Chalk it up to others misfortunes I would say.  But we are really getting alot of new members. <br />
<br />
Our normal raids usually consisted around 40 or so.  Our last raid we had 68.  Unfortunately we had only 2 shamen to buff the raid.  And do it in a  timely manner.  That leaves us a little stressed.  Usually we will have 4 to 6 shamen, but not all of us have the new spells.  I'd say 4 for sure have the new spells and the others still have the PoP spells.<br />
<br />
We are doing tier 3 pop and some OoW stuff.  If everything goes well we will be elemental soon. (I just need RD, MM and RZ for eles).  There has been some discussion by the shaman of the best way to go about buffing the numbers we have.  Since I've never really buffed a full raid I thought I'd come here and get some advice.  I have a few specific questions, but I'd also like any other advice people can give.<br />
<br />
1.  We only have the single version of Wunshi.  How do we handle pre-raid buffs?  Does EVERYONE need Wunshi?  or should we just hit the MT and OT's and pullers and mbg Fo7?<br />
<br />
2.  Rebuffing the newly rezzed.  We do run a shaman chat channel, though sometimes it gets hectic. In your expert opinions, would it just be best to call out when you are rebuffing in a channel, or do you think it would be benificial to have one or two shaman designated to rebuffing the people who need it.  Tells for buffs are getting out of control and it sometimes gets confusing.<br />
<br />
thats it.  Any advice would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">to point 1:<br />
imo do mgb f7 and then hit the tanks, offtanks and maybe clerics with wunshi. give might to the dps-melees if they cry, but otherwise that must be sufficient (ah yes, and buff the shaman with it, too ;))<br />
<br />
point 2: my shaman (omg pls do not say shamEn!) have a channel and whenever we see someone naked standing next to a corpse, we call his name in the channel (just target and type %T in the channel) and do the buffing. we normally have 1-2 shaman on debuffing/slowing, rest does buffing/assisthealing/slacking/nuking, but with its possible with just 2 shaman too (they have to be focused though :))<br />
otherwise they shall tell for buffs (no other channels). sure, can get hectic normally, but thats part of the job :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tebion covered point 1 perfectly.<br />
<br />
2. Rez Channel. 1 of each buffing class in this channel along with a corpse dragger. When somebody gets killed, they join this channel &amp; ask for pie. They get rezzed in, buffed, &amp; back to the raid asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2.  Rebuffing the newly rezzed.  We do run a shaman chat channel, though sometimes it gets hectic. In your expert opinions, would it just be best to call out when you are rebuffing in a channel, or do you think it would be benificial to have one or two shaman designated to rebuffing the people who need it.  Tells for buffs are getting out of control and it sometimes gets confusing. <br />
<br />
Shaman in our guild generally assign buffs. I've found it's much easier to keep up with 1-2 buffs then having to be responsible for all shaman buffs. With 2 shaman, it would probably be: Gloriana - FOCUS/MIGHT, Solemneyes - AGI/STA and we would spam the raid channel frequently. If I got a tell for sta, I would either /r Solemneyes or I would tell SE to that so and so wants STA in the shaman channel or usually a combination of the two. (Any of other buffs would be handled ad hoc - tribunal by groups, the occasional cha, etc).<br />
<br />
As far as rebuffing the dead, when you see people pop up by their corpse, you cast your assigned buffs on them. Generally, we let the other shaman know the person has been rezzed: &quot;so and so up!&quot; After I buff everyone I see being rezzed, I usually ask anyone who was missed to send buff requests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good advice so far. I second massing 7th and just getting some select few with Wunshi. Also you might want to make a hotkey like &quot;shaman 1 on focus, might - shaman 2 on sta, agi, resists&quot;. Then just keep your set of buffs memmed and ignore all tells that are not on your buff list. People who can not read do not need buffs.<br />
<br />
As for the newly rezzed, if you do divide up the buffs between different shamans just hit everyone with your buffs as he appears at his corpse. Anyone you miss can still send you a tell.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, there are few people on a large raid that actually have to work. Most classes have at worst two buffs they have to cast. A shadowknight can jolly well take the time to read your buff hotkey text and send a couple of tells to the appropriate shaman. Anyone who thinks his time is more important then yours better be the raid leader, main tank or puller. Anyone else can get in line and take the extra 10 seconds to send two tells instead of one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depending on the raid (if we are expecting many deaths and battle rezzing) we designate one or possibly 2 shaman as rebuffers.  When I get the duty, I turn off all names (/shownames off -- that way you only see a name for a pet or a corpse and you know who needs rebuffs).  I usually call rebuffs in the shaman chat channel (rebuffing %t!).  Also before the raiding gets underway, the designated shaman rebuffer calls in raid that he will be the shaman rebuffer tonight, and periodically repeats it.<br />
<br />
As for pre-raid buffing.  None of our shamans have group wunshi either.  Usually someone MGB's fortitude, someone MGB's sense, and then shamans take like groups 1-4, 5-6, etc and buff everyone with wunshi.  We tried MGBing Fo7 and then hitting tanks etc with Wunshi but the guild rebelled and everyone just clicks off Fo7 now, so we bit the bullet and now buff everyone.  If you get spiritual channeling you can pretty much buff a full raid of 60+ with wunshi w/o having to med or get pumped.<br />
<br />
During the raid, we in the shaman channel designate 1 shaman to cast malos.  No sense in having 5 shaman cast it... Then have the rest spam malosinia and turgurs/nihil till we get the mob totally debuffed.  Never count on mages to cast sinia; at least our mages are just too lazy.<br />
<br />
We usually have about 4-6 shamans per raid, and this system seems to work pretty well.  Yah it gets crazy sometimes when 30 people die at once and all want rebuffs (especially when you were just rezzed as well), but such is life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Buffing pet peeve - <br />
<br />
I know this sounds weird, but I HATE people who say thanks during a huge raid rebuffing. Screws with my /rt!! <br />
<br />
I've made several posts to my guild forums thanking my guild for being thoughtful and courteous but to please NOT THANK ME for each individual buff while raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wudedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yep keep thkx on msg board because now where did melee_17 go? or the freakin rogue that clicks SoS on/off and I changed out cap with see invis?<br />
<br />
and yeah most of my peeps have rebelled on fo7 as well. sigh. &lt; next time Sony lemme choose which spell I want first &gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Assigning buffs to various shaman will save you a lot of time and headache. In our guild, since I am the class leader, I assign buffs based on who has what and spam /raid with the macro during buffs and after a wipe/semi-wipe. Saves time and confusion.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have the blessing of being one of five shaman on guild raids. The buff load is no longer a problem. But when I was the only shaman in the guild, boy did I grow to hate buffing, lol. Here's how you do it, minimally.<br />
<br />
MGB Focus of the Seventh.<br />
<br />
MGB Talisman of the Boar.<br />
<br />
One shaman hits clerics/mages with IOS, since our Focus line does not stack with the cleric self-only mana regen buff (and I believe there is a mage shield-line buff they like to use that does not stack with Focus-line). You can sooner milk a chicken than get your average cleric/mage to click that buff off. <br />
<br />
The IOS shaman then loads up Fortitude and hits TANKS with it.<br />
<br />
One shaman hits TANKS with Wunshi.<br />
<br />
By the way, TANKS does not mean every single melee in the raid. TANKS means your actual tanks, the ones who take the beating. I also Wunshi/Fortitude my puller.<br />
<br />
If you have Spirit of Might, your Rangers/Rogues will love you for it. Zerkers like Might too. Spirit of Sense is another good one. My guild considers those luxury buffs on raids. When someone dies, they get Focus/STA. When we're at the raid start, we might buff Sense/Might if we have the time for it. Otherwise we hit DPS'ers on the run with Might and call it even.<br />
<br />
Spiritual Channeling helps with this.<br />
<br />
Rebuffs: Do it quickly and efficiently. Our shaman put a rebuff macro to our shaman raid channel (Focus on %T, etc.). Double buffing is just a waste of time and mana.<br />
<br />
One more thing: if anybody bitches, tell them folks have done POP targets with POP buffs for quite some time and been perfectly successful. Then put up an AFK message that says something along the lines of: &quot;Unless you've died and want rebuffs, you are raiding with what you got on your body. Live with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Trust me on this, make sure the puller is maxed out, and the alt pullers are as well. Nothing will bring a raid to a halt faster than the puller waiting around for buffs to land. Also the better off he is, the more likely he/she is to survive. I know hauling scale back to camp with a mob that's taking 1500pt hunks out of my hide, I kept praying that the extra bit of avoidance from the buff, would be enough. Guess what, FD'd at the tanks feet with under 100hps left is a fairly common occurance.<br />
<br />
Also when doing pull duty, I was pretty anal about not getting heals unless I ask for them. Then when I ask, I didn't expect to wait long for it. When on a roll, and everyone works together, and things flow smoothly, it's a thing of beauty :)<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Agree'd Wastrel about the pullers.  Not like we have a choice in that anyway.  I know I don't want someone who can bring 20 mobs to me and play dead mad at me....hehe.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, Thanks so much for the advice everyone.  This is really really helping alot.<br />
<br />
Oh. Keep the advice coming, can never have too much info when it comes to raids and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have been the only shaman buffing our 60+ raid force, multiple times now.  We generally do Uqua+ content, and its a stretch for our guild sometimes (lots of new under geared apps).  Consequently, we have a lot of deaths typically.  (But win still hehe).<br />
<br />
At any rate, with expedition timers running, I rarely have time to med, and most buffing needs to be done ASAP.<br />
<br />
What that amounts to, is prioritizing buffing.  The beginning of the raid is easy.  The only way to buff a raid of that size, being alone, is this:<br />
<br />
1.  mgb Fo7.<br />
2.  talisman of fort or sta by groups.<br />
3.  ToT if needed by groups.<br />
<br />
That usually runs me fairly low mana.  At that point, the prioritizing comes into effect.<br />
<br />
I buff wunshi and sense in this order, as my mana comes back.<br />
<br />
1.  MT/SA/TA<br />
2.  Other offtanks<br />
3.  Monks<br />
4.  Other melee<br />
5.  by request only after that.  <br />
<br />
To cut down on random ranger A-L asking for wunshi when I'm OOM and have monks to buff still, I usually let folks know where I am in that buff sequence.  <br />
<br />
&quot;mgb fo7 inc&quot;<br />
&quot;fortitude by groups inc&quot;<br />
&quot;tot by groups inc&quot;<br />
&quot;Wunshi single casts for tanks inc&quot;<br />
&quot;Wunshi single casts for monks inc (better not die damnit)&quot;.<br />
&quot;Wunshi for dps melee inc&quot;<br />
<br />
finally,<br />
<br />
&quot;Wunshi or missed buffs at request now&quot;.<br />
<br />
If I get any tells from druids, wizards, etc.. asking for single casts of this or that, they are ignored until that buff sequence is done.  <br />
<br />
Basically, if you have limited Shaman (or often only 1), you have to serve the most people as fast as possible.  You can't feel bad about ignoring the individual to serve the masses hehe.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Trust me on this, make sure the puller is maxed out, and the alt pullers are as well. Nothing will bring a raid to a halt faster than the puller waiting around for buffs to land.<br />
<br />
And I kinda disagree about the importance of fast monk buffing.  Good monks run off bare arse and do their job, which, is not to be hit in the first place.  And, honestly, with mobs hitting for 1-2k a pop, really, how much help does 600 hp do?  Not much.  What would have killed the monk with wunshi, will kill the monk without.  If you have limited time, limited mana, its probably a better idea to toss sense on a monk than it is wunshi.  <br />
<br />
Our raid leaders often tell the monks to just keep moving, if buffs happen to land when the monk is running back and forth, so be it, if not, suck it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">this is where spiritual channeling becomes superior.  You get 30 wunshi's of on SC - and SC refreshes faster then wunshi's wears off.  2 shaman with SC can buff a whole raid with wunshi's in 4 min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OT:<br />
<br />
Raid shaman pet peeves:<br />
<br />
1.  10 seconds from engaging mob, get a tell for wunshi etc.<br />
2.  Getting tells for buffs when I just died<br />
3.  when shamans are going nuts trying to buff everyone preraid, getting tells from someone for wunshi &gt;&lt;<br />
4.  Someone asking for an off the wall buff like diaku.  Trust me, you wont notice the difference it makes to a raid, get over it!<br />
5.  Shamans buff for a living, yet you have to *beg* one of your 9 clerics on the raid for a symbol/conviction &gt;&lt;<br />
6.  People not saying please, as if I'm just a buffing bot...<br />
7.  in guild chat:  &quot;is this mob slowed!!???&quot; YES IT IS, you're just gimp!<br />
8.  Being expected to patch heal on a pull.... as if we can cast turgurs and yoppas at the same time!<br />
<br />
Any others? Im sure!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've only recently started in a raiding guild, and I started straight into time.<br />
<br />
typically someone will yelp if they don't have Wunshi and you're able to cast it. There is an old army rule: never volunteer. after MGBs and group buffs take it to tells.<br />
<br />
I typically will toss Wunshi on the tanks, and then Fort. group by group. after that, its on tell basis. usually I have 3-5 tells ever few mins, someone was too far from MGB, someone had another buff up, someone was DoTed, there are hundreds of excuses you'll hear, best thing is to perma mem single Wunshi and Fort. while on raids.<br />
<br />
Don't start tossing buffs on random people, wait for someone to say something for the buffs (I don't know if its because I want to conserve mana, or if it's because I liked to be asked for things but anyway) make the most of your time, organize with other shaman and classes to get the most out of your buffs (i.e. those who have group versions, MGB and organize shaman to be responsible for specific groups: shaman1 - groups 1-3; shaman2 - groups 4-6; etc.) my guild in itself has 2 other channels going at all times, guild, raidsay, debuff channel, and shaman channel, make use of these tools.<br />
<br />
as far as debuffing, it really only takes one shaman, two at most if you want things to happen instantly.<br />
<br />
read up on encounters, the mobs that are the targets, and other mobs in zone, occasionally you'll learn the hard way, that any mob can add, even if they aren't part of the intended encounter. knowledge and skill are everyone's two greatest advantages.<br />
<br />
EDIT: just a side note, I'm the shammy that gets all the tells for buffs, my name's the easiest to spell. /em mumbles something about making an unpronouncable name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grendo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Formally being a buffing class, and being part of several raid guilds each with their own way of handling things, Ive found the best way (when class channels are involved - as is the case here) is a simple tell system. <br />
<br />
A hotkey to buff works easiest, including a tell to the person you're buffing (so they expect it and dont spam you or another shaman) and a tell to the class channel saying who you're buffing and with what (to prevent duplicant buffs on rez etc).<br />
<br />
Generally, not buffing unless asked is a decent rule when youre short help. If they need it they will let you know. If they ask you too late -- well thats up to you how to handle it. heh<br />
<br />
The point is really moot once you get the group version of Wunshi -- which if you're the only consistent shaman(s) in your raid force, and people arent happy with Fo7 -- tell them to pass on guild-dropped oow runes and youd be happy to buff them. Otherwise, there's no reason to complain. Iirc its a shamans, 7th? 70 rune -- one cant be expected to get all of those without some boxing/guild help...or extreme luck. <br />
<br />
Its not necessary to a Time raid - plenty of others did it long before the new buffs - its simply an additional factor to make most e-penises larger (omgz I have uberz hitpoints!!11one). Tanks and HP sensitive classes excluded of course (including pullers)<br />
<br />
&gt;=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Draz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Being the only shaman on a large raid can be nothing short of frustrating.  With the recent exodus to EQ2/WoW i've been in that situation a lot.  What i've ended up doing is:<br />
1.)  As the raid forms, i start casting Wunshi's on tanks(Warrior, Pally, SK) and a few clerics(the ones who usually heal on inc and get smacked around).<br />
2.)  Once buffs are called i MGB Fo7, and then do Fort by group.<br />
3.)  Usually follow up w/ Wunshi's to the pullers/ and enchanters if we're doing a raid where CC is big, and also Rogues if i'm feelin generous and have time/mana.<br />
<br />
The key is keeping track of who has what, and don't let people push you to cast the buffs, just because they like to see green numbers.  200 more HP isn't gonna matter if a Wizard gets agro, chances are they are still raid pizza.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The shaman in my guild give out whatever buffs are requested. We just got a shaman with the group wunshi (had one but he retired) so 3-4 of us have been buffing the raid constantly with the group stamina/sense and single target wunshi/might.<br />
<br />
We do this because we expect to have whatever buffs we want when we need them, we expect our guildmates to want to have the best buffs they can have, and we want to ensure that people are happy. Happy people have more fun, which in turn creates a better all round environment.<br />
<br />
I would be embarassed to ever put up an afk message because I couldn't be bothered to buff someone. EDIT: Not meant as a snipe, more an example of how I personally play the game.<br />
<br />
After a wipe (and we have been doing Uqua so they have occured from time to time) we will mgb focus then hit tanks, pullers, and cycle the raid groups until they are done.<br />
<br />
Get your rezzing organized so casters get pulled in first. I hate watching all the melee get rezzed while casters are dead. Get up, get buffing, and make your raid force the strongest it can be. Even single target buffing the raid you will probably be full mana before the clerics are all done buffing and medding. Obviously there are times when its critical to just get moving so spread the wunshi out and do it as the raid rolls on.</div></div><hr />

you can always setup one of the standard hotkey responses.  Take quarm for example.  Fairly resistant, needs to be re-debuffed every time a head drops.  Guild often askes, &quot;is he slowed yet&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hoteky 1:<br />
<br />
&quot;/rs %t is resisting slow.  A lot.  Don't be discouraged as its only a matter of time before slow lands.  In the meantime, us shaman suggest you increase your healing speeds, and tanks, please increase your AC and avoidance.  Thank you, and have a nice day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hotkey 2:<br />
<br />
&quot;/rs %t is resisting slow.  Thanks for asking about it though.  I wasn't aware that slow was a factor in this game anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hotkey 3:<br />
<br />
&quot;/rs %t is resisting slow.  I'm giving up and dotting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hotkey 4: <br />
<br />
&quot;/rs %t is resisting slow.  Blame SOE&quot;<br />
<br />
Hotkey 5:<br />
<br />
&quot;/rs %t is resisting slow.  Was this mob tashed? &quot;<br />
<br />
Hotkey 6:<br />
<br />
&quot;/rs %t is resisting slow.  Maybe you'll think twice about not wanting to farm nihili in KT with me next time, punks&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Only one shaman in my guild has the group wunshi so when I show up for raids now I just start single target casting wunshi on everyone I see. In the event that our group wunshi caster doesn't show, I'm ahead of the game. With some quick buff aa's, beneficial spell haste and good manna regen buffs it never takes long to tag everyone. Besides, what else do I have to do while the raid gets set up? And my Wunshi lasts 2 hours, so it's not like I'm doing it all that often. More often than not, we have 4-6 shaman in a raid and we just MGB all our buffs and are gtg though.<br />
<br />
Following raid buffs I spam a hotkey in the raid chat channel that says, &quot;All shaman buffs can be directed to me in tell.&quot; two times. From then on, if you don't ask me for a buff in tell you don't get it (barring group members). I don't have a hard name to type so I don't feel I'm asking for to much. By the way /rt or ctrl-t is your best freakin friend.<br />
<br />
Durring raids I keep one eye peeled for the dead. When I see a corpse pop I will go stand in front of them and hit another hotkey that says, &quot;Focus &amp; Stamina %T&quot; in say. We don't consistantly have a shaman channel, but I've moved it there when we do. I'll buff them with wunshi and fortitude and leave it at that. If they want something else, I expect a tell.<br />
<br />
Many ways to tackle bufs I guess. This is just one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We have 2 to 4 shaman on most raids at this point.  There are only two buffs we try to keep up on everyone all the time, some kind of Focus and Stamina.<br />

No one has group Wunshi yet.  We used to start with MGB Fo7.  If we have 4 shaman everyone does their own group.  A couple of times when I was the only one there I have clicked SC and buffed everyone with Wunshi.<br />
<br />
We have one person with group Fortitude so he will MGB that.  If he's not there we MGB Boar.<br />

We have a raid shaman channel where we do most of our administration, who is doing what tonight.<br />

/afk I'm doing Focus tonight :: send tells to Binter for Stamina :: tnx<br />
<br />
I just edit it at the beginning of the evening if someone else has the Sta duty.  Then I can one-click the message any time the raid moves to another zone.<br />
<br />
When someone sends me a tell saying &quot;Sta plz&quot; I just ignore it.  The afk message does the work for me (if the requester can't read the afk message, there's no point in my trying to type an answer to teach them how to read.)  And I will not mem Fortitude that evening, unless Binter dies.</div></div><hr />

So you don't talk to anyone at all via /tell when you are raiding? God, I would be bored stupid if I couldn't talk to my friends and they wouldn't talk to me very long if they got a constant afk message while chatting..... :D</div></div><hr />

I talk as much as I like.  Doing it this way means I don't have to talk about buffing, and I don't have to spend my time memming and dememming buffs.<br />

Identical effect, it even has a duration of a couple more minutes! Plus druids need something to do in my guild, since we use Viction instead of Steeloak/Balikor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">another thing: when you have enough shaman, make sure you save at least one mgb for a possible wipe.<br />
its better to cast either fort, sense or trib on each group than buffing the whole raid with F7/wunshi on a wipe 10 minutes after mgbs are done, believe me  :D <br />
<br />
and yeah, pullers have top priority in the buffing chain.<br />
<br />
to the &quot;10 secs before pull &quot;xyz tells you; wunshi please&quot; ... 10 secs are ok, i get many requests right after the like &quot;&lt;MOB XYZ&gt; IS INCOMING!&quot;  ;) <br />
and sometimes i even take my time to make a fitting answer, ehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Mass your best FoS.  Buff your tanks with single target good stuff.<br />
Leave the onus on your raiders to ask for the buffs they need.<br />
Don't be scared to tell people &quot;no, I won't buff that 5 seconds before the charge&quot; if they delay asking for buffs.<br />
If I see someone recently ressed, I'll often buff them up and say in our shaman channel that soandso is buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Usually just two of us Shaman with any sort of good buff spells on any raids in my guild.<br />
<br />
Cullain will MGB Fo7, then put single Might on the Melees and Hybrids. I will put group Fortitude and Sense on each group leader, then put Wunshi on the Warriors and Knights.<br />
<br />
I like to save my MGB for Ancestral Aid 3 if needed; if we wipe (haven't lately), we trade roles on the rebuffs. I personally put IoS on the Clerics and Perserverence on the Necromancers as well. Of course, when one of us gets group Wunshi or group Might, we'll adapt. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">What's all this bull**** about clerics not getting focus but getting IoS instead?<br />
Focus, Oak, Symbol + AC Buff is better mana regen and hp then Cleric Self Buff+Conviction+IoS.    Don't let clerics whinge about their self buffs.  They can get the same spells as the rest of the raid and live with it.  <br />
<br />
As for buffing, for about 6 weeks I was the only shaman with all the relevant spells.  It was hell.  Tell the raid channel what you are doing, and stick to it.  <br />
&quot;I will MGB Focus.  Cast Sta/Dodge on every group in the raid.  I will then Wunshi Tanks/Chanters.  When mana/time permit I will do +Damage and Wunshi on others.  Necro's, please twitch me and somone please heal the Canni damage I take.  Buffing this raid costs 7Kmana per group&quot;<br />
/afk Buffing Raid for next 10 mins.  <br />
<br />
<br />
For casters and priests Wunshi is just a few HP more than Focus, Str &amp; Dex do have a small effect on DPS and Procs, so it is useful to give that to melees.  So as time and mana permit start doing Wunshi on other people, favouring melees over casters/priests.  <br />
Don't cast to under 50% mana.  <br />
Make sure Necro's twitch you.  <br />
Make sure someone heals the Canni Damage you take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Once a few shaman have spells it all changes, and becomes a lot easier.  <br />
Assign each shaman a different buff.  Announce it in raid and guild a few times (hotkey it).  Try to make sure the same shaman always do the same things raid after raid.  <br />
<br />
If someone asks you for a different buff just reply back with the name of the shaman who is on that buff.  People will learn in the end.  <br />
<br />
Dead folk and Late Arrivals:  Once someone is rezzed/present slap your buff on them and call it in the shaman channel, that way the other shaman know to buff that person.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather put IoS on four Clerics than argue about it. YMMV.</div></div><hr />

&quot;/rs %t is resisting slow.  A lot.  Don't be discouraged as its only a matter of time before slow lands.  In the meantime, us shaman suggest you increase your healing speeds, and tanks, please increase your AC and avoidance.  Thank you, and have a nice day.&quot;<br />

<br />
Well said! We have one cleric that repeatedly asks for Wunshi; the rest are perfectly happy with their IOS. Besides, it's quick and painless to cast IOS. They're happy, minimal mana cost, minimal time spent. Happy campers all 'round. <br />
