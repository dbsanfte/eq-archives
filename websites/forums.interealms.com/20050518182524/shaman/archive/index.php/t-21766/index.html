<br />
<br />
&quot;sony shot the shaman, but he did not shoot the deputy&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They do?<br />
<br />
I can't find neither.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
yes they do, not all the spells are listed on lucy, just most, but they do have a desease slow, and the debuff is being worked on.<br />
<br />
 i wonder if sony will make a replacement character program...<br />
<br />
trade my shaman in for a similarly equip/flagged beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What's your source if the spells aren't listed on Lucy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No offense, but none of the normal channels of information supports your claims.  Are you a dev or something, that would explain your inside knowledge of &quot;what is being worked on&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have inside info and are talking with devs .. tell them to knock it off already.  Give the beastlord something OTHER than better versions of our spell lines already geezuz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My 2c is not to even look at other classes new spells until they are pretty much live. What matters is that shaman are upgraded correctly relative to the new content.  I can't remember who said it but &quot;keep your eye on the ball&quot;  is appropriate.<br />
<br />
Now at the end of the day (ie: September) maybe it is time to re-roll if you so desire.<br />
