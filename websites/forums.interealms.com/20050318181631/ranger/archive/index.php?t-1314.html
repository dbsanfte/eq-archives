Thanks! :)</div></div><hr />

Several rangers, including our fearless leader Sunmoon with a distinctive sun and moon logo, wear their tattoos proudly, marked for prosperity and most likely as long as they live.  One of the more impressive was a lunar landscape, very realistic, born by one of the rangers that has retired, Cadthe.<br />
<br />
Personally the concept gives me the willies, why would you want to go through a fair amount of pain (for some tattoos, not all) to brand yourself forever?  But thats just my conservative side showing.  Its your body, do with it as you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aegien</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.trance-atlantic.co.uk/cgi-bin/ids/index.cgi?mode=album&amp;album=./Ceiran%27s%20Tattoo<br />

This is a little documentary of a peice that i got done on my back a while back. I actually have had more work done since then and my back will someday be complete (Will be 90% covered at complete).<br />
<br />
I'm actually a tat fanatic. The sensation varies from person to person. I describe it as an annoying feeling, where I'd just like to smack the fk out of the area being done while it's being done. I wouldn't describe it as a pain as much as a bother. I have work over very sensitive areas, spine, shoulder blade, inner arm, etc... Even on the inner side of my arm it tickled more than it was a pain.<br />
<br />
I will forwarn you however to eat a good meal before going in. If you're blood sugar is too low you can pass out quite easily. It's nothing to be embarrassed about, I know many people that it's happened to, including myself ;). Also don't tense up - just relax and let the artist do their work. Tensing up can cause delays and if you tense up in the area where the peice is to be set you can do some irrepairible damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my back, upper left shoulder area.  Its a sun, very cool colors (yellows and oranges mixed in).  <br />
<br />
The experience was fine for me, I went with a friend who has several from the same place.  We knew it was safe, I was able to find what I wanted and boom.  <br />
<br />
I suppose it is a little intimidating, but I didnt really have trouble with it.  The pain, while not pleasant, is certainly bearable.  I dont remember it being bad at all.  I guess that depends on where you get it tho huh ;)<br />
<br />
Bottom line is:<br />
1. Make sure you want one.<br />
2. Make sure you dont &quot;settle&quot; for something you dont really like<br />
3. Make sure it's a safe, reputable place.<br />
<br />
Interesting note, while we were there a girl came in to get her belly-button peirced. ... Now THAT looked painfull!   Anyway she was cool.  She came up to me, looked at my back and said:<br />
<br />
Her  &quot;Oh what a cute pink bunny!&quot;<br />
Me &quot;WHAT?!&quot;<br />
Her &quot; Haha just kidding, the sun looks great, I love the colors.&quot;<br />
My Friend &quot;BWAHAHA! &quot;<br />
<br />
We dated for a few months hehe.  Hmm I need to call her =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is an American Flag, with shaded ripples, and a realistic looking drop of blood descending from the lower right corner.  I don't think anybody needs help understanding what it symbolizes.<br />
<br />
I got it from this guy:<br />
<br />
www.inklinestudio.com<br />
<br />
And believe me, once you see his work, you will not be satisfied with anything less.  He is, to put it mildly, a genius.  He required a consultation BEFORE setting the appointment, and we took over an hour to discuss what I wanted, browse visuals on the web, etc.  He did the tat freehand (Wish I had a digital camera to show how it came out).<br />
<br />
As far as the nitty gritty - everybody is different, but mine took about an hour, maybe a bit more.  Pain was mild...like a cat scratch or sunburn...but when he stopped the needle, the pain ebbed immediately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sionach</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have one on each ankle; the left hurt FAR more than the right, even though the right is a &quot;bracelet&quot; style that goes across my Achilles Tendon.  The artist that did the right side and some touchup on the left said that most people will have more sensitivity on one side of the body than the other &amp; it's frequently related to which is the primary hand (I'm right handed).<br />
<br />
For an idea of what it feels like (or at least what it felt like for me), go get an Epilady and try it on your lower leg.  Yes, I'm talking about that torture device that was used for removing leg-hair by many masochistic women in the late 80's (myself included).  ;)  Seriously, that's probably about the best comparison I could come up with.  It's not horrifically unbearable, but it's not exactly pleasant either (I think Aegien is just blessed with thick skin).<br />
<br />
Have fun with it and *don't* drink alcohol or take pain killers before going to get it done (thins the blood and makes you bleed more).  Oh, and if you walk in to the tattoo parlour and it doesn't &quot;feel&quot; right, find someplace else to go.  :)</div></div><hr />

I'm curious, how big and much did your tatoo cost? It doesnt really give you any idea how much this stuff costs on the website.</div></div><hr />

I decided exactly what I want, but I was leary on choosing an artist, I think I'll truck over to this guy!  I live in CT so it may be tough, but a person this thorough cant be bad. ;)  Plus it's a small tatoo I'm thinking of, on my hand around my thumb and down the back of my hand a bit, so it shouldnt be too too expensive. . .<br />
<br />
*wanders off thinking of the possibilities*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duffwin</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am also tattooed. It started 15 years ago, when I was instructor in the army. I was young and easy to impress. And since most of my comrades were tattooed, it took not long till I was too.<br />
<br />
Well, I left army. But again I was in the company of tattooed people, because I became singer in a rockband.<br />
So two years later I was longhaired and had lotta tattoos (all on my arms).<br />
<br />
Motives include:<br />
<br />
 the face of Jesus (tattooed freehand by one of the best tattoo artists in Vienna back then)<br />
 one Motorhead logo*<br />
 the Twisted Sister logo (from the LP Stay Hungry)<br />
 a dragon<br />
 a laughing skull (with the words Twisted Forever around)<br />
 a rose<br />
 some comics (Donald Duck, the Ghostrider 2999)<br />
 a winged demon raping a longhaired woman (on the right shoulder)<br />
<br />
<br />
I never regretted it. And I plan to get some more.<br />
You know, every tattoo describes a certain part of my life. It is like carrying a diary with you. So I will sooner or later get a EQ tattoo too, since this game influenced my life very strong.<br />
<br />
Of couse here are still people, that think you got tattooed in prison. Tattoos play no role in our culture, unlike in Asia. And they are not as accepted as in the UK.<br />
But I guess, sooner or later this will change. With all the young people wearing tattoos/piercings as a fashion statement.<br />
<br />
<br />
* Motorhead England of course! They suck, since they moved to the States. Playing ballads and kicked Philthy out, bah. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashezen</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was actually thinking of getting some ivy tattoed on my left shoulder, as a tribute to both my fiance (Ivymayden), my Ranger, and my love of nature in general. It would be ivy with hard-shapes, I imagine, with a sort of celtic design to it. Now I just have to figure out how the heck to draw that out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jellical</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2, one on each shoulderblade.  The one on my left is 2 roses, 3 hearts, and it's not done yet.. couldn't find an artist who could do freehand calligraphy small enough to put my daughters name in the ribbons around the hearts.  The second, on my right shoulder, I had done more recently, and it's a tribal style panther.  I designed both of them, and both were free.. because I had a couple other designs that I traded to the artist, both were original, and both have become pretty popular.  If you have a decent background in art, some parlors will trade you tattoo work for your art, provided that it's original, and you don't want huge works of art that will take hours of work.  Both of my tattoos would normally have cost in the 60 to 70 dollar range.  Neither one was painful, and I noticed that after about 5 minutes, my shoulders seemed to just go numb, so I couldn't feel the needle.  This was a good thing to me, heh.  Anyhow, make sure you know what you want, and make sure that you pick someone who is not only liscenced, but keeps a clean work area.  Its better to be safe than sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auriane</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 3, one on each arm and one on my back going from my right shoulder blade down and across to my waist. The ones on my arms are snakes coiled around about 3 times like a bracelet will do, the one on my back is a phoenix/traditional firebird with its head on the shoulder and the tail going all the way down to my waist. The back one took about 4 sittings of around 2 hours each but he did it freehand in reds, oranges, golds, and whites and it looks amazing according to friends (wish I had a pic) it was worth it and the pain was minimal. The inner arms hurt more then my back but that is to be expected since the skin is thinner there</div></div><hr />

I don't have any tats, but while I agree that ASPIRIN should be avoided as a painkiller for the reason stated above, I don't see why Tylenol would be a problem... it is a nerve-deadener rather than an anti-inflamatory and has no blood-thinning properties that I know of. Anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sionach</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Picky picky.  :p<br />
<br />
To clarify; most NON-Aspirin painkillers should be fine to use prior to getting a tattoo.  Aleve (Naproxen sodium) is a safe one to use.  Acetaminophen (Tyelonol) and Ibuprofen (Motrin), are probably fine as well, but you may wish to check with your artist beforehand and get feedback from them.<br />
<br />
Sorry for any confusion.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duffwin</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh please, for god's sake, you do not need painkillers for getting tattooed. You ever graze your knee/elbow? That is the same injury (only skin, not flesh).<br />
It is really not that bad. Shoulder especially is like a massage. Of course there are more sensible places, like the inside of the forearm. I have both tattooed (and looked like Popeye for some days), but I still live. ;-)<br />
<br />
Don't drink is a good advice, makes you bleed stonger. The poster above is right.<br />
<br />
I don't know the atmosphere in American tattoo studios, but where I was, there usually ran loud music* and we smoked (a lot). So everyone was relaxed and the whole experience was not painful at all, but great.<br />
You most likely keep your tattoo for the rest of your life, so you should remember the process of getting it, no?<br />
<br />
*Guns'n' Roses is excellent tattoo music.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunmoon</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Duffwin.. try not to simplify it too much :) It's not like a little scrape.. it's a constant pain for 45 minutes to an hour and a half. For some people, it hurts more than others. To me, it was tolerable, but extremely uncomfortable. It also depends on where you get it done on the body. Areas with fatty tissue hurt considerably less than areas like the ankle, or elbow, or nerve concentrated areas like the lower back and chest.<br />
<br />
Here is a picture of my tattoo. It took an hour and 15 minutes and cost 130 bucks in Daytona Beach in '95 for a reference.<br />

I tried a nude beach a couple times, but my skin is way too pale to do that.  Burned badly in places I don't care to mention.  Yes, putting on sunscreen (just doesn't last long enough and you never get full coverage) with a significant other can be an erotic experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell being the army almost everyone that has served in some type of field unit has one.<br />
The main thing I can tell you is... Make sure it means something not just some dumb logo that looks cool.<br />
It has to mean something to you. I have a Arm bnad with a designs through and then above that I have a Tribal Sun. Both have a meaning. I enjoy having them alot.<br />
Most people dont know I have them but when they do see them its fun telling them what they mean and were I got them.<br />
I got the Sun while I was stationed in FT. Polk LA 2nd ACR 3rd Squadron (All Criminal Regiment ;) ) And the Band I had already drawn up and had done in Hungry Budipist (or Budifest ;)) with a bunch of Canadian SF guys. <br />
