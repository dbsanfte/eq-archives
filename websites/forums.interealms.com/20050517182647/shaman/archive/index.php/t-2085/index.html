<br />
 Please only post on this thread when you have a result.   If you raid NToV regularly it would help if you started trying to slow with CHA buffed as Roy's AE will dispell you.  Also since this test will run for awhile, post your results from multiple raids  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Valid tests will include (incomplete data will not be evaluated)<br />
The target:  Aaryonar  <br />
Your level<br />
Your race<br />
Your charisma at the time of the spell cast<br />
Your charisma at the time of the spell landed<br />
How many times you were resisted<br />
How many attempts to land the spell you made<br />
What debuffs are on Roy<br />

*Thantu or Sunmoon, could you please sticky this for about 6-8 weeks?  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure if this is a joke or not:confused: <br />
There is alot of variables that would need to be tracked as well.<br />
You would also need to know what debuffs are in for sure. Malo, Malosini, Tashxxx, bard songs plus AA skills plus instrument, bard tash?.<br />
As for his AE, you just avoid or resist it.<br />
Why don't you pick a target that is quicker then a 1 week spawn?<br />
<br />
Edit: oh yah, bitch at me cause I'm not posting any stats pertinent to said target. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've participated in at least 10 Aary kills. My CHA was high because I buffed it to prevent the AE to scrap my C3 but as soon as Aary hit it's first AE, CHA buff was gone. Most of the fights it took very extensive debuffing to slow it (Malo, Sini, OOS + Tash). And we lost once because 3 shamans couldn't slow it. Without at least Malo, SK taps don't land, wich should give you an idea of it's magic resistance. Funny thing though, last time a troll shaman with much lower CHA than myself slowed it easy. CHA effecting spells vs Aary test is futile because his AE will kill it and because of the extreme high MR. Do it regulary vs any ancient wyvern, drake, wyrm whatever to test it. Also doing tests on Statue or any other NToV dragon for that matter.<br />
<br />
The only time I buff my CHA is for mobs like Aaary or AL who got mana affecting AE that removes C3. Of course I never had trouble slowing anything. Some mobs like Aary are damn hard to slow but doable. And CHA effects it in 0 ways.<br />
<br />
And on the same note, I watched a troll shaman with much lower CHA slow NToV mobs without Malosini on them without any  problems. At the same time, I had much higher CHA and was failing. Thanks to a random number generator. The only dragon I ever had trouble slowing was Aary, rest of slowable NToV is a piece of cake with very ****ty CHA.<br />
<br />
And no I don't have any hard evidence, especially since shamans with Eye/Brains from Cazic have no trouble debuffing either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This post is meant as tracking, not opinions.<br />
<br />
Opinions can be posted in the other cha thread here, this post is merely Wildaar's attempt to sort out opinions from truth.<br />
<br />
I would like to see the results, so whenever someone does the testing keep us posted =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oaklanbash_Vaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, I remember doing these kind of discussions with Wildaar back during the days him and I were doing our epic at the same time, both waiting for the dog in CoM to spawn.  I do not have any hard numbers to post, so feel free to delete this post.  But I will tell you this.  I usualyl have 35 charisma, and never even bother to buff it, and I have zero problems slowing any mobs after malo and tash and oos have landed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Last night, vs Aary:<br />
<br />
Charisma of 122 (using Unfailing Reverence--yes, my Cha sucks otherwise).<br />
<br />
3 attempts on Slow, all failed. Other two shaman on raid also failed repeatedly, until we all got AoEed and could no longer try.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Aary owned us :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">this way of tracking will be utterly pointless and show nothing :)<br />
theres just too many variables.<br />
which debuffs in is one thing, but even the debuffs themselves arent all static(occlusion will vary alot from bard to bard)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Benorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had a wussy Hill Giant resist slow with 80CHA,   that mean anything :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I slowed a moss snake with CHA of 92. Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This thread is a joke, right?<br />
<br />
You need to do your tests with the same mob, and get a base sample set before you start varying your charisma.  Also, the number of samples that you get has to be large so as to have a reasonable confidence whether a variance outside of standard deviations for the sample set size is reasonably expected or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you want to test charisma effects, test it on yourself.<br />
<br />
Some people are missing the point here though. The hypothesis should not be that Charisma will enable you to slow an unslowable mob, neither should it be that high Charisma will make you slow very MR mobs without the need of debuffs. <br />
All the hypothesis should be saying is that higher Charisma reduces resists by X.<br />
Charisma can not replace any debuffs, it &quot;could&quot; make you get resisted only 50 out of 100 tries when slowing a mob like Aaryonar, while somebody else with a significant lower charisma<br />
would get resisted 60 times on 100 attempts on said mob with the same debuffs on.<br />
<br />
Anyways, testing this on any mobs won't help in finding the answer. Test it on yourself, an even con with MR you can view and decide yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I slowed your wonderful Aaryonar this weekend.  It landed right after Malosini. <br />
My char?  A normal 72. <br />
<br />
Bard played OOS nicely and all debuffs were done on time and in order that time.  Had a hell of a time with that dragon before people got off their asses and did things right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">4 Aary fights in 2 days. Server up, server down, server up...you get the idea.<br />
<br />
All the time:<br />
77 CHA Troll shaman.<br />
71 CHA Barbarian shaman.<br />
58 CHA Barbarian shaman.<br />
<br />
77 Troll landed slow before Malosini two times, 3 resists on slow (not sure if malosini was on or not).<br />
71 Barbarian failed 7 Malosinies in 4 fights, 4 slows landed no resists after Malosini, didn't try to slow no Malosini.<br />
58 Barbarian landed slow with Malosini.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Why not try this on Dagarn? He's hard to slow and doesn't dispel Cha buffs. Plus it's safer to test on him, as you don't have to worry about being AE'd and losing all your mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We killed a few dagarns the last 3 days, no problems slowing it. However SKs in my guild tell me that Aary without Malo or Tash isn't even tappable, wich indicates insane MR. Dagarn however is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No matter what the MR is, if a mob isn't immune, it should be tappable unless you fight a dragon and stand outside of melee range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That's what I thought also Giac. Might not be the case. Some mobs also require ID for disease SK taps to land, at least I was asked to ID a mob because disease taps weren't landing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We always slow Aary much faster than we slow Dagarn. I've never heard of either of them being untappable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Okay, I'll play.<br />
<br />
Roy fight number 1:<br />
<br />
1. Cha buffed to 120 because of stupid dot<br />
2. Malo, malosini, tash<br />
3. Three shaman (all barbs with Cha buffs) attempt slows, all fail<br />
<br />
Roy fight number 2:<br />
1. Cha buffed to 120 because of stupid dot<br />
2. Malo, tash, OOS (bard showed up), malosini<br />
3. I was resisted, but another barb shaman with cha buff managed to slow and reslow successfully<br />
<br />
Cha didn't seem to do a damn thing, but the OOS was nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Pretty conclusive as far as it can be. <br />
Char has exactly zero effect on resist rate of slows.<br />
Just like we thought.<br />
<br />
I will agree with Jing that Aary is a lousy lousy test mob.  You get maybe 2 or 3 (max) times to attempt slow on him, and then he's either slowed or all the shamans are OOM and you're gonna die anyway.  <br />
<br />
That's when I bust out the chardok slow stick and try to stick a Togor's proc.  It's better than just giving up eh?<br />
<br />
Aary is a big old bitch, I hate her.</div></div><hr />

That's what I thought also Giac. Might not be the case. Some mobs also require ID for disease SK taps to land, at least I was asked to ID a mob because disease taps weren't landing. <br />
<br />
Do you remember which mob that was by chance, and if the disease taps were actually landing after ID, 'cause this sounds interesting. <br />
Wondering if tap resist checks are the same for Magic and DR or if Poison and Disease are totally different from Magic/Fire/Cold. Always wondered why disease and poison nukes were all &quot;all or nothing&quot; type of nukes(correct me if am wrong, not 100% sure if BST and Necro lines are *all* that way), while you can get partial resists on pure Magic/Fire/Cold nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My hypothesis is that ...<br />
<br />
Taps are unresistable at X resist. Some mobs have bigger resist than X thus immune to taps. So if you can debuff the mob to X or lower than X resist, than taps will land. Again, hypothesis and no proof.<br />
<br />
The ST golems (FA, MotG and Progenitor) are apparently not disease tappable and need ID to be tappable. I was suprised when my SK friend asked me to ID The Progenitor so he can torrent it. Do disease taps work differently than magic taps? No one knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">*shrug*<br />
<br />
I've had slows resisted by Roy at 120 Cha and slows landing at 10 cha (actually put on -cha gear). I see no difference.<br />
<br />
I like using Cha as a crap buff though, so usually I have it on most of the time.</div></div><hr />

WHY DO I NEED CHARISMA?<br />
<br />
Spoke with GZ this morning regarding Charisma and its effect in relation to resists.<br />
<br />
In summary Charisma effects the resists of Charms, Mesmerises and Blur-Type Spells across all classes.<br />
<br />
Charisma will not lower resist rates of debuff spells, slow spells, direct damage spells, or DoT's. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Went to SF.  Had my monk buddy pull various mobs -mostly wurms, mature wurms, drakes, and various sperms.  Had CHA buffed to 130 whole time.  Casted slow 24 times that night, resisted once.  All mobs dark blue at lvl 55.<br />
<br />
This is not a great example, for most mobs there have low MR.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Went to SG, was on Cripple duty.  Had CHA at 78.  Crippled was resisted on various mobs 6 times in a row.  Casted CHA buff on myself and brought it up to 130.  Had Cripple land 13 out of the next 14 tries.  Casting at level 55 as well.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Both of these examples are not scientific in nature and when I get back I'll attempt at providing better, concrete data.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Lexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">When I use charisma on your basic blue to yellow mobs in a normal grouping situation, I get a much lower resist rate when I have charisma buff up.  My resist rate is also goes up, the lower level slow I use, unless a chanter is tashing. I try to balance my mana and my clerics mana utilitzation, so If I am running at 30 percent mana and him at 80+ percent, ill drop down 1 lvl in slows. so I can have more mana for emergency heals, roots, poison dots, or what ever else is needed.<br />
<br />
All of this may be a coincidence, but I have had better luck slowing with a charisma buff up. (My charisma is 92 when its up)<br />
<br />
A lot of stats have break points at 75, 100, 135 etc. So charisma may have 1 at 75 and then 125 or so. Never can tell. Answer may not be linear.</div></div><hr />

Proof? Logs?  <br />
<br />
Sorry, not going to go with a &quot;gut feeling&quot; on this.</div></div><hr />
