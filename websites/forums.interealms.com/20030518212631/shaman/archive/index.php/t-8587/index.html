<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First, let me sat without Malosini, Epic, BoN, ID and Plague, I would NOT do this.  Also a Horse and KEI is important and if you can't buy the KEI, again I wouldn't do it.<br />

PoN, on Treants, I was getting about 3% a kill, on a 4 minute kill at 57 and 58.  59 it slows down considerably, but, still half decent.<br />
Just go north there are 3 static spawns there plus a raven/bat you'll first see.  Do NOT pull the named Treant, he'll beat you like a redheaded stepchild.  Just Malosi to pull, root, slow, ID, epic, disease then Bane/Epic/Disease as you need to.  Try not to run TOO much as  you lose med time if you move on horseback.  Also, bring a lot of food.<br />
<br />
At 59 it slows some (1%ish a kill)and I think I'm going to head back to Katta or somewhere similar and pound on guards or maybe Permapits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Replica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think you are overrating the necessity of gear for camping these spawns.  i camped them at 56, no epic, no fungi, no horse, and i was missing BoN.  i just pulled with slow, malosi, then crippled.  they then swing too slow to interrupt casting,  use pet (HoS and Haste), Plague, E-bolt, and JBB.  by the way, 3% a kill is not a realistic number for the exp progression.. you saying that youre getting ~ blue bubble a kill, that means i only have to kill 33 for my level?  i soloed there for 3 1/2 hours, on top of all 3 spawns when they spawned, and netted about the normal exp rate for soloing,  yellow an hour.  anyway, thanks for reminding me of this place, just left it alone for a while do to PoN being overcamped for a short period of time, and the addiction to Wacraft3 im fighting :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taoxek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solod those mobs at 53, With Epic and root dotting. Mobs were blue/even/yellow. Took 6-7 minutes to kill them though, but over 1% level exp per kill.</div></div><hr />
