of the Australian equivalent of the Workers' Compensation board. This is a true<br />
story. Had this guy died, he'd have received a Darwin Award for sure....<br />
<br />
Dear Sir &quot;I am writing in response to your request for additional<br />
information in Block 3 of the accident report form. I put &quot;poor planning&quot; as the cause of my<br />
accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be<br />
sufficient.<br />
<br />
I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working<br />
alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work, I<br />
found that I had some bricks left over which, when weighed later, were found<br />
<br />
to be slightly in excess of 500 lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by<br />
hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was<br />
attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor.<br />
<br />
Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel<br />
out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope,<br />
holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks. You will note in<br />
Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135lbs.<br />
<br />
Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost<br />
my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I<br />
proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of<br />
the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding downward at<br />
an equal, impressive speed. This explained the fractured skull, minor<br />
abrasions and the broken collar bone, as listed in section 3 of the accident report<br />
form.<br />
<br />
Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the<br />
fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley.<br />
Fortunately, by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to<br />
hold tightly to the rope, in spite of beginning to experience a great deal<br />
of pain.<br />
<br />
At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the<br />
ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of<br />
the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50lbs. I refer you again to my<br />
weight. As you can imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side of<br />
the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming<br />
up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and several<br />
lacerations of my legs and lower body.<br />
<br />
Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel<br />
seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of<br />
bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked. I am sorry to<br />
report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to<br />
move, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and<br />
I lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me.<br />
This explains the two broken legs.<br />
<br />
They settled his claim...</div></div><hr />
