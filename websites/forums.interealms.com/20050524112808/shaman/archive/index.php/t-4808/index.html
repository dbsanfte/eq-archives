<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Those that see me respond to &quot;need exp at somelevelover53, where to go&quot; threads know I have a fondness toward Chardok.  Nice exp modifier, plenty of mobs, and several areas to go to if you want to camp something.  In addition, its a nice zone to try non standard groups.<br />
<br />
Case and point Sunday:<br />
Rogue<br />
Rogue<br />
Mage<br />
Warrior<br />
Druid (54)<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
All 60 except the druid and maybe the mage.  We moved down to Herbalist with minimal problems, then moved past the Overseer? spawn.  From there, we decided to try to keep going around the corner.<br />
<br />
Just past Overseer is an alchove with 3 Tortured Iksar somethings, big skeletons that are highly MR, hit for a ton, and you get all of them unless you have an FD puller (which we didn't).  First time we saw them we didn't have one of the rogues or the mage, and we had to evac as the Warrior was about to die.  Second time, both the druid and myself got cooked.  Only got one slowed, and our healing was barely able to keep the warrior up.  As we went down, the melees and the mage cleaned up the others.  We got rezzed and decided not to mess with them again.<br />
<br />
We couldn't find any information on this encounter, and were just curious if anyone had any information to share about them.  We intend to go back, but we will need at least one more healer as well as either an FD puller, or an Enchanter, or a Bard, to help control the pull.  Its possible we could AE it, but that would require a completely different group.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

As an aside I love everything about chardok but the pathing, I love the herbie camp.  I can make potions on the fly there :)</div></div><hr />
