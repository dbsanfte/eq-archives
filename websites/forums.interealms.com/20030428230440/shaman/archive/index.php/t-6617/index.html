<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I've saved up 20K plat.  ANd I've got an FBSS and a Barbed Ringmail tunic to throw in also.  Total about 25-27K plat depending on how you value those 2 items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I know.  It's seems almost criminal!  There were 2 JBBs in the bazaar Mon night.  one for 30K, and one for 50K.  Later the 50K got lowered to 35K.  Then the 30K one sold.<br />
<br />
I tried to talk the remaining trader down, but he wouldn't budge.  He wasn't rude about it, he just knew that he could get his price.  he probably did, too.  I haven't been able to get back on the check.<br />
<br />
Switching servers would be more attractive, but my small guild is about half RL friends from all over the US.  Maybe when they all leave for Star Wars Galaxies, I'll think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grrr!  Missed a JBB in the bazaar last night by about an hour!<br />
<br />
I now have 27K in plat and a barbed ringmail (no one will buy it at 3500pp).   someone sell me a JBB!</div></div><hr />
