<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK it's time to get this rolling.  The druids already showed us up by figuring out the Pure Blood quest in good time.  We still haven't got a clue about Stoicism tho.  I know I will never use this spell but I'm willing to put in some time looking for how to make it.  What I am asking is that you, my fellow posters, use this thread for discussion on solving the Stoicism quest.  Keep in mind that tradeskills might enter into the finished product.  Alchemy is suspect in particular.  <br />
<br />
ok . . . . GO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This has already been done and discussed.  it is currently bugged and the quest mob is permakilled on my server at least.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Bring me the empty&quot; something or other<br />

I tried a few things and got no where</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That is the stoicism quest you need to bring the water mental an empty flask from a drunken pirate in dulak.<br />
<br />
The problem is at the moment well at least before it was permakilled you would hand its thing and try to fire off the second part of the quest and it didn't trigger correctly. So it was uncompletable the gms killed the quest mob to keep people from losing their flasks.<br />
<br />
As soon as this mob is fixed basically hand in flask to mob and from the sounds of the text fight a couple of mobs that spawn and hand in what they drop for the spell.<br />

I agree, I used to think this was one of the better boards, but I see more and more people flaming and trolling.</div></div><hr />

Well that's kinda cynical.  I mean, we all benefit directly or indirectly from the advice and experience of others.<br />
<br />
Inform the uninformed, assist the needy, be polite at a minimum and kind when possible.  Civility is a worthy goal.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, flames serve no purpose regardless of the context.  They serve only to encourage the attention-hungry, who should rather be ignored.  And ultimately they drive out everyone of quality, leaving behind only the human debris.<br />
<br />
One need only visit the Torv board to witness this lamentable outcome.</div></div><hr />

If you've got your flask, the hardest bit is done - drops off the drunks in dulak's harbour for those who don't know - in the huts to the right as you enter the zone is where i got mine, took a few hours<br />
<br />
go to the spirit at the back of the inside of the upturned ship hull (pos 690 neg 150 if memory serves - i marked it on the map so i could find it again easily) and talk to it, give it the flask, it gives you a rock - talk a bit more, hand it the rock back<br />
<br />
at the opening to the ship hill spawns 2 tiny elementals &quot;flotsam&quot; and &quot;jetsam&quot; - they agro immediately - kill them, loot their no drop items and hand them into the spirit, spirit returns spell: stoicism<br />
<br />
the battle here was utterly trivial to a 47 shaman and 55 beastlord<br />
<br />
the spell itself is extremely cool and the effect draws lots of oohs and aaahs from people who havent seen it before <br />
<br />

info is spot on.  the quest is a cakewalk, and let me tell you how much i love stoicism at 55.   :D <br />
<br />
canni down to 100hp and close to full mana, and presto eight ticks later (two casts) and i'm at full health and full mana.  i simply can't imagine topor/canni5 . . .   <br />
