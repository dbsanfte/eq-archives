<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kazgal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow shamans, <br />
<br />
I have a few questions:<br />
<br />
1. In BoT what is the spawntimer on the lvl 64 and 65 named?<br />
<br />
2. In PoT what is the spawntime on the lvl 65 Overseer? (for the chain BP)<br />
<br />
3. Anyone have any tactics on the Overseer on how to take him down?<br />
<br />
4. If you zone into Plane of Growth are you swamped with adds not just  the mob at zone in?<br />
<br />
5. Is it safe to grind in Plane of Hate since the revamp?<br />
<br />
6. If you max your AA points Anything special happen?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks heaps,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2) I think 8 hours? maybe not<br />
<br />
3)  lots and lots of heals, you used to be able to use charmpets to tank him, but I believe that got nerfed.  quads for 1600 and rampage if I'm not mistaken.  take a decent warrior, lots of damage, and a few clerics.<br />
<br />
4)  The two protectors of growth have zonewide aggro again, respawn every 30 mins, they will attack you if you zone in, other than that, I believe it is safe to zone in invis<br />
<br />
<br />
6) no special bonuses or anything, but having every AA is something special in itself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">6) Nothing special happens, but if you have 30 saved up you get this Wounderful big block of RED text that spams you, Every time you zone! Warning you about how your aa exp will not be saved and how you must spend points now!  Althought there is nothing to buy....<br />
<br />
<br />
Should be a gold name =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. 64 named have placeholders (kriegers) and have the same spawn tme as generic mobs. 65 named spawn every 6 hours.<br />
<br />
3. Ranged damage + lots of healing or charm and lots of healing.<br />
<br />
4. No, as long as your invisible and not on a horse. However lots of mobs can roam past there, but nothing like pofear.<br />
<br />
5. Apparently, but the xp may not be any good<br />
<br />
6. Nope.<br />
