<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use warrior for GW - no emp exp - tunnels freak me out.<br />

can keep the taunt easily, FD, snare, and takes a beating pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For gw I personally like a well equipped monk. For emp farming either ranger or druid. Although I bot emp with my cleric sometimes and that works plenty good the stun knockback useful for placing mobs so they dont gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Farina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have used a 60 paladin. Paladin can pull GW with force and keep good aggro while i malosini and then slow. With this combo I have killed over 70 + GW's and seen only 2 shaman drops.  I got tigir's and voice. however i did get some rare wizard and druid stuff and sold for profits totalling 100k+.  Still no malo and torpor though  :( <br />
I pull to behind the VP entrance and ususally dont get adds. The only mob you have to look out for is chromos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd suggest camping emp solo at 61. At 61 I soloed emp for torpor. He dropped torpor on my 15th emp kill. Look up the soloing guild in tactics forums. As far as partners you want to get decent tank for GW's and any class will help with Emp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hagle, did you &quot;solo&quot; him or 2 box him with a snaring toon? most people that claim to solo him actually play two or more characters at once while killing emp. that's not soloing. i tried soloing him , killed him a few times but had to gate a lot. his ability to gate, even when you keep him near his spawn is a pain without a snaring class with u.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you can give your pet a serrated bone dirk to be able to proc snare.<br />
<br />
those weapon can be find in bazaar,ranging from 50 to 120 plats.<br />
<br />
you can add a gnoll lariat (very cheap) to add stun procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barelil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No matter what class you want to partner with for the Emp, you will still need to add a rogue to open the doors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Plus the rogue will hand the SBD back if they don't need it, or they will bring their own =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, any good damage dealer works.  I've done it with each melee.  It's more work if you have a rogue, tho, just because of some of the ungodly amounts of damage they can do.  You have to fight to regain agro sometimes.<br />
<br />
&quot;***?  Plague, Bane, and Ebolt on a slowed &amp; crippled mob, and he's not wanting to kill ME?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the best partner for GWurms is a bard.  The bard can track, pull, and chains til you land your malosini turgur cripple.  Then the bard can tank for you and be torpored and not be angry because he will be doing most of his damage with dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yer level 61? Why do you want a partner?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Because as hard as I try, I cannot seem to kill 'em  :D  No malo / torpor / pox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I solo ie no one but me and dogdog there. Only have had trouble with Blood of chottle haha. He get out of room then summon me out and I not have rogue so I had to gate/die and have CR from hell. I do have spirit call which helps a ton. What I do is wait till Emp is down to 40 % then stack all I mean ALL of my dots on him cast spirit call and make sure he's rooted in the no gate zone and have root on my trigger button. Look up the soloing guilde it gives alot more info. I have never had Emp gate on me. I do this 100 % alone. I dont use any form of snare either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i was so worried spirit call would push emp back to the skeleton guards next to his spawn spot (agroing them). but it seems to work good. i know what you mean about blood, he likes to run and if he makes it outside the door it's gate time. been there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Key to Emp is positioning him right so pets push him back into no gate zone and pin him there and keeping root on him when his hps get low. Forgot to add to that you realy should have dogdog tank him. Just makes things easier. Here's link to Emp chottal soloing guide:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">good point , thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>gryyfindergirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Gotta throw my 2CP in here. I'm not a shamen (yet). I am a mage, trolling the shaman boards cause I am about to make an alt. I play with a 61 shammy, and he loves it. Air pet for stunning/casters, earth for chain rooting/tanking, Insane DPS with water pet backstabbing, and fire pet for, eh, eh, wasting spell book space :). And that isn't figuring the 80+dps I can sustain most of the time in an XP group. (not counting pet DPS in that.) Geryn (my shaman friend) pulls, slows, I send pet in, chain nuke it down, we loot. He can solo GW's, but it takes like 20-30 mins, cut that down to at least half with me (and I was only 51 at the time). Don't overlook us mages, you guys have defensive/buffing/healing down pat, we have damage like almost no other class. <br />
<br />
<br />
Side note, making my shammy tonight. Thinking Barb, cause I like the look of them, and I get a free set of Cultural armor from my friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">no more barb shammies plz. i beg you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>gryyfindergirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">was thinking ogre, but  a free set of the lower barb cultural is hard to pass up!</div></div><hr />
