<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Color me N00b, but I figured there were about 10 online games: EQ, DAOC, SWG, FF11, Realm, Ultima, Meridian 59, Sims, Toon-something, Lineage and may be one or two more.<br />
<br />
Then I saw on GU Comics that Warhammer Online had been cancelled.<br />
<br />
Did a Google.  WOW!<br />

That's a lot of games OUT and in development.</div></div><hr />

Good list. Thanks!!!</div></div><hr />

Yeah, there's a whole bunch.</div></div><hr />

dosnt have Vanguard on it<br />
the game im most looking forward to</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am sorry to hear that Warhammer Online has been cancelled.  It is not my cup of tea, but I it looked like a lot of work had already gone into it.<br />
<br />
I recognize many of the titles on that list as vaporware that has been around for 5 or 6 years.  My guess it that there are probably only about 15 or so online games that could truly be considered Massive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Vanguard is on both those lists. On Faern's list it's just called Saga of Heroes, and it's misclassified as a Super Hero game. On the mmorpg.com list it's at the bottom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not sure where they got the ratings but CoH had the highest rating, And it is a blast to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It seems that there are proportionally as many bad MMO's as there are bad offline games...<br />
<br />
With MMO's its even more important to produce quality since MMO's has to last much longer.<br />
<br />
The future for MMO's seems to be getting more diverse, even if a few large are going to have a majority of the customers.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the best of the small companies will generate enough dough and have good enough devs to make them expand.<br />

Also from looking at the list above:<br />

Toon Town  	Children's MOG  	Disney  	Final  	Released <br />

I wonder how thats going to work out with trash-talk and adults trying to get in contact with kids. It gives me a bad feeling...  :(</div></div><hr />

It's Disney Vig. (I'm a stockholder). They are very concerned with image and I imagine that not only are they policing that game VERY strictly, if they had any sense (note to Eisner - RESIGN), they'd be working with the FBI to catch those child wannabe contacting fektards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I beta tested Toontwon, and still have an actave account on their Test Server. Toontown is VERY kid safe, not only is there no death, Toons do not die, they just get sad and go to the playground until they are happy again.<br />
 The chat system is done from canned sayings you can select from. There is only one way to be able to type direct to some one, and that is if you are Secret Friends. Being a Secret Friend requires that Toon A get a code, and give it to Toon B. Toon B then enters it while on line and they are Secret Friends, BUT there is no way to pass the code Ingame, you must be able to connect out of game to do so. And with only the canned sayings to use, no way to set up a meeting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Im glad they have thought of those details. Thanks for the informaion guys :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Youre right, but the alternative might be child-molestation. I know what I would choose for a child-only game. Besides, after a few years, my would be kid could play a real MMO with me instead.<br />
<br />
But honestly, i wouldnt want my kids stuck on MMO's, i would like them to be running outside in the yard playing with wooden swords instead...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can't help feeling it would be better if kids actually met the child molester online than in real life. It's a safe environment for kids to fully realise that most people are decent, but there are people you must watch out for.<br />
<br />
Naturally I'd also back that up with education, long term logging, some automated text matching, a guaranteed secure link between subscriber and account and a certainty that complaints made against a player will be looked into. Might as well filter society at the same time. I'm pretty sure the child molesters probably aren't going to use something they know will be monitored anyway.<br />
<br />
Heck, I've no doubt there'd be more than a few players happy to pretend to be children just for the sheer pleasure of trying to catch the nutso's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That reminds me of a BBC documentary on TV i saw some time ago. A reporter feigned being a child over the internet, sent fake photos and stuff like that and the molester wanted a real-life meeting.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, the molester got more than he asked for when a news-team showed up to question him as to why he wanted intimate relations with minors...  :D Swedish TV3 also did similar things with peddy's. Nothing to turn a molester off like a brigade of reporters.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The American FBI (equivalent of MI5 for you Brit types iinm) actually does enter chat rooms et al for the expressed purpose of trying to catch child molestors.<br />
<br />
The ironical part is that prior to this, they actually enlist the help of young girls to come to the bureau and help the agents learn the lingo, who is &quot;hot&quot; and who is not et al.<br />
<br />
Quite funny to see 35 year old men and women getting into discussions with kids:<br />
<br />
Agent: &quot;Isn't Britney Spears popular?&quot;<br />
12 year old: &quot;Ewww, she is like so 5 minutes ago. As - IF.  Avril Levigne is the bomb!&quot;<br />
Agent: &quot;Bomb?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Toon Town Children's MOG Disney Final Released<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I wonder how thats going to work out with trash-talk and adults trying to get in contact with kids. It gives me a bad feeling... <br />
<br />
I have been extremely impressed with the interface design and ideas in ToonTown.  <br />
<br />
It's a great on-line game for children and it is a readily buffered.  <br />
<br />
My 8 year old wanted to play EQ, and initially she had a tremendous time running about.  I got her a drogmar, and an EB item and a couple of twink weapons and the next thing I know her High Elf was running about in West Karanas.  <br />
<br />
But some jerk started pestering her and wanted her to give him 1000 plat or something.  I saw the tail end of that, petitioned him and put him on ignore, but it worried me some.  <br />
<br />
So, we tried Toon Town, and she loved it.  It does have a buffered chat mechanism, where you select phrases from drop down menus.  It's not really a game any of us would want to play, but it's got it's own very dedicated core.  Two people can agree to &quot;special chat&quot; to each other also, but it requires entry of the parental password.  <br />
<br />
Clearly a lot of adults play too, given that my 40 year old wife is totally hooked.  She sees lots of &quot;Granny Smith&quot; and other names that appear to reflect adults.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, it's got a great design for children and lots of really creative interface tricks that I think are both easy and powerful - and that's a wonderful combination.</div></div><hr />
