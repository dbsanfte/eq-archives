<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else remember a satirical patch message (yeah, lots of em) that was from the future?  Had things in it like &quot;new characters start at level 50&quot; and they were down to 2 or 3 servers.  I can't remember any more, but do remember laughing quite a bit as a read it.<br />
<br />
I can't seem to find it in Search as it might be too old.  So, I am asking everyone about it on the off chance they have it saved or know exactly where it can be found.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think this might be the post you seek:<br />

It has a link in it to the fake patch/SOE update.<br />
<br />
Now I come to think of it, this is probably not the one you seek, sorry. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember that one!  But, not the one I was looking for.  The one I am looking for was posted like it was cut &amp; pasted from somewhere, like most patch messages.  I've scanned through what I found using Search (patch message) and couldn't find it.  Must be older than I thought, or I am not seeing it.  Oh well.</div></div><hr />
