<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just logged on to test to talk about new changes. Only three shaman at level 65 on test. Mayhap there will be more later, but that seems a light way to test the changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dirtnap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always thought you should be able to &quot;clone&quot; your main char to the test server, maybe not all the equipment.  LVL 25 just doesn't cut it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it's not like anyone listened to the shamans on test anyway.  I've always felt sorry for those folks, people on the boards often search them out for a punching bag.  &quot;Why werent these problems found on test??  The test players must be newb morons!!&quot;  The truth of the matter is that they were found on test and the bug reports were just ignored.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised, after many conversations with test players, that anyone bothers to play there at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hardly anyone does play there at all anymore. Top guilds had to merge to keep raiding. So basically 2 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The truth of the matter is that they were found on test and the bug reports were just ignored.<br />
<br />
You can't imagine how true that is ;)<br />
<br />
Top guilds had to merge to keep raiding.<br />
<br />
The guild that merged with another was the #2 raiding force on the server.  The top force would have been around a lvl 2 raiding org or so compared to live progression.  The top org has always had a mash of different guilds, nothing new there at all.<br />
<br />
Progression stopped for test at the time of GoD beta.  We put raiding on hold to test....dropping the server back some.  Then the changes that were made to the server made raids on time stop, literally stop dead.  Pleading and begging with dev to fix the bugs or atleast acknowledge them fell on deaf ears.  Our members got annoyed and some of the best players and best geared quit...to watch paint dry or some other worth while persuit.  Our members tried to hammer away at god, and made progression...quick deep progression.  But the bugs that plauged the server, and the frustration of watching things that have been reported over and over again go live drove most away.  Atleast most of the hardcore players.  There are still a few around.<br />
<br />
It's difficult to imagin the frustration if you're a player on live, just as it's difficult for the test player to comprehend the &quot;race&quot; to spawns.  For me personally, the biggest annoyance was reporting bugs, making sure dev knew about them...talking personally with them and asking what they needed or what we can do to help them address it only to see it go live and be blamed for inadiquate testing not only by folks on live but by development.<br />
<br />
The relationship in the past with the development staff was top notch, we'd run any testing they asked for or needed.  Forgo our raids and drop whatever to test for them, and they would do their best to keep us on even ground with the live servers as far as chance for mobs and things like that.  We never asked for more than that, although at times it was offered...we declined.  We simply had a desire for our &quot;shot&quot; as it were at the mobs that server bounces ate.  Our perk was lower population, theirs was unpayed testers that have played in most cases since the inception of this game with each other.  When a couple of very key members left the dev team, that relationship seemed to go away...for whatever reason.  There are still a couple with dev and QA that utilized the org but by and large they are now the exception instead of the rule they once were.<br />
<br />
It's disappointing to see what the server has become, and the quality of &quot;tested&quot; content now being pushed live.  Granted your top guilds on live always ran into problems with encounters and things that test didn't find, but by and large in the past it seems like things got tested better than they do now.  For whatever that's worth.  The bugs are being reported, but there needs to be someone reading them.<br />
<br />
I don't understand what soe was thinking, it's not like reporting the bugs was a selfish act...eventually, they all got pushed live.  In the end, they lost unpaid testers 90% of which enjoyed what they considered their responsibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I played as Buddlyte the shaman on test server back in the kunark days, up to level 55 a couple years ago.  The testing that went on was minimal imo.  I recall testing out PoMischief etc, but that was about it, but I wasn't on the cutting edge.<br />
<br />
Anyway, SWG beta was similar to what Howjan described.  Many many many bugs were reported and they all went live and flourished anyway.  Just the way SOE works I suppose.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is it not possible like beta to just augment a character up to 65th level?  I have never played on test before.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No, the highest you can buff yourself is 25.  Basically to get a taste of the classes, but offer no real testing capability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow, thanks for that insight, Howjan.  I had no idea how grim things were on test.  I guess if I were them, I'd START by building back my relationship with what free testers are left to me...  It's so much easier to destroy than to create.  I didn't realize just how much work they were going to have to do to get this game back on track.  Bleh.</div></div><hr />
