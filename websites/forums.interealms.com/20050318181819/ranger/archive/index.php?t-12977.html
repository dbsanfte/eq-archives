I was thinking spiders and rats in PoD would be a good idea, too.  That is, provided my small heals and constant slows will do the trick.  Slow doesn't always make things easy. &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daesun</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AM3 rangers can put LFG up and bowkite in PoN until groups forming at the graveyard realise how much damage they're able to put out on an XP mob and invite them to group.  It's pretty poor xp/hour, and you really need to get out of the soloing mindset.  A duo can do well in some areas, shaman/ranger or cleric/ranger.  The mobs hit fairly hard, so I'm not sure whether a druid would be able to keep up on healing for long even with C3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A druid can keep up fine on healing, they get better mana regen than a cleric.  plus you can dot to make it dead faster :)<br />
<br />
CLR/RNG can duo in Nightmare, I did wraiths for awhile but it's not like it's fast exp.<br />
<br />
It was feasible to solo in PoV if you had the patience, a good bow, and EQ.  But I heard they made or are making the mobs summon (good, I hate quading druids :p)<br />
<br />
Basically, soloing is slow, get a group when you can.  if you can 3 box a cleric and enc it's good exp, but what's the fun in that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not too shabby, but yes, the mobs hit hard and adds happen often.<br />

I don't have them yet unfortunately but I duo alot with a druid. Gonna go check out PoD soon as I've been having slight trouble finding groups for some reason in PoN. Seems like most groups here on TM are made up mainly of guildies etc...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nightop</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I duel box my 61 Ranger and my 53 Cleric.  I have been fear kittign the Blood Ravens, there is a Nice set of 3 of them that I have found.  I can kill those 3 and then I pull one of the Treants to break up the monotiny of fear kitting.  Both the birds and the trees hit pretty hard and the trees can be a real pain until they get slowed.  I usually through a Celestial heal on myself first thing when I get the tree back to camp.  Then Complete at 2 bubs of health.  Usually this is about the time slow lands.   Once slow lands you can usually go down to 1.5 bubs of health but it tends to get close if the tree gets a couple of lucky rounds in.<br />
<br />
I have never really check exp when grouped with the cleric but I do know that I was getting about 1/2 a blue bubble per kill when the cleric was just there healing and was not grouped with me.<br />
<br />
&lt; Edit  Should mention that is half a blue of AA Exp at 100% AA per kill  &gt;</div></div><hr />

Can someone elaborate on this please? )  Which mobs?  and how big should the RNG and ENC be? <br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poorboy</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually duo with a 61 Bard friend of mine.  Bard = Haste, Slow, Mez, DoT, Charm, melee, mana and health regen...basically everything except heal.  Anywhere there's a charmable mob we usually do pretty well.  It also brings some relief to kiting mobs knowing that if any adds aggro they'll be mezzed or charmed.  After 62 we get a decent heal to make soloing or duo-ing that much easier, and that may be when I stop levelling and go back to earning  AAXP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get 2% xp per kill there most times  A touch less since hitting lvl 63.<br />
<br />
Duo with a wizard quad kiting = 4% per 15 minutes &lt;am3 and eq&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Group = 1% per 2 kills.</div></div><hr />
