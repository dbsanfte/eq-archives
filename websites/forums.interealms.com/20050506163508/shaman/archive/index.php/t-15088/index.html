<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am wondering where i should be factioning, should i be in HoB, is it a bigger hit ? Is nurga cause ic an kill faster fro bulk, or is droga cause the mobs are higher level and in theory take a bigger faction hit.<br />
<br />
Does it go by mob level or is it all about bulk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I could tell in the new droga, it doesn't seem to be any higher than it used to be (1 pt per hit).  I was there for a few hours killing stuff and started indiff, ended indiff to chardok.<br />
<br />
HoB seemed about the same, although we did kill a number of those sarnaks that were messed up and giving the wrong factions.<br />
<br />
Korocust is supposedly a pretty big faction hit, if you can wander by as someone is killing him.  Aside from that, I'd have to say see if you can get an ae group in nurga and try to kill masses there, unfortunately there aren't nearly as many mobs to pull and you're gonna be waiting.  Droga sucks now, all mobs have 15k+ hp, it's not even worth it to go solo for faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I heard there is a new spot in the Frontier Mtns where they placed most of the old Droga quest mobs.  See if you can find it and report back ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just killed the angry goblin for my second chardok ring.  One of the &quot;burnai caves&quot; (in FM) has been taken over by the low level goblins who got kicked out of Droga when the big guys showed up.  <br />
<br />
I had myself bound nearby in FM and just gated there before I logged out each evening to see if I could find the Angry Goblin.  The last time I went, the angry wasn't up, nor was the goblin traitor, but there were some goblin bodyguards up, along with Ruk'gus.  I figured what the heck, I'll kill those guys just for amusement.  After I was finished killing them, I went back to the first cave where the angry goblin and goblin traitor were supposed to spawn and they were up!<br />
<br />
So, it's either a coincidence that the angry spawned right then, or he's now triggered by killing something else.<br />
<br />
In any case, the mobs are all there and all still give faction hits and drop faction stuff (salts &amp; skins).  There aren't nearly as many of them though, so this spot isn't going to give you nearly as many hits as AoE in droga might have.  I think the respawns may be a tad faster though.</div></div><hr />
