<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tacomodo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went to the loc in Rathe Mnts (2900, n1900), and it's near some broken catapult and some other stuff, but he's not here.<br />
<br />
The loc on EQAtlas seems to be wrong with the neg on the x-axis... Or is it the guide from eqshaman?<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take a book next time.</div></div><hr />
