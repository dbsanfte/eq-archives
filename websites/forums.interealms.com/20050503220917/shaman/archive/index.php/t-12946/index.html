<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ioki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, first I wish to apologize for this posting but i could not find this when I searched for it. <br />
<br />
Now to the root of my question<br />
<br />
What good is can-dance? <br />
<br />
I just hit 24 and have cannibalize and regeneration so I can can-dance. I try to do it but I do not see any real purpose in it. <br />
<br />
Please explain the purpose for it. What are its benefits?<br />
<br />
Can I do a macro to do it? <br />
<br />
If so how do I make a macro for can-dance?<br />
<br />
Again thanks for your replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EQ checks for SITTING every 6 seconds. if you sitting.. you get your sitting meditation,  It doesn't matter if you stand for 5 of those seconds.. as long as you are sitting on every 6 ( tick )<br />
<br />
so canni dance.<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 2 ( or whatever gem slot canni is in )<br />
/pause 17 ( pauses 1.7 seconds - just longer than canni i think )<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
so this makes you <br />
1) Stand<br />
2) cast canni<br />
3) waits till the spell is cast<br />
4) makes you sit.<br />
<br />
you wait for your mana to go up one percent ( to get the timing down )<br />
then do macro.. stand canni sit.  then you get sitting med.  then canni again.. wait for sitting med.  repeat..<br />
<br />
it works alot better than just canni a bunch of times then letting yourself regen back up.</div></div><hr />
