<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Curious if people are trying to stick with 6 man groups or tried with 4, likely I will be doing 4 most of the time, just curious if they harder or it truly is group dependant.<br />
<br />
LDON sounds really cool. can't wait.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From my experience in Beta at the lower levels, 4 people is doable, but very very challenging.  You will certainly need to be well rounded, and good crowd control will be a must (more so than usual).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">4 person groups are harder.  The adventure seems to be populated based on your average level, not taking into account how many are in the group... so expect to face challenges designed for 6 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did an adventure with a group of 4 last night.  Needless to say it was challenging but fun.  We failed at the collection adventure, but did manage to pick up a couple of augments as well and a nice 14/21 ranger axe with vengeance 2.  I think we would have made it had we one more person to add some DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gardner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you did a 4 person adventure - I would recommend the rescue / boss kill but even then you will have to kill plenty of mobs.<br />
<br />
I ended up in a 4 person yesterday (2 couldn't zone in due to a bug) and we didn't really come close to completing the collection mission even with Time enabled dps.<br />
<br />
Even though it might be a pain, most of these adventures are balanced for 5-6 rather than 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did a 4 person last night. Was supposed to be 5, but jst as we zoned in, the Necro says &quot;Gotta emergency, gotta go&quot; and gated out. (Hope it was not anything real bad) Anyway, there we were, Shaman, Druid, Ranger, Beastlord all in our 60's. Went down the hall, could not seem to get singles, it was tough, but doable, cleared one hall, then Ranger set off a DOT chest trap (burning something) it set our resists WAY doen, and keep slowly eating away hp. then in the next hall, hit a spot where we were getting 6 mobs at once, just could not handle them. So, my advice, 4 is doable like has been said, but, you must have some form of crowd control. (and no, root parking was not working on our big pull, the druid and I could not drag off mobs to park, (was a tight area) and keep the melees healed at the same time. Maybe a cleric instead of druid with there fast heats, and HOT's could have.</div></div><hr />
