<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lo all,<br />
<br />
I'm a 56 Shaman on Zeb, looking for some advise on equipment. Take a look at my Magelo and let me know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm.. I'd get an Ivory Imbued Collar, replace those gaunts.. with perhaps Crystal Chitin Gauntlets.. and replace the veil with either Crystal Spider eyes or an Enshrouded Veil... <br />
<br />
Noticed your bags as well.. I'd put your Runecrafters Boots on and stick your black furs in your main inventory and make a hotkey for them hehe... or at least that's what I did :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I always find it interesting how people will post 1 sentence asking for gear advice and then expect people to write entire multi-paragraph chapters about what is the best gear for them to upgrade.<br />
<br />
And, just so you don't think I'm an ass, here is my input:<br />
<br />
Face:   Something with AC and HPs -  Crystal Spider Eyes are good.<br />
Neck:   Something with AC and HPs  - Clattering Bone Necklace is good.<br />
Hands: Something with AC and HPs - Coldain Skin Gloves or Crystal Chitin Gloves are nice.<br />
Belt: Something with AC and HPs  - Spider Fur Belt is nice.<br />
Ears: Something with AC and HPs - Earring of the Solistice is *very nice* and so are Black Sapphire Earrings, and Earring of Twisted Leaves.<br />
<br />
Biggest area for improvements:<br />
Gloves and Face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I get your point snapdragon :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess what is boils down to is AC/HP vs Wis. Yes, Cana changes your HP for Mana, but you have to take the time to make the change and it still takes away from your life. Wis gives you the mana up front to use as you will and you can still cana down when your not getting beat upon.<br />
<br />
I have the luxury of having a Cleric with the removed Greater Heal staff along with me limiting the need for maximizing my HP's. I'm pretty much alway 80% to max HP.<br />
<br />
My Guild has not yet been to Halls of Testing, but will soon. As main slower I will have my pick at first chain drops. this will help much in balancing AC/HP with wis items. A few items are already going to be replaced. i.e.<br />
<br />
Belt - Smiters Girdle<br />
Shawl - #7<br />
Boots - I am wearing my Rune Crafters :)<br />
Earring - must do cabbage quest!<br />
<br />
I have a pair of Crystal Chitin Guantlets, but have been hesitant to wear them.<br />
<br />
I have a clattering bone necklace and I never even thought to wear it!<br />
<br />
Changing all of these would bring my wisdom below 200, though. Something I am apprehensive about since I manage to get it above thee 225 mark.<br />
<br />
So, I ask you. Is AC/HP that much more important than  Wisdom? I mean, that is a direct bite into your mana pool. Cana is great but brings you that much closer to death and when I'm soloing, that make me nervous.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HP isn't just for Cana.. I don't know about you but I tend to piss off mobs quite a bit.. and they like to pound on me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">HP/AC vs Wis/Mana has been debated to death - posting a wis-heavy profile like yours &amp; asking for opinions is a dangerous thing to do on this board unless you're receptive to the advice of dozens of shaman who have gone before you.  If you actually care about the merits of HP&gt;AC&gt; all then use that search button at the top of the page &amp; read one of the dozens of threads on the subject.<br />
<br />
The short answer to your question is yes - it is worth the bite into your mana pool.  Read the many existing threads on the subject to see why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kalamari: I'm not yet 60th lvl, and I've never been into HoT, but I'm pretty sure if I say something wrong some of the other Shamans here will correct me (gently, I hope).<br />
<br />
If you are going to be main slower at lvl 56, you are going to get beat on, a lot.  You will probably be hanging out right up there next to the MA so that when you get aggro the MA doesn't have to chase the dragon all over the place.  You need to be tough enough to take some hits.  So Gloves with an AC of 2 aren't really desireable.<br />
<br />
You make a good point about how you don't need to max your HPs because you can get it back quickly and you are usually at 80%.  If you aren't at full hps, it doesn't matter if you have 1700 or 2000 hps.<br />
<br />
Now apply the same logic to mana.  If you are at 80% mana, it doesn't matter how much your max is...only how fast you can get it back.  The extra mana capacity from 20 pts of Wisdom is only going to matter if you can refill it quickly.  Which we can do, but only by sacrificing HPs.<br />
<br />
AC/HPs are better than Wisdom for 2 basic reasons:<br />
<br />
1) if you aren't using them (converting to mana) it will help keep you alive.  <br />
2) HPs regen is *extremely* easy to get...everybody has some sort of regen, and there are plenty of healing spells from many classes including CH.  Available mana regen is much lower.<br />
<br />
I suggest upgrading without trading away any of your current setup.  Try 2 or 3 raids as main slower with your current gear, then do 2 or 3 with your new gear setup.  If you decide that you want to go back to 225 Wis you can just swap the gear out of your bank.  But I don't think you will :)<br />
<br />
PS - here is my magelo:  I'm 9 lvls lower than you are, but you might get a few ideas.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd like to put my oar in here as I'd stay I'm a little further down the same road as you :) I started HoT at 53 with my guild as main buffer and we had difficulty breaking the door... now we clear HoT, go do west tov mobs, come back and clear the respawn.. the difference due to hot armour and increased levels is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Ok the main thing you will need for HoT are: HP, AC and resists.<br />
<br />
At 56 you will find it very difficult to slow mobs without enchanter/mage tash and possibly bard tash - I find it difficult at 57 without tashing help (even with malosini).<br />
<br />
Okies - back to the point!<br />
<br />
The shaman epic, although some don't appreciate it, does have hp, mana and above all resists.. I do notice your fire resist is 30.. you will need some more here so I'd say circle of seasons and bard song should help but failing that you can use resist potions to add a bit more +svF or +svC etc.. you will encounter AE fire and cold mobs (AE poison is just a small dot and not much to worry about).<br />
<br />
As others have said - because you will be getting hit (*hard* by named) HP and AC are also extremely important - aego is best and don't forget you can stack ranger AC buff on the cleric's.. I have about 3000hp and 1057ish ac with buffs. See profile for ideas (full SS with olde-worlde non-armour bits).<br />
<br />
I'd look at aquiring the following:<br />
a) Epic (I just got mine at 57... wonderful as it's extra stats/resists and free dot that doesn't break root, and nobody tell you different unless they have a watersprinkler..).<br />
b) If your main slower - you should have coverage with bard song as you'll have AC/HP gear on..<br />
c) If your buffer then velium blue diamond bracers etc for resists.<br />
d) If your the 'main' shammie in your guild activities then yes get the SS BP, but I would say go for the vindi BP once your guild can handle him.<br />
e) replace those gloves - even totemic gloves have better AC and resists :) with a Polished Mithral mask, bearform and ench buffs, you'll not need those gloves.<br />
f) If your comfortable with killing giants and ally to CoV - do the scout quest (Talisman of Benevolence had just cold resist but does have 7ac,  +38hp, +15wis and +55mana) and replace that spear..<br />
g) booties - I notice you have thurg bootie armour and planes boots - use them when slowing! make a hot key for fur booties.<br />
h) Have a look at a sarnak battle shield for resists - it doesn't have wis but does have the same ac.<br />
<br />
Okies - I'll stop, that's one biiiig oar there :)<br />
<br />
Just make sure that for HoT that you have a necro and everyone has a large (or small if your necro is 57) for CR..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Let it be known that I did not start this to debate AC/HP vs WIS. I do realize the value both. This is more a discussion of how much wisdom to sacrifice in order to obtain AC/HP. I believe there has to be a balance between them.<br />
<br />
In saying such, I messed around with my profile subsituting several pieces I already have in the bank and was rather happy with the results.<br />
<br />
Lost 14 Wisdom<br />
Lost 43 mana<br />
Gained  61 HP<br />
Gained 49 AC!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm far from done, but appreciate the advice. If you want to look, I have the alternate profile on my magelo account too.<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=301584</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My advice is somewhat radical.<br />
<br />
Sell the Shield of Banewarding.  (I am assuming you dont have a lot of money lying around, and this was the easy target for making enough to aquire some improvements).<br />
<br />
Then, aquire the following<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield, or CC shield, or Skull Marked Shield (2k to 3k)<br />
Hierophant cloak (gain 3 ac, 75 hps/mana, lose 6 wis)<br />
Cystal Spider Eyes (1k)<br />
and maybe a rune etched iceworm fang (moving the howler to range) or<br />
A horse.  The value of horses cannot be underestimated.  (el cheapo of course)<br />
<br />
The main reason I proposed the sale of banewarding is that the Hierocloak is arguably the best cloak period, and cant be upgraded.  A bane warding shield can be upgraded to an orb of infinate void. <br />
<br />
I think a main point that someone has been made but is lost, is that AC is like mana regen if you are getting agro a lot.  If you have higer ac, you take less damage.  The less damage you take is the more you can canabalize.  Therefore, higher AC = Mana regen.<br />
These points are moot if you are a low agro shaman, mainly because then your AC sacrifices are for nothing, but if you are the highest shaman, you are THE high agro shaman in those situations, and as such, should tailor your gear for it.<br />
<br />
Again, opinions only =D</div></div><hr />
