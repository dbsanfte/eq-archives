<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a bit of a lurker here, but I have always appreciated the rare piece of advice I've found here that actually helped me. I'd like to thank those who have given such great advice over the years. I also wish to say that the shaman class may have a few problems, but we are still very powerful in my opinion. I've noticed lately that the useless whining has gone down in level as the new expansion comes near 8)<br />
<br />
Whatever happens I'll still play and hopefully I may be able to come up with a tidbit of info that will help other people who play a shaman. If I do ever find something that might help others, this is the place I would post it. The Crucible has been almost a bible to me for years. I moved a few years ago and got a new puter and email address but I have been watching this site for longer than my profile says, on a different account than this one.<br />
<br />
Thank you for providing this excellent reference source for we fellow shamans Gloriana, 8). I wish I had made some major contributions over the years but I tend to wake up in the morning and forget everything as I make my way to work.<br />
<br />
I have taken a couple of hits over the years, I gotta laff about my comments about pet weapons...that drew alot of heat. I still never carry weapons for my pet and although I realize they dual wield etc I am usually too busy to go into a town and buy weapons for my pet. Plus as an ogre there's not alot of towns I can go into. Also who the hell has room in their inventory?<br />
<br />
I'm dragging this out but what I really wanted to say is I'm getting very tired of EQ. If OoW is not some really fantastic expansion I'll probably be quitting. I belong to a super guild on CT server (Talons). I've played this character as my main for over 5 years. Despite what some of you may think I believe I know how to play a shaman as well as anyone can. I sincerely think even now that there is no better class that you could play. No matter what situation you are in there we are always able to contribute. I usually feel totally in control of most situations.<br />
<br />
Over the years I have looked up my spells, my alchemy and everything else, here on the Shaman's Crucible. I'm feeling a bit burnt out lately (maybe real life is getting to me). Anyway that's about all I can say without repeating myself too much. So...<br />
<br />
Vive Le Shaman!<br />

Appreciate what ya got or ya might hit major depression ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ya'll should listen ta dis here person, ya hear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I hear you on that.  I play on CT as well, in the only guild I'll ever be in.  I was going through a bit of burnout as well, and almost quit...  think I waited too long to actually do it though, lol.  Still, I took a good break for a while, and I'm getting back into it.  Working up the VP quests &amp; looking forward to Omens has actually got me back into the game again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On CT, shaman still have a reasonable amount of respect as a class.  I don't ever find it hard to nab groups in KT, ele, or whatnot.  I'm glad this expansion is coming around, cause it seems like a lot of people are starting to burnout.  Hopefully you stick around, Tuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, hope ya find the fun agai Cush, I just wanted to note about your comments about the pet weapons, I assume you (like most people ) pass through PoK every day. The fishing vendors at the pool by the Alchemy Vendors usally have rusty daggers for sale, I pick up a pair or 3 just about everyday whan I log on. I only adds about 2 min to the usual log on buff up time of finding a V, and a C3 if your not going to a raid. On Raid times my doggy gets mage weapons if we are not doing major AoE mobs, if we are, I usally like you do not bother to arem him, as he wont last long anyway. But for XP grouping, weapons are a big thig, I know dogdog has low DPS, but why make it worse than it has to be.</div></div><hr />
