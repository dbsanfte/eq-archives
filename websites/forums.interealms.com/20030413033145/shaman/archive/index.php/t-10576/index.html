<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering.. I've read that after you turn in the relics to the Apparition, Venril Sathir and Rile spawn to duke it out and some other skellies pop to watch the show.  <br />
<br />
I've been told that you have to kill 3 waves of those skellies before VS becomes targetable.  Is this true?  Can I pull them before Rile goes down or do they not pop til after they fight? Or is there a certain time limit before be becomes targetable?  Thinking about killing him with a single group of 61+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Search is your friend. :)<br />
<br />
VS becomes targettable 12 min after the turn-in.  Dont pull the Arisen from the room because they are instant respawns until VS dies.  As a general rule in EQ, don't EVER do ANYTHING that will potentially aggro an untargettable mob.<br />
<br />
Once VS becomes targettable you can poke your head around the corner and pull him if you lack a monk/SK.  Just make sure everyone sits on their hands for 12 min and deals with the spawns in the room AFTER VS is dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know search is my friend.. but I've read so much different stuff I didn't know which info was accurate and which wasn't.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine who was first to complete the cudgel quest on brell told me that 3 waves would have to be defeated prior to being able to target him...  I just wanted to make sure that wasn't the case and that if i pulled the arisen out of vs's room that I could just keep them mezzed. :)<br />
<br />
So once he does become targettable, and I pull him.. is it 100 percent that the arisen will come with him?  Or is it possible to single pull him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">at level 60, pulling from max range with malo you will get 2 arisen adds, even with a full room pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cool deal...  will try and get that bitz slain sometime this week :)  I want clicky!</div></div><hr />
