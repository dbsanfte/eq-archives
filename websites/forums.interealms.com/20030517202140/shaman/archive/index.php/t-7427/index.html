<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok just beat down Kirn on Sunday. Now for Neh Ashiir. What kind of fire power do I need to bring and what can I expect from the fight? Thanks for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Neh is pretty much like Ghiosk.  A souped up reaver.  Procs blind, can't land spells, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Of course, you need a rogue, for the locked door.  Hrm, can't think of much else that you have to have.<br />
<br />
You could do Neh with one group.  I prefer two though.  Enough people to make it easier, not to many to get cramped in the confined spaces.<br />
<br />
You probably want to lev people before you start climbing the ramp up to the upper level.  Some how, some way, people always find a way to fall off.<br />
<br />
Really, the trip to Neh is harder than the Neh fight.  You can get a lot of adds if you arent careful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The trick is not to camp in the room at the top of the invs stairs..has a insane spawn rate..move on to bridge behind it and med on bridge.we mostly chain stun and ae the room..otherwise its a pain in the ass..dont fight on the stairs either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Let me get this straight in order to get to Neh  you have to go through the same locked door that Rak is behind  where the Reavers are correct?  If so   which way past the the Door past Rak  do  I need to go. Left as in away from the lift or right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go through the front door of the 'castle' (into the room where Rak's reaver spawns). Then go though either one of the doors at the back of the room and turn right. Go along that corridor, turning right in the small room, then up a slope. There's a room directly ahead of you but on your right is a secret door that leads to a transparent ramp. This ramp leads to the 'sky houses', and if you follow it all the way you'll get to Neh Ashir.</div></div><hr />
