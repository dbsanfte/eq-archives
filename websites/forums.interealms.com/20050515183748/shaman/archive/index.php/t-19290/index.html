<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">because pallies get a 1200pt heal for 500 mana with a 5 second cast time?  <br />
<br />
not likely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Disregard this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im failing to see a huge different. Them getting a heal as good as the main heal we all use with a slighty longer casting time still seems asinine to me.<br />
<br />
Well, if we dont get a upgrade anyway. I mean everyone gets nuke upgrades but us, everyone getting DH upgrades but us too ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">and we wonder why poeple confuse us for hybrids:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How much of this type of healing improvement too pallys . With our healing staying the same . Will it take too FINALY convince everyone that a HYBRID has Surpassed a PRIEST in Healing capibilities ?<br />
I personaly feel pallys are very close too us in healing NOW if this goes live . IMO they will be the same as us at LEAST in all honesty prob a small bit better .<br />
Guess the point is this .. If that spell WERE a 3sec casting time ... would that be enough too get a consencus on how silly it is that this HYBRID one of the better Tanks in the game .. can Also out HEAL pure Priest classes ?<br />
/boggle <br />
Sorry for the rant , this just aggrivates me .</div></div><hr />

There is no other &quot;point&quot; that needs to be made.  The idea with a game is you play to enjoy it and that you enjoy to play it.</div></div><hr />

Most Paladins I've talked hate their new heals, all of them.  They think they're a joke.  Too slow casting, too high mana cost, etc  Also, it looks like they're getting another stun, Ancient Force of Trushar, that costs 15 mana more (same spell except a -55 adjust instead of -45) than Force of Akilae.<br />
<br />
Clerics hate their new heal, because it's basically Supernal Light x 1.1.  10% more mana and 10% more hp healed.  That extra 300hp is so worth it!<br />
<br />
<br />
Haven't talked to many druids, but they're probably pissed too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Big whoop-tee-do.<br />
I mean seriously, give them whatever healing they want, if paladins seriously think that it makes them a better class, whatever.<br />
I know TONS of paladins and clerics, none of them think in the least bit that their healing ability needed a boost; I also know a few paladins that say that they have too many stuns, so take that with a grain of salt :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your missing the point.<br />
<br />
Its has nothing  to do with not giving this to paladins, it has everything  to do with us not getting healing upgrades. We are a pure class, there is no way they should be almost even with us in the direct healing department. You can say we still have our &quot;big heal&quot; but for the cast time and heal amount and the fact that you cant use any focus with it .... no one uses it, its not efficent in a group for a shaman to stop everything he is doing for 10 seconds to cast 1 1950 heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I put my big incomplete heal spell somewhere in the back of my spell book. I'll never use it. It's a totally stupid spell when I can cast Tnarg's and get the benefit of all my focus items and AA's. I can't even remember what it is called. My Tnarg's averages for about 1600 HP and i land crits for over 3300 HP.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is pallys with focus items and AA's are gonna be rockin' with that spell. Think I'll make a Berzerker (</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This spell makes little sense for paladins at all though.  50 more mana and 100 more healing, roughly, over Touch of Nife?  I don't get that.<br />

I think Paladins are still unbalanced as a class, but this is a stupid spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You know if they do give us a new direct heal, it will be 1430hp for like 470 mana.  Just Tnarg's x 1.1.   Keep praying for a group Quiescence.</div></div><hr />

Exactly what point do you mean?<br />
1) that paladins may out heal us &gt;IF&lt; this spell goes live.<br />
or<br />
2) that somehow your worried that a paladin will take your place in a group as main healer?<br />
<br />
if its not one of these 2, then I understand the 3rd possibilty as well, you want a upgrade to our blast heal. Well, I do too, Tnargs is a nice blast heal, bit hefty on the mana cost side, but with proper AA and foci, its a nice spell. The thing is we may get an upgrade, there are simply too many if, and, buts, maybes, rumors, hey I had a friend that talked to this guy that knew a fellow that was doing the beta, etc, etc, etc...<br />
Sure proactive work is better than waiting till the final product hits stores and goes live and we may or may not be screwed, thing is we literally have done all that we possibly can do; we have feedbacked, suggested, pissed, moaned, and somehow as a community managed to put together a letter that included blast heals/lack there of as one of our main concerns as a class.<br />
I want to be able to fullfill my role as a healer better, I want the ability to serve as a healer regardless of and seperate to my ability to slow. I am sure that you do too, but I seriously doubt that regardless of what spells that a paladin gets for a healing upgrade will really affect our ability to get a group as a healer or debuffer. <br />
Yes we should get an upgrade too, yes its unfair that they get a group heal and we dont, but paladins have been a squeaky wheel for a long time and SOE greases squeaky wheels...sadly shaman as a community may have been silent for too long.</div></div><hr />

Most paladins I know bitch about not having a 96% rez and slow, too. They tend to whine more than Druids, all in the name of &quot;melee balance&quot;, too. Go fig.</div></div><hr />

I guess someone doesnt do very many hard ldons. In a hard ldon, 95% of the people I know will say PAL &gt; WAR. Even with the changes they made to discs and adding the new war taunt, warriors still cant out agro a paladin. The pally group heal has saved my hard ldon groups many times. So maybe if  you enjoy sitting in POV inner or in BoT or maybe even the gimp normal LDONs which even a shaman can tank, I guess you dont need a paladin. In a hard LDON, you need to have a paladin in most of the zones, especially in MM, Guk, and Miragul because the pally undead crits are the best dps you gonna have if they have su3. I saw a pally crit for over 4k twice on one mob, it was dead in about 15 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">As many have stated here, and I agree with them, the issue is not with the fact that we are not prime healing class. Issue is that we are PURE priest class, and we've been beaten by different HYBRIDS already in few areas. I am OK that I am not as powerful healer as the cleric is - fine by me, cleric is primary healer, should be the best. I am OK that the druid is above, somewhat, of me with the heals, for example - after all, they're closer to that nature-thingie and stuff, let them heal more. But paladins beating me as a shaman when it comes to healing? No bloody way I agree with that.<br />
<br />
Yes, paladins already heal better then we do for some time. So it basically already sucks for some time. And now, yet another expansion leaves us dry, giving us literally NO upgrades. Whopee-dee-damn-doo, we may get AA's, now, finally, like SCS, what some other - HYBRID classes at that - already have for couple of years.<br />
<br />
The point is, we got our first, and also the last, upgrade with Kunark. After that, we're got nothing which can be called &quot;new&quot; or &quot;upgrade&quot; for real. And the last expansions have been a joke at best, where our &quot;new and upgraded&quot; buffs/spells cost significally more mana then their older versions, while giving only minor upgrade to the effect! Not to mention shorter duration time. Just face it disbelievers, we're back in the dust for ages now and it's only getting worse. No, we are not nerfed, we are simply forgotten. Or ignored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't believe I am reading this, especially coming from another shaman?<br />
Knights were always sought after in PoP over warriors without hate proccing weapons.  And for MM and Dguk, normal or hard LDON, I will always prefer a paladin.  Doesn't mean I would refuse a warrior from my guild ever, but I would definitely feel safer going with an unknown paladin than an unknown warrior or even shadow knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Sony hates Shamans, learn to live with it. I like my class, do i want better? yes, will i quit if i dont get it? no. I will continue to struggle on until no one will play with me anymore and then I will just become the master tradeskill class we seem to be becoming, can farm the hell out of green stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Maybe that satisfies you Haggr, but definately not me. I'm in EQ since beta and have seen the shaman becoming from powerful but well balanced class into forgotten stepchild, which is being ushered under the bed all the time guests (expansions) come, and then forgotten under that bed. If Sony continues to screw shamans over, I will quit, especially now that the WoW is coming closer and closer. We're matched and outmatched in most areas nowadays, even in those (almost) what we considered to be our butter and bread areas. Our main 'tools of the business' are only marginally better then those of other classes, and at the same time, we have no utility to offer what these other classes do have, and in many areas we're being replaced with these same other classes. No, I don't say that the other classes are unbalanced and too powerful. Nope. They've gotten their upgrades, which come with the time, all good. But I am saying that we have been forgotten and ignored, and have been &quot;dangling&quot; along since the Velious expansion, without getting upgrades or improvements or something totally new.<br />
<br />
I'd rather play different game if this trend continues. Oh, wait, I will anyway, as soon as WoW is out...</div></div><hr />

- Why would anyone group with paladins? THEY SUCK! I mean, snap aggro, superb tanking, group heals, very fast single target heals, LoH, Ressurection, Slay Undead. When I had a necro and paladin in group last saturday for a few gigs, I think I healed something like 5 times for 3 LDoN easy missions. I remember being grouped with 2 paladins in MM, didn't cast one single heal the entire mission ... But yeah, paladins suck. Avoid them.</div></div><hr />
