<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I came across a strange group the other night at ME. It was a group with four Vah Shir beastlords. I was invited to join along with an enchanter. I haven't been part of a nearly full party of beastlords since my pre-lv15 days at the cat newbie area. It felt like home again. But we did have a blast since every person in the group had a pet. The poor mobs didn't know what hit them. I would slow down the mobs and the six pets would tear the mob to pieces. It was amazing seeing so many pets jumping on a single mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow an enchanter willing to group with 4 pet classes, hooray for the pet changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought we weren't a pet class? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thought only 4 pets could hit a mob at once?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">neg, the four pet thing is bs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The new pet changes are truly wonderful. As for only 4 pets attacking at the same time, I don't think that true. Usually I'm busy casting as the mob is approaching. By the time I issue the attack command to my pet, all the other pets are engaged. Once my pet enters the furball, I see it doing damage. It was such a site seeing an Enchanter with in a team with 5 summoned pets.  The enchanter felt obligated to summon his lame pet just to keep up with appearances.</div></div><hr />
