Why is it that I can love my ranger yet I dont wanna keep going with the XP grind that the 30+ lvls seem to be/are?? I just started a Bard, gave him Fungi + some other v.nice crap and he is lvl 14 in 4 hours!!! in 4 hours my ranger MIGHT get one level. Why is it that VI thinks that every level should be so DAMN hard?? Why can't DBlues ALWAYS give 2-4% XP, after all only a few classes can SOLO them!!<br />
Here is what I propose (be it rant, yes)<br />
<br />
LBlue con = .5% XP, 1% AAXP<br />
DBlue con = 2-4% XP, 3-6% AAXP (3 or 4% XP being 3-5 and 1-3 lvls below you)<br />
Even con = 6% XP, 8% AAXP<br />
Yellow con = 10% XP, 14% AAXP<br />
Red con = 20% XP, 20% AAXP<br />
<br />
yes this means faster levels, balanceing solution? REINSTATE HELL LEVELS!!! (in these you get 1/2 the norm XP / level). Hell, just make the mobs that give this XP hard to kill, sort of<br />
<br />
i.e. @ lvl 40 a lblue is 25 dblue is 35 even is 40 yellow is 42 and red is 45<br />
<br />
LBlue has 1400hp = same XP/time ratio as DSP (1 kill/min = 60%/hour)<br />
DBlue has  2100hp (more risk of resists) = 1kill/1.7min = 35kills = 70%/hour<br />
Even has 2500hp (v.high risk of resists) = 1kill/4min = 15kills/hour = 90%/hour @ moderate risk of death<br />
Yellow has 3000hp = v.high risk of resists = 1kill/5min = 20kill/hour = 200%/hour w/ death exepected more than once + long crs to this zone (you lose XP and time to kill which really inconvienences this, chances are you die every 4th one)<br />
Red has 3200hp = 1kill/6min = 200%/hour with death every other pull = maybe 2-3 kills per hour.<br />
<br />
a group (full 20% bonus) can chain kill reds (slower, healer for the hits, tank, and dmg dealers) @ 1 per 2min + 10min DT per hour = 60-10=50/2=25 mobs/hour (red)<br />
20%xp*1.20(group modif.)=24%per kill/6ppl = 4% per person * 25/hour = 100%/hour = grouping is encouraged which VI wants.<br />
<br />
Finally to get into Artican's Zone of Leveling you need a key which is a lvl 30 quest (no lvl 20 necro kiters) and requiers killing of spawns on 10 hour repop time but ahve garunteed drops, NO-DROP key.<br />
<br />
Mobs in this zone dont group argo and dont summon, however if you get more than 2 at a time you get adds (no quadding for 24% / 10min :) 12% per 10 min now = 72%/hour</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rebeliousmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks, ill send you a tell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">k, i'll be on tonight definatly. Maybe this afternoon also.<br />
<br />
So have you quit or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hell levels eh? You do know that it takes the same amount of experience to go from 1-60 right? They just smoothed it out, so adding them back in accomplishes nothing. Of course if you really feel that killing 5 mobs per level is teh win, feel free to /feedback your suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, Hopwin,<br />
<br />
A.) I posted here because I really didnt mean any of it, just needed to vent from the grinding  i ahve been doing.<br />
<br />
B.) Its more a 50 kills per level thing because red cons WILL kill you if you arent in a good group, dlbues that offer 2-4% per kill are the only real soloable mobs for any class, necros included</div></div><hr />
