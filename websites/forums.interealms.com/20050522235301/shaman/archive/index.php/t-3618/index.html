<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Errun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are the options for good helms that have no graphic. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most if not all circlets and crowns, don't give graphics.<br />
Might check out a site like Allakhazam's and do a search for each of those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A cheaper option is simply the Crown of the Froglok Kings, because I like looking at my beautiful head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Out side of VT, not sure what has what for graphics in there yet, the crown of king tormax would have to be the best non visible helm I can think of for a shaman. Can even turn it for a &quot;custom&quot; crown if you like the plate look better =)</div></div><hr />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Falinkan is the best option I have seen to date.   has some wis (5) and decent ac (12), plus effect is affliction haste 3.   so can assist you in soloing from time to time (with AH3, I tend to be able to pull with slow at max rane, and land Ebolt just as they arrive, before firrst hit and inevitable interrupt)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Burrower helm has ghey leather look (although in pure black...)</div></div><hr />

25 ac 10 wis 70 hp / mana 20 sv cold some focus effect, i forgot.<br />
no graphic hps/mana high AC .. pretty nice!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got a Spirit Weaver's Coif recently (drops from Glade Stalker in POG) - stats are ac 16 dex 5 wis 5 mana 15 nodrop - not too shabby.<br />
<br />
But the odd thing is, ever since I got it, NO helm has shown a graphic for me, as if wearing the SWC has bugged all my helms!! Bizarre eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm not sure if it's been fixed as I've not done it for a while but I used to go into bear form then click it off. This removed my helm graphic.<br />
<br />
[edit - Actually Grippa - I had my graphics stuck for a while, but I was wearing my tradeskill gear to boost my WIS. Even when I changed back into my regular gear I was still showing up in my WIS junk. No matter what I did I couldn't get rid of the graphics. I ended up going around in Bear form for a couple of weeks untill it fixed itself... Still never figured out what caused/fixed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Circlet of Suffering from Telkoroner is good:<br />
<br />
AC20, +7 STR, +7 STA, +100 HP, +50 MANA.<br />
<br />
Yeah, there's better out there. But it has decent AC, great HP, and no graphic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm having trouble thinking of a droppable helm without a graphic with 15ac &gt; and wis or mana. Artificers is easily the most accessible helm that meets your requirements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess that depends on what graphics you have on.<br />
<br />
Spirit Caller does have a graphic under Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Errun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wolf callers has no graphic under luclin??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spiritcaller's under Luclin doesn't look anything like Totemic.<br />
<br />
Has the horns but not as long, better texture and IMO an overall better look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Winnow D'Minnow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I use the Mith Helm:<br />
<br />
AC35, Wis+15, Str+4, Mana+40, All Saves +15<br />
<br />
It has the Plate Horned look.  The problem is how god aweful ugly it looks in DE form.  I use the Bearform trick to get rid of the graphic as I like to stay in DE form.  (Equip Helm, Cast Bearform, Click off Bearform, no helm in Barb form or DE form after this until you zone or re-equip helm) Unfortunately the players entering the zone after you do this will still see your helm : (<br />
<br />
I'll take this look over the ugly skull helm look anyday:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Not everyone is old school and has the DE Mask... like you and I.<br />
<br />
Would be nice to answer a question so that everyone understands instead of asking themselves... DE mask? What does that have to do with a graphic-less helm when I don't have or don't know what that mask is?<br />
<br />
Less obfuscation and more substance ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">BAH! I think Aruman is trying to make me feel bad cause I missed DE mask by one day :mad: /cry /whine /bitch.  One day I will win a GM event that has one!  If there are anymore GM events...Oh, btw, with Luclin models on, some helms have graphics that dont without.  I believe this has been stated about Spirit Callers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mazirus Slaymaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">!!! how did you get that form</div></div><hr />
