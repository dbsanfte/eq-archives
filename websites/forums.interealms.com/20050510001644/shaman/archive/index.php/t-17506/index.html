Hi Mandrake,<br />
<br />
It is not true that you need to get into a good guild to get your high level spells or to get your epic.<br />
<br />
I am in a guild that is a very small family guild and they have not made a ton of difference to me getting my high level spells (this guild is &quot;good&quot; for me but not what most people mean when they say a &quot;good&quot; guild):).  One of my friends who is not in my guild bought one of my 65 spells for me.  One of my other friends who is not in my guild got me some of my rarer high 50's spells when his uber guild went and dropped a kunark dragon on his head for kicks.<br />
<br />
Now that spell research is in the game and components drop pretty well even the rarer dropped sub 60 spells are not that hard to get .  I got the last component for torpor for 4k and the last component for malo for 500 pp.  61-62 spells are very cheap.  63-64 spells are not too bad.  65 spells are still rather expensive but can be bought in bazaar.  <br />
<br />
I just finished my epic last week and no one from my guild was even there.  I did it with friends.  <br />
<br />
Now not being in a big guild means you probably will not have your spells in the bank 10 levels before you get to the level to scribe them.  But you will get them.<br />
<br />
And there are LOTS of guilds that welcome members with erratic play times.  And I prefer those guilds, as my job is not to play Everquest and no one is going to tell me when to be there:)  You probably will not get into your server's uberguild with limited play time, but you can get into a guild.<br />
<br />
Your last question I don't know the answer to, we use the old fashioned telephone:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's no reason you can't use Roger Wilco or the like behind EQ with friends (my sister and her group do it regularly) - though I've never heard of an entire EQ guild doing it.  People tend to either become good typists or learn to anticipate the folks around them - easier than in FPS games, I'd wager.<br />
<br />
I agree that you don't NEED a guild for these things.  It makes them a lot easier to get, but it's definitely possible to get them without signing your life away to a guild.  I've been in what are generally called &quot;family&quot; guilds for most of my EQ time and have never been interested in raiding guilds.  I've gotten malo (some guildmates got it for me when we went to HoT for the first time), torpor (some friends locked themselves in the crypt in Sebilis with me for a couple weeks), and bought Q in the bazaar.  It takes more time, but - especially with spell research - there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is certainly possible to get your spells without guild support.  It just takes a fair amount of farming and/or camping the places where they drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not true.    My shaman has almost all spells except maybe...   2 that I would want.   Primal Avatar is the only major one I am missing.   I am not only in a small guild but I am not a 24/7 player.  I play a couple 3 hours a night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A good guild always helps, but having friends in good guilds can help you aswell.<br />
<br />
I've been blessed with friends who either are higher end than me or simply think of me when they see a spare rune/spec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mandrake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">that makes me feel great!  as i was really dreading hitting a wall with my shaman that i already love so much.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of any good 'family' type guilds on Firona Vie, or else where or how do i get hooked up with one?  Whenever i talk to people in guilds they useually say only 50-55+ people.<br />
<br />
on another note, i really like all the fun people on this forum, i mean i posted this like an hour ago and ive already gotten great insite from some really smart people!<br />
<br />
I swear i spend more time on the boards than i do in game sometimes (: hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Of my 65 spells I only bought 1. The rest I got from rune turn ins. I got the runes from XP groups in BoT. It can be done a guild just makes it easier.  Has for epic you can problly manage to do that with out a large guild to. Only catch is the tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Berik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hello,<br />
<br />
Im on the Fennin Ro server therefore I can't give you any info first hand about the guilds on Fir Vie...<br />
<br />
<br />
However, here is a wonderful link for you.<br />
<br />
http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie<br />
<br />
It is the link to your server boards, you will see this forum there to.<br />
<br />
http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47<br />
<br />
And now for some actual info, NO you don't need a guild but it sure makes things easier.<br />
<br />
The number 1 thing your going to have to have working for you if your not in a guild, is a very out going attitude and be a nice person...that will get you alot farther than you think.  There is alot of guilds out there that offer a family type idea, and are still able to get alot of things done.<br />
<br />
You may not progress at a rapid pace through EQ if your in a family guild, but you will have a fun and enjoyable time.  Im not knocking hardcore guilds, raiding guilds etc...but there not for me.  I work 40hrs a week, part time student, have social things to do and a girlfriend who I love to spend all day with.  Being in a hardcore raiding guild, would not work for me so I joined CD.  We have been together for almost 4yrs.  We have done, velious, st, ssra, vt, and have just now entered the Elemental planes..so don't go thinking you have to be in a Fires of Heaven guild to do things.  We still have the same requirements to join, as we always have.  Are level requirement is still 35 believe it or not.  <br />
<br />
Just have a good time, don't take the game to serious and don't worry about the small stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Constan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mandrake I have always found it was better to just play and have fun. If you just play you will meet people and eventually find a guild. Searching for a guild just to be in one normally doesn't last to long. My advice would be play, have fun, group alot and make friends. It all works out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I’ve been in a very small guild for the last two years.  My guild is also very laid back, perhaps too much so, but I don’t regret it.  We never do anything higher than the first planes in PoP and we never do anything of the big dungeons, so equipment and spell wise I don’t have a lot of access to things.  But I have good friends to spend time with and believe Norrath can be a very lonely place without friends.  And at 61st level I have Malo and Torpor, thanks to research materials and a guild mate with 200 research skill.<br />
<br />
And friends really are the key to fun and success in EQ.  I’m currently getting a lot of LDoN adventures because I’m grouping with an unguilded ranger friend, and his duel boxed cleric, because I made friends with him two years ago.  If you find people in game you like, talk to them.  If they enjoy your company as well you could have made some friend for the rest of your EQ life.  And like any friendship, it requires some give and take.  Be willing to help them meet their goals and they will most likely help you do the same.  <br />
<br />
If the most important thing to you is what equipment you have and what spells are in your spell book then you may be happier trying to find a raiding guild.  But if you enjoy a more casual play style and are willing to just take your upgrades when they come, there are lots of guilds out there for you to choose from.  If you find someone you enjoy groping with and they are in a guild, ask them about it.  That’s how I found my guild.  I met a very nice druid lady when running around Misty Thicket when I was playing my ranger and I started grouping with her.  That encounter led me to making some of my very best friends in game.  <br />
<br />
So go out there, have some fun and get to know some people.  The rest will take care of itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm in a raiding guild that is specifically &quot;real life friendly&quot;.  No raiding requirements, i.e. you don't have to log in just because a raid is scheduled, and even if you are online you are not required to attend a raid.  We use a points-based system to distribute loot (not DKP, this one is auction-based) and casual raiders simply take longer to accumulate enough points to win the nice stuff.<br />
<br />
Of course, there are practical requirements.  Keys/flags require a good bit of work, but much of it is solo/outside raiding hours (like the VT key pieces, for example).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In todays EQ you can solo enough cash to buy all your spells, and outfit yourself in full Ornate, add in some EP jewelery, and be well over 3K hps unbuffed. LDoN is also a great source of equipment, and the cash isnt sucky either (tip: volunteer to King Loot, and sell off the reserch in the bazaar if no one in the group wants any of it)<br />
<br />
Bottom line, you really only need a guild to enjoy bigger encounters and to see the &quot;End Game&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">To answer the question that seems to have got lost in the sea of guilg/no guild opining ;), if you want voice comms behind EQ, http://www.teamspeak.org/ seems to be the best around atm. Use it all the time and makes comms an absolute breeze (although it does mean when you insult the bard he can actually reply without stopping his twist and having everyone else jump on him :p).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There are quite a few family guilds on FV as well as roleplaying guilds that are fairly laid back and understandable.  Only family guild i know of offhand is Portent of Luclin (Talk to Ktok if you are interested) but there are several others that you can research and join.<br />
<br />
Getting high end gear, spells, and your epic does not require a guild.  Spells can be bought and money can be farmed.  Shaman epic can be done solo or duo'ed (if you cheat) all the way up to fear and then you can always form a pickup raid or get friends to help with Fear and the final fight.  FV also lets you buy parchments and other no drop items (as well as keys and some flags) so that is a benefit and with LDoN you can save alot of money by using points for equipment and saving that money for your spells.  You can quest for Stoicism and canni 3 so even if cash is fairly short you should be ok.<br />
<br />
Dont let the idea that you have to be guilded ruin your view of the game.  While guilds are fun because its a common chat channel and goal I wouldnt worry about it otherwise.  Besides it will probably be some time before you need to worry about 60+ spells and by then who knows what your interests will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its a very tough question ... but I would never join a guild to get something or make something possible.  Well at least don't tell them that anyway =)  With my cleric I was in a top guild on Bristlebane .. like #5 or 6 and I still had to buy most of my spells.  I even had to buy Ageo back in the day so don't count on anyone buying you anything.  If they need you to do something .. then they need top fork over the cash.  Like GRC went to all the shaman and druids before clerics.  If I wanted it I would have to buy it.  I wouldn't approach the need for a guild to acomplish any personal goals.  <br />
<br />
or..<br />
<br />
you could pretend like your a girl and cyber the guild leader ... that will get you a lot =)<br />
<br />
pS the only spell that you might need a guild for is primal avatar which drops in ST .. dont think many people are gonna let you loot a ST key =) ... then again hunt for researh components .. can make them all =)</div></div><hr />

We used RW for a while, until we realised it is unstable as hell.  Get TeamSpeak instead; very stable, and also a free download.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, I'll bite.<br />
<br />
Why would you want to go through all the trouble to get primal avatar?<br />
<br />
spoiler : There's this nifty spell we get at 65 called ferine avatar that buffs better, is a rune turn in, or can even be bought in bazaar...</div></div><hr />
