<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail,<br />
<br />
Putting this in General forum since I'm covering multiple topics, but most of it is alchemy-related.<br />
<br />
I sat in the front row for the first session Tradeskills discussion with Dan Enright.  My notes were horrible, but I'm writing this as soon as I got home so hopefully the hangover isn't affecting my memory too badly. :) <br />
<br />
The session was taped by someone (Caster's Realm or Allakhazam's, can't remember which), so a more detailed list of what was said should be posted with greater accuracy soon.<br />
<br />
Shaman-related highlights:<br />
<br />
Discussed removing negative attributes to Alchemy potions.<br />
Dan understood that this detractor isn't really necessary with the EQ of today.  He said that instead of re-writing the current potion stats, it is more likely to write code for NEW stat potions w/o negative affects.  No ETA or priority given for Alchemy re-vamp.<br />
<br />
Problems with alchemy are well known, and Dan said the re-vamp would likely lower both the component purchase price AND increase the vendor sell-back price to reduce the expense associated with alchemy.  Once again, no ETA on this.<br />
<br />
Invisiblility potions for Shaman is not going to happen according to Dan.  He tried, but the idea was shot down in a meeting.  Furthermore, he said he tried to let the store-bought potions be made combineable in a potion bag, and that was also shot down. :(  Verant doesn't want a 10 charge invis potion IG.<br />
<br />
Making a Geerlok for Alchemy (&amp; poison-making) was discussed, so this may happen eventually.<br />
<br />
Many other classes/cultures discussed Cultural armour deficiencies and problems.  Dan took notes on most everyone's concerns.  I didn't get a chance to address the new Cultural armour stats, but I did tear out Sister Li's post on page 2 of the Fain Faire thread and set it on his notebook before slipping out.<br />
<br />
Strength was confirmed as a tradeskill attribute for smithing, but it only affects chance of skill-up (NOT success) if it is higher than int/wis.  The recipe being attempted (if not trivial) has no bearing on skill-up rate according to Dan.  The trivial check is different than the skill-up check.<br />
<br />
I spoke with Ryan Parker (on the dev team) for awhile, and he mentioned reading our Fan Faire thread, so most everything posted before Fan Faire started was being read by at least some people over at Verant.<br />
<br />
Oh, Dan Enright did mention (slip?) that the artwork for the new epics(!) for PoP has been done, but that the work behind them isn't.<br />
<br />
The tradeskill cap (for all) has been lifted in the code already, but hasn't been changed yet IG, though it may upon PoP release.<br />
<br />
I spent a half-hour at our class discussion table &amp; met some nice Shaman from other servers.  Thanks for the advice. :)<br />
<br />
Tanuden, you deserted us before things really got going, but it was nice drinking and chatting with you.<br />
<br />
There was a very nice female Shaman dressed up with a cool home-made epic (nicely done), the blue diamond facial tattoo, a kilt, studded leather hauberk, gloves, boots, leather bags, and a stuffed dogdog.  Pretty neat.  (Sorry I forgot name/server, but was in &quot;Illuminati&quot; or something like that guild. :p)<br />
<br />
LOTS more was discussed, but my brain's drained right now &amp; I need sleep.  If anyone has questions, I'd be happy to try and answer them. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels<br />
<br />
PS:  Gloriana - Crom &amp; Siilver missed you. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
What about the boobs!?  And hair color?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dan understood that this detractor isn't really necessary with the EQ of today.

<br />
Anyone else read this as: higher trivial, more expensive ingredients?<br />
<br />
Nice report, Frekkels, glad you had a good time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
The Shaman's hair color was dark brown, with a twisted braid on the front side, very barbarian-esque.<br />
<br />
As far as chest size, she did run around at one point without the hauberk, (it looked heavy &amp; HOT) which made it look like she was in need of a rez, as all she had underneath it was a tube top. :D<br />
<br />
The physics of gravity keeping it up still confuse me.  :)<br />
If you want descriptions of size, go to the next FF yourself.  In the meantime, use your imagination. ;)<br />
<br />
Gloriana, I think you are right about the higher trivial level (though it wasn't specifically mentioned) but Dan really sounded earnest when he talked about lowering the price of business with alchemy.  He acknowledged the cost vs functionality was very skewed against us.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Very interesting stuff. Thanks for sharing your info from fan faire. Keep it coming heh, its great to hear what they are up to and what people like yourself have mentioned to them. Good stuff, thanks.<br />
<br />
Did you ask for Nome illusion potions ? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maddcovv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sorry I missed most of you, that was me in the first trade skill meeting trying to bash him around about alchemy  :)<br />
<br />
I also left our suggestions on the class disscussion table and with the dev team<br />
<br />
Oh yeah the dev tem said pretty much NO to a group shrink...  it would need a confirmation box and thats just too hard for then to make!  W T F?<br />
<br />
They also said the 60 shaman spells drops are fine now.... to which i said no they arent.. and they said yeah I think they are... and I said  No they arent....  heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lies.<br />
<br />
Isn't there a group TL to bind?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sounds like a little laziness to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From Mobhunter: (link has some more info from Fan Fair)<br />
http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-2045610826<br />
<br />
&quot;- Group shrink for shamans is being discussed, possibly with a confirmation box added. According to a post at the Shaman's Crucible board, alchemy will undergo a revamp at some point.&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess being discussed as in, we say &quot;please&quot; and they say &quot;no&quot;, then yeah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My cynical Monday morning interpretations:<br />
<br />
Discussed removing negative attributes to Alchemy potions.<br />
Positive attributes will be removed as well <br />
<br />
NEW stat potions w/o negative affects<br />
Lesser and Greater Charisma potions along with a 10 second cast True North potion<br />
<br />
Problems with alchemy are well known, and Dan said the re-vamp would likely lower both the component purchase price<br />
Prices will be cut in half, but for balance issues vendors will only be located in NToV, Sleepers, and VP<br />
<br />
increase the vendor sell-back price to reduce the expense associated with alchemy. Once again, no ETA on this. <br />
<br />
They will be increasing the sellback price of 10-shots to be as much as 10 1-shots<br />
<br />
Making a Geerlok for Alchemy (&amp; poison-making) was discussed, so this may happen eventually<br />
<br />
The components for the Geerlok will drop in NToV, Sleepers, and VP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ohh Torelorm..gonna give Zorlac and myself a run as board curmudgeon.<br />
<br />
:)=<br />
<br />
On a more serious note, imnshfo - even with all the &quot;potential&quot; alchemy changes I don't think that addresses 25% of the Shaman concerns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They wont even look at alchemy until after PoP comes out.  And it will be 6 months after launch till that expansion is playable and the bugs are worked out.  Then they will have to fix all the balancing issues.  <br />
<br />
So I look for a alchemy revamp in early 2004 if I had to guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well... supposedly they said they're not going to release PoP until it is actually finished, but I'm sure there's going to be a lot of bugs in it still. Just no unfinished quests and mobs that haven't been itemized yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bah, from the announcement I was under the impresssion the class forums would not have someone there.  Left early.<br />
<br />
<br />
If alchemy is our number one concern, they completely misunderstand us methinks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and the woman in the shaman outfit was a cutie.  Too much on the &quot;young rebel&quot; thing imo, but hey, I'm more of a Madonna/June Cleaver kinda guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;There was a very nice female Shaman dressed up with a cool home-made epic (nicely done), the blue diamond facial tattoo, a kilt, studded leather hauberk, gloves, boots, leather bags, and a stuffed dogdog.

<br />
I got a picture of her in front of the FF sign by the registration booth.  I went over to ask her if she posted on the Crucible and her boyfriend said &quot;She doesn't even play a Shaman&quot;.  He didn't seem very friendly at all so I just said &quot;thank you&quot; and left them be.  I had bigger &quot;beers&quot; to drink anyways.. 8-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;Verant doesn't want a 10 charge invis potion IG.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Maybe we should start asking for 2k nukes, CH, 10k DoTs... as suggesting group shrink or combining store bought potions are deemed too &quot;powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
*note my attempt on sarcasm...*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hail,<br />
<br />
Jeez, there are some cranky people posting this morning. :o<br />
<br />
Anyway, the reason I posted about ALCHEMY is because I went to the TRADESKILLS SESSION.<br />
<br />
I DID NOT go to the DEVELOPERS session, and Baelish was the one running the Community &amp; Feedback session, so I didn't waste my breath with him about Kunark spell drops, Group Shrink, et al.<br />
<br />
When I talked to one of the guys on the Dev teams Friday night, he said he had read the &quot;Fan Faire concerns&quot; or whatever it was titled (up to 4 pages now) thread, and had seen what we were complaining about.  I didn't see any need to pound it into their head again other than another casual mention about how truly bad Kunark spell drops are.<br />
<br />
The woman who dressed up as a shaman was nice enough once you made it obvious you weren't ogling her for her assets and admired the work it went into making the outfit.  I chatted with her for a few minutes while she was playing EQ on Verant's computers for her hour of fun.  Her husband/boyfriend (?) was a bit stand-offish I agree.<br />
<br />
The Dev guy I spoke with also stated rather firmly that PoP WOULD RELEASE on time.  I was a bit unconvinced, and he repeated it again twice (almost a mantra it seemed), so I'm guessing there is a TON of pressure for on-time release.<br />
<br />
There are also SEPARATE teams for both Live content (alchemy) and PoP content.  So an alchemy revamp getting worked on before PoP is possible, though I agree seeing it finished before PoP release is doubtful.<br />
<br />
Separate from all this, Halas newbie quests are going to be worked on soon.  SOON.  They are working these actively, city by city.  Probably continue to roll them out one or two at a time each patch.  I begged for more of the Tribunal Initiate Quests (#2 &amp; #3), and the Dev fella said these would have to be added on someone's own time.  The guy who did the first quest is no longer an employee I think... :(<br />
<br />
It seems MOST of the really cool content was added by employees messing around on their unpaid time.<br />
<br />
During the FanFaire, they introduced a bunch of SOE/Verant employees.  There was a Barb Warrior (in kilt) who showed up, it seems he's in charge of all the PoP content if I heard things right.<br />
<br />
One final comment.  Employees (generally NOT the suits) read our boards on occasion.  It would probably help to keep the negativity OUT of the threads.  Complain in a manner conducive to receptive listeners instead of just b*tching so readers want to hit the &quot;back&quot; button after a few lines.  My 2cp on that subject.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I would normally agree that &quot;b*tching&quot; isn't the answer.  But after following the board for 2+ years (lurking mainly), seeing the Shaman community conduct themselves in a professional manner, we have gotten ZERO, Nada, Zilch.  While other classes whine b*tch moan and get results.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes the squeaky wheel gets the grease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">So THAT'S why the Tribunal Symbol hasn't gone past 1... despite the fact that newer race symbols were introduced much later and gone up to number 4 or whatever.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised there aren't more people posting that have gone to the Faire with their own info they have gathered (that low amount of shamans?).   I do thank Frekkils for his effort :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Arkand Eagleseeker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, I DID go to the Developer's Meeting. Both of them. Sorry, the Trade guy was just too dry. Something one of my friends reported from that which you missed cause it was in the second one...<br />
<br />
Dan opened his yap WIDE and revealed the Hard Caps are capable of coming off with PoP. Skills and stats can now all go above 255 right now since it was already patched, but they are CURRENTLY code capped at the old levels to keep them as is. Where will they go? He said that wasn't decided yet, but they at least had the option now.<br />
<br />
As for the developers...<br />
<br />
Arkand opeened HIS yap wide and asked about the Affliction Focus effects on debuffs and the Developer's stared dumbfounded. Feel free to rant and rave against me... 2.0 second Turgur's will likely be gone next patch. One of them tried to smooth it over, and thought they might leave it on some spells, but I think he was just trying to make me feel better. He did seem to indicate a debuff effect separate from Affliction might yet be added.<br />
<br />
Vex Thal stuff is being looked at for upgrade.<br />
<br />
A new particle effect system is already on your machine, including real lightning, and that's due to go live soon. That's probably the biggest leak from their side of things.<br />
<br />
All Legends changes will go to live servers after 1 month. Nothing will be held back.<br />
<br />
A new sound system is in the queue.<br />
<br />
Lots of ideas about how to deal with the bazaar. For now, make your viewport 1 pixel by 1 pixel and live with it.<br />
<br />
They seemed to be proud of un-nerfing DoTs vs. movement. When mentioned, there wasn't much comment from the crowd, so it wasn't a big thing except to the developers.<br />
<br />
Necro Lifeburn line is likely going to get serious looking at. (It has DoT agro and low HP agro, so it's suicide.) This might get them looking at general DoT agro. *crosses fingers*<br />
<br />
Valdanov is going to be looked at hard. Apparently, one developer found and read the Safehouse's thread on it and is familiar with the process they used to figure out where VZ is (and failed). None of them actually knew the quest, so none could confirm functionality.<br />
<br />
No real comment on 9th or 10th shawls.<br />
<br />
Ragefire got a general groan and a non-response. <br />
<br />
Cleric weapon-pet will likely get a re-tuning.<br />
<br />
Enchanters won't be getting Lures. For helping on raids, the Dev Team usggested trying out their pets, which now won't break Mez.<br />
<br />
They agreed to look into a number of quests and item complaints.<br />
<br />
Spell effect items triggering on casts may be given a disable option, but it will be local, not server side filtered.<br />
<br />
The casting/archery vs. target in wall problem is known, and it likely won't change. They believe it would require a major change to the core code, and it would be intially as buggy as the new UI. So it ain't happening. Same with auto-firing archery... known problem, is a problem, but the fix is so deep in the core code, they are not willing to tackle it.<br />
<br />
Manaburn insta-kills in PvP ARE a problem, and they know it. Expect something soon.<br />
<br />
Yes, 6 wizards killing Gorenaire is not unintended. But when mentioned that a Warrior could watch all week for Sever, call his raid friends, and then see six wizards gate straight to EJ and KS him before the Warrior's raid could get there, they seemed a little... regretful. You could see some changes on Sever/War epic soon, but that's just idle speculation.<br />
<br />
There was tons more. Tons and tons more. Mostly little, though, or class specific.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">MB needs to be nerfed without question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think its funny that VI says that PoP will be released on time. <br />
<br />
Luclin was released on time, and we all know that several zones were NOT finished, that several zones are an underdeveloped underitemized waste of time (Griegs? Mons Letalis?), that several Vah Shir quests are broken or unfinished up until today (progressive pottery quest is broken, progressive smithing quest is unfinished or a crude joke if you look at the reward), that Beastlords were not finished.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hail,<br />
<br />
Yes, that's her in the pic link above.  Though you can't see the detail on the Spear of Fate very well.  It was well done.  And it was better w/o the hauberk, looking very much like a shaman waiting for rez in the tube top. ;)<br />
<br />
As to tradeskills caps getting lifted, I posted about that at www.eqtraders.com which is where I felt it belonged.  Not too many tradeskillers here that I've seen, and most that do read both boards.  There was simply TOO much to throw in one post, so I covered what I thought would be important to us.  Visit Niami's site for more information, posted in the General and tradeskill specific forums.<br />
<br />
The artwork in question mentioned was for *NEW* epic weapons for PoP.  But only the artwork was done, none of the stats/effects/content was even started yet.  That was my impression anyway.  It seemed to be a slip on his part, and Dan changed the subject fast.<br />
<br />
Tanuden, the cider kept flowing that night until very late.  Should have stayed with us. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels of E. Marr</div></div><hr />

<br />
One note re: newbie quests though.  Send a note or 10 to the Developers forum to ask the developer who is workin on your newbie quests to learn the background of your class/race/guild(char guild).<br />
<br />
Heh, the Freeport Bard armor is called Songweavers &lt;blah&gt;.   But the name of the non-affiliated Kelethin Bards Guild is Songweavers.    The Songweavers are unrelated, faction-wise, in game to the Antonican Bards of Freeport.<br />
<br />
Heh, a wood elf bard is a Songweaver by default, but can't wear Songweaver armor.  All because the developer didn't know.<br />
<br />
So your Barbie Shammy may well run around in Greenblood Chain in a few weeks...<br />
<br />
J/K  I spoke with the developer and Absor at the FF.  The consensus was &quot;ooops, that is ****ed up, will need to look into that.&quot;<br />
<br />
They try, but there is no way these guys can know everything in game.<br />
<br />
Though I was surprised that no one else had mentioned this in the month or so since the Freeport stuff came out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Hah -- Meneldur -- I met you at the fanfaire. I was sitting next to you when you mentioned that to Absor. Funny...<br />
<br />
This just a minor issue though. Just a matter of naming something properly.</div></div><hr />
