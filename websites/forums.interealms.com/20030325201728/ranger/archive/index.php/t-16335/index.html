<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Forza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since this is the place to rant and rave this is where i'm going to do it.<br />
I know this game is a multi-player game and is designed for parties but I enjoy soloing. Thus the ranger class. It's supposed to be one of the best soloing classes they have.<br />
My bitch is once you get past the newbie quests there really isn't any other quests to go on where you don't need a group to complete. :mad: Or once you get high enough to go on the quest by yourself the reward isn't worth it.<br />
Am I missing the quest or am I just alone in this argument. I can't believe that everyone out there wants to party all the time. Don't get me wrong, I like to group also. But sometimes I want to accomplish things on my own. It makes me feel like I actually earned it and it wasn't just given to me.<br />
Oh well. Now that I finally got that out i guess I'll go find another group for my next quest. ;) See ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lol, agree with you there, but then EQ was meant to be a group interactive thing anyway. I solo 90% of my time but still I can't ever get the nice items. That's ok I guess in a way one just learns to live with it.<br />
<br />
BTW it gets worse as you get higher in level. Hehehe try fighting any mob in ME and you'll see what I mean. Soon you will not only Not be able to do a lot of nice quests alone but you will also have problems soloing mobs. Not impossible, just difficult...very difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>axis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hear you and second your opinion.I'm level 22 and i find that unless I group up I spend a lot of time dieing and retrieving my corpse.       MORE SOLO QUESTS!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nay, tis the lvl of difficulty.  If a ranger was able to completely solo a worthwhile quest, it would be farmed into oblivion by druids/wizards/etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try the Rallic Pack Pattern quest. Kill the Grimling Runner. (I just did it, because 1K is NOWHERE near worth the difficulty of this quest.) and turn his pouch in in Katta Castellum. Then go to Shadeweaver's Thicket and hunt Shadeling Silks, get a ton of them (two stacks or so) and make threads and such to randomly up your tailoring. Make the cord from three threads (This IS the hard part). Then go get a Perfect Owlbear Pelt from Hollowshade Moor. (Thank God for Fear Kiting). Whammo. You have a 10 slot, 85% Weight Reduction Backpack for little risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually I don't think that the questable item would be farmed to death. Look at it this way, if everyone knew that they could solo quest for the item (doesn't have to be an uber item, just something that's more useful than the usual stuff) then there would be no need for them to go and buy the item in the bazaar anymore would there. Thus there would be no incentive for anyone to farm those items.<br />
<br />
I don't know about anyone else but I always buy items in the bazaar that I can't solo to get. To me there's no point in buying items that I can solo for, even if there is a 90% chance that I will die in the attempt.</div></div><hr />
