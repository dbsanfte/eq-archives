<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>michael strong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there.  I have an issue typing in my hotkey macro's for spell sets.<br />
namely buffs. they wont work if i have all 5 lines with spells in them.<br />
if i decrease the number and set the pauses on alternate lines they work fine, but that is a pain in the %$@$ to have to have more than one hotkey devoted to a small buff set.<br />
<br />
ok heres what they look like<br />
<br />
/doability(), pause()<br />
/doability(), pause()<br />
x5<br />
<br />
if i put the pauses in between the spells they work fine. but i know i can put pauses in the lines as well,  what am i doing wrong?<br />
<br />
i have reviewed and checked the delays, and they are fine or more than adequate.  can someone post detailed format so i can make this work?  thank you .  merry christmas too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It actually needs to have the pause first, then what ever your doing...<br />
/pause X, /cast 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Judlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, for some reason, the /pause command needs to be first (with a comma after it and NO space before the /cast or /doability command), but it goes off AFTER the /cast command on the same line.<br />
<br />
So just enter the time to pause after the cast before the cast and it will work fine.  Five casts on one hotkey. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>michael strong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks everyone,  That worked like a charm, all i had to do was adjust the delays a little</div></div><hr />
