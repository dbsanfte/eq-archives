<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kanudil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone else get the same thing as me? Whenever I type /assist (insert random name here, or just /assist mob) and I heal immediatly after, the heal goes through, but it doesn't actually heal the person. I've tested this many times, even c5ing and then doing that. I've had this problem for a while (going as far back as PoP)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm...the typing of assist never seemed to work out well for me.<br />
<br />
Make a hotkey.<br />
<br />
THEN, before you heal, make sure that what you are healing is healable. (Do this by checking your target box) By that I mean, you can cast a heal on a MOB, but not only did you just waste {X} seconds, but you didn't heal jack.<br />
<br />
I have found when playing a healer, it was easier to use the 'F' keys.  I know there are easier ways than that - but playing a healer got me so  verklempt  I gave it up pretty quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After /assist you need a /pause 3 before any other command.  This let's your computer be targeted on the proper person for the next command in your macro to be executed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry to hickjack this thread, but I have a related question.<br />
I know there is a way to use assist to change target without automatically attacking the mob, but I can't find it. Can somebody tell me how I disable this autoattack on assist?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Risteezen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The command is &quot;/assist off&quot; and once you enter it you will never attack automatically from assist until you use &quot;/assist on&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Risteezen<br />
<br />
When I log on tonight, I will immediately change my assist hotkey to /assist off.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">@Kanudil: yes, there is an assistlag, i often slow the puller, while having the mob in my target and puzzle them often :)<br />
<br />
@Emmhim: you only have to type /assist off ONCE, and you will never turn on autoattack on when assisting. Its a toggle-command.<br />
<br />
the key must still stay either &quot;/assist&quot; or &quot;/assist &lt;name&gt;&quot;</div></div><hr />
