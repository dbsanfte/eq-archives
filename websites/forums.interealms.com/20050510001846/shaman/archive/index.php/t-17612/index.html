<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hear shaman talking alot about soloing the named mobs in UP, and I got to wondering how they do it.  I'm 63, decently equipped (I hope) and have Torpor.... So I was wondering about this.  First of all would be how in the world do you get them solo!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">either weave them around on the pull to a safe corner, or play in 3rd person view and move the mobs as adds come. its not hard at all, but takes focus.<br />
<br />
Torpor is the key and pet gear. The rest is just doing what shaman do, outlasting your opponet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Which named are we talking about here?  Zelnithak...Rumblecrush...Gantru Dralkenr?  Others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stuff like Gantru, Moktor, etc. Elysians are immune to disease and poison so you've got a LONG fight ahead of you, but the new magic-based dots would actually give you a shot.<br />
<br />
If you can solo Rumblecrush... erm... don't tell anybody. Zel *might* be doable, but he's got an awful lot of HP to try solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I remember hearing some of our more uber brethren talking about taking RC and Zelnithak.  Don't know how uber though.  :)<br />
<br />
I could use something to give my cash flow a jump start.  Got to be able to afford the Ornate.  LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah they post it on here, I think they said it took close to an hour and in the last 20-30pct of Zels life they had a cleric to heal them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In umbral, pulling is the most difficult part of the equation.  These days, I use my pet bard to pull (and snare, and debuff).  Before that, it is annoyingly difficult to single pull the named.  <br />
<br />
You *can* solo Gantru Raldukan, Gantru Dralkner, and the remainder of the lesser named quite easily.  There are some annoyingly resistant (ie: immune) mobs that its just not worth attempting, but fortunately they drop nothing of too much interest.  It *might* be possible to solo Zelnithak, but that would requrie a more than slightly uber shaman.  I would not consider Rumblecrush to be even remotely attemptable.  <br />
<br />
I've always wanted to try Radir Firestorm with either a duo, or a trio, but haven't managed to find the time yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can always if your a fast zoner, root adds along the way<br />
pull the named back to Zone In, then zone back and forth.<br />
<br />
Clearing Agro, and letting you come back clear.  Downside is if theres any other groups there they might kill the named ((either purposefully as its not a violation as you arent on the mobs agro list or accidently as the agro mob attacks them))<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah they post it on here, I think they said it took close to an hour and in the last 20-30pct of Zels life they had a cleric to heal them.<br />
<br />
Man this would be a nasty fight.  Zel has a buttload of hps.  It takes me<br />
a good 10 to 15 minutes to 3 box him with melee, druid, and shaman.<br />
Considering how that would lower my dps a ton easy by like 1/5th<br />
margin, yeah an hour would not surprise me.<br />
<br />
New Dot would help a lot.  As would BA item, As would Extended Detrimental item and Dot Efficiency.  <br />
<br />
Quiessence would match his DPS all right.  But youd be leaving it up close to full time allowing very little casting time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Isn't Zel immune to disease? that would kinda suck for soloin him ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I soloed Zelnithak and not aware of many others soloing him. Hes very tough I almost died like 6 times before I got to the  stage of vt/ep equipped. <br />
and with aa like lr5, i tried with ca3 before that and only got him to 89% using all my mana. Not worth soloing unless you want to challenge yourself.  <br />
<br />
Wtih 250 dr resisted all his AE, just his flurries hurt ALOT. I had to slow like every 3-4%- he is pretty easily magic slowable also make sure cripple on it.<br />
<br />
Some named in UP to do are corrupted elysian elders, A Shak Dhak Warlord(drops dathor great hammer rarely), Gantru Dalkenr(30k hp but his dps is very low when slowed) Fallen Seargent if hes up. <br />
My advice is possibly to  have a druid alt like lvl 24 mine is and get used to UP and have it bound in UP. And with track you get used to where stuff is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh and the last 20-30% it was like last 10-20% and the cleric only did some melee. I was sitting on 60m=p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kayleigh88</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hear shaman talking alot about soloing the named mobs in UP, and I got to wondering how they do it.

<br />
I have duo-ed Tawro with a necro. I think we ITUed to the Swarm-guy, killed him, then regular inviz to the Spirit, kill the spirit, then Tawro pops, then kill Tawro. I am very sure he can be soloed by someone that is moderately uber. he only hits in the mid-300s. Just make sure when fighting in caves that you make sure they stay away from the walls. i have a screenshot of me fighting the swarm-guy under the world because he gated there and summoned me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mcroc, thats so unbelievable. I also have a 24 druid bound there to track named. She is very useful for pulling them too to the zone, then zoning and logging in Urd.<br />
<br />
Bascisally, a non uber with Torpor can take Dralkner, Raldukan, Fallen Sergeant, Shak Dathor Warlord and the Corrupted Elysian. Zelniak requires damn good gear and AA's. Tawro requires decent equipment as well as crucial AA's. Swarmcaller is easy (although pointless, he only spawns a ring cycle). Good luck with the kills.<br />
<br />
Dralkner is on 8 hour spawn, and wanders from the rocks opposite ME entrance to the left towards the fallen soldier hills.</div></div><hr />
