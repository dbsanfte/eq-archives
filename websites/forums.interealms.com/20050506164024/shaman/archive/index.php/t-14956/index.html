Some guy in the nexus decided to turn his corpses into art. I must say I was pretty impressed<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've seen that in nexus before... the only problem is that if you are running a mediocre computer and you turn the corner and see that your FPS falls through the floor. Hard to _stop_ looking at it after you turn towards it! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The pattern of corpses comes from someone doing mass sacrifices (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1768&amp;source=Live) to a necro. Probably a high level player who is quitting or deleting their character.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Saw a low level druid do this in EC.  He would cast Treeform on himself and then have a buddy whack him.  He would then drag his Tree Corpse to the opening to the EC Tunnel and made it a nice sized forest outside.  <br />
<br />
Of course, lag went through the roof, he got yelled at and petioned bunches, still it was cool coming over the sand dunes and seeing the EC Grove   :D <br />

<br />
1.  the char is listed as lvl 65 even after all of those deaths?  I lose 11 percent of my lvl per death and i am only mid 50s.<br />
<br />
2.  a corpse always points north.  it is not possible to 'arrange' corpses so that they face another direction.</div></div><hr />

Umm....try this:<br />
It's easy, ya die, go drag your body and position it where you want <br />
<br />
<br />
1 level 65 character with equipment banked + 1 cleric friend with epic and lots of time= naked level 65 character with about 100 corpses.<br />
<br />
Just about anything is possible, all it takes is a few rescources and some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Also, you don't lose XP if you die in a duel.<br />
<br />
His #2 is a real problem, though.  I don't think you can change the orientation of a corpse, can you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Your direction on death determines the orientation of the corpse. They certainly do not all point north.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Also, dragging your corpse around to change it's orientation is not as easy as it sounds.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't think corpses point north, simply 'cause all ya gotta do is pay attention after a raid wipe... all the corpse point every which way... they certainly don't point all one direction.<br />
<br />
It's not that hard folks --- you bind yourself in the Nexus, get killed somehow (DoT yerself, /d, whatever), and each time you die, you just turn a fraction of a degree from the previous death.  Perfect circular pattern.  No dragging involved.  Losta time and general goofiness required though....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Man, I thought this was gonna be the necrophilia thread :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This is a very old subject.  The true way you do this is to simply bind where you want to create the &quot;flower&quot; at and then kill yourself, through whatever means, over and over again at that same position, rotating slightly until the flower is created.  I guess you could drag corpses to wherever, like someone else said, but that'd be slightly annoying and tedious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">ok, i was wrong...<br />
<br />
you can die over and over in a duel as stated without losing exp.<br />
<br />
you can bind and then keep turning at bind point to get the pattern.<br />
<br />
- I wanted to see if it was possible, so i created a newbie, got bound by a guard and blasted the guard every time i spawned (after i turned a little).  Then I realized that I didn't really care if it could be done or not...  I would rather buff newbies than create a newbie and get killed over and over, lol.<br />
<br />
PS.  What happened to the chars Sittin and Spinnin on the Bristlebane server.  It was quite comical to see them standing outside of the bank in pok every time I went there.  Sittin was always squating beside the door and Spinnin was always standing there spinning in a circle.  They where there every time I went to the pok bank for atleast a week!  I wish I would have grabbed a snapshot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Takeshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Kittyshaman, please notice that the character who took the picture is a level 65 Shaman by the name of Skitzoid, whereas the character who formed the corpse pile is a Wood Elf, meaning he is not a Shaman, named Tirc.</div></div><hr />
