<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ven Dragnborn</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has recently decided that we are going to start going to places like CoM, Lguk and the like and seem to have the opinion that only, and I mean ONLY monks  are qualified to pull.<br />
I've been trying to convince them that we are capable of thinking &quot;outside the box&quot; with what we have available without resorting to &quot;pharming&quot; for  outside  help.<br />
No one seems to want to listen and one of my posts on ttte subject was &quot;rude and insulting&quot; when that wasn't the intent. All I had meant to do was  say if we aren't going to listen to alternatives then why bother. <br />
But they seem stuck on the idea that if we were to go to CoM with OUT a monk, we will wipe period.<br />
What are your views and opinions.<br />
Am I wrong to think we could do it without a monk? I need honest answers from the people who know hence I come here.<br />
Thanks guys<br />

Your guild needs to realize that you dont need to FD split mobs... if you watch and learn your pathing, you can harmony pull mobs all day and night long there.<br />
<br />
Heh, My guild doesnt let me pull unless Im running the raid tho :p  I tend to be.... erm, pretty adventerous in my pulling :) If there aint 10 mobs... what fun are they to kill? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ven Dragnborn</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are some quotes from our board:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I too have raided CoM on more than one occassion. Here's my opinion, too efectively preform that raid we will need at least one solid group of nukers, preferabbly wizards with lures. we would need three to four groups of melee each having a 50+ cleric and if at all possible one or two with their epics so they can click rez, it may be important to get people back as fast as humanly possible. At least one of the melee groups would need to have three to four 50+ warriors and it may be stretching it too say that we could include the rest of the melees at a lvl of 35+ at least one 50+ monk is needed<br />
<br />
<br />
and we'll need someone to pull who<br />
can then feign death well. Monks are best but a sk<br />
could suffice too, though it's harder for them (spell<br />
to cast vs skill). A key point is that the puller has<br />
to be able to split the pulls or it will be a guaranteed<br />
wipeout. The mobs back there are just too tough for<br />
us to face in multiples, esp if a reaver is in the mix.<br />
<br />
I happen to know a 50+ monk who's an excellent<br />
puller and fd-er and will contact him as well as<br />
another option.<br />
<br />
If you'll glance down our roster, you'll see several 50+ druids, 50+ warrior, 50ish warrior, 50ish cleric, 50ish enchanter, mid 40s cleric, shaman, wizards, echanters, druids, rangers, and more mid 30s characters can you can shake a stick out<br />
<br />
The cool thing about using a monk to pull over using<br />
a harmony pull (whether the regular ranger harmony<br />
one or an indirect harmony pull) is the<br />
monk is in direct control of how the pull is going.<br />
Too many adds? FD and wait for things to walk away.<br />
Have a long run back to the group with mobs in the<br />
way? FD saves you again. <br />
<br />
FD is the safest way.. period.. hehe..<br />
But il face the fact that fd pulls arent allways easy.. and might take time.. and might not work EVERYWHER.. but atleast noone gets killed.. .. thing is.. u aggro the mobs in a chain.. 1 2 3 4 5 .. <br />
<br />
<br />
Chanters have a tendancy to die IF something goes wrong.. u can do it a lot of times.. but at some point.. someting will go wrong.. thats eq in a nutshell.. .. having that FD is sweet sweet sweet.... ive never seen a plane raid.. or anything beyond that.. use a chanter to pull.. they rather use a warrior and die for real.. then pick off stuff as it leaves..<br />
<br />
<br />
monks are the melee pullers. and dmg dishers.. but not tanks.. but the FD is soo nice to clear your aggro..and beeing a skill.. it rarely fizzles.. and rarely takes much time to get done.. <br />
<br />
, #1 you HAVE to have a Monk with out a monk or ideally 2 monks your not going to be successfull you WILL wipe, no if ands or buts about it. #2 you have to have rogue and this rogue has to know what he is doing or you cant for one get into the temple let alone get to where the black reavers spawn , <br />
<br />
<br />
This is what I'm up against</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BP</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">huh ? are they raiding the same com as the rest of us ? need nukers with lure ? 3 to 4 melee groups ???<br />
<br />
*boggle* the only thing that needs more then one group in CoM is lord Rak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baram</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/applaud Ven<br />
<br />
In the end game a group of 3 people can do all of CoM if one of the persons is a mage.  For everything including the reavers and the named, a ranger, cleric, mage is sufficient if they are CoM veterans.  Of course this isn't the most expedient way to get it done, but it shows your line of thinking put to the nth level to be valid.<br />
<br />
Speaking of a 50ish level raid, there really isn't an absolute need for any specific class if you know what to do.  CoH works fine for splitting mobs if that is necessary, but I highly suggest not splitting the yard trash.  Those mobs are meant for aoe or to be pulled in bunches of 7 or 8 to keep the raid moving along.  And if you wish to skip the locked door which leads to the reavers area there are spots you are able to gflux a mage up for coh to relatively safe spots.  Easier just to have a rogue lockpick the door for you, but not absolutely necessary.  <br />
<br />
Finally, to split the reavers, if your guild should wish to do so, coh + any class that can take a few hits (rangers included) is sufficient for splitting them if the ranger/mage work well together.   <br />
<br />
Of course, unless your guild is comprised of those willing to experiment it is unlikely they will support such ideas, but you are right in your thinking imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ven Dragnborn</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback so far guys. I know I am still a &quot;newbie&quot; to this game and thats exactly why I came here to look for advice. I *DON'T* know  when I am wrong and when I'm right. <br />
We aren't an &quot;Uber&quot; guild by any stretch yet I think we have the capabilities to do more on our own than we give ourselves credit for. And it saddens me to think we may be  selling ourselves short and limiting our options for raids and such.<br />
<br />
Just tonight, a group went to Kael but I'm &quot;too little&quot; to try it. Maybe I am but I was willing to risk it on myself even if I wasn't included in a group.  If I can't try something, hhow will I know if its possible or not. By the same token, if I can't convince people that things can be done differently than conventional thinking says how to do, how will we ever know?<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't really ask my guild for anything. The last couple months RL issues have kept me from playing regularly so everyone is passing me by. I'm soloing almost all the time now and when I make suggestions, they are poopooed or totally disregarded as  useless. I'm not sure what to do<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Out of 26 posts on this particular matter only two was supportive of me and when I  edited my post about why bother if the person posting  different thinking ideas are going to be treated as 5 year olds I was told I shouldn't have deleted my post.</div></div><hr />

I have personally as a CLERIC pulled CoM, I used three spells, DA, DB, Strike (level 5 dd)... Saying you need a monk to FD pull etc AND enchanters means one of two things:<br />
<br />
1. Your enchanters never bought their mezz spells or are completly incompetent so it goes either way. Your clerics also never bought the CH spell because someone told them it was a waste of pp.<br />
2. The raid leader is a complete moron that got exactly no clue on what a class can and can not do and was told that his friends best buddy cousins uberguild on another server that cleared Ssra whiped in there with 20 people...<br />
<br />
Somehow I tend to lean on 2. I would also suggest you start looking for a new guild with people who actually play the game and learn something from playing it...<br />
<br />
Besides, if you want some REALLY fun so should you let me pull the first reavers :p. Oh look there are 6 mobs behind the door, lets AoE pull them out ... A little tip, AoEs really need to cut their limit in height (; Though it was a quick way to get the reavers down and they did die even though it was a tad hectic a while to.<br />

but needing a monk or more than 1 group to do anything in Lowr Guk is funny! Funny enough to make me laugh<br />
<br />
HAHHAHAHAH &lt;--- see that, I'm laughing<br />
<br />
99.9% of my exp from 32-45(what i'm currently at) has been done in lower guk, and I'd say about 40% of the time I pull, and 90% of the time someone pulls that does not have FD, so only 10% of my groups in Lower Guk have had a monk/sk/necro puller.<br />
<br />
Don't mean any offense by this, but your guild sounds like its heading into the zerg way of thinking, which is of course, we need no skills, we can kill stuff with 300 people intead! RAR!!<br />

I recently led a raid to COM, had one group.  We killed everything, except that rak guy.  Somehow we got the top reaver to warp to the bottom with no adds(still haven't figured that out).  You definitely don't need no 3-4 groups.  As for pulling, we had a 60 Rogue doing it for us, she did a great job, maybe one to 2 adds at most at a time, but the chanter, oh wait no chanter.  We just tanked them off.  Only time we died was when she pulled 2 reavers and one kept spliting into another reaver.  Oh, and by the way.. I was tanking ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rangers are far superior pullers in CoM because of Harmony, amongst other things.<br />
<br />
Sounds like your guild has their brains stuck in the box.  (or their head stuck in their @$$).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Learon</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last time I went to CoM we did it with 1 group consisting of 60 chanter, 60 monk, 60 war, 58 war, 57 rog and a 53 cleric. Yes it is a powerful group but I am certain it can be done with less. At the time I was playing the cleric and we killed everything but lord rak and got us a nice reaver which I was awarded for my ranger... :)<br />
<br />
The only 2 deaths we had was when we were leaving and 2 of us managed to fall off one of the top bridges. 10 k fall damage hurts for just about anyone. :p<br />
<br />
As for who should be pulling I am certain that we rangers are just as good pullers as the FD'ers with only one exception. I have never managed to get the reavers on top of the elevator single. That is the only place I think an FD puller is needed unless the raid can handle multiple reavers at once.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts on the subject and good luck in CoM, it's a great zone!</div></div><hr />

I'd rather have the monk do it most of the time.  /shrug<br />
<br />
I think I am just tired of pulling for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well in truth we've done CoM with 3+ groups before.  It can make a good training ground raiding, following directions, and working together.   But then we've also done it with 5 people before.  <br />
<br />
Use the tools that you have to scout areas and learn the spawn points.  Use harmony to help minimize over pulls.  Use Bind sight, have mages/wizards use their Eye spell, heck bind sight their eye so you can see the spawns.  Then it's just a matter of approaching it to harmony the spawn without getting aggro.<br />
<br />
In truth the largest problem in a big CoM raid is people not following directions, opening doors when their not supposed to, falling off the skyway, or watching their pet path off into never never land.  <br />
<br />
And always, if you're pulling, and you don't know if youre going to get more than your group/s can handle, then just stand there and die.  Eat the death, /consent a rogue get a rez and go on down the road with a lesson learned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did they upgrade City of Mist into a L50+ zone on Rodcet Nife? Did they need all that firepower so they can go kill Trakanon or raid Temple of Veeshan right after?<br />
<br />
<br />
I find it hard to believe that your guild is talking about the same City of Mist that I hunted for exp several times while in the 40s and did pulling on top of that. I didn't like the funky pathing or mob ghosting so didn't do it a lot. Harmony is your friend in this zone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are places where I would automatically let my guild monks pull because with FD, it's easier. But in COM, a ranger owns that zone. I can single pull reavers and anything else I want simply because, as an outdoor zone, I can harmony whatever I don't want to pull and then pull what I do want.<br />
<br />
For instance, we always pull the elevator reavers down to the throne room on the first floor. The way we do this is a rogue sends me up the elevator, and I drop invis to aggro the two nearest mobs and then jump down the elevator shaft. We kill those 2 and after that, I can ride the elevator up and start dropping harmony of other mobs and then single pull. The only tricky part is getting line of sight when one of the reavers insists on standing just inside the door to the next room at the top of the stairs.</div></div><hr />

It can be done with 2 groups of 50+ if they know what they are doing.  Multiple spawns might be a problem, but they don't happen all that often.<br />
<br />
I hunted CoM for exp back in the day and got sick of waiting for a monk to FD split the mobs (our groups kinda sucked there, so wasn't really able to take on adds) so when he went AFK I started harmony pulling.  Went MUCH faster.<br />
I could pull reavers if I was so inclined to do so, but prefer the safer bet of letting a monk do it if they're available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ven Dragnborn</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope no one got the impression that I was bashing Monks. In no way would I do that. They  are  great pullers and damage dealers and I'm not trying to take anything away from Monks at all.<br />
Here is a breakdown of my guilds forces  at this time:<br />
<br />
1-9.......... 29 <br />
10-19 .....44 <br />
20-29..... 22 <br />
30-39 .....27 <br />
40-49 .....18 <br />
50-60 .....17 <br />
 This is actually going to be plus or minus about 3 due to some leaveing and new recruits since the graph was updated. This counts Alts  with Mains combined<br />
<br />
Count by Class :<br />
<br />
COUNT BY CLASSES <br />
Bard 9 <br />
Beastlord 7 <br />
Cleric 14 <br />
Druid 18 <br />
Enchanter 9 <br />
Magician 4 <br />
Monk 7 <br />
Necromancer 15 <br />
Paladin 5 <br />
Ranger 13 <br />
Rogue 12 <br />
Shadowknight 8 <br />
Shaman 13 <br />
Warrior 17 <br />
Wizard 9 <br />
<br />
Again,  plus or minus as I know of 2 Rangers and one Wizard thats left recently. I don't have a breakdown of class  levels but I could go through our roster and  detail that as well.<br />
<br />
So anyway, as you can see I have my work cut out for me  in teaching my guild just what we Rangers as well as other classes are able to do. And with the attitudes I am encountering, its gonna be a long row to hoe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since CoM is an outdoor zone, you can single pull anything in there with enough time with harmony.<br />
<br />
I sometimes will have a monk split pull the Reavers up the elevator because it's faster, but I can certainly do it without them.<br />

In any zone that is outdoors, NOTHING beats a Ranger for pulling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Track, Harmony, root, snare, jolt, long distance pulling, splitting up packs of mobs. No other class has the tool set we have for outdoor pulling.<br />
<br />
Harmony, pull 1, root it and snare, pull 2, snare it, pull 3 and take to camp, you are almost garaunteed a nice steady stream of critters entering camp so long as you pay attention to spawn times and what gets pulled when.<br />
<br />
Most Chanters hate Rangers because we turn them into buff beetches, nothing to &quot;crowd control&quot; makes em cranky it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kirec</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in a group a long time ago (mid-Kunark) - ranger (me, tanking), bard, enchanter, rogue, and cleric.  We went to the top of CoM, got the chanter his epic piece, got me a Woodsman's Staff, and went back down all without a single death and we got great exp.<br />
<br />
Anyone who tells you monks are *necessary* to pull CoM is nuts.  Anyone who tells you that you need more than one 57+ group to do the entire city minus Rak is nuts too.<br />
<br />
With lower levels it might be a bit tougher, but certainly nothing too hard to handle.  CoM is a challenge for guilds who have never done it, but that doesn't disqualify rangers from being able to pull; in fact, rangers and druids are probably the best pullers there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skex</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I run CoM raids regularly on Bristlebane. We generally have two groups 46-60. I tend to prefer 2 groups because I'm all about overkill, but to be honest for pulling CoM I let our rogues do it just so they don't have to screw around with playing door man for other classes. <br />
<br />
I use this raid mainly to work on raiding skills and meeting potential guildmates ( and to get JR's for our guildies who need them). But frankly for the most part Harmony pulling is a waste of time with these mobs with the exception of the Reavers, any force that can take down a reaver can take down 5-6 of the regular mobs with no problem. With a solid team who know how to keep their heads and use their assist keys the whole place is a breeze add a chanter and forget about stress.<br />
<br />
Tonight we cleared all but the top most Reaver (mainly a time thing)  and Rak with 2 groups with no crowd control a couple rogues one cleric several rangers and druids 2 warriors and one wizzy. No mages no bards no monky and no Chanter. <br />
Our only death was our assasin who sacrificed to split a pair of reavers (that one dropped the JR so his sacrifice wasn't in vain) <br />
The only hairy point in the night was when we had 5 repops off of one reaver (glad we didn't have 6 might have cost us some additional lives had that been the case)<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that Rangers can't pull CoM its just that for the most part rogues are the best pullers for CoM just because of the damn locked doors.</div></div><hr />

RAWR.<br />
<br />
it's based on levels really, outlevel the monks and pulling ... when you reach a higher level and wont aggro many of them, ranger pulling becomes accepted (i pull in umbral all the time) but until then, you'll get adds. in CoM you can harmony (which owns) .. but in Lfuk .. err guk .. you would prolly be best with a level51 melee or a 40ish monk. <br />
<br />
and who cares if you get an add ?  =) Keeps chanters feeling useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaen</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think most people in this thread missed the part of the guild raid being *primarily* level 30's. It's going to be pretty damn rough for level 30s to &quot;do&quot; CoM. I can see where the guild leader doesn't want to take many risks with the whole family along for the ride. It can be pretty frustrating, especially for people that low level and not very familiar with raiding. People posting saying &quot;Duh, it should only be 1 group of 60s to clear CoM&quot; are just too busy bragging and missed the point of raid. The fact that they want click sticks and some lure based wizzies sounds like a good backup to ensure the 30's dont die 5 billion times without losing too much exp and getting frustrated. <br />
<br />
I can also see why he wants a monk to do the pulling, it sounds as if the guild leader just wants to be cautious with so many low level people attending. Which is a smart thing to do when they might be up against black reavers. One reaver would instntly wipe out 5 groups of 30s alone if they weren't careful, let alone 3-4 that come sometimes by a goofed pull.<br />

LGuk would be fine since a lot of mobs there are geared to level 30-50 .. where CoM is more geared 40 - 60.</div></div><hr />

come one come all ( if ur 35 + )..  &lt;-------- see that????<br />

Between Via and FoF it looks to me like<br />
we can field a good number of low to high 40s, some 50s &lt;------<br />
and a 60 or two.<br />
<br />
<br />
so no this is not a bunch of 30's heading into these zones. I'm not even invited at 34. No biggie. I'm just not wanting  my CLASS  left out in the cold because no one thinks about what we are capable of. I DON'T want my guild to have the &quot;Kunark&quot; mentality  about Rangers. Every one of the people that have  talked down to me in my guild are in the 40 plus crowd.  Just because they may have played longer than I have doesn't mean I cannot contribute. And the reason I feel  qualified TO contribute is because I do what I have done here. I asked advice  of those that KNOW.<br />

Ven, you're right in that most of the zone is readily<br />
handable by Via in a 'normal' raid or hunt, if we<br />
had a solid turnout especially with a solid 40s turnout<br />
<br />
and we'll need someone to pull who<br />
can then feign death well. Monks are best but a sk<br />
could suffice too, though it's harder for them (spell<br />
to cast vs skill).<br />
<br />
<br />
I was also told &quot;harmony pulling would only work in outside zones (Duh, I mentioned that fact) on orcs and dervs<br />
<br />
The exact quote:<br />
In my humble opinion, this method would only<br />
work in an outdoor area against a camp similar<br />
to an orc or dervish camp<br />
<br />
<br />
Now you sit there and tell me my class was not totally disrespected right there.<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
This method would seem very risky with long distance pulling against tough mobs and it wouldn't work in a deep pull where there were mobs potentially spawning along the way between the main group and the target mob's camp. <br />
<br />
The black reaver area is an example of a spot where I<br />
believe this method would likely not work as the mobs are<br />
too tough as the pull to the safe place for the main group is<br />
a bit long and its a deep pull with many spawning spots<br />
<br />
<br />
The cool thing about using a monk to pull over using<br />
a harmony pull  is the monk is in direct control of how the pull is going.<br />
Too many adds? FD and wait for things to walk away.<br />
Have a long run back to the group with mobs in the<br />
way? FD saves you again. Allows for deep pulls with<br />
consistent results. From what I've observed, monks<br />
that develop a talent for FD pulling can really fine tune<br />
their pulls to get what they want very consistently.<br />
The main group is not put at risk from a bad pull as the<br />
monk can stop the pull before reaching the group.<br />
<br />
<br />
NOW do you see? Does this  tell you the attitude I'm getting ?<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: I was wondering why a Ranger in my guild quit the other week. I mean totally out of the game quit. This type of attitude  has me considering the Tree as well. And not to trade in for another character. I love my Ranger, but if I'm not allowed to use my skills to thier fullest potential, whats the point? NO other class can even beGIN to  encompass what  a Ranger is.</div></div><hr />

huh ? are they raiding the same com as the rest of us ? need nukers with lure ? 3 to 4 melee groups ???<br />
<br />
*boggle* the only thing that needs more then one group in CoM is lord Rak. <br />
<br />
/agree  CoM is doable in one group...even lord Rak (yes, even if you don't have a single mage).   Levels = power and so the higher levels you have the fewer people you'll need.  Any nukers that don't have lures are pretty useless when it comes to the major mobs in this zone.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Just do a search here.  There were a couple of posts I read specifically describing harmony pulling in CoM.</div></div><hr />

Id say ranger can pull anything besides the reavers with ease using harmony in there as long as u are like 40 +lvls.<br />
As for doin CoM without rogue it was interesting took us a while to figure out how to pull the Mage epic split reaver but once done we had key to elevator and rest was a breeze.<br />
(we were there to get Rak to pop at an easy to get to and fight spot for later use)<br />
<br />
Hmm Tirae how do u do Rak without mage? just wondering.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were doing everything in there short of Lord Rak and the elevator room with 1 group when we were in our low 50s.  And I'm talking about no monks.  Now that we're 60, we do the elevator room with 1 group too.  We just rush in and kill them.  No wizards, no harmony, no monks, just kill them.  CoM is an ideal zone for a single group of low-mid 50s.  The stuff in there is generally easier than Sebilis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When we went to clean up the last bits for shammy epic (Rak and Neh) we had<br />
<br />
60 shaman<br />
60 warrior (from leetest guild)<br />
60 cleric (who has about the most mana in all of EQ)<br />
53 ranger (me, non-epic)<br />
2 mid-50s epic rogues<br />
<br />
Doing Rak, we really just left it to the warrior and cleric...the rest of us couldn't take the AE dmg.  We used the hallways (Rak was in the corner room as you start to go up towards skyways) to protect all but the warrior from the AE.  The rest of us kept the hallways clear of mobs during the fight.</div></div><hr />
