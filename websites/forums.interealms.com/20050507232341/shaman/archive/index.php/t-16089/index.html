<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ohiaightya Lassnite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone knows if the EQShaman site is going to upgrade to where ppl can find more Froglok quests and there are other quests and stuff that they are lacking. For some reason I cant find much about Frogs, Like where they are KoS and safe areas. I know there are areas where you have to raise faction. I have been killing Giants in Great Divide and Kael and just tagging in some cases for faction purposes and checking in Coblt Scar and it hasnt changed. If anyone has any info to share, please do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This board is not associated with that scumbag ebayers site.  You have been mislead by the scumbag ebayer owner of that site into thinking that this site has anything at all to do with eqshaman.com.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Isoka, Gandalf isnt pissed about this board, he's pissed about the EQShaman/Mysupersales crap thang</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well one the reasons your not seeing a change in your CoV faction is the KOS to CoV faction is VERY deep and takes ALOT of hits like several thousand if I remember right to get out of.  The regular Gaints in GD and EW and the ones near the zone in Keal are only worth one faction hit AFAIK.  For bigger hits to your CoV faction your going to need to kill giants in the Areana or one those named in Western Wastes which both ussually take a group.  The ones in Waking Lands might have bigger hit as well.  But I honestly dont know about them as I have not fought them.  The one time I did do CoV faction I did it with my wizard Quad Kiting and it took forever.  Best of luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Religion, of course, has a big part to play in just about all faction dealings, as well.  Consider that a Rallos worshipper will have a pretty easy time becoming accepted with Velious giants, compared to other religions.  I've also heard you can make a human bard that worships Veeshan, who'll be accepted by Claws of Veeshan faction...  but haven't tested it, yet.<br />
<br />
So the short answer is that your religion may make it easier or harder than your friends will have it.  As far as what's particular to frogs?  Mithaniel, isn't it?  Depends on how far Mithaniel is considered from Veeshan...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Re-read my post please, there was nothing bashing the question or the original poster.  All of the bashing was directed at Yantis the scumbag ebayer.  <br />
<br />
Yantis uses this board to field questions about shaman and lend his scumbag ebayer site legitimacy.  As far as I know, Sunmoon asked him to remove the link to the crucible from the eqshaman site and Yantis did not comply.  That is flat out rude.<br />
<br />
If we don't make a point of distancing ourselves from Yantis and his scummy business, we will end up like the monks, completely cut off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were cut off before the Yantis link went up.  But that Yantis business made a nice, neat, after-the-fact explanation for people to bitch about.</div></div><hr />

When you see repeated posts by Absor saying he isn't going to post on the monk board because of the Yantis garbage, you would think it would sink in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok, my apologize so ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ohiaightya Lassnite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well since I am still fairly new at playing EQ I am still figuring out the places to go for info and a little guidence, not to be told some smack about how some one feels about whatever. I respect peoples oppinions and everything, I am just wanting to be the best Shaman I can be and get to the point where I am wanted in a group because of my skills, not just because I can buff the group. or because I am the only Shammy that is running around lost with a LFG tag over my head. But if it wasnt for that site, I wouldnt have found this one. And I think that this one has been FAR MORE helpful then that has and I am glad I found it. I have gain alot of knowledge reading what people have to say in here and I am thankful.<br />

<br />
<br />
Yup, cause if we dont trash EQshaman and boycott it at every second and use hate and anger to drive anyone away that even says the word EQshaman, then Absor might not post here and talk to us like he does now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh wait ... http://smilies.jeeptalk.org/contrib/ruinkai/wscared.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hi Litgruv, here is a &lt;a href = &quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=exaggeration&quot;&gt;word&lt;/a&gt; that describes your response for ya :P<br />
<br />
Please re-&lt;a href = &quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=read&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; the post again, any &quot;hate and anger&quot; is directed at Yantis, not the original poster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yea, i like that site too, but that doesnt change the point i was making, which was Absor doesnt post here or interact with us either way. <br />
<br />
Oh and dont take things so personal bud, i didnt mean to ruffle your feathers. If you need a hug send a PM, no one has to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Absor does post here, do a search for AbsorEQ :)<br />
<br />
And yeah, I'll take that hug now....</div></div><hr />

Read the threads and listen to the amount of attention they get. Its one thing to show up and give advertisement or a PR appearence like in our last &quot;interaction&quot; http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13026 and its entirly another to get involved with a class issue and attempt to solve it.<br />
