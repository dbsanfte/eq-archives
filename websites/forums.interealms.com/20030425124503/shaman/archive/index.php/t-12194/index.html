That's my magelo. You will notice the lack of epic, the lack of hp, ac, wisdom and so on.<br />
<br />
I've never been overly concerned about my equipment as it's not really hindered my play anywhere. In groups and raids I have enough HP to canni 5 comfortably all the time, so mana is never a problem. The only times I really feel the sting of my equipment is when I try to solo for fast xp, or when I duel in arena and am vastly outclassed in equipment.<br />
<br />
I still need to buy a few spells (shouldn't cost more than 75k or so) then I will have all the 64-65 spells I want (namely Fot7 + 2 pop dots). I have the rest of the 61-65 spells. I have a strange tendency to blow cash on alts that I should probably give up. <br />
<br />
Whenever I go farming for cash I /lfg on because farming is really quite boring. This usually barely leaves me enough time to get to camp and set out pet before I get called by someone. <br />
<br />
I don't really have a schedule that allows for raiding with a guild (I used to be in one that did SoL, NToV, SSRA, now they are moving into VT). I left before I got anything more than the Vindi BP though. <br />
<br />
Basically I am looking for some cheap fast ways to make my gear less.......embarassing. HP and resists are the main things I am looking for atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not that bad off :P<br />
<br />
  Neck: tracking wolf collar<br />
  Back: Heirophant's Cloak<br />
  Shield: Tae Ew Shield(smithed), Orb of the infinite void<br />
  Legs: Tae Ew Leggings(smithed)<br />
 <br />
<br />
That should do you quite well. If you have a friend that is a high level smith you can go to CT and farm the Tae Ew blood that is needed for the Tae Ew armour.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I cannot suggest the Tae Ew stuff enough. They sell in the bazaar for outrageous prices. So the solution? get it yourself. There are probably about 100 or so 250skill smiths on your server, and you're looking for one of the 5 of them that isn't greedy and does combines for free. Iw as lucky enough to form a friendship with a 65 ranger in my local Uberguild and he has done 2 tae ew combines for me so far and to quote him &quot;ask me if you ever need another smithing job done free of charge.&quot;<br />
<br />
At level 65, with the 61 pet and all, soloing the Tae ew lizards will be a walk in the park. there is a guide on this page. Read it. From looking at your equip it seems that you have the breastplate category covered. I would craft a Tae Ew Shield (stats damn near as good as the BP) and possibly the greaves or armplates. Really I farmed all of the ingredients for BOTH my BP and Shield in under 5 hours of work. However it did take me more like 10 or 15 hours to find a smith willing to work with me.<br />
<br />
So once you get yourself some tae ew stuff, It really comes down to a choice. you can either farm money and buy yourself good equip, or join a raiding guild and fight for uber equip. its up to you and very dependant on how much time you're willing to invest in the game.</div></div><hr />

I am also L65 and look at my equipments u will prolly laugh your ass off.<br />
I can easily be the worst equiped L65 Shaman across all servers.</div></div><hr />

wish i could sayi was in full skyshrine but i am not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My gear blows too, but less so since I spent some time in PoM.  <br />
<br />
The boots in PoM are sure nice.  I probably made a mistake blowing 2 thrones on the helm, given that the Circlet is really better.  But it gives me some options in the event I ever get a focus item again.</div></div><hr />
