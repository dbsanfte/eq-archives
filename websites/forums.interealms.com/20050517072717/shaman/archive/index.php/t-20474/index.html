<br />
Why not Shaman?<br />
<br />
I'm tired of dying when trying to do something as simple as get to the GoD trials in zones in barundi when invis drops.   It is a real burden on the rest of the group to drag my corpse, reze me, and wait for rez-effects to drop.  Even worse if we don't have a chanter or druid in group for mana regen buff.<br />
<br />
I would be happy enough with an improved invis potion costing 10pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is an improved invisibility potion that can be made, not sure if you know or not if so ignore this post. The bad part about it was when I left eq was the rareness of the parts to make it. Not sure if the forage rate has improved or not. There is also phase Spider Blood but that is lore and 1 charge only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry to disappoint, but the LDON potion made with foraged components has been proven not to be improved invis.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah, information has proven otherwise since I have left eq. Ok I stand corrected. I don't see the lack of a improved invis that big of a deal really though, if you are concerned that invis will fade get those instant cast invis potions in inventory just in case. Although admittedly useless on corpse runs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">that was me that sat down and talked to the dev, and I never thought to ask him about invis.  The only response to the type of question like that was when I asked him why SKs got SCS and he responded that they prob shouldn't have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From what I remember of a discussion in the Newbie Zone back before the board was abolished and questions were still answered, Invis was added to the shaman spell line up during Beta.  It was never removed when the game went live, though the Devs had decided that Invis V animals was enough.  It was decided to leave the spell in place rather than endure the uproar that removing it would have caused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like to have 2-3 Cloudy Potions on me at all times. They are insta click invis, and even though I have not had to use one yet (thank goodness), I don't believe that your invis will fade. This should work, but luckily haven't had to try yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just keep in mind, Clerics have NO INVIS!<br />
<br />
This is something that bugs the hell out of me on a daily basis, just because it would be so handy in the Daily Shaman life. The fact that clerics have no standard invis at all has kept me quiet about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well.. not really. while shaman have invis to the living mobs/animals, cleric do get one with the undead mobs:<br />
<br />
Invisibility versus Undead <br />
Classes: Cleric level 14 <br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=235<br />
<br />
they even have an &quot;improved&quot; one:<br />
<br />
Improved Invis to Undead <br />
Classes: Cleric level 50 <br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=1411<br />
<br />
<br />
and just in case.. ain't it funny that beastlord get invis too if originaly shaman were not supposed to get one?<br />
<br />
Invisibility <br />
Classes: <br />
Enchanter level 4 <br />
Magician level 8 <br />
Wizard level 16 <br />
Shaman level 29 <br />
Beastlord level 49</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We have far bigger concerns then improved invis at the moment. I will take it if I get it course but I do not think this is something to bug the developers with.<br />
<br />
Anyways, class diversity is a good thing and everyone getting the same spells irks me.<br />
<br />
If we get something it should be new, like a self only reverse harmony. I do not know if it is codeable with the current game engine but would be something new and unique.<br />
<br />
Give it to clerics and shaman (clerics get the better version) - shaman version reduces aggro (not assist) radius of all pacifiable MOBs to something like quarter-beneficial-spell-range with regard to the shaman only.<br />
<br />
Allows safer reinvising and the superior cleric version allows for travel through zones where the gaps between MOBs are big enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the more classes with invis the fewer people you will have to keep invis on when moving through danger zones.<br />
<br />
and the insta invis pots can be clicked at full run and you will stay invis (or become invis).<br />
bank a few for cr's or pick one up on your way out, they are sold in pok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">To add to a list of &quot;upgradable&quot; spell lines just because we have them...<br />
<br />
Fire DD (above level 1)<br />
Charm Animal (above level 34)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">From what I remember of a discussion in the Newbie Zone back before the board was abolished and questions were still answered, Invis was added to the shaman spell line up during Beta.

<br />
*sheesh* Talk about a selective application of the 'Vision(tm)'. While we're at it, in Beta, we had the same heals than Druids while alternating in power with them on DDs, better DOTs than Necro and a slow that was 20% better than anyone else's.<br />
<br />
Not that I am advocating we get those things back, but just that for them to be using 'back in Beta' as a justification is... amusing at best.<br />
<br />
Not to mention they never had any trouble removing stuff from the shaman line-up. We also used to have Charm, a fire-based DS and DOT that last over 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
The reality of the thing is probably much closer to this: back when they introduced the fixed invis in Velious and Luclin, the barely cogent code monkey in 'charge' of coming up with spells for shaman thought instead that what shaman really needed was a level 51 pet buff with a long recast and stats a level 49 shaman could easily match. Then, during Luclin, the NEW barely cogent code monkey (because the first had long been fired, as 90%+ of the then coder had) decided that a group-Acumen would be 'th3 sh!t, m@n', especially if they didn't add it to the loot tables.</div></div><hr />
