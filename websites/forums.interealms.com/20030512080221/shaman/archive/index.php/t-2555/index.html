How to play EQ drunk.<br />
by mill<br />
<br />
hi all, <br />
<br />
My name is Mill, and I am an alcoholic. <br />
<br />
I have mastered the art of playing eq drunk, and I just wanted to share some info and ideas with you.<br />
<br />
I happen to live with my brother, who is 32, and i am 28, we have a network setup at home, and most of the time, we have a third computer of a friends hooked up as well, just want to let you know my setup.<br />
Preperation: You first need to banish all the people in your life who may be a hinderance. For me this is primarily my girlfriend, but be this, wife, husband, dog, anything, make up an excuse to get the the hell away. Im tired and am going to bed early works well for me. Next, you need an ample supply of preferred beverage. I love Old Milwaukee Light beer, so one case and some extra is nice, for two, we usually get two cases, and always have the crisper in the fridge full of &quot;mystery beer&quot;, the stuff other people leave when partying at our place. This insures that you have enough even if your liver is kicking ass that night. Also, make sure the way to the bathroom is clear, in case you need to talk to god on the big white telephone. Smokes. jerky, this is a great tool, helps remove the watery mouth im about to puke taste after a particularly brutal death(will explain later). <br />
<br />
Rules: Drink whenever somone says drink in group or guild, no arguments. Biggest rule, if somone in your party dies, finish a full beer. If you die, finish your beer, and pound/funnel abother full one. If more than one person on your party dies, finish, and pound/funnel one for each persons death. This is non negotiable, and really makes you play sharp, or crazy depending on thirst. this is all done after the battle, and when it is deemed &quot;safe&quot;. This can get messy, during a nagafen raid, everyone in my party died at least once, i limited myself to funneling a 6 pack, this was done after the raid, and took me about 15 to 20 minutes(found out next day i puked that night). <br />
<br />
Set your alarm clock(if you work) before you start, because you will never remember after. <br />
<br />
Some neat things that ahve happened to me. Well, I was in kedge one night, and remember the entrance is all, later on, i guess we were in bubble room, and i refused to acknowledge i had a pet, even though my guild kept telling me it was beside me, i insisted it was a kill stealing druid and i was going to out nuke it. Only one person died, that was my brother and he was drunker than me anyway.<br />
Planes are always a bonus while drunk, twice I have been in fear, and not remembered leaving, somehow,managed not to die. Important to let your group here know that if you really start babbling, to trick you into leaving, anything to get you out. <br />
<br />
This is just a rough guide, because the real thing cant truly be written down, as you never remember it if done properly. Stories you hear about yourslef can be truly heroic, or utterly catastrophic. Everything is more fun though, even if your a light drinker(twelve pack and under) Beer makes med time almost as desired as fight time, and you seek new ways to remain at full mana(no, i cant fight yet, only 90% mana, drink!). Now, go out and do this, and do it often and soon, if you dont, you simply are not enjoying eq. <br />
<br />
Oh, and people think im roleplaying when really hammered, But i just cant type by this point, and cant explain it, so Ogres get a racial drinking bonus i think. Thought this just a little humor that should be read. <br />
