<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know where to put this, since the seperate mmorpg forums exclude asherons call 2, and the grey seems to be focused around politics talk. So apologies if this is wrong section.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I been playing the free trial of Asherons Call 2, theres a free 15 day trial which was on their webpage. And I've been quite impressed, nice graphics, some very nice quests and a different way of developing characters. So it seems quite odd its not more popular. <br />
<br />
From my experience I have only noticed a few pitfalls like I was using 256 mb ram intially and it was laggy as hell. Upgraded to 700 ish and has been fine. The lack of players is a pitfall in finding other people to group with (or as its termed &quot;joining a fellowship&quot;), however, thats not to say no people are around those levels and its possible to solo. The only other 2 faults I have come across so far, which I don't see as too major, was the swimming, you lose your mana bar then proceed to losing your health, which is quite aggravating when there is no shore to get up on. And, secondly hills. The hills are quite annoying to climb particuarly as when you do you will occasionally slide back in an annoying fashion. They haven't annoyed me to stop playing so I don't think others would too, so I can't help but be curious why it doesn't pull very many numbers comparitively.(Admittedly only played 3 days of this trial so far)<br />
<br />
So what were other peoples impressions of AC2 and what is the main reason why it only attracts like 1000 people? as opposed to other mmorpgs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I played AC1 for a bit, and was very excited about AC2 before release.  I got into beta, and it really seemed like it had promise.  Great graphics, big plans for the storyline, etc.  <br />
<br />
The first problems were severe lag and rubberbanding.     You'd run for several hundred feet, and suddenly shoot back, or run in place.  The AC engine (1 and 2) both had wierd ways of handling lag.<br />
<br />
The next major problems occurred when the same major problems from beta were in at launch.  I bought the game anyway, and they gradually fixed at least some of the lag.  But they made poor, poor design decisions.  Stuff like giving every single monster in the game a ranged attack (to stop people from perching).    Besides that, the classes were really poorly designed.  It was almost as if they were showing off an engine, and threw together a really weak game to sit on top of it.  Itemization and tradeskills were awful, griefing and exploits plentiful, and for every cool idea they put into the game, they put 3 stupid ones in.<br />
<br />
The final straw for me came when one of the features that had been so highly touted turned out to be complete crap.  The cities, all in ruin from years of neglect, were supposed to grow and thrive automatically as people congregated there.  For example, if a city became a major hub, the engine would rebuild that city to slowly become a really nice place.  A big nice city on one server might be a ghost town and in ruins on another. That all turned out to be BS; the devs finally said that those type of updates were actually in patches...this was not new technology at all, and in fact the players had very little control over whether a city was renewed.  This was the selling point I'd used to get friends into the game, and it was all a farce.<br />
<br />
Now, with all that negativity aside, the game has made strides...keep in mind that I have not played since about a month after release.  I don't mean to dissuade you (or anyone) from the game; in fact, i'd absolutely love to see it take off, as i'd jump right back in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm... another game I might want fit into my touring schedule before WoW goes live.  If anyone else has views on this game they'd like to share I'd be interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've played AC2 in the beta.  After reaching level 40ish, the game started to feel repetitive.  There was nothing to look foward to.  That was years ago when it was beta.  Im sure alot more content has been released since then.<br />
<br />
The thing that bothered me the most was their decision to eliminate all NPCs.  It gave me an eerie feeling when passing thru some of the less popular towns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Stuff like giving every single monster in the game a ranged attack (to stop people from perching)&quot;<br />
I think its cool the ranged attacks, it makes it a lot more different and varied gameplay, though I don't know what you mean by perching.<br />
From playing Asherons Call 2 today, I am still impressed with the ideas. Like when you die, you lose vitae which is just your max hp and vigor, which is really nice because it doesn't overly punish you and it doesn't cripple your experience for a time like other mmorpgs do. Though I've still not levelled far so I don't know how severe it gets further on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ohh boy... AC2...<br />
<br />
It is a long, sad story. I played AC1 since it's release, and for several years afterward. Like every other AC1 player, I was eagerly awaiting AC2. The graphics were stunning, and the crap they were telling us about the game sounded interesting. Seemed like it might actually qualify as 'second generation'. Once beta began, the disenchantment began. It was absolutely nothing like AC1 (Which pissed off about every AC1 player, I didn't really care), and was a horrid buggy, contentless, unbalanced mess. Of course since it was beta, people still had hope that it would be fixed before it was shipped. However, as is almost always the case these days, it was shipped half-finished. It lacked low, mid, and high level content. It lacked balanced classes, at least 3/4 of them were completely useless and the others were demi-gods. Crafting was useless, exploits were everywhere, people were hitting the max level cap in under three weeks, etc. It was a complete disaster. <br />
<br />
During those times there was still hope, but after months of apathy from the devs people just gave up and left. The populations plummeted. It was this point the devs (Just to clarify, there were two seperate teams. One actually developed the game, and the second, the Live team, were the ones who got stuck with a horrendously borked game) tried to turn things around. The changes were agonizingly slow. Nerfs were handed out like candy, to everyone. Buffs were given sparingly. Everyone was angry, but the direhards stuck around. <br />
<br />
Soon the pops dipped to their lowest points ever. Then the **** just completely hit the fan. Chat ceased to work, for EVERYONE. Tells didn't work, alligence chat didn't work, hell even open chat didn't work half of the time. Pops fell even lower, as people realized how incredibly hollow the game was when they didn't have at least a working chat to keep them distracted from the bland content. The devs were still tweaking things, making exp much harder to get, forcing grouping, and basically alienating the very few AC1 people who liked it (AC1 was incredibly soloable, and so was AC2 for certain classes until they changed them). <br />
<br />
I just dug up a classic quote from Ken Karl, some former jackass at Turbine:<br />
<br />
&quot;And for logging in, yep, that too is a problem and chat. And that is one that I deserve to be beat up for. <br />
<br />
None of the fixes we put in yet have totally fixed the problem. <br />
<br />
And yep, we are going back to trying to fix it once again, and I know that this sort of thing does not help. <br />
<br />
We are now looking at some very base line changes to the system to put in some new parts. <br />
<br />
The problems there is we could introduce a whole new line of problems, but right now, that may be a risk worth taking&quot; <br />
<br />
--- Ken Karl <br />
<br />
Beautiful... it makes the SOE community reps seem competant. However, he doesn't work at Turbine anymore... likely as a result of his inept handling of everything passed his way.<br />
<br />
Anyway, after everyone left things started to turn around, still slowly, but they got the basic elements of the game running again. They added some interesting stuff, balance was still god-awful, but it could have been worse. Pops climbed ever so-slowly back up to that impressive &quot;200+ players during primetime&quot; figure.<br />
<br />
Then we go ahead quite a bit, after realizing they have to do something to keep their level 50 players interested, they needed to do something big. Not just crappy, broken quests that were designed to be super-mega-crazy hard, but ended up being broken by just casting one spell (imagine if hitting a mob didn't break mez, and every mob was mez'able in EQ, and that is how it was in AC2 for many months). Eventually the devs introduced 'Hero' levels. In other words, the 'Welcome to the worst tredmill ever conceived' levels. Every couple of levels you'd double or triple your TOTAL xp up to the point. It didn't help that mobs gave just a little bit more xp, and that they reduced group xp bonuses.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the hero content was pretty good, and from that point on it wasn't a terrible game. The tredmill was unbearable (at least for me) though, and the gains from the billions more xp you made were so insignificant it was just demoralizing. You can put 5 billion xp into Arcane Lore (a skill that is used as a requirement to equip certain weapons/armor) and then be able to use a staff with 15 more damage. Gah, it was just sickening.<br />
<br />
I should also mention that during the entire game's life there has been non-stop balancing, tweaking, completely revamping classes. Most of the time it has been a good move, but it gets exhausing having your classes changed over, and over, and over yet again.<br />
<br />
I haven't played AC2 in several months though, so I really can't say where it went after that point. It had potential, it easily has the best (most fun) melee combat engine of any MMORPG on the market. It had good graphics as well. There were some interesting quest mechanics here and there too. However the tredmill at the end just killed it for me, just brutally murdered it.<br />
<br />
All this said, I would actually recommend checking it out to anyone who hasn't played it. After everything they've added, the low end game is a total blast, especially if you play with friends. If you do make it to the high end though, be prepared for a long, hard fight with the tredmill if things haven't changed much.<br />
<br />
I'll end with this sceenshot of my character back when he was about level thirty. Good times...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I played for a while at launch.  The graphics were great (apart from non-human characters) and the archery based class was a lot of fun.  Unfortunately as far as gameplay goes the only word to adequately describe the game is &quot;barren&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not long after I left they were forced to close most servers and merge the entire population into one or two remaining servers, that's how many people quit.<br />
<br />
A lovely looking art with some nice ideas utterly ruined by a lack of common sense when designing the basics of the game (no NPCs, no NPC towns etc, meeting places consisting of a forge and maybe a single quest giver... these are really bad ideas for an RPG ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Perching is where an archer (or caster) would find a spot that mobs could not reach, and kill completely without risk to themselves.  The mob AI is about as stupid as any I've ever seen, and they mobs would basically just run into a tree, or building, or just stand still, if they could not reach the percher.<br />
<br />
So, they add in ranged attacks for every single mob.  Yep, even the measliest level 1 rat could somehow shoot you with golden magic bolts of energy.  This wouldn't be so bad, except that my chosen class was a pure melee, and it meant I took damage while running to the mob I wished to kill.  It also meant that traveling was much more dangerous, because running through a field meant getting pelted by mobs you couldn't even see.<br />
<br />
Like another poster though, I would suggest trying it out.  There's a free trial floating around somewhere (a week or two I think), and I believe its worth checking out.  The low end is fun, and there are some really cool aspects to the game (try playing some instruments).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">AC2 rocks and is the game I left EQ for.<br />
<br />
After playing EQ for 4 yrs and getting my shaman up to lvl 65 and 206 aa I am now happily playing AC2.<br />
<br />
Some things I like about Ac2.<br />
<br />
Graphics are killer.<br />
<br />
Combat animations, when you stun a mob it slows and does everything in slow motion, it's so cool - you'll never get tired of doing it.<br />
<br />
I play a ranger and when I pepper the mob with arrows, you can actually see the arrows sticking out of the mob.<br />
<br />
You have tons to do when attacking, lots of different styles.<br />
<br />
You can solo alot.<br />
<br />
Tons of quests, in fact you can level up to 30 mostly by doing vaults and quests.<br />
<br />
ie:<br />
<br />
Gauntlet - a series of one on one fights, with ever increasing difficulty of monsters - fun fun fun and great exp.<br />
<br />
Shreth Cache - 30k sitting on floor of bank. You pick it up and uber bank guards come swarming in to &quot;arrest&quot; you - they actually kill you, see how much money you can pick up before getting killed!<br />
<br />
Turbine is very very imaginative in the types of quests they offer, that are fun.<br />
<br />
Epic weapons and armour at lvl 15, 30 and 45 (45 is hero level) opens up new abilities. Time to get to 45 - 2 months max.<br />
<br />
All classes can craft mounts at lvl 9<br />
<br />
All classes can port and bind.<br />
<br />
All classes when joining a guild get a guild hall that they can bind to and port to (great for raids)<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested in trying the game, my name is Zigmund on the Cold Eve server (kingdom vs kingdom) server. <br />
<br />
I play a lvl 47 Ranger and I'll hook you up and run you thru some quests etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Still been playing Asherons Call 2 and I am impressed with a lot of things like;<br />
*The Idea of Vaults; a one-off dungeon which gives you a fortune in experience and a nice addition of lore.<br />
<br />
*The Quest system; It is fantastic the quest journal and you get very nice rewards for doing quests. Particuarly nice, say you're exping somewhere fighting some mobs. You see suddenly a mob with a name, it has a blue icon above its head. You kill it, and you get given a 1 hour quest to kill say 5 or 10 mobs of a certain type to give a bonus to experience.<br />
<br />
*The Graphics; It needs quite a good system to run, but some of the graphics are pretty nice, some of the detail to the country formations and weather effects. <br />
<br />
*Potions; Omg, potions are actually good in this. You're fighting a typical mob and it will drop a useful potion which you can accumulate and use for say certain adventures into a dungeon.<br />
<br />
*The con system; The con system there is a red con, orange con and a yellow con. As well as this you can examine each creature to find out its level as well as its hp and vigor. Red con means more difficult, orange con is a defined group encounter for its level, and yellow is basic standard colour of mobs which you should be able to solo with most classes. Also of note here, is when you kill any mob it tells you how much exp points you get, which means you can compare and choose where to exp say.<br />
<br />
*The Craft System;<br />
<br />
The design of this is very good. You basically have and can raise skills in racial armours, weapons, tools, spell binding and a special subsection called Quest recipes, which you can't raise skills in but can make some of the items in quests, its just where recipes are stored for them. <br />
<br />
To start of with you can make a simple tool set which use to gain tradeskill supplies. The one of most relevance to start of with is butchering. Where every mob you kill you can butcher with a specially made hunting knife. (Which incidentally comes under tools, the better you become at butchering, the better a hunting knife you can use and can get higher amounts of the tradeskill items.) Hides are an example of what you can butcher and this is used in making certain weapons and for making certain armours, specifically human armour I think. <br />
<br />
The other method of obtaining tradeskill items is through mining,(this is where the other tools come in) you can mine silver, crystal, gold, iron and stone. Mining is basically where via a skill called surveying you make a map which maps out a certain area where you will find the mined item you are after. So say iron, you have a map of area with an iron area in it. It has coordinates with it and you can either go there physically  or you can give the map to a cartogropher who will send you to the approximate location. There you are given textual clues as to how near or far away you are to the mining area where you will find say your iron.<br />
<br />
Once you have the tradeskill items, you have a recipe which you combine the items in. The recipe is shown a certain colour, white, yellow, red or violet. White is the best chance of successfully combining, yellow is a gamble above your skill level, red is a big gamble, and violet shouldn't even be really considered. Everytime you get a successful combine you gain special craft exp points which you can spend on upping your skills in say human armour, or you can upp your skills in another aspect like Iron Mining, Butchering or maybe on your ability to make tools. This is a clever idea as when you successfully combine you not only gain the product but you also gain this craft exp. Also, the harder the recipe the more of this craft experience you get. So, by perhaps risking yellows you can make a little more in craft experience.<br />
<br />
The best thing about the tradeskilling is the items have a nice tradeskill only effect to them. For armour, you have a choice of 4 different effects you want your character to have. Do you want armour that gives regen, or do you want armour that gives + to vigor.(the kinda mana cost for abilities and spells in Ac2)  And the same for weapons, you can choose a weapon with an effect of a low vigor cost, or you can choose a weapon with an effect of a low damage variance. I think the last effect was an armour boost. As well as this, there is a tradeskill called spellbinding. This is perhaps the most fun aspect of it, imagine say a item you looted with a nice proc but with terrible stats. With spellbinding you can take that proc off and put it onto a totem to use on any weapon you have with an available enchantment slot on. If its a tradeskill made weapon, you can have 2!!<br />
(Also of note to tradeskills, there is a trivial butchering code, you can't butcher mobs that are too low below you- (this is very clever as it promotes gaining tradeskills while say you are exping)<br />
<br />
*Combat<br />
There is something unique about Ac2 ;most mobs can fight at range,  this adds a really nice twist. You can have a fight with a drudge at range throwing spears at each other or shooting arrows at each other. Or you can be both at melee range fighting weapon to weapon. Combat wise, you can choose to wield a magic weapon, a missile weapon(range), or a melee weapon, with the restriction that if a mob is in melee range and you are using a range weapon you won't be able to use many of your special abilities for range. Also of note in combat, there is a system like openings, called opportunities in AC2, where the mob glows a gold colour and is at a weakness meaning you can do increased damage with certain abilities.<br />
<br />
*Character Development.<br />
You start of with 4 different races. Each race has a tree for melee, missile and magic which they can progress and specialize in. You gain skill points which you can choose which area you want to develop in or gain a new ability in. As well as this, you gain experience points to spend as you level up which you can spend in any of your abilities to make it a better skill. This has to be one of my favourite aspects of AC2, you can tailor your character to be strong at range or strong in melee. Also you can tailor your character to be better in groups or solo situations. Do I buy a backstab for group situations or a heal, or do I buy a better damaging ability for solo activity or defense. <br />
<br />
At level 15, you can choose to specialize your character further by saving 5 skill points and choosing one of 6 trees. These trees are more noticably class definitions similar to eq like an enchanter, or ranger, or a rogue. Except the abilities you get are completely different to eq, for example, the ranger gets a pet and can set traps. The class with feign death can debuff a mob with a slow/damage attack.(the amount of slow/duration and damage depends on how much xp you invest in it).<br />
<br />
*The Map<br />
The Map system is brilliant, and the loc attached to the map works perfectly well and its very intuitive how you navigate areas. The maps shows places of interest, dungeons and landscape terrains like mountains which helps hugely. Incidentally a lot of travel is via ringways which teleport you around a region. The map is very useful in navigating to where these portals are, and finding your way to another region.<br />
*Group Questing<br />
Quests are groupable and some stages can be done by a single person. So for example, in your group, only one person may have to go to a npc for everyone to get to the next stage. And only one person has to collect an item of a corpse. <br />
*Death<br />
The Death system is good in that you don't lose exp, but you do lose something called Vitae. This is basically your maximum hp and vigor. I think this is a clever idea in that theres no crappy delevelling but at the same time there is a penalty. Also of note, there are no corpse runs.<br />
* Binding and Porting<br />
There are lifestones everywhere where you can bind too, which every class can. As well as this, you can gate to your bind with an ability called lifestone recall. And if you belong in a guild, or allegiance as its called, then your guild will have an additional port where you can port to which I think is pretty cool.<br />
*Auras/group only buffs<br />
There are certain Auras that you only get the benefit of while you are in the group, this is pretty nice.<br />
<br />
*Swimming. Its realistic in that you can't swim forever and as you continue swimming you first start to lose vigor then start losing your health.<br />
<br />
*Fleeing<br />
Most mobs only chase you for a certain distance bar a few exception types. This is pretty good. Meaning a dungeon upon pulling 2 or 3 you can run back a fair distance, although being careful because respawn is quick, and then lose aggro.<br />
<br />
*Downtime<br />
When you are stationary and not in combat your health and vigor regens around 1/4 a tick, so there is little downtime. This works well.<br />
<br />
But with all these nice ideas there is a bad side.<br />
<br />
*Graphics, after about a few days, the graphics becomes bland and boring. Every landscape looks the same, every dungeon looks the same. There is no progressive wow factor.<br />
<br />
*It feels like no incentive to level up. Whether this is because I simply have got bored of the mmorpg genre I don't know. But in AC2 it feels like simply character developing. There is no end game I don't think, and asuch I did notice a fair few high levellers around helping out some of the new people which was a bit annoying, especially when they go into a dungeon and slaughter it all for you thinking that helps. Also, from what I could see there was no level cap either? and it becomes an endless grind after a certain stage.<br />
<br />
*Crafting is intensive. The Butchering idea is fantastic, but the mining is very disappointing and intensive. You get guided by textual cues where to find this mining spot, telling you how close and far away you are to the destination of a mining source. And even worse is that there is about 4 different mining spots that you get tped to. Each mining gets about 100 of the mining item intially and to make some of the harder recipes you need about 1000 ish, which can take a few hours to mine and is boring as hell. The actual combining is ok though.<br />
<br />
*Groups, because of the lack of people it is very hard to find group. In addition to this, characters seem quite ill designed for groups at the earlier stage. I think its only till about level 35 that a certain class will have a mesmerize type feature. There doesn't seem to be much of a spphisticated role as eq. Mobs Ai seem little to non existant. Certain classes have taunt abilities but I don't even know if that is even needed. <br />
<br />
*No NPCs<br />
Barring quest npcs and mobs there are no npcs. So you can visit a town and all there is in that town is a warder npc(who gives you an item informing you of quests in the region) and perhaps a cartogropher, though thats most likely at a tradeskill town.<br />
<br />
*No Banks, you can accumulate so much stuff and you want to store some of the tradeskill stuff but there is no ability to do so.<br />
<br />
*Lack of varied content. <br />
<br />
*The all too familar grind.<br />
<br />
*lag, on more than one occasion everyone on the server would get a load of lag.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My verdict;<br />
Definitely worth the trial period, the first impressions are excellent and it really has nice ideas.  But after the trial period there seems to be little or no incentive to continue. There is a lack of a lasting appeal which eq seems to have. I think the numbers it gets is pretty unfair in comparison to other games but I do believe it is improving which could perhaps make a more endearing game. (A new advertising campaign by Turbine is set to be made soon I think.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tallce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't know where to put this, since the seperate mmorpg forums exclude asherons call 2, and the grey seems to be focused around politics talk. So apologies if this is wrong section.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I been playing the free trial of Asherons Call 2, theres a free 15 day trial which was on their webpage. And I've been quite impressed, nice graphics, some very nice quests and a different way of developing characters. So it seems quite odd its not more popular. <br />
<br />
From my experience I have only noticed a few pitfalls like I was using 256 mb ram intially and it was laggy as hell. Upgraded to 700 ish and has been fine. The lack of players is a pitfall in finding other people to group with (or as its termed &quot;joining a fellowship&quot;), however, thats not to say no people are around those levels and its possible to solo. The only other 2 faults I have come across so far, which I don't see as too major, was the swimming, you lose your mana bar then proceed to losing your health, which is quite aggravating when there is no shore to get up on. And, secondly hills. The hills are quite annoying to climb particuarly as when you do you will occasionally slide back in an annoying fashion. They haven't annoyed me to stop playing so I don't think others would too, so I can't help but be curious why it doesn't pull very many numbers comparitively.(Admittedly only played 3 days of this trial so far)<br />
<br />
So what were other peoples impressions of AC2 and what is the main reason why it only attracts like 1000 people? as opposed to other mmorpgs.<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the big reasons AC2 was such a flop was due to Microsoft literlly butchering the game. AC2 was in development since the release of AC1 and the concept behind the game was much different. Microsoft saw the trend in MMORPGs was leaning towards forced grouping, and molded AC2 into that. That along with all the chat bugs, connection issues and the XP bug that let people get to level 50 within weeks of launch almost destroyed the game. Now that Turbine has bought back both AC1 and AC2 there have been huge changes to the game. Turbine is working on housing, has changed the crafting system completely to increase the ingame economy, is working on alot more solo content and an overall improvements to the game as a result of buying back AC2.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yeah I think one of the attractors to mmorpgs is people, and Asherons Call 2 doesn't have especially many of them. I've finished my trial period for Asherons Call 2, I think it really has some cool aspects and I umming about whether to actually buy the game just for when I am bored. What puts me off is the lack of end game and for what I have heard in the next stages of levels is an annoying grind with little to look forward to.</div></div><hr />
