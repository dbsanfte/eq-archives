<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Nope, it didn't really kill me, because I CAN'T find one!!!<br />
<br />
Spent some plat for trackers, No Yun Shaman's up.  Blew more then I wanted on trackers, so now I'm just relying on the kind ranger and druid in TT that are farming the Forager/Hunter cycles.<br />
<br />
They haven't seen any Yuns either.<br />
<br />
Grrrrrr.<br />
<br />
Do the Yuns spawn on the Sebilis side of the wall thingie?  Everyone that has checked for me didn't find one, but didn't venture over to where Sebilis is.<br />
<br />
Oh and by the way, on Friday night on Rodcet, TT was bugged so NO frogluks were to be found ANYWHERE!!!  Only the Forager and Hunter were spawning, no other frogluks were spawning.  Good use of some plat there.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.  Do I hop on one foot while paying a lvl55 human druid wearing a Charred Gaurdian Sheild to track the Yun's for me while runnign backwards?<br />
<br />
This is getting rediculous, the Yun Powder is the last thing I need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well i don't know wat's up with your server...<br />
<br />
but some druid alt of a guildie found me a yun in 30 min while we were going for seb key bits..<br />
<br />
and he found one for a guildie in about 5 min the next time we went out there..<br />
<br />
standing facing away from the TT zoneline..  he always came from  the left (sorry i forget which direction that is.. ) and it was about a 1 minute 30 sec pull to the mobs he snared.. <br />
<br />
hope that helps some.. <br />
<br />
also someone told me once that the area near the lake/aqueduct spawns them.. but i never had to go that far to try.. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">remember they are are KoS to EVERY other mob so they die fast, best way is to get some friends and kill everything there so it doesn't kill the Yuns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thyalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was there last night on Prexus going for my fourth one for a lowbie friend.  Normally in about 5-10 mins I have my choice, but with a 65 pally with me killing everything in sight, in four hours the only froggie I got to spawn was a Knight. /sigh What a wasted night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got mine over by the aqua duct. You need to have a ranger or druid or bard tracking constantly yuns agro everything and die fast.<br />
<br />
You have to get these things almost right as they spawn or they will go toe to toe with a cocatrice or a raptor and it is boom dead froggie.<br />
