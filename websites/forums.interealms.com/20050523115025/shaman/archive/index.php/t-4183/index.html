Hi,<br />
<br />
The mana cap has been a big topic lately, so I'd like to take a minute to address it. Mana caps have been in EverQuest since the game was released. They haven't been changed, made more restrictive, or added at a later date in order to keep casters down. The mana cap as it is now has been there since you created your character, and only recently become a topic of concern for players. <br />
<br />
Most things in EverQuest have a point of diminishing returns - a point where adding more of a resource yields little or no improvement. This is most obvious in your basic stats, where you can easily see that after your strength score hits 255 it does you no good to put on more strength enhancing gear. These kinds of caps aren't intended to cause you distress, and in many ways they can help support a well balanced game system.<br />
<br />
While we have an appreciation for the benefits that stat caps can bring to a system, we're also willing to look at things like this with an objective eye. The mana cap on worn items has been in since release, and hasn't come up before as an issue that players felt overly limited by. With all the attention focused on the cap in recent days, the dev team looked it over and we agree - there's no reason to place an artificial cap on mana enhancing items.<br />
<br />
On test server now, we've changed the rule so that players get full value from all mana increasing worn items. We expect this will go live with the next patch.<br />
<br />
Thanks for bringing your concerns to our attention,<br />
<br />

Yeah right.  When I twinked out my druid long ago I bought up a lot of +mana items.  I guarantee you I had full use of the +300ish mana I had at level 1 because I could nuke forever... and then had to sit there and med for ages to get it all back.  Now I recently twinked a wizard with a bunch of gear and he only had 60 mana total at level 1, and he had over 800 in mana gear on.<br />
<br />
That cap was definately changed since early 2000.<br />
<br />
But, at least they are smart enough to get rid of it.</div></div><hr />

As far as they know this limit has always been in place. <br />
<br />
Thats fine they can think this all they want too...<br />
<br />
The clear point to be taken away from this is that its no longer an issue, or soon wont be...<br />
<br />
The concerns of many players were taken to heart  and corrected...<br />
<br />
This is just another step in the caster balance that has long been over due...<br />
<br />
Grats VI for getting to this as quickly as they did...<br />
<br />
Personally I'm really amazed they corrected this as fast as they did...<br />
<br />
I can hardly wait to see the new MB crits...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jaradis, there is a difference in what VI is talking about and what you are talking about.  A lvl 60 wizard is limited to using roughly about +1380 mana(think that is the going number right now) on items.  There IS however a level based restriction that you are talking about.  I think the lvl based one was added later. <br />
<br />
Some people are questioning if the +1380 mana is the lvl limit for lvl 60.  +40 for lvl 1, 80 for lvl 2.... Something like that.  Just going from memory.  :)</div></div><hr />

No, he is talking about the same thing.  The formula that gives the cap at low levels also gives the 1388 cap at level 60.  Its all one in the same.  Prior to Luclin you could not really hit the cap easily, and you definately couldn't see it without the new UI.</div></div><hr />

Not entirely true. People where already suspecting it before the new ui. Mana burn was one indication of a cap that worked back to be about the same thing. Other people where also seeing this apparent cap in thier own testing to see how big thier mana pool was. Also the cheater programs like showeq where already seeing mana numbers.<br />
<br />
The new ui just made it reasonably easy for anyone to test it with some simple steps and be able to safely complain with out need to admit to using a cheat program or falling back to innacurate testing.</div></div><hr />
