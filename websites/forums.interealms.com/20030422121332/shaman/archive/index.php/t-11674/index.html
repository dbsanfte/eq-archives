i really want a melee upgrade.  nothing over balancing just something that makes us more like rangers and less like necros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As soon as you buy a horse.  The reason being is you lose the medding advantage of a horse if auto attack is on.  You even med while using effects from armor (JBB) but not if you are attacking.  Plus the amount of damage you do from melee is more then made up by 1 dd spell.</div></div><hr />

Dunno; I'm 61, and still tend to melee.  Horsie goes bye bye so I can get the extra point or two of damage from slamming the critter.  I miss an awful lot, though, even with max'd skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I stopped swinging a weapon at 60. I had torpor, so just &quot;torpor-tanked&quot; the mobs while the dog and my dots ate them up. Even with max melee skills (piercing/offense), my damage was so pathetic that I didn't feel like I was really losing any efficiency. Now that I have the leezord mount, I at least have a good excuse for not meleeing. ;)</div></div><hr />
