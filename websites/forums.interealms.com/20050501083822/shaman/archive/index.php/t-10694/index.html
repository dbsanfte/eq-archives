<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question.  Can I have a pet up while I use this ability or does it despawn?  If not, and I have rank one of Spirit Call, that means for at least 60 seconds I'll have 4 doggies chewing on the mob. <br />
<br />
Another one.  If mob dies before 60 seconds do they stick around to be used on another bad guy?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes pet plus SC puppies up at once. They will only assist on second mob if you get that mob to hit you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just to expand on your 2nd question a little bit. The mob that you have targeted when you use spirit call will autmatically be attacked, but if there's another mob beating on you at the time odds are that the pets will switch to that one. If you want to switch them to a 2nd mob, you can't until the first one is dead and you have to have caught agro from the 2nd mob _after_ the pets were summoned. It works basically like enchanter pets in that regards.</div></div><hr />
