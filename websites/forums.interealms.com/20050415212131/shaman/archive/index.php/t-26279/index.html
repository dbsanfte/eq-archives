<br />
As I am sure most of you know, VT is a keyed zone, and its a bit of a pain in the arse to get all the pieces...okay, maybe more than a bit of a pain; hehe.  I have the shards that drop from Dawnshroud, Scarlet Desert, Sanctus Seru, and Acrylia Caverns.  I also have the Glowing orb of luclinite from Grieg's End.  That leaves me with the shards from Ahkeva ruins, Fungus Grove, The Grey, the Deep, and of course, Ssra temple. (think i covered em all, if not I'll edit and update)  Just wondering if anyone had tips or strats on getting the rest of my shards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, if anyone knows about how to get keyed for the Ssra Emporer, I'd appreciate that as well. ( got my Ssra insignia last night =)</div></div><hr />

He's the last piece I'm missing for VT key, and I hate unfinished quests, and locked zones.

but my guild has late-night groups that run through older raid content. not uncommon to see them clearing ST at 3 AM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not worried about the AE, info on it has -100 MR, and its not uncommon for elemental+ to have all resists above the 200 mark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">its not uncommon for elemental+ to have all resists above the 200 mark.<br />
<br />
<br />
My guild isn't anywhere near elemental yet, we are all working on VT progression to prepare for POP, etc etc... Emp was our weekly raid for a while there, right before i joined in, so I imagine that 2 GoD/OOW equipped groups could probably taken...but what do I know? Wasnt even smart enough to use the search feature.<br />
<br />
blah...that guide is the same one we have on guild page...looking more along the lines of the Ssra drop... i.e. the ring and what is required for that, etc etc<br />
<br />
--Still a noob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was on the same lines as Shamu, but the Emp is doable with a small raid force, we tend to take him out on occasion, he has insane MR (i.e. resists necro lifetaps), so landing turgur's/nihil is pretty much impossible.<br />
<br />
I'd like to get the spiritkin chest and try that out and see if I could land turgurs on him...I'm on a mission now. :)</div></div><hr />

This item is the result of a quest.<br />
# Key to the Emperor's Chamber<br />
<br />
Crafted: This item is crafted by players.<br />
<br />
    * Ring of the Shissar (Non-Tradeskill, 0 trivial)<br />
                + Ssraeshzian Insignia (1)<br />
                + Zazuzh's Idol (1)<br />
                + Zeruzsh's Ring (1)<br />
                + Taskmaster's Pouch (1)<br />
                  <br />
Found in:<br />
<br />
    * Ssraeshza Temple<br />
<br />
In the basement of the temple, kill named Taskmasters or Warden Mekuzh until you obtain a Taskmaster's Pouch. Then kill Commander Zazuzh, on the first floor, and obtain the Zazuzh's Idol. Then kill Commander Zeruzsh, on the second floor, to get the ring. Then go to the imperial guard chamber and kill the guards until one of the named Mobs spawns. They drop the insignia.<br />
<br />
Combine the idol, ring and insignia in the pouch and you will receive the Ring of Shissar, which gets you into the Emperor's Chamber.<br />
<br />
Short story: all is soloable except Insignia from pre-Emp room (and maybe that is now, too). Is that what you wanted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xelnag Ashenpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why bother? He's DR slowable and was originally tuned with the 20% slow in mind. The PoP 40%, 10 extra levels, 2 lots of tanking AA's and general mudflation just trivialises him even more.<br />
<br />
Although Emp himself isn't the problem(weak melee, single target DD dealable if you time it). It's the other snakes in the room that you need to CC that makes the fight hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">why bother indeed.....<br />
<br />
simple answer: for fun (and bragging rights).<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bearage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">VT: It's not the bosses that are the problem for a group.  It is the getting there.  Even with todays gear, aa, mana, hp etc etc with one group there is still a massive amount of mobs to get to the mob you mention and if it's a full spawn with all of the Warders up - you'll have to sequentially crawl through.  I doubt with one group you will have the luxuary of a mage parked anywhere so it's going to be one hell of a crawl.  You could probably do it but I think you'd get bored first.  If you don't you're talking hours and hours (to get to DXVT)<br />
<br />
Emp: Regarding the Emp - mininum numbers are hampered by having to mez four very resistant mobs.  Sure enough you could say that one 'uber' enc could mez four - perhaps (they really do resist a lot) and one tank could tank four mobs (2 of which will make a balance curse reducing heal power and will need to cure) and then one tank for the Emp and one for rampage IF you could keep him healed - and the rampage tank - not to mention the mob slowed and the curse on the MT lifted (nasty agro reducer).  Who knows? 16k tank 10k mana cleric and the rest of the group the highest EQ can make?  WAR PAL PAL CLR SHM ENC - perhaps - I doubt it though.<br />
<br />
Bearage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think the Emp could be done with two groups.  When we were preparing for VT our guild did him regularly with four groups or so; we had no Gates or Elemental gear at the time, people were level 65.<br />
<br />
Emperor Group:  WAR, WAR/SK/PAL (Rampage), CLR, SHM, DPS, DPS<br />
<br />
CC Group:  ENC, SHM, WAR/SK/PAL, WAR/SK/PAL :: last 2 slots for DPS DPS (on emperor)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember when I had to mez this was quite some time ago lvl 65 max. If you have the Ancient Enternal Rapture and Rapture you could maybe keep two mez'd but 4 I seriously doubt it. If i remember correctly the only way to get AER if you were not already in VT was from the Ring of Vulak so having both pre VT is not going to be easy to find.<br />
<br />
I honestly dont know post 65 spells for mez, it might be possible now but I am not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xelnag Ashenpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You'd pretty much need 2 groups minimum for Emp. 2 plate tanks, 2 clerics, 2 necros(spell DPS + mana) for Emp, and then a combination of either 2 bards or two enchanters(probably side with enchanters as they have more tools at their disposal to survive without healing, without having to shed agro), another 2 plate tanks(SK's as their ND agro is the best), a shaman(healing SK's and slow) and a misc. class(Maybe mage for DS and spell DPS or a druid for extra healing and spell DPS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ancient Mezzes are available from Lord Inquisitor Seru, he drops a single luclin Ancient every time.  Qvic+ gear, Seru's one-groupable.  Tank, cleric, shaman, 3x dps (necro best by a mile, ranger w/ bane bow next).  Maybe 1x cleric with mana backup like a bard or sk, I haven't done it since folks seriously started accumulating Shielding.<br />
<br />
1) Emperor Ssraeshza himself is tankable with a single cleric, single tank, with occasional input from the shaman working CC to slow &amp; RGC.  Dude's rampage is ignorable, cle epic click will heal it off np.  <br />
<br />
2) All four tankmez guys can be handled by one shadowknight, or one hot**** paladin, with the above mentioned shaman healing him.  The curse proc on adds you just leave there, since it doesn't affect heal-over-times.  With all the defensive advancements, Spiritual Serenity with aa backup can heal all the damage they do.<br />
<br />
3) One enchanter with impeccable timing can cc the four mezzables.  10 levels since the encounter was made makes a humongous difference, but you'll still have to work at sticking sinia to make it really okay for him.  <br />
<br />
4) Then you just have to worry about killing the mofo, which isn't quite as straightforward as you'd like.  Emperor Ssraeshza's hp, as it turns out, aren't all that high.  His fight goes long because of extremely high regen.  Which means that low levels of damage will simply never kill him.  LISeru is the opposite way, btw; his regen is ass, it'll take him hours to recover from whatever is done to him, but his base hp are like 2mil.  I've never done it, but it's possible for one guy to melee Seru to death over like 6-7 hours.  Not so with Emperor Ssraeshza.  You have to outdamage his regen to make any headway at all.  Oh, and no chance of 600dps afk rogue bots, he's immune to normal melee.  Best dps are Conflagaration-proc weapons from ranger/bst.  Well, best damage other than Panther, but there would have to be a second shaman :p<br />
<br />
One group? nah, won't have the dps, now or ever.  Two groups? np</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">DXVT in Vex Thal is soloable, once you get to him.  2-3 hours soloable, but hey. Getting to him is quite another issue.  I've been told there are CotH spots outside his &amp; TXD's rooms, but don't know personally.  It's about an hour clear just from TVK's room with two groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wudedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Been my experience that RGC was needed @ every 45 secs on MA. Not quite chain casting but close. Emp only fight I can remember where its Disease spells for everything. Have never landed any magic /poison or cold, but all Dis dots land and dis slow works. I would suggest the more pet classes the better. Leopard/Panter rock on this fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Regarding the shards you need.  I suggest getting a big tank to go with you.  It will make things go alot faster.  You can solo it, but I got my shards from the Deep, Akheva, and Ssra pretty deep in.  Having a friend makes life alot easier.<br />
<br />
Regarding the Emp key: same thing.  Typically what we did is everyone was expected to be at the point where all you needed was the part from pre emp room.  You then farm the named until everyone is keyed.  If you bring 6 people on your raid that need the part, expect it to take anywhere from one to two hours.<br />
<br />
Regarding VT: I participated in a couple raids with the last two months.  18 to 25 folks, most from higher end guilds than myself, but they were playing twinks or two boxing to get gear for alts.  Pretty much the only mobs we killed were the named.  We would CotH around the zone with specific instructions to not do anything once called.  No sit, no spin, no kneel, no anything.  MA would then jump out of the pile, position the named and after that pretty conventional.<br />
<br />
If you go the traditional way in VT, killing to get to AHR, it takes roughly 4 hours if you are really pushing it.  This assumes everyone is on the ball.  VT can still produce some hellacious trains for the unwary.  Using the CoTH method, it takes roughly the same amount of time, but more of it is dead time just standing around.  In most cases, this allows you to do laundry, grab a beer, hit the head, etc. without things going to pot.  In at least a couple spots, you do need to be awake because roamers do come through there, and their agro range is just big enough to be a nuissance.<br />
<br />
GoD and OOW geared folks will tell you I am hedging the time requirement, but since I am not GoD nor OOW geared, this is the experience I have :).<br />
<br />
One last thing: the CoTH spots we were getting called to were entirely legal, but they were creatively exotic.  Exotic to the point of &quot;How did they get here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Enjoy your trip.  VT is still one of my most favorite zones in the game.  Very little mitigates, and as a shaman you really can feel nostalgic :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have magician bots available.

DXVT is in the blue room at about (500, 1000), and TXD across from him at (-500, 1000).  Do you recall where the CotH was for those?  The TVK -&gt; DXVT clear is for real the longest part of Vex Thal by an order of magnitude, shortcutting that would be huge.</div></div><hr />

Wish I could help you, but I just don't know the coth spots well enough to locate them on a map for you.  This is not due to me being unwilling; it is due to the fact that I just don't know the spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ok, Vex Thal CoH in nutshell - <br />
<br />
1st CoH spot -  Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyek (aka Blob1) room.  Blob1 is perma rooted.  CoH to him, kill to despawn warders.<br />
<br />
2nd CoH spot - This is trickier to describe.  There are 3 towers in VT (North, South and West).  Setting a COH bot in the towers is same principle.  The room w/ Name has 2 small rooms off it.  In each room there is a non-see invis roamer.  In the corner of these small rooms you camp the mage (Mage camped w/ invis).  Mage logs in, when mob starts roaming away, CoH shaman then warrior then everyone else.<br />
<br />
The main problem with Diabo Xi Va Temariel is you will get respawns of trash.</div></div><hr />

Basically you plant in corner bhind DXVT spawn.  Send in Rogue to DXVT spawn spot and train everything away as mage is loading.  Mage then COHs War, Shaman, cleric, etc.  W/ proper placement, you should get DXVT and 2 guards.</div></div><hr />

Ive got the Insignia....now Ill show off my noob-ness...Do I have to do the COM's in that order, or as I can get to them...secondly, as a lowly level 52, how many friends and of what level should I bring with me?  <br />
<br />
I'm of the mindset that our spells are there to help us IN combat, so I would definitely be in there whackin away!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">For Emp, dont even bother to do him with less then is useful unless you are very familiar with the encounter.  2 Groups could do it but the fight would be long and risky so no mistakes could happen.  Unless you like that prospect, I would just do him with 4 or 5 and be done with it.  Take your core 1-2 groups and add a another 2 pickups or guildies or friends guildies to the mix.  Then youre in and out in 1.5 hours. You will need the time to clear to your first named in VT. :)</div></div><hr />
