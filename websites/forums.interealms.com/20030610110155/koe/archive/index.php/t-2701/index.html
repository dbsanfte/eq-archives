<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to say thanks to all you guys for yesterday for allowing me to tag along to ToV even tho I was KOS and died on the way there in WW and then slaughtered 4 more times in ToV everytime to door opened.  I hope to have my faction fixed by our next trip there so I can do something other than lay on the floor and just stand long enough to dump some mana. After the ToV raid we took some of our 2ndaries out to a bunch of zones and I had more fun than I have in a loooong time playing EQ. Thanks to Canoe, Rizz, drunken Fan and the rest of you that were there or stopped by. Also the whole Rizz raid on Sullon Zek was great. Over all it was a great day.</div></div><hr />
