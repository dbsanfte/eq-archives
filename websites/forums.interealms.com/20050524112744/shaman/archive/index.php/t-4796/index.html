<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm interested in everyone's oppinion as to what kind of spells we should get. It boils down to what role do you want improved on raids.<br />
<br />
As for me:<br />
<br />
A new heal would be nice, the current 75% CH sounds nice and I could actually heal people outside the group.<br />
<br />
Also our DD (675 dmg) is out of date, all other casters and priests get FAR better DD's, thought about something around 900 damage, could also cost alot of mana as we don't have mana issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">debuff and group shrink for me plzthx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like my traditional role.  I'm a debuffer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like to debuff at the high end game.  I'd like more variety in it so we can stack better and effect mobs that are Immune to slow with some other interesting effects.<br />
<br />
Though, I do think some sort of improved heal in the 57-58th level range would be good.  Generally, any additional lower level shaman on raids ARE back up healers.  That's just how it is.  I spent most of 58 and 59 jamming down the Chloroblast button on every raid I was on.  <br />
<br />
I really don't think the CH is the way to go for Shaman.  I'd like to see Sup knocked down to 49 at least, if not 45.  Chloroblast moved down to 52/53 (51 has Turgurs, that's enough to make even the most jaded happy for a level or two).  Then put in a bigger heal around 56/57, keep the speed, but double the mana cost and healing power of Chloroblast.  This would let us do what we need to do at the point in our careers - keep clerics and enchanters alive on raids.  Server as a viable fast cast healer.  I'm also fine with Druids getting the same thing.<br />
<br />
A heal that takes 10 seconds is NOT what we need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nukes. On raids after buffing, there's just dot and nuke for us. We<br />
can go toe to toe with most &quot;experience&quot; mobs, but agains raid<br />
mobs we don't do enough melee damage and can't absorb <br />
enough damage to get close. This is fine, if we can contribute with<br />
dot's and nukes. Dot's are (hopefully) being made stackable, but<br />
frequently mobs don't last long enough for dot's to do much. Our<br />
cold and poison based nukes are weak and could use upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">shaman vs. chanter:<br />
cripple is equal.<br />
our slow beats theirs by a WHOPPING 5%!<br />
we can't really effect casters, but they have mana seive.<br />
<br />
Let's have some really distinctive mob gimpification.  I'm perfectly happy with my healing being a downtime phenomenon or emergency thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I voted debuffs.  It's what I do, and I like doing it.<br />
<br />
But, damage would be nice.  I wouldnt want to be wizard.  heck, wouldnt even want to be a druid.  But a cold, or even poison nuke upgrade would make me happy I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been thinking about this for awhile. How about some more disease based spells? I have two ideas.<br />
<br />
Disease based cripple - &quot;Your flesh begins to rot&quot; I think it would be even cooler if a disease based cripple was more powerful then the regular cripple. It makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Disease based nuke&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;Your skin is consumed by disease&quot; We have no nukes. A disease based nuke would be fairly unique and go along with our noob poison nuke. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think disease based shaman spells make so much sense. They would go along with the few disease based spells that we already have like Plague of Insects, Insideous Decay and Pox. They would also add some versatility to raid type situations where our spells are limited due to resists, like Glimmer Drakes in ToV for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Selkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">AoE root!<br />
<br />
J/K, my shaman isn't high level.  But wouldn't it be a trip? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">AoE root, though a nice dream, would probalby be too overpowering.<br />
Heh; though, Point blank and can root ourselves might make up for the benefit. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd just like Torpor :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Although I enjoy the support role, I would love to be able to put out more consistant, reliable damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like them all because I don't like being forced to take one role.  I love being multi-faceted and able to assume several different roles. So it is not really a question of one more than the other but making sure we stay the &quot;swiss-army&quot; knife of the priest class. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I really hoped for more disease based spells.  It's a completely underutilized resist (along with, surprise, poison our other major spell line for damage).<br />
<br />
Pre-Luclin we effectively got 1 disease spell (2 if you want to count plague) and a disease debuff.  All that can be said is what assmunch added the disease debuff.  Disease was much more prevalant early on apparently with the huge damage done over very long durations by our disease dots (anyone play a shaman in early beta know of any other disease spells a shaman had?).   Around 19 we even get an incredibly useless targetted DD+dot.  Why not give us a 'pillar' disease spell (no snare so we won't be quad kite munchkins).  Hell give us a gimpy feedback like spell called 'decaying aura' or something, a nice little 14-15 point DS out of nowhere.  The could even be original and make 'decaying aura' a 10 point DS that adds 2 disease damage per hand to the recipients weapon.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately our PoP spells will be improved acumen, improved group acumen, improved group acumen II, ubaDRPRspell, can Vb and at least one right click turned spell.</div></div><hr />
