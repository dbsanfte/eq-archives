<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recognize that thumbing through Magelo's database to dearch for upgrades can often be counterproductive, what with Test Server and Stormhammer items indistinguishable from the normal, production items.  Nevertheless ... I'd appreciate some help from the shaman community narrowing down where a couple of these items may come from.  If they are Test or Legends - that's fine - I'd just like to know so I can stop wondering. =)<br />

Entwood Earring<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=25695<br />
Given the name, I would assume a Storms drop, and given the impressive stats, I would assume a Lord (possibly the Ocean Lord), but haven't seen this on any loot list.  Of course, I don't doubt that it could be from elsewhere.  Naming-by-area has never been EQ's strong point (Shiny Metallic, anyone?).<br />
<br />
Netherbian Scale Vambraces<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=8134<br />
First added to the database last year, so clearly a Luclin-era item (which fits with the name), and updated recently (so probably not a one-shot GM item), these are really nice.  They are also tradeable, which isn't usually the case for wacky Stormhammer stuff.  Are these an exception, or something on Test that we never saw, or are these things out there someplace?<br />
<br />
Scornful's Chromatic Talisman<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=30390<br />
I've found that a lot of the items with this style of name are Stormhammer GM awarded items, but I just thought I'd check if this wasn't a drop off something unusual in a back corner of PoP.  The 1-pt rune component to the effect makes it a downtime gimmick, but its still a nice item.<br />
<br />
Stout Water Repellant Boots<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=19097<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17386<br />
These are actually listed as being from PoStorms by Allakhazam.  They seem too weak to be from the Lords, but as far as I know they aren't on the loot list of anything else.  Possibly an alternate reward from the Relv's forest quest ... or maybe Ston'Ruak?<br />
<br />
Supple Armadillo Scale Sleeves<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=11401<br />
Like the Netherbian Scale Vambraces, these are tradeable.  The insert date, recommended level, and the int/wis switch to me all indicates a Storms drop (even the Storms-crafted Hurricane chain was int instead of wis until recently).  Are these just some insanely rare drop off of one the assorted armadillo types in zone?  Or is there a rare that I'm not aware of?  Or are these, like so many items, derived from Legends rather than typical play?</div></div><hr />
