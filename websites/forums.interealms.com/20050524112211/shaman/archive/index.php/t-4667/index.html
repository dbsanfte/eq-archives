<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used to be a druidic shaman, with the help of this board and the lack of being able to kill blues easily, i switched and got a few AC hp pieces.  A couple days back i read a couple posts about druids VS shaman on this board.  It got me to thinking if since there are druidic shaman are there shamanistic druids?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not that i know off<br />
<br />
theres no real reason to have a shammanistic druid, as they dont beneifit from AC/HP as much as we do.<br />
<br />
Of course theres gonna be a druid w/ amazing HP's out there(uber guild), but thats due to having uber stuff, not goin all out for HP/AC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My buddy has good HP and AC.  He learned from watching me take hits that HP are important and so is AC.  His ac is over 930 when he wants to tank, and his HPs are close to my own totals.  You'd be amazed at what we can duo given the simple fact that he can take some hits.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One of the best Druids on Xev (Courbis, may have moved to AB), routinely had unbuffed AC &gt; 900.<br />
<br />
I tell ya, if all druids were as a55-kicking / non-whining as him, I'd change my tune.<br />
<br />
But they're not - so I won't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">one of the reasons (but not the only) we have high high hp is for canni.  If a druid was stocked with mod-rods, and had high HP/AC, im thinking that would make him Shamanistic, and with ES vambraces so they can clicky dot like we clicky JBB</div></div><hr />
