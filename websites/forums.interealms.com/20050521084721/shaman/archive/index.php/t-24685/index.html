<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bladefury~fennin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After having extremely good luck getting my epic (i did it from start to finish in 3 days with no guild and just duoing with my cleric mostly)  i just wanted to see how other epic stack up against ours.  It seems for how easy ours is it doesnt have that bad of stats and its effect does come in handy.  So just wanted to see how other classes feel about their epic and what it took to get it.<br />
<br />
To start off.. can someone post a link from lucy for ALL classes epics.  Im at work and can only view items listed on lucy for some reason . heh but i cant seem to find other classes epic ..mostly cause i dont know there exact names.<br />
<br />
Once we get that list up we can see how all these epics compare to one another.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
