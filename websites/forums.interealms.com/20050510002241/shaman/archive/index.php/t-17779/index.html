$75 to move w/ items intact.  Can only move each char once per 6 months.<br />

I don't know about Sullon (you might have been able to move there before), but quite certain you couldn't go to the others, they wanted to help keep the balance.  Guess $75 a pop is more important.</div></div><hr />

I've been wondering when they'd break down and do this. Have to admit that it would be nice if my boyfriend could bring his clicky Cleric to Stromm but that whole 1 year no transfer rule appears to still be intact :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not?  I hate the idea but it already happens via EBay.  Sadly one can buy anything game related over the internet from 3rd party vendors.  UO is just saying, hey, we want all the money from our game, why let some 3rd party make money off of OUR product?<br />
<br />
I was thinking of this yesterday.<br />
<br />
If SOE offered you preleveled characters, tons of plats, any item you wanted, etc - I'd feel kind of sickened and feel like my gaming accomplishments were diminished.  It just seems like it would be a really lame thing for a company to do - develop a game then sell all the accomplishments available for extra cash.  Hi, we'll just create some new data for you - we don't even camp the stuff!  I'd bet that many people would be upset if SOE started offering all of these extra perks....yet few really feel upset over the fact that all of this stuff is readily available from 3rd parties or players.  In some ways I wish SOE *would* just sell all the stuff so that the vampires couldn't make money off of someone else's game - and if SOE sold the crap then there might be less powercamping bots out there sucking plats up to sell online, less of people searching for the next big exploit for plats, and less PLers building characters to sell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xysander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Originally you could not transfer to or from a zek server, but they added that option in around Aug 2002.  I don't recall if you could transfer to/from Sullon but I know you could to the other 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think the transfers with items are wonderful. As someone posted on another board I read...<br />
<br />
In EQ you're not a kickass warrior with a sword, you're a warrior with a kickass sword. At high level, your gear is your character. I could never and would never transfer a character and lose all the gear for that very reason. I'm surprised the price is so high, but /shrug. I just thought the profit point would be with a little lower price than that. <br />
<br />
As far as them selling items for cash. I always thought that was a ridiculous stupid idea, in any game. But maybe it's better than ebay.  The big problem with the idea, of course, is that they'd then start adding uber items and making them stupidly rare to get WITHOUT buying them, just so that people would pony up the cash. I wouldn't want to see that in EQ. Although, it'd be an interesting change. Right now, it's the people who can spend 50 hours a week in game that have everything. It'd be an interesting change in dynamics if people could get stuff WITHOUT huge time investments. Probably not a positive one, though. Lord knows I dropped Magic like a hot potato as soon as I realized it was all about how much money you were willing to spend on cards. <br />
<br />
But, for all that, there is one item I'd pony up RL cash for. The stupid Nature's Melody without which my pretty uber bard is still gimped for providing group haste. Can't get it any more since my guild will never do Tunare again (and any guild that is on that level of the game will do virtually nothing else of any interest to me). Missed my chance, and will probably never see PoTime to get the only upgrade in the game, as I just don't play THAT much any more. But I suppose that just brings me back to my earlier point - as soon as they let you buy uber loot for $, they'll make that the easiest (only for most people) way to get the items. And that would NOT be good. The game is catass enough (read: too much) as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sadly, the day they allow moves to Stromm is the day that server goes to hell.  The server should NEVER be allowed to transfer so it keeps the integrity that it has.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
They most likely set it at $75 to try and keep the demand for transfers to a reasonable level.  If you set it at their actual cost (probably like $5) you would have thousands upon thousands of requests to move since its a minimal fee.  At $75 you'll get only those that are serious about the move and not those that are doing it &quot;just for the hell of it, its only 5 bucks&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only problem that is going to come out of this...  full guild transfers from heavily congested end game servers to servers with few high end guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Stromm isn't exactly different than other servers at this point. The rampant &quot;trading plat on X for plat here&quot; as well as the numerous player auctions for the server erased whatever &quot;newbie&quot; status it had a while ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">it is late, but still great change, it used to cost same $75 for nake transfer, Sony make pretty dumn good $$ from it, now they realise this will be good source of $$ so they make better offer to get more people transfer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't see why they can't make it an in-game based option.  Depending on the db setup, they're doing one of 2 things for these requests:<br />
1) replication of your character record from one database to another (server to server) then deletion from the original database.<br />
2) Changing the server attribute in a central database for your character record.<br />
As part of the move they modify your character's name if it is not unique and reset any guild info in your record.<br />
<br />
It's not rocket surgery, so of course SOE must do it by hand and charge you for several months worth of gametime for something that ought to have been in-game from release for maybe a nominal fee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sethrel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">This is a very cool feature.  Currently I am on Stormhammer because my friend and I started on different servers.  We now have the option of paying $75 to move to a server where we can be together and not have to pay double the monthly fee.<br />
<br />
I bet there are quite a few on Stormhammer that are there because they wanted to be together on the same server and had started on different servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">When they opened the server that they sold item transfers on I really expected them to do this a few weeks later. Really suprised its taken this long personally. The fee that still annoys me is $50 to move a character between accounts. You're already paying $50+ for a new set of software then they jack you another $50 to move a character over. I just bought evo+ldon for a third account, now I gotta wait till I got $50 extra dollars to transfer my port/track bish over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I cannot imagine the amount of drool pouring from Yantis' mouth right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hmmm...I wonder what server has only a couple guilds in the Eles and Time? :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong. There are no Time guilds on Stromm, only two in elemental planes, and only two even working on tier 1-3 bosses. Server transfers, geared or not would ruin the current integrity of Stromm, and all those who played hard for 6 months to get where they are.<br />
<br />
Mudflation is high because of several people three boxing 24/7 (taking shifts I assume) to farm several places in the game, and sell that for RL cash. It's pathetic, but SoE doesn't even _try_ to prevent it, thus mid 50's spells selling for 5-10k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">By that line of thinking, anyone who has done a cross server trade for plat has also ruined that integrity but I don't see anyone up in arms about that. Like I said, Stromm lost its integrity the moment the server board had to create a whole forum specifically for cross server trades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I wonder why the poor folks on Firiona Vie are still stopped from leaving the server. I mean, they can still get off it, they just need to ALSO spend 30 days on Stormhammer, as you can apparently transfer from SH to any normal server via the char transfer service.<br />
<br />
Poor FV never recovered from the plat-for-dollars sites 'discovering' the amazing no NO DROP ruleset.<br />
<br />
And the homepage has claimed for ages that they don't even do naked transfers to FV, which is a blatant lie as the top end guilds are recruiting from off-server and the transfers are arriving in good order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've been waiting for this for ever.   I'm heading to SZ to get my ass whooped weeeeee!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Azzik i could care less about how much Platinum or what equipment people would bring to Stromm.  The MOST important has already been pointed out.  Those of us that have busted our butts to get into the upper Tiers of PoP would immediately be ousted by those guilds that would transfer to Stromm fully flagged and completely upset the entire balance that has been created.<br />
The only reason i can see that you are not understanding this is that you aren't one of us that would be adversely effected by it.  Stromm is still the Low Man on the totem pole as opposed to other servers and i for one came back to play because of this reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I honestly don't believe you need to worry much about a whole time-level guild transferring to some backwater server where they can be big fish in a little pond.  The guilds that have that level of order and dedication are likely already top on their servers.<br />
<br />
What I am less fond of is that now the server trash can move freely (they ruined their own lands, here they come to ruin mine).  Our server has a &quot;S*** List&quot; and I am sure other servers have similar, to let people be aware of who to avoid.  While it is rare I know each server likely has it's handful of severe jerks.  Allowing them to transfer freely with no record of where they came from would be a bit unfair to the server's they are heading to in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Like the name-change option, server transfer should have a list attached so that people can look up the backgrounds on these people.  It doesn't mean much to a lot of players, but if you are involved in a raiding guild and depending on your members, it is best to be able to find out exactly who you are dealing with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">/agree Mathi... they might as well advertise it like this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Escape your permanently fubar reputation on your server!  Escape to a new server with your ill-gotten gains from your MQ and Casino scams!  Then rinse and repeat on a new server of unsuspecting saps every six months!  Only $75 per transfer!&quot;</div></div><hr />

They are not allowing me to transfer off VS to an american server.<br />
I never signed up for a transfer TO vs, which means im still an soe customer.  They never should have had the 3 euro servers tied to the rest. Ends up screwing over US players like myself.  <br />
<br />
If i had known i couldnt reap the same benifits as US players when i started on VS, i never would have.  I'm not even a new dawn customer.  Just a regular ol american joe like most. we just chose VS for the hell of it, flip of a coin, what have you. Welcome to everquest, where you can be shafted by people oversea's without leaving your chair!<br />
<br />
I considered coming back to eq because of this, but i guess i will just cancel, not playing anyways :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but by starting up on VS doesn't that make you a UbiSoft customer? And everyone has seen how seamless and gelled that relationship has been since they started...<br />
<br />
That said, if they're allowing transfers to  VS, it seems a little off not to allow transfers from  VS. Unless Ubi are losing too many customers as it is and daren't risk dropping any more...<br />

Er, it's SoE who have made the offer, not Ubi, so if anyone's shafting you it's people from your own country.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually this was more directed at euro's killing everything while we sleep. It was a crappy thing to say, sorry.<br />
<br />
And you are right, i've done alot of digging since that post.  I've gone as far as i can with ubi. They where very nice i might add.  Of cource sony just shut me down right off.  I'm gonna find the path to the top. Someones head will be on a stick when im done, this angers me to no end. <br />
<br />

<br />
Nope, theres a few of us kinda stuck in the middle. Theres a couple more in this boat with me.  If you tranfered to VS you became a ubi customer.  Thing is, you can log onto it as a normal paying sony customer.  Of cource theres no warning anytime during the damn 65 levels that i played there that said; by logging on and playing on vs i would be excluded from regular soe benifits and/or offers.</div></div><hr />
