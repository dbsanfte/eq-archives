 last time i loged in it was still 2k hit for 60  (ie our 61 pet )  but i willl log in tomorrow and check too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">2k hit for 60 (ie our 61 pet ) <br />
<br />
Sorry to be stating the obvious but if the above is true … why offer this pet to us at all?  <br />
<br />
Maybe this pet is higher than our level 58 warrior type pet … say level 60 something.   Hopefully it duel welds and has SoW nativity but I’m not expecting it.  In fact, it would not surprise me that our new pet spell is the exactly the same spell as 61 with a new name and pet level.   <br />
<br />
It’s hard to determine information about pet’s from Lucy because the seemingly only difference between them is the “extra” field as follows; <br />
<br />
Farrel's Companion SHM/67 shaman_wolf_67_<br />
True Spirit SHM/61 SpiritWolf242<br />
Spirit of the Howler SHM/55 SpiritWolf237 <br />
<br />
Maybe someone else has better update/feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Might the &quot;shaman_wolf&quot; instead of the &quot;SpiritWolf&quot; denote anything different possibly? New model, new features, new anything? Or just a different label?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Could - and since I didn't beta test this expansion I can't add anything other than response to the reports that this pet is same as True Spirit pet with 2K HP and max hit of 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Enchanters reported thier pet went from 35ish DPS to 55ish, so let's hope ours sees an improvement of somewhere around that tune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i checked last nite it is still our 61 pet, basically dev incompetance is why, they changed the name but forgot to actually change our pet. it is the 61 pet and despite feedback and bugging every day they havent chnaged it yet, but i will check again today. either that or the devs know which is even worse.<br />
<br />
btw no graphical change it the exact same thing at this time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My first day in OoW beta my pet was killed by a non slowable green con mob. I just laughed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When I logged in yesterday morning to the beta, it seemed like an identical copy of the 61 pet. I'd be happier with my 61 pet being a spirit again :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Obviously an oversight.  Both the pet and Spiritual Serenity (Increase Hitpoints v2 by 455 per tick at level 70) have not been updated/changed from the placeholders that they were to the final spell stats.  In light of the fact that BoT is already 630/tick, it will be interesting to see what they make SS.  I believe 800/tick has been proposed in the past by others, I'd agree with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">and once again an expansion will go live with shaman spells uncompleted &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">and once again an expansion will go live with shaman spells uncompleted &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
That's a surprise?<br />
<br />
For some reason, I thought Q was still 360 and thought &quot;Yeah, SS is an upgrade&quot;, then looked it again and went &quot;Wait a minute... it's basically Quiescence v1.1&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Changes haven't been entered yet.  Rytan will be changing our pet tuesday as part of the patch.  The new pet will be level 70.  It should hit for a max of 3 damage, bash for 1.  It won't dual wield even with 2 weapons so shaman don't have to worry about carrying around any more rusty weapons, and it's currently slated to have 30 hp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Chutoi, don't forget the 3000 mana cost is most in-expensive. I can't believe they're letting us get away with anything less than 5000! =P</div></div><hr />

So you are saying it's still level 58? or is it higher? Max hit and hp might be the same in that case, but a higher level pet would have higher innate atk/AC, which means that it would cope better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its still blue at 70, but i cant say whether is is higher level or not, all i know is it hit for 60 and had 2k hp, which suggest the same pet, also same cast time and mana cost. no pet that increase has stayed the same hit or hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
More importantly, who the heck is Farrel and why is the pet named after him?  /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Is it really possible the major upgrade is pet level with same performance stats so the new pet can actually still damage the lvl 70 mobs as the 61 pet did to 65 mobs?<br />
<br />
In otherwords, only upgrade is to raise pet level to match new content mob level?<br />
<br />
How sad that would be ... from speedbump to just gravel on the road.</div></div><hr />
