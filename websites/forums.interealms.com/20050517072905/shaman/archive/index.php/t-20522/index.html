<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, something went south in the latest patch.<br />
<br />
Bearform with shrink used to be great for climbing up slopes.<br />
Now it can barely climb stairs that used to be trivial with max shrink.<br />
<br />
I havent been to Velks yet, but I suspect that the 'shortcut' up to Upper Spiders for small races and shrunken peopel no longer works at all.<br />
<br />
Anybody else having problems with sizes and movement under the new engine/patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have read that with this new patch, characters slow down when running up hill.  This may have something to do with it.  Anyone have any insight into this one?  Haven't really noticed anything myself but I haven't been looking either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Man it sucked I could not get accorss marus seru for crap.<br />

I  kmow i will be blasted for trying to help but here goes.<br />
I believe it may be part of the 'wall bug' that has cropped up since the last patch. you can view a thread about it and comment here;<br />

This has been giving me and many in my guild fits since yesterday</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With the last patch a new feature was introduced. I basically makes it impossible to climb stairs for small races (and other shrunk players) by any other means than jumping.<br />
I noticed that in Tower of SolRO and Plane of Torment. <br />
To compensate for this you now have a high probability to fall through the world to experience new interesting views of the zone.<br />
Also added is the possibility to box mobs into the walls where they cant be targeted anymore, while themselves able to dish out damage, which enriches encounters.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like the new anti-wall code is &quot;Working as intended&quot;.  LOL</div></div><hr />
