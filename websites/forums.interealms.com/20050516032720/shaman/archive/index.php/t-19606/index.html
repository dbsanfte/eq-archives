<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The discussion of the Q upgrade (is 20% more enough?) highlights a real design challenge as EQ gets older.  For those of us not yet in LDON hard or the elemental planes, the existing Q is fine for healing and a 20% upgrade is about right for the new mobs we will likely face in GoD.  But those already in EP and above are finding they need more like a 500hp/tic heal from Q to be an effective healer.  We live in two different worlds, and our needs and balancing are different.<br />
<br />
You could deal with this by having the 500hp/tic Q upgrade be available as a no drop spell in the highest raiding zones, so only those who need it can get it.  The problem is that those shaman can also go to all the other zones, and it leaves the rest of us a second rate shaman in those other zones and situations.  Over time, if you pursued this design approach, the ubers and the casuals would really be playing two different games in the same online world.<br />
<br />
Maybe Sony needs to acknowledge this and just have some &quot;uber&quot; servers with different balancing that you graduate to when you kill Quarm or something.<br />
<br />
Sony needs to keep providing upgrades for folks who play 40+ hours a week that are not available to folks who play 20 hours per week, or the game will not hold the interest of the hard core.  But how do you do this without trivializing the role and sense of accomplishment of the casuals, who fall further and further behind in their relative competency in the &quot;open&quot; zones and raids?<br />
<br />
I dont know the answer to this, but it seems like a core issue for the game going into year 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sony faces and I think always will face this issue. They face class balancing as well as balancing content for casual players vs. hardcore players. It is not an easy task, with so many subscribers you are always going to have a lot of unhappy people with the state of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actualy think the Idea of having a &quot;special&quot; server for people at the end game would be really cool . Of course it should be only if they choose too . Kinda like &quot;You have grown so strong you have acended too an alt reality .&quot; <br />
Sorta a cool concept .. with super juiced powers and mobs .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Trust me man, if people are able to hack it in elementals, they arent taking your spots in groups at the lower end of things. Call me a snob, but I really dont have a big desire to set foot in BoT, HoH or other spots. I generally dont take LDON groups outside the guild, unless with friends, in case they would pick me over you anyways :P<br />
<br />
Having the spells be no drop in a set zone would be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If such a server existed, the amount of trash and cockblocking would reach entirely new heights.<br />
<br />
That would be a CS nightmare... especially since all you're likely to get is a guide with rather limited power to resolve any situation. <br />
<br />
As for spells only in high end zones, they already tried this with Ancients, and it would appear they are moving that way again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think Roxanne has a point though.  Balance may be near the core of what we are all complaining about.  Many of the upgrades that we're getting seem to be fairly OK for those of us who still spend our time in the *gasp* old world, LoY, and LDoN.  <br />
<br />
Those of you who are in the EP and above, I think, are right to complain that these spells (and most of the AA's) really won't have a significant impact in the zones you adventure in and the encounters you face.<br />
<br />
In stead of a no-drop spell, what about spells that could auto-tune themselves to the zone you are in.  Make the new Q heal 500/tick in EP and above and 360 in the rest of the zones.   Make KM (OMG! someone still uses that?) bump up to 2.7K in the Tier 1 planes, 3.5K in the Tier 2 Planes, and 4.25K in the EP and above.  <br />
<br />
I think an approach like that might make the balance a bit more innate. Casual players would have upgrades that benefit them where they EXP just as much as the hardcore would from the zones they EXP/RAID in.  It might also help prevent some over-balancing if the higher end people tried to farm targets in the lower planes (like the group of 6 time people who keep stealing the BoT named from 40+ person raids for whom they are an appopriate challenge).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The general idea of ancient spells is a good one ( don't hit me yet!). As is casters get most of their power early in an expansions via spells while melees get to slowy pick it up.<br />
Ideally there would be a way to upgrade existing spells somehow but I doubt that is possible from the programming side. That leaves us with ancient spells, the drop rate of which is horrible. A vendor deep in raid zones selling nodrop spell upgrades would be nice.<br />
- Everyone gets a 350 heal when the expansion goes live.<br />
- Most people get their 400 heal a while later when it is discovered.<br />
- Some raiders discover a new vendor, selling, say 3 spells, one of them a 450 heal.<br />
- Deep in one of the harder raid zones a NPC will give you a 500 heal in exchange for three uncommon drops.<br />
<br />
Of course if that ever goes live my guildleader will kill me for having suggested a system that makes more people send him tells like &quot;d00d cn u gt me to teh vendro plz!1&quot;.<br />
<br />
Still, I would like an implementation like that. Gradual upgrades, no ultra-rare spells like the current ancients, much room to fiddle with. Wouldn't work for long-refresh spells though I guess.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is already a large gap between casual and Time players.  Those who want the gear, need to spend the countless hours of progression to get it.  But, making spells even more difficult to get is moronic.  Casual players struggle with their 50's, and most don't even think about getting their 65's.  Melees don't get special skills and Time, so casters shouldn't get their own special set of spells either IMO.<br />

<br />
Not to mention the fact that if Sony has to develop two separate games, one for ubers, one for the other 95% of the EQ playerbase then clearly the ubers are going to get left out in the cold at some point in the future.<br />
<br />
We've seen a number of threads on this board now that have addressed this same topic.  Its quite clear that the ubers cannot (or choose not to) grasp this simple point.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry the more I read this board, the more I realize most of the uber guilds see the entire population of Everquest as nothing more than obstacles, annoyances and lag. At the best people to be ridiculed.  I really have a hard time caring about the plight of the 5th shaman in Time who is sporting 8k hps and whining he's bored.<br />

This board has hit a low end. It used to be a source of info and a place to post accomplishment even if small. Nowdays you can't even post you got into the Elemental Planes without some weiner saying its old news. This board is dead, about as usefull as monkly business if it continues this way.

Noone, not a single person I have seen says that ancient spells are a good idea. Even if they did how you make the connection that proposing harder challenges giving greater rewards somehow means the person in question hates casual players is mindboggling. Just in case you meant me, I probably am what most people consider 'uber' (hate that word). I regularly group with a casual, bazaar-geared paladin as my tank. I regularly get random lfg people if no guildies need group. I would rather have some FT1, 5AA cleric who knows his job then a clueless time-geared cleric.<br />
Bottom line, you can like raiding without hating people. You can propose more time spent should give greater reward without hating casual players.<br />

You will find idiots anywhere, casuals, 'ubers' and in between. A lot of people like to brag about their gear and some do it in a way that hurts other people. That does not mean every raider hates casuals. And yes, raidin shaman do have issues - though you seem to realize that, you just don't care about them. That is pretty similar to the attitude you tell us raiders are supposed to have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well Ancient spells in itself are a good idea but SoE needs to issue a second part to those spells.<br />
<br />
Having better spells for the &quot;Uber&quot; raiders is not a problem<br />
Having those spells available in all the content is.<br />
<br />
Soe should simply make a raid specific set of spells and make it so those only work during the raids they are designed for, that way the play field stays even when we xp in &quot;open&quot; zones and they can still balance the encounter difficulty with better spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well at least this thread i see some good arguement. this is what we should be doing, not the stuff i be seeing lately.<br />
<br />
It should be noted that GoD is desigen for 55+ with content VT, EP, and TIME difficult, and that alot of players can get too, ie it not meant to take more tha a group to get flag for alot the harder content. or so its been suggested, there fore the problems some shaman are getting will eventually i think affect all. I think a lot of GoD will show shamans unbalance out, but alot more shaman will be able to get to these points, i beleive it will only take time before alot more poeple see the probelem not just shaman,<br />
<br />
but time it what it will take it seems, which is way i will wait before i buy GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think that the original implementation of ancient spells was good.  Think about it like this:<br />
<br />
When Luclin came out, the only items with focus effects were those in VT.  I could be wrong, but I don't think there are any Improved Damage type focuses in VT.  There certainly weren't any Burning Affliction type items then, (there is one there now) as BA4 wasn't implemented until well in to PoP.  So, without these focus items, all shamans were doing the same amount of damage via bane of nife, poxx, and whatever nuke we used then.  Obviously, some shamans had bigger mana pools and more FT than others, but everyone had the same potential damage output - some could just sustain it longer.  Then, with ancient scourge, those shamans who had reached the final stages of the expansion got an upgrade that did 254 damage a tick (versus 214 for bane of nife).  That is an 18.6% upgrade (more or less the same improvement you get with the best dot focus in Time http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3509).  This gave the uber shaman the capacity to deal damage slightly faster than a non-uber shaman.  Considering the time it took then (and it still isn't easy now) to get a guild VT keyed, is this upgrade unreasonable?  I don't think it is.<br />
<br />
Also consider ancient feral avatar (the only spell in my spellbook that I have never cast), a 20% upgrade from the previous two avatars.  This about how big of a difference avatar makes for a melee.  What is 20% of that improvement?  Pretty insignificant.<br />
<br />
The original purpose of ancient spells was to make the uber players' spells just a little bit better than the non-uber players' spells, but they did not add any new functionality (with the exception of the ancient bard mezz, which is unresistable).  I feel this was fair and justified.  VT also brought us mana preservation effects, which once again made uber players slightly better than non-ubers.  It is nice to have a way to improve your character other than just throwing on more mana and hp.  <br />
<br />
Then, in PoP, there were no ancient spells.  Everyone gets the same spells, and anyone that puts forth a decent effort can obtain them. We're now back to where we were in velious - everyone has the same spell damage output.  However, in place of Ancient spells, we now have a series of escalating focus effects.  Anyone can get an ID4 item for 5k in the bazaar or after spending a little time in tak (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=43409).  There are spell haste, detrimental extension, and beneficial extension augments available as well.  There are also cheap pottery items available for further DoT focus effects, which anyone can obtain easily.  Regretfully, there are no extremely easy MP4 items to get, although they are still obtainable by anyone that can save money (PoWater pottery item and Ornate boots).  I stand by what I said that anyone can get these focus effects and items that I just mentioned.  It will take a pretty significant amount of time and money-saving, but a guildless person can still do it, albeit slower than one that has a crew to group/farm with every day.<br />
<br />
Combine 10% more effectiveness with 10% less mana used, 10% less time spent casting a spell, and spells that last 10% longer, and you'll find that all these focii add up to make you a lot more powerful than you were without them.<br />
<br />
Players that raid get improved focus effects.  Instead of 10% mana pres, I get 15%.  Instead of 20% improved healing, I get 30%.  Instead of 10% extension, I get 20%, so on and so forth.  This makes up for a lack of ancient spells.  My spells are more effective and more mana efficient than someone without these upgraded focii.  Considering all the time I have spent raiding, I don't think this is an unfair reward.  If it wasn't for focus effects, itemization would be extremely boring.<br />
<br />
I would even go so far as to say that it is these effects, rather than hp/mana, that creates most of the gap between raiders and non.  The extra HP and mana really only gives you a safety buffer, it doesn't make you kill faster or heal for more.<br />
<br />
So, basically, focus effects have replaced the need for ancient spells, and this makes me wonder why we are getting them in GoD and what it could mean for the division between raiders and non.  If focus effects in GoD are as much an improvement over Time effects as Time effects were over VT, then I am not sure why ancients would be necessary.  Right now, I suspect that there will be significantly improved focus items in GoD, and less focus items will trickle down (i.e., casual people will have focus effects as good as what I have now, while I have something 10% better).  This is fine.  However, if you throw in ancient spells, that's a big jump in power (all ancient spells except ours and sk's are an exact 20% improvement on its predecessor).  I can see how this would be unfair and frustrating to those that couldn't obtain them (remember, though, we still have no idea how hard they will really be to get).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">focus efect arent really the same as a spell, for 1 thing focus effect can affect all casting classes. therefore using these make any class better not just shaman.<br />
yes they make it easier for any class that has them, but a druid or cleric without this items can still function fine in a healing role for example. a shaman without these cant, and with i would say only just.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think of it like this:  You can either have an item that you wear which improves your heals by exactly 20% every time, or you can have a tnarg's that heals 1560 every time, which do you chose?  Tnarg's is the only direct heal spell effected by IH that we use, so the end result is the same: a 1560pt direct heal.<br />
<br />
Ancient spells should be just more powerful versions of normal spells.  We didn't need ancient spells in PoP because with PoTime focus effects, your spells are already significantly more powerful than with standard focus effects.  Wizards, for example, can easily choose from several 35% improved damage for items.  This makes their Strike of Solusek average to 17.5% better than a Strike of Solusek without focus.  An ancient spell that only PoTime people can get, combined with an improved nuke that only PoTime people can get would have created an even larger gap in power between PoTime people and non-PoTime people.  For PoP, focus effects took the place of ancient spells - they increased the magnitude and the strength of previously existing spells without adding any new functionality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah there is a divide between the raiding and grouping game, I commented on this back along that the raiding game is contrary to that of the grouping game although I cannot remember my reasons for saying it. I think it was in reference to tradeskills.<br />
<br />
As a  note, I think final fantasy deal with this problem, by uniting all the spell casts of say every wizard to have a united effect. Not quite sure the specifics but that concept alone sounded very interesting.<br />
<br />
Ancient spells are a game infrastructure, the idea of having an upgrade which is non equipment is very appealing to raid players. So I am not opposed to ancient spells as alot of others are. However, I kinda object to such a desired upgrade such as the new cannibalize being made ancient. Its utility would be invaluable to every shaman, and I would prefer that the ancient spell is not so game altering as that but instead something along the lines of something else. I mean I couldn't care about ancient scourge of nife or Feral Avatar even though at the time they would have been very nice upgrades. I did get them but they weren't so desired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Jinheim:<br />
There are certainly several ways to give the 'uber' casters better spells, be it AAs, focus items or ancients. I do not think any of these are necessarily bad. However the rarity of the first set of ancients was, in my opinion way too high.<br />
More important, as you yourself noted, you need to make the basic spells themselves available. Focus items can take care of improved effect, speed or efficiency but they can not make up for a different base spell. In the case of GoD that means focus effects cannot turn Cannibalize IV into our ancient spell, which is the biggest, most central and most sorely needed of our new spells.<br />
<br />
Spreading caster improvements between AA, tiered spells (300 HoT, 330 HoT, 360 HoT, or something like that) and focus items would also give a steadier increase in caster power then the current way, which gives most casters 80% of their power when a new expansion arrives, 10% more soon after when the first focus items are acquired and the last 10% over the rest of the expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The original implemention of Ancient spells was retarded.  They were dropping off Brogg in Old sebilis.  After they fixed that they were only dropping from Vulak...that dragon with the ae called &quot;Ancient Breath&quot;.  Also a stupid place to put them.  That pretty much put them out of reach of everyone, casual or hardcore.  The casual couldn't get them, and the hardcore didn't want to.<br />
<br />
They will probably drop of something as equally retarted, but we can always hope for Brogg again.</div></div><hr />
