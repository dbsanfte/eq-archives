<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Q: If I have 500 pts at Guk, 500 pts at MM, 500 pts at Nro and 1492 pts at Everfrost, then I can buy two(2) 1492 items at Everfrost, is that correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, that is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">long as you haven't already spent 8 or more points :P  hee hee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">okay, now i'm confused.  If you get 1492 at one vendor and so many at another its like having 1492 at that vendor correct.<br />
<br />
What happens when you spend 1492 points from your main vendor do you start again at ground zero?<br />
<br />
Say i have 1492 at everfrost, 500 at the other camps, buy two items at everfrost depleting all my points do I now have to wait and accumulate 1492 at evefrost to buy more?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nope.<br />
<br />
You just have to accumulate 1492 totally from any camp to buy your next piece of armor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The total number of points you have EVER earned at a given camp is remembered by the vendors at that camp.  You can buy stuff up to that level, and they will show you stuff a tad beyond that level to whet your appetite.<br />
<br />
You can spend points earned from any camp at any camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The way someone described it to me, is consider points earned at a camp as faction with that camp.<br />
<br />
You can spend the points anywhere, but you can only buy items from camp X up to the value that you've earned at that camp.<br />
<br />
As an aside - someone told me a couple of days ago that once you buy a 1492 point item, that unlocks all camps. I've only heard that from one source, and it doesn't sound true, but can anyone confirm or deny for my peace of mind?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sounds like a load of dung to me. I don't believe it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funnily enough, I don't believe it either, like I said in the post, but I was really asking for a definitive &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">long as you haven't already spent 8 or more points :P  hee hee<br />
<br />
That should read &quot;... 9 or more points&quot; as 1500 - 8 = 1492.<br />
<br />
You have become better at nitpicking (255)  :D .</div></div><hr />
