You can get a mini torpor spell in LOY (stoicism, cool but I was 65 when it came out so irrelevant for me but good for you).<br />
You get kragg's mending, a 10 second casting 1950 pt heal (extremely cool)<br />
You can research your rare kunark/velious/luclin spells.<br />
Your 55 and below pet still sucks but the 61 pet is pretty beefy.<br />
In PoP, our existing abilities got marginally increased.  Nothing new really, same sh1t different expansion.  The most notable shaman ability in PoP IMHO is a good blast heal, followed by group shrink and haste.<br />
<br />
I haven't played in a few weeks though so I am probably forgetting something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kragg's is a level 58 spell, he won't have access to that yet.  However, if he's really been gone a year and a half he might not have Superior Heal yet, it was moved to lvl 51 from level 55 some time ago.<br />
<br />
The most notable thing about POP is that XP there ROCKS.   You can solo in PoD/PoN at 54 but it's risky and probably not worth it - you'll do much better grouped.  Like half a yellow per hour in the right group in Plane of Nightmare at your level.<br />
<br />
Oh, and hell levels are gone.  That means 55 won't be any different from 54 XP-wise.</div></div><hr />
