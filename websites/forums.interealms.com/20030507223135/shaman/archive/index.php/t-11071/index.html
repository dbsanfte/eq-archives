<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thizzlenob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just started a Bar Sham.  I am currently at level 13, so I am about to get root at 14.  <br />
<br />
My question is, when someone says to root, dot, dot, nuke, sit(for example purposes), does that mean cast the same dot twice?  I don't know if the same dot stacks with itself.  Or just cast any disease based dot and any poison based dot, as long as they are not both poison or both disease?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It means to cast two different dots.  If you had two seperate poison dots you could cast those, but more than likely you will go poison/disease.  Be ready to reapply root and do NOT use enstill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All shaman DoTs stack with all other shaman DoTs, so you can stack as many different poison and disease spell combinations as you like. <br />
<br />
You can stack any posion DoT with any other posion DoT and any disease DoT with any other Disease DoT. You cannot stack any DoT with itself - i.e. casting &quot;sicken&quot; twice on the same mob will not double the damage, because the second casting will overwrite the first casting.<br />
<br />
I have heard that Verant have changed casting rules so that if 2 shaman cast the same DoT on a mob, bith DoTs will stick and do thusly do double damage, but I have not verified this for myself.<br />
<br />
Typically though, you would stack your best poison DoT and your best disease DoT only. Obviously the disease DoT is slower acting so you would only need to re-apply the poison DoT.<br />
<br />
In actual fact, if I recall correctly, the shaman DoTs at level 14 are rather weak, and are, in fact, of only marginal benefit (they are however, much more efficient than our puny DD spells!). Nevertheless, you should teach yourself how to &quot;root n rot&quot; efficiently, because as your DoTs become more powerful, it does become a more viable tactic at higher levels. It is better to learn the basics of your tactics against mobs that are relatively weak - learning new tactics at higher levels can be a painful learning curve!<br />
<br />
N.B. As a shaman, it is important that you do not become too dependent on &quot;root n rot&quot; (you are not a druid!). It is a good efficient tactic, but if used exclusively, it will be to the detriment of your other abilities. You need to keep your weapon skills maximised, and also your affense and defense. Defense is the most vital ability you have, so keep it maxed at every level - The reason for this will become increasingly apparent as you gain levels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't bother rooting and rotting at your level.  The root will drain your mana, and for very little effect.<br />
<br />
At your level you should just melee and dot.  Save that root mana for heals, because even meditating, you won't get your root mana back before it breaks most of the time.  When you get slow and haste, throw those on as well.<br />
<br />
Eventually you will have a large enough mana pool that root will cost about 1% of your mana and you will be able to cast it a lot more often.  However, as a shaman, I've never root-rotted unless I was in a very odd one-time situation.  Our dots just break root too often to make it a good tactic, and eventually you will get a pet and a good slow, and then you'll only root to park mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thizzlenob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow, thanks for the great info.<br />
<br />
Trust me, I picked a Shammy so I could still get in there beat the hell out of mobs face to face, and have some great magic abilities to boot.   My first chararcter was a warrior(don't tell anybody). <br />
<br />
I am not planning on doing a lot of root rotting.  I just wasn't sure how our DOTs worked.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I may get booted out the door for saying this, but you might want to try playing a ranger as well.  One of my mains is a ranger for the very reason you stated.  I wanted to get up close and personal with mobs but still be able to cast some spells.  Rangers are more warrior than caster, but they still get some very useful spells.  One of the hardest things about playing a ranger is waiting until level 30 to get SoW.  But the class is a great compromise for those who like to play warrior but don’t want to be magic deprived.  <br />
<br />
All that having been said, I’m also having a great time with my shaman.  Being able to slow down the mob and speed up your attacks is a great combination.  And we get great healing spells, even better than druids. I love being able to heal myself fully with a single greater healing spell at 31.  And I’m very much looking forward to getting my first pet.  <br />
<br />
Basically, rangers are fighters who can cast and shaman are casters who can fight.</div></div><hr />
