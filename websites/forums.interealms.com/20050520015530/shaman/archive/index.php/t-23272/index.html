<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just dinged 60, Friday night after about 2 weeks of hard grinding.  I'm guessing that I spent 20 - 25 hours  grinding out this level. Mostly in tier 1 planes.<br />
<br />
Now, 3 day later and after only 4 hours of play time. I'm 40% into level 60.  I'll ding in 2 or three days. Still fighting in tier 1 planes.  I never realized that there was such a huge difference in exp. needed for some levels, over others.  It makes more sense to me that the higher the level the more exp it would take to gain a level.  Much like the old D &amp; D model.<br />
<br />
Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, when I dinged 59 all my 60+ guildmates commented on the long grind for 60.  60-65 were reasonably quick tho.  I went from 40-50 in about a week or so.  50-60 took me several months, but, I took a couple two week breaks, spent some time on tradeskills, was an officer of my guild at the time, and grinded out a few aa's while waiting to help out for a guild Vox raid.<br />
<br />
In some respects, I'm dreading the grind to 70.  I've been having a lot of fun knocking out aa's and improving my toon through that mechanism.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well... sorta.<br />
<br />
1-59 is progressively worse.  60 continues to have the exp it did when 60 was the cap, which was enough to get you through a few deaths.<br />
<br />
61-65 restart the process, but they certainly didn't feel as slow as 58 and 59 did.  I believe to fill your exp bar in 65, it takes more exp than to get through 64... but I filled mine so erratically (and often) that I really don't recall for certain.<br />
<br />
Anybody do straight 65 exp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh.  Well, I hate to break it to you but . . . level 60 is actually half a level.  They made it that way a long time ago, and (probably to avoid the bitching) when level 65 went in and everyone had max 60, they didn't go back and increase the exp needed to max it.<br />
<br />
60 is basically the exception on levelling.  I think after the smoothing, that all levels from 1-59 and then from 61-65 increase in exp needed in a fairly linear fashion.  61+ is still going to suck for you guys, unless you head to a zone with some substantial exp bonus while grinding.<br />

I just starting playing again after a three month brake. But since I return to playing I had only 15 percent into lvl65. I played about, couple of hours on a couple of nights in BoT and about 8 reg. LDoN's I am now sitting at about 86 percent into lvl65. With 10 percent going to AA exp. I would say I have been seening 5 percent Lvl exp per LDoN that I have been doing. and again that is with 10 percent exp going to AA's</div></div><hr />

<br />
a) 1 zillion points from now you get level and aa;<br />
<br />
b) .5 zillion points from now you get level, and are stronger while working on the other .5 zillion to get aa; at 1 zillion, you have both either way.</div></div><hr />

You're correct. I play on stromm, one of the newest servers, and I remember 60 to 61 taking like 2 hours in PoV IC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I soloed/grouped in CoD and Tactics 61-65 and it went pretty quick.  I believe CoD is now an open zone while you still need a flag to hit Tactics.  There may be some level cap in place now in those zones however. =/<br />
<br />
A good ZEM or the right mobs will do you good anytime.  It sounds like you just need to relocate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i thought they opened all of tier3 and lower.. IE tactics</div></div><hr />

Hell Lvl45 there is a lvl I would like to forget.. I remember with my First toon Barb War spending 7 hours a Day in DL Chain pulling for a week straight to get through lvl45 LOL</div></div><hr />

Anyway... I don't understand why people split their XP. This just pushes both rewards further off...<br />
 ... is something I totally agree with.<br />
<br />
Get the one goal, get stronger, and then work on the other with the benefit of the first.  I don't get the logic otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
59 could have taken on all the hell levels combined in a brawl and still won :)  This was especially true when just kunark was available.  Velious helped, but 59 was mostly bad because there were very very few places back then to actually get ok xp.  Luclin added a lot of spots to go for 55+ xp which helped out a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't dought it.  I spent a few hours in Old Seb, during 59 and the exp.  just blows there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Furree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">having recently maxed an xp bar i can confirm that 65 to 66 seems about the same as 64 to 65. i couldn't notice it being any faster. if it is, it's certainly not on the scale of 60 to 61 which is definately a half level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">59 was bad for tough for me, but it was after they took off hell lvls so I was fortunate not to experience that sucky grind. When I hit 60 it flew by pretty quick. Maybe you were just in the wrong zones? :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hey all I'm going to share a lil history on hell lvls cause im bored atm...  8)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My worst hell lvl was 14 new spells awsome got a DD that hits for 74 im uber....  This was back in the day mind you no kunark no velious..  Went right away to Karanas to test my soloing capabilities with the Griffawns..  Well 2 months later I dinged 15....  after about 12 13 - 14 dings 8)...<br />
<br />
The other hell lvl I had was at 55 I quit playing my shammy 8(..  finally got my own acount and found out I couldnt transfer her to my acount I cried....<br />
<br />
2 Acounts and 3 mains later (bout 2 years)..  My friend who had my shaman on his acount quite EQ  I finally got my shaman back..<br />
<br />
Then about 2 1/2 weeks ago I started at lvl 55..  Now Im 65 with 4 AA's woot...  There are no hell lvls there's only hell groups....<br />
<br />
Sorry for the post not really having a point...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There was one nice thing about having the hell levels:  They came after we picked up a new batch of spells.  Armed with better butt-kicking materials, they were quicker for us than, say, for a warrior or bard.  Having levels 47, 48, and the like be much much smaller in comparison took some of the sting out of them.<br />
<br />
I brought a 2nd shaman up to 52 after the hell levels were gone.  The 2 levels just before a major spell upgrade now suck far more than they used to, simply because they last far longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I thought that they had only smoothed out the lvl 1-49 levelling?  Hence why levels 54 and 59 still suck.  59 really, really sucked.<br />

<br />
In a guild group, grinding down in Droga at the King Camp.  I was lvl54 and we had a lvl59 mage with us (most of the group was lvl58+, I was the only slower they could find).  The lvl59 mage got faster exp then I did at this camp.  I'm convinced that lvl54 is STILL a hell level.  Lvl59 isn't nearly as bad as it once was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mages can only be classes without an xp penalty, so he's got ~7% on ya right there :(  Also, I believe the higher level you are the larger the chunk of the group xp you get but I don't know if that is still in effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Originally every 5th level from like 34 up was a mathmatical hell level because of the way they figured experience. It was literally double the exp of 53 for 54 then went back down at 55. Originally they smoothed out all the hell levels through 49 (a day or so after I dinged 50 btw, wasn't a happy kitty). A few months later they straightened out the 50's (right after I finished 54) by taking the total exp needed to go from 51 to max 60 and spreading it out between all the 51+ levels in a more linear progression. About a day or so later they patched again taking lvl 60 out of the equation because it became a full level and not the half level it always was, leaving all of 51-59 mostly smoothed. 54 and 59 still take a bit longer then the other levels in my observation, but isn't even close to what it originally was.</div></div><hr />

Oh well.<br />
<br />
60 is really very short, but I do have a theory.  I was questing in Nurga when I hit both 59 and 60.  Exp dropped horribly even though I was still killing all and only dark blues in the same camp I had been at since 55.<br />
<br />
The theory is that the formula that determines that amount of exp you get from a mob was (for levels past 50) set to top out at 60.  Something to do with the levels of the mobs you are facing (yes other areas with DB mobs, but a higher level produced much better exp per kill for me). Something with the formula gives you bad exp at 60 when facing MObs at or below a certain level (even if they are db cons).  I'm guessing that is what you are running into in teir 1 and should now progress.<br />
<br />
EDIT: 60 is supposed to be easy just move up in difficulty a bit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hmm, well 59 didn't suck at all for me, so guess I should share what I did:<br />
<br />
Get a good guild group and go deep inside Droga.  Dinged 59 in just a few sessions no problem (granted most of the other group members were 60+, but people still want to go there since the AA isn't all that bad, and the rare drops, quest components are also good...)<br />
<br />
I did 58 outside of droga and all of 59 inside droga and they seemed about the same to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I've done 59... twice (sadistic? maybe) - Once before the hell level change, once after. <br />
<br />
Bard (August 2001): Sebilis, took 6 hours in the king camp (by the lower zone out) to get 3 blues, and that area was known for good experience. (65 did not exist at this point. Maximum was 60. Dinged 62 in December 2001, 63 earlier in 2004, and has stayed there since then. Unfortunately, my wrist can't handle twisting anymore.)<br />
<br />
Shaman (Summer 2003): Plane of Valor, not sure how long it took, but it seemed significantly faster, especially since we were at the outer caves at the time, which is also known for fairly decent experience. (I remember trucking out 61-65 though shortly after this as swiftly as I could, didn't even bother with Torpor/Malo and shot straight for 65.)<br />
<br />
Looking forward to 70? They'd have to try to get me to buy it first after still not getting my $30 out of Gates...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">i just remembered that when i was 45 there was no kunark. So the best exp zones were lower guk frenzy camp or sol b bats (with a kick ass group only).<br />
i hated lower guk, i hate the frenzy camp i hate the SMR camp.<br />
i started to hunt in lower guk at 35 and been there til 50. 15 Levels (including 2 hell levels 39 and 45) with old world exp, spells and gear. ****. If i had to do this again i think id quit.</div></div><hr />
