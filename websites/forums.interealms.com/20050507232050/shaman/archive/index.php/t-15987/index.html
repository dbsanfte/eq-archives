<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play a frog shaman and I have never been stunned unless the mob hit me from behind or it was a spell. Is this normal or an undiscovered froglok trait. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you've most likely missed it happening, or it could be a bug (frogs were non kos to everything in bear form i do believe, or at least most things).<br />
<br />
I'd have to see a log before i made any conclusion though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my opinion, the whole ogre frontal stun immunity is overrated anyway. Most characters I've played get stunned almost exclusively when they are not facing the mob (i.e. running or pulling back to group).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wish I couldn't be stunned, got a train on ya and there's a wall/corner nearby?   You'll get that gate off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I killed a ****load of them in my time and I can definitely confirm they are stunnable from the front. :)</div></div><hr />

I'm a barb and I always get stunned running away from the mob, but if I was ogre I would definetly learn to run backwards :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
On heavy mobs there is no beating an ogre that isn't stunnable.  I don't think this is over rated at all.  <br />
I also play a frog shaman and can't remember if I have been stunned or not, now that you mention it!  I'll have to check it out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I play a froglok shaman and I've definately been stunned from the front.  Happened yesterday in fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Come to think about it, I do drink an awful lot, (I find that drinking helps with the grind, I just wonder how I'm going to explain that in my future AA meetings).<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's possible that I missed that rare time of being stunned from the front. I played through 3 kei's yesterday and didn't get stunned once. If it does happen, it's very, very rare.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The best thing about ogre unstunnability is not the fact that they are immune to stuns, bt the fact that bashes do not force an immediate channelling roll for them.  I rarely get stunned, but I get insta-interrupted from bashes quite a bit, even by greenies.  I would never exchange my good looks for that, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yedra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Frog Shaman are definately stunable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You're probably playing in the particular zones which - for whatever reason - have critters which don't seem to do much stunning at all.  Head ye over to some of the old world zones that used to be popular.  Stun-o-rama!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just for the record, I did get stunned last night.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>zimbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For the record, I play an ogre shaman...lvl 62.  I've played a long time and I am a strong solo shaman.  The only time I have ever been stunned is when I attempt to move while in melee.  I have been in fights with mobs to my front, rear and both sides and if my big old ogre feet are not moving, then I don't get stunned.   So its more than frontal stun immunity and let me tell you it is nice.<br />
<br />
I've played other races and I always am taken aback by the stuns...its like *** is happening, why can't I do anything....stun immunity is top shelf stuff friends.</div></div><hr />
