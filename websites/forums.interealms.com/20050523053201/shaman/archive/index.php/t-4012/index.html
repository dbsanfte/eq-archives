<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today i crafted those two belts:<br />
<br />
Heres the good news (the stats):<br />
<br />
Blackened Darksplint Skirt<br />
TRL SHM Innoruuk L 45<br />
AC 15, WIS 5, AGI 5, HP 40, MANA 40<br />
<br />
Crimson Darksplint Skirt<br />
OGR SHM Rallos-Zek L 45<br />
AC 15, WIS 5, STA 5, HP 40, MANA 40<br />
<br />
Heres the bad news:<br />
Both Belts are tagged as Legs items. This is clearly an error and should be bug-reported if you intend to wear such a belt<br />
<br />
While most of the cultural chain armour is quite crappy those belts are pretty nice imho as soon as they have the correct slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice belts man.  What was the rough cost to make em?  Would be rather interested in getting hold of the troll one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm very nice, now all I have to do is get my smithy up and make some for myself.<br />
After they have been made belt slots of course :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there are other skirts that are supposed to be leg slot and not belts..... this might actually be legs and not belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mestrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye but there's already a Darksplint Leggings item plus these use belt patterns/leather armor.<br />

<br />
That's my shaman in a full set (bar JBB and the non working belt).<br />
<br />
Been about one level since I started getting it, thanks to a great friend on Zeb.. It's changed the way I play, Canni 3 hardly moves either bar anymore :/ <br />
<br />
It's good stuff for those unguilded peeps like me :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The barb cultural stuff, artificer's ringmail, had the exact same problem. Recipe is for a belt, 2 rings, uses belt pattern and tattered belt but slot was legs when actually made. They did fix it to go in the correct slot eventually tho. Might try posting over on eqtraders if you haven't already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">id guess this is a leg slot item<br />
<br />
skirt as in KILT  u yanks cast yer minds back to highlander etc<br />
<br />
The scotish warriors wore thigh length wrap around skirts of diferent colours (to show their clan)    verant seems to like this idea for barbarians, its a tad crazy to then apply the same thing to torlls and ogres, but that vern#ant for ya!<br />
<br />
soory to spoil ya glee but this may simply be a lo ac leg armour ((<br />
<br />
edit-  just read the above post lol<br />
<br />
woohoo  bugger historical accuracy in a fantasy universe *grin*   gimme MORE ac any day !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm, so we have barbarian shaman, orge shaman, iksar shaman and inny troll shaman. Could we be missing one option ...<br />
<br />
CT troll shaman. What gives :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can anyone post pics of what it looks like on Ogres?  'Preciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just for info: These Belts have been fixed with Aug.14th patch and now fit into the waist slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm, so we have barbarian shaman, orge shaman, iksar shaman and inny troll shaman. Could we be missing one option ...<br />
<br />
CT troll shaman. What gives<br />
<br />
There IS ogre crafted armor for CT troll shammys. Ogre crafted armor comes in three colors: crimson (rallos), fulvous (= yellow, CT), and blackened (inny). The stats for the three are about the same with some minor differences (as in first post here, black belt has agi where red has sta).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nice. Now I just gotta find one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you havent seen your auction channel saying that its for sale, you might check your tradeskill channel (usually tradeskills:tradeskills) and ask for an ogre/barb/iksar smith.<br />
<br />
Or, go to eqtraders to your specific server, and there may be a sticky post of GM smiths on your server, or post asking for one.<br />
<br />
After all of that, there may not be one that exists, because of a variety of reasons (see below)<br />
<br />
They will ask for a certain amount of money.  Keep in mind that these items use blue diamonds, some of them 3 per attempt, and they have to do many combines to get the item made, all of which can destroy a blue diamond in the process.  Also, they spent at LEAST of month of effort getting thier skill up, doing nothing else.  Don't be an ass and demean the effort they made.  If you cant afford it, look at that lod shield on your back, or the bane warding shield and decide if those hours of your time are worth 20 to 40k, then maybe you should sell it, because thier time is not worth less than thiers<br />
<br />
(sorry, really tired of people who want to bring me crap to combine for them, because its just a click, and then when i say no, im the greedy one (nevermind THEY are the ones wanting something))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ummmmmm, kthx<br />
<br />
I happen to practice tradeskills too, tho not smithing, and I kind of have an idea what's involved here.</div></div><hr />
