Im headed to cobalt scar when I get home for some otter slaughtering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I kept giving copies of Agi away, but no one wants them anymore. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actually bought it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had a monk ask for that buff last night.  Asked him point blank in group did you just buy your character off Ebay (I knew he didn't).  Gave it to him and he shut up.  To each his own.  I'm secretly hoping that SOE puts in a group 65 level cha buff for us.  We really really need that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, stupid as it sounds, there is probably a point to that buff now. Remember, most well equipped tanks (at 65) are still sitting around 1300-1400ac (from a theoretical cap of 1600), and their max agi is now up to 305. <br />
<br />
Not to say it's not ok to deny people buffs they don't need. With all of the single target shorter duration buffs in PoP, buffing has become a real nightmare for us. <br />
<br />
People (who expect to take hits), need focus, stamina, and maybe haste. The rest is really gravy in &lt;b&gt;most&lt;/b&gt; situations. <br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to just say bye to people who demand agi, avatar, billy, pe, acumen, replentishment, dex for the cleric, and why aren't you slowing the mobs anymore Valka?</div></div><hr />
