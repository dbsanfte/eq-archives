<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Had several good ones, but last night's kicked butt.  Composition was<br />
<br />
Guardian<br />
Palladin<br />
Templar<br />
Mystic (me)<br />
Conjurer<br />
Wizard<br />
<br />
Part of the reason I'm sure was that everyone knew how to play.  That always makes a difference.  However, we were taking on some impressive things in TS, including several named that were 2 up arrow red.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Class interchangability is one of my favorite things about EQ2, but here's my choices.<br />
<br />
- Guardian<br />
- Scout Class (Bards rock for DPS! Who'd have thought!)<br />
- Monk (Having a feign death class with a Rez Stone is a GODSEND)<br />
- Cleric/Druid (Or other DPS class, perhaps AE)<br />
- Mystic<br />
- Conjuror/Wizard<br />
<br />
I've found that when we lost our Fury/Druid for the night, and picked up a Monk to replace it, we did just fine.<br />
<br />
But two healers really makes life nice. You can focus on DPS AND Healing/Debuffing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">2 Priest, 2 Scout, 2 Fighter is my preferred consist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like having multiple nukers for multi-mob group encounters, especially if the mobs are mostly melee only. Just keep Group Ward up and let them go to town. :)<br />
<br />
-Tok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't get the fascination with 2 healers in groups.  I've been in several groups where everyone was screaming that we needed to find another healer and they add next to nothing in 99% of xp groups, well at least when I'm in the group.  But then again, I'm an illusionist and I actually realize that there's more to the class than mez/breeze/haste.<br />
<br />
Get an enchanter that knows what they're doing and you don't need a second healer.  I do more DPS than the monk in my normal group and I make double up orange/red mobs very manageable with a single healer.  Stifle isn't just for casters ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, Ideal group IMO is one of each archetype that knows what they're doing plus 2 other people that know their roles.  Only things I try to avoid after getting the archetypes covered is double priests of same class or another enchanter.</div></div><hr />

2 Healers in the group makes it just that much easier to mow through hordes of mobs with little to no downtime between kills and it's more fun (In my opinion) to kill ALL the mobs at once rather that crowd control them and whack them one at a time.<br />
<br />
Any skill/spell that has the ability to stop mobs from using their special abilities is a KICKASS ability in my opinion, so if Chanters can do that then there's a HUGE advantage to that class.<br />
<br />
I also like the stacking buffs that two different priest classes can provide.<br />
<br />
One more note: The Fury class is a druid subclass that has a lot of long term and short term buffs that increase the DPS of your melee classes by a LONG shot. Priest classes are different in this game, just like anything else.<br />
<br />
Before you judge groups so quickly I'd take a better look at them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally, my fave group makeup is monk to tank (me), mystic, fury, bard, anyone else that's available.  In that group, my healers have power to spare to add damage to mobs, and we slice through non-stop encounters like a hot knife through soft butter.  If you've never tried a group like this one, give it a shot, just make sure you've got a competent monk otherwise your asking for a dirt nap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Having 2 Priests just means that when things don't go as planned, it's still &quot;ok&quot;.  Dying really cramps my style so I try to avoid it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get an enchanter that knows what they're doing and you don't need a second healer. <br />
<br />
Coercer/illusionist + 5 other players. Any priest class will do. Sometimes you don't need a healer at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ask yourself this:<br />
<br />
Which is easier to find . . . an Enchanter who knows how to play OR any old Priest?<br />
<br />
It's just numbers.  I'd rather put together a group quickly and get to the slaughter than piddle around trying to find a specific class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree that if you do happen to pick up an Enchanter, it's nice, but I wouldn't spend my time looking for that one class just so I don't have to get another priest.<br />
<br />
In the end though, the fact that there is no one really clear group make up that is overwhelming better than any other is a good thing. The Holy Trinity has yet to rear it's head. :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tok said it better than I did.<br />
<br />
Down with the Trinity!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't try to put together any optimal combination, I just go with whatever I can get. :)  I find that it's MUCH more the player than the class anyway as one bad player can easily ruin an EQ2 group.<br />
<br />
I also haven't found any real necessity yet as EQ2 is so heavily dependant on extremely varying factors that the topic is just too subjective.  EQ2 depends on relative levels, spells, and gear which vary from group to group.<br />
<br />
As for the Enchanter vs 2 priest vs...whatever other combination there is, what you don't want to forget is that any combination will do!  You don't have to worry about finding that chanter, or that second priest, you can grab just about whatever is available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My small guild just recently added a tank class...but up until now we've done incredible things with:<br />
<br />
cleric<br />
mystic (me)<br />
conj<br />
assassin <br />
swash<br />
swash<br />
<br />
High dps, priests who aren't afraid to tank as that aggro goes a-bouncin' :P, and somehow it all seems to work out.  The fact that we were all EQ1 addicts and know what to do helps alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In response to Gojirax, notice that MY ideal group is pretty much the same as most everyone else.... 6 people that know how to play their classes being the key. ;)<br />
<br />
Get your 4 archetypes covered with competent players and you're all set in most situations.  Having a second healer isn't a BAD idea at all, but it's not really necessary and can be a real pain in the ass to do.  I can't count the number of times I've seen groups try to form and break up 30+ minutes later after doing nothing but looking for ONE LFG healer heh.<br />
<br />
If you have an enchanter in group, chances are a second healer isn't the best choice for filling out the group.  If by some strange miracle you do have 2 healers, let one of them go so the rest of us can put a group together dammit! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I must admit I am very surprised to hear that people are seeing healer shortages.<br />
<br />
In completing AQ4, we had a group consisting of 2 Mystics, 1 Warden, 1 Templar, 1 Zerker and 1 Ranger . . . we simply couldn't find anything BUT healers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I havent found any instances yet where 2 healers were mandatory....either killing giants in TS or doin anything else. It all depends on the DPS of the group. <br />
<br />
I have found that it's much easier if we engage single, harder targets instead of mobs of blues...simple math = less people for me to heal. Near Tower 4 in TS is a good example....lots of skellies that are orange/yellow  1/2up to me at 24.<br />
<br />
I was outside crypt when you were there....your group had several but there were even more healers LFG but nobody else for the most part. I gave up and went to xp in TS lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I understand what you're getting at Sciek. Makes sense too. The &quot;Two Healer&quot; group isn't a necessity as much as a cushion. The jury is still out on whether there's a &quot;Most Efficient&quot; group for kills per minute etc. I simply haven't grouped with enough different classes to know.<br />
<br />
My AQ4 group consisted Mystic, Conjuror, Guardian, Monk, Berzerker and Paladin.<br />
<br />
The Paladin wasn't the brightest. He used some AE swing that aggroed mobs outside our encounter, and wiped us, then he aggroed some party wiping named.. then when he revived he came back naked and didn't know why. So we killed some bugs and shrillers while he ran to town and repaired his armor. Then he asked &quot;Where's my *^%!#@ jewelery?!?!&quot;.. so in unison our group said &quot;Check your overflow&quot;<br />
<br />
So he came back after repairing his armor and got within 10 feet of the room we were in and died.. just for one last shot of Xp debt.<br />
<br />
Fortunately this was during the 50% Xp bonus days and I didn't notice any real slowdown. (Plus we won't be on for days now so the debt doens't hurt.)<br />
<br />
I fully agree.. 6 people that KNOW their roles is greater than a perfect blend of fools. ;)</div></div><hr />
