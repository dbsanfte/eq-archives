<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As we all know, vah shirs eat at a higher metabolism *or lower* rate then people. regardless, food goes like mana with MGB on a raid.  what do you all eat that is better then normal rations and water flasks? because it's eating my cash flow having to go to bazaar or something and re-stock every 2 min when i could be soloing a mob for awesome loot or such *snicker*. so, can anyone insert some names of food of recipies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fish rolls: a banquest-size meal made from 1 fresh fish and 1 bat wing.  it goes well with a plains pebble, and a Fizzlecutter Fuzzleformula 5000... or whatever that hair tonic was called... as a drink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">anything besides those 2? them can be costly *i know fizzlecutter is a biznistach*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">50pp for an Opal Encrusted Stein (your price may vary) plus your charisma buff and you chould be over 110cha. Get sneak on if you're less than indifferent to Ping and you should be able to buy stacks of that gnome hair tonic (lots of bald gnomes out there) for about 5-6pp a stack. It's not THAT pricey and personally I think it's worth it because a couple of stacks last a looong while.<br />
<br />
If you can't be bothered raising your baking skill, there's usually a few people selling food in Bazaar cheap. Sometimes you can get a really good deal on some really long lasting stat foods. Other than that... pass me the fish and batwings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I only eat halas 10lb meat pies.<br />
hehehee<br />
<br />
I bought 60 of them in the bazaar for 50pp per stack.  I will buy food again around christmas.<br />
<br />
beware: they are giant-sized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My diet varies based on prices in the bazaar.  :)<br />
<br />
Centi steaks, mind worm steaks, the occasional meat pie, obadah truffles - if I can find a stack for under 20 pp, any of those are likely to get snatched up.<br />
<br />
For drink?  Fizzlecutter 5000- only way to go until those Qeynos Afternoon Teas get a little cheaper.  :)<br />

<br />
these cost about 18pp per stack from your friendly chardok grociery story<br />
<br />
i buy 5 stacks of each ... lasts me about 2 weeks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ceno, what do you mean local chardok guy or whatever? ingredients drop there or are they loots?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, you all say about food, but never how much drink of fizzle's you buy...you just say get it, never with a defined amount. IE, person who got the halas 10lb pies never said the ratio of pies to drinks *kinda what i am looking for*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I bake up Halas Pies.  LB likes PIE!  <br />
PIE! is good. Buy PIE!<br />
<br />
Though I will be whipping up Truffles tonight before the raid to trivial those out or use up all my stock.  <br />
<br />
If you have no baking skill but want to learn, go to East Commons. Buy batwings, buy frosting, combine till trivial.   Then buy batwings and buy fish and combine till trivial.  <br />
<br />
EQTraders is the best place to learn recipes or trivials.<br />
<br />
You want to buy or make miraculous meals and enduring drinks.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Those should last a looooooooooong time. <br />
<br />
If that fails try doing what Troll and Ogres do...eat gnomes, dwarves, asslings, and small children. <br />
I prefer Barbarian females myself !! <br />

One of my guildies actually exped in kael, and kept all the meat.  She spent about 4 levels in kael.  She said in guild chat &quot;anyone need giant meat?&quot; and I wanted it.  I was expecting about 10 pieces of meat.  She filled up the trade window with stacks of giant meat, and then did it again :o   I'll never be hungry again.</div></div><hr />

Usually 2 nites in akheva is good for about a month of food worth for about 4 characters...at least when the steaks and stew are trivial.</div></div><hr />
