<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recived a couple of PM's and read a post concerning the spells Canni 1 and 2 ...<br />
Some belive that the spells may be taking the intended HP but returning less mana than they are supposed to . At least one report states that dememing and then rememing the spell fixes the issue for a short time . After which the diminishing mana returns again .<br />
<br />
For my part I will check this for myself in game tonight . I would however like to ask the help of any shamans that may have spare time in the next few days in looking into this .<br />
If you should notice a problem please report it in this thred . If you consistantly do not see a problem and have the time please post here saying so . That way I can get a feel as to wether this issue exists and if it does how widespred it may be .<br />
<br />
Please note with these spells being pretty low level you lower level shamans can be a huge help in determining if this bug exists . If we come to the conclusion that there is indeed a problem I will pass along the info learned too Brenlo and friends .<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance to all with time to help out .</div></div><hr />

It might extend to the Spirit Channeling level 70 AA too ....<br />
<br />
There are report of Mana being used while it is active (its mean to take from HPs), and I have bugged it every time I see it ....<br />
<br />
If ya going to get onto them about it, might be worth including this observation too )<br />

ps: i dont canni-dance.  this might have something to do with it.  after 4 years of playing a shaman i've never seen the need, unless you are playing a non-regen race, but then thats just begging for hurt.</div></div><hr />

I've always appreciated the 20 or so mana per tick I get sitting down in between casts as opposed to the 1 or 2 I get standing up between casts :) <br />
<br />
With cannibalize 4, it works out that you have just enough time to sit down for every tick in between casts.  This is also why cannibalizing on a horse is so great, you get the mana from meditating and from cannibalizing without ever missing a tick or a cast of cannibalize.  <br />
<br />
Do I dance?  You bet I do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Even at 65 i always noticed the different when i canni dance. But with all the mana regen i never did it much so i could be lazy. But if im on a raid or the group wipes or we are rushing to finish a LDoN, canni dance can make all the difference and will make a noticable increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did a little testing personaly over the last two nights . I am unable to duplicate the problem myself . Canny 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 and canny AA all seem to give me the correct mana value each time .<br />
Im not saying there is not a problem . Im just saying I cannot duplicate it . I feel I need more of a &quot;concensus&quot; that this is an Issue before I take it to the Dev's . Please continue to offer feedback in this thred . <br />
When it reaches a point that I can duplicate the problem or a bunch of people see it as an Issue I will move forward with it . Untill that time i will continue to gather data as best as I can on this issue .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I played in an ldon *edit* last night *end edit*.   I didn't pay as much attention as I should have but I did pay attention a few times when I canni 2'ed.    Most of the time it seemed to give the correct mana back.   There were a few times where I only got a &quot;few&quot; mana back.   I had one time where it didn't give back the right mana 2 casts in a row.    Both of those were when I used my canni dance hotkey.     <br />
<br />
I'm far to used to watching the hp tick for the canni hotkey instead of the mana tick so it was hard to watch a different set of numbers :-) :-)<br />
<br />
It definitely wasn't happening all the time, so its going to be a big pain to track down.  As someone in a tech support area,  I hate users with intermittent problems and now I AM one of them ;-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually, it has nothing to do with bot/macro shamans.  i can say i've now seen this bug and reproduced it after logging/zoning.  seems, at least with Canni I, that instead of getting the &quot;advertised 20-29 mana (dependent on level), i'm getting between 16-20 mana.  and moving, zoning, chain casting, canni-dancing, etc. doesnt change it.  i've submitted /bug's in game, so hopefully they will fix it or at least address the discrepancy between the spell description and its actual game performance.<br />

<br />
update on this.  the above was posted at level 26.  at lvl 33, the effect of canni1 gives between 19-21 mana per cast, random, without any sensible fashion.  if i stand perfectly still, i get between 19-21.  if i move between castings, i get 19-21.  if i zone, i get 19-21 mana per cast.  given the &quot;assumed&quot; linear progression by level, by level 33, i should be getting either 21 or 22 mana per cast, assuming 1 mana bump every 4 levels or so after 24.  the fact that i can still record 19 or 20 mana on a casting is just plain attrocious.  thankfully, i'm not seeing anymore 16-18m bumps on a cast.<br />
<br />
does anyone else see this at the low-mid range with canni1 (or canni2 which i cant cast yet).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Slightly off but still on-topic.. I've seemed to have pinpointed the Spiritual Channeling issue and have duplicated it.  The only time it will draw from my mana pool while active is when my HP's drop to what seems to be ~40%.  As soon as I hit that threshold, it uses mana, as soon as I heal back up over it, it resumes using hp's.  Other than this issue, I've never once had it use mana.  <br />
<br />
This may be a &quot;feature,&quot; not a bug.  I'm not sure if I love it or hate it.  It's nice to have a safeguard sometimes I guess, but there are surely times where I'd rather use those last HP's to save a cleric or otherwise on a raid and eat a death myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">.

<br />
<br />
  Could it possibly only check for your natural HP from Stats and not the added HP from gear ?  Perhaps test it naked and see if it behaves the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>njs50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was definatly having the problem with Canni I, probably 70% of the time between level 30 &amp; 39 (may have also been earlier, but i might not have noticed) I was only getting about 8 mana back for my 50hp. I found re-zoning would fix it temporarily but eventually it'd go back to the reduced amount of mana... <br />
<br />
I couldn't really figure out what caused it, however since going to Canni2 I havn't noticed the issue again...<br />

<br />
Fully self buffed again, mounted this time and outdoors unlike when it was happening in Velks.  I was not using a canni-dance macro this time since I was mounted of course.</div></div><hr />
