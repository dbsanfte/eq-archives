<br />
Need to change the text color ya ya..it just got late.<br />
Also for got to make buff bar quit fading.<br />
<br />
Also might play around with background textures.<br />
I modded most all the windows myself with notepad.<br />
Borrowed snippets from some, modded some.<br />
Kinda a mixture of things i saw and l liked and a few i made up all my own. Started with Icy Blue as a base then started changing.<br />
<br />
Haha, noticed my JBB on my spell bar has a legs icon behind it.<br />
Hey i made this thing from 2-7 am. expect a few sleepy bugs in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like it. There are some nice features there that I may have to steal myself :p <br />
<br />
What resolution are you running at? 1024 by 768?<br />
<br />
If I was to use It I'd have to rearrange it as I prefer the buffs and the group/player infor on the opposite sides!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, thats at 1280X1024.<br />
<br />
Now that im awake i found alot more things to tweak =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like the efficiency of space with the pet controls mixed with the inventory.  I use my pet in most situations, so I need to have it available most all the time.<br />
<br />
As for preferences, I like have most combat clickies in one general area (&quot;assist&quot; button, pet attack, group target, and spells all within one quadrant).<br />
<br />
Care to post some XML?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looks great, wanna put it out for downloads? would like to try it myself</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>pacman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it looks great....  but where is the target window ?? and please post this mod as it is one of the best i have seen for space and it looks quite organized.</div></div><hr />

Real good job on this one...the current mod I use is similar that it has all the funtions on it but the hot keys. The pet command keys are on opposite sides of the screen which has been a real pain in the *ss<br />
<br />
I like the way everything is grouped together. I would have to get use to them being on the right but thats what I think we all like about the new mods is the changes from the mundain old ui.<br />
<br />
So next question is : Where is it?<br />
<br />
Can't find the link right now(behind firewall at work and stupid fiters) but upload it to the new ui sites and let us know....<br />
<br />
Again, Nice job<br />
