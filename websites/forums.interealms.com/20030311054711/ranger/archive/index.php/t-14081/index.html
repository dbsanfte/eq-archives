<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Filson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I KNOW the answer is buried somewhere in a few hundred posts on the subject. But, the facts have changed over time, and I frankly can't keep up with how it work right NOW.<br />
<br />
So, please, someone set me straight before I get there. The best I can figure out...<br />
<br />
At level 50, we have our choice of these fine spells:<br />
<br />
Wolf Form: illusion wolf, +55%mvmt, +30atk<br />
Force of Nature: +3 dmg shield, +15atk, +3hp/tick<br />
Call of Earth: +4 dmg shield, +24ac<br />
<br />
Now, from what I can figure out from Lucy's:<br />
<br />
Wolf Form cancells/blocks FoN because 30atk&gt;15atk in slot 3.<br />
Call of Earth cancells/blocks FoN because 4ds&gt;3ds in slot 2.<br />
<br />
So it appears your choice is either:<br />
1) CoE &amp; Wolf = 55%mvmt, +30atk, +4ds, +24ac<br />
-OR-<br />
2) FoN &amp; SoW = 55%mvmt, +15atk, +3ds, +3hp/tick<br />
<br />
Am I on the right track? Let me add a wrinkle. I have a Lupine Dagger. I paid 8k for it ages ago. Now I see them for 3k. Is this why? It appears that if ou have the FoN &amp; SoW option going, and you proc the Lupine, all you are left with is wolf form.<br />
<br />
Tell me there is a magic combo I'm missing, please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Delyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buff stacking is a pain hehe.<br />
<br />
There is also the lower lvl CoE (Riftwinds Protection) and I am not at all sure how it stacks since only Call of Earth existed when I was  your lvl and my young ranger has only Riftwind's Protection.<br />
<br />
Seems like you have it down though as far as stacking.<br />
<br />
Outdoors (except Dreadlands when Gore is up &lt;G&gt;) you would do fine with wolfform and call of earth/riftwinds.<br />
<br />
Indoors you are stuck with either CoE or FoN, which you use would depend on if you needed the regen or the ac, I would opt for the ac except in down time myself. And would use Firefist for the attack buff since it gives about the same attack as FoN but will stack with CoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well you have to choose your buffs according to what fits the situation best.  If you're tanking and need the AC, then use CoE.  If your fear kiting or not tanking, then you want the ATK, so use FoN.<br />
<br />
Use Nature's Precision until you get level 51 and Strength of Nature, they both will stack with CoE, FoN, and wolf form.  Then use that all the time instead of NP until you get 60 and Warders Protection.  At that point you have to redo your buff stacking again.<br />
<br />
Here's how I'd do it:<br />
<br />
NP/SoN = always<br />
<br />
FoN = when fear kiting, or not tanking.<br />
or <br />
CoE = When tanking or getting hit, or tired of buffing with FoN all the time.<br />
<br />
SoW = always<br />
or <br />
Wolf form or Greater Wolf form = when faction issues allow and its outdoors.<br />
<br />
See, it's easy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kodith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've also noticed that FoN has a much *much* shorter duration than CoE. <br />
<br />
In groups where I'm not tanking but pulling I often just use wolfform if possible since it lasts so much longer and I don't have to stop and buff myself every 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Looks like you have the right numbers and stacking issues figured out though.<br />
<br />
Good luck in your hunt!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">even in DL and with Gore up, Wolf form aint a problem, provided you have high enough base faction with Ring of Scales.<br />
<br />
Wolf Form does NOT make you KOS to all in Kunark. It simply lowers your faction ALOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Filson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the tutoring. It's all much clearer now. :p<br />
<br />
BTW, I remember this being fixed. It was worse than this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Philby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CoE lasts an hour while FoN lasts 15 minutes and costs 60 vs. 100 mana. I would rather buff others with CoE, SoN, etc than to keep spending time buffing FoN. If you have c2/kei it might be a different story. It always bugged me when I played my enchanter when I saw rangers buffing themselves and never casting a buff on others. <br />
<br />
FoN is good on raids when if you know you are getting agro you will get pasted. Otherwise, most rangers could use the AC. You are a light tank and can quickly pull agro off a caster or root park mob - and if you do that the AC helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hazzel-Zeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've also noticed that FoN has a much *much* shorter duration than CoE.  <br />
<br />
FoN has the same duration as the druid/shaman regen line we get ie chloroplast (55) and regrowth (64) and scales up to 20.5 mins at lvl 65.<br />
<br />
Since it stacks with all other regens, cast it on all those that use hp for mana ie shaman, necros and people eating mod rods.</div></div><hr />
