<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Either an act is ethical or it is not. The nature of an unethical act is not influenced or changed by the scale of the act or the perceived importance of the victim. For example, it is not ethical to pull the wings off a fly because &quot;it's just a fly&quot;. It is not ethical to steal a pack of gum from a store because &quot;it's just gum&quot;. It is not ethical to illegally profit from a game because &quot;it's just a game&quot;.<br />
<br />
Being comfortable with an unethical act does not make it acceptible. I oppose buying/selling EQ items/accounts with non-game currency, not because I'm jealous or believe it affects me adversely, but simply because it is unethical. Verant opposes it because it undermines their game. Federal and state governments oppose income tax fraud because it undermines their revenues. See how this works?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ethics is bull.  Everyone has their own set when it comes to various things, and you're never going to develop a set of ethics that everyone will believe in / follow at all times.<br />
<br />
If you can rationalize something as being acceptable behavior, some ethical code isn't going to stop you.<br />
<br />
Sorry, just finished an ethics class that I'm not too fond of =)</div></div><hr />

Can't wait till that kind a rational has a hold of the nuke button...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In the &quot;Have you ever Ebay'd EQ?&quot; poll, around 2/3 of the respondants either have Ebay'ed, or don't care.  Maybe you should change your thread title to:  &quot;A quick lesson in ethics for 2/3 of you.&quot;  or &quot;Why the majority of you are unethical!&quot;<br />
<br />
Verant decided to change their policy on Ebay primarily to reduce work for their GMs and guides (who were being /petition'ed for Ebay scammers.)  The effect to the game was much less important-  witness the complete lack of interest in shutting down playerauctions (3000+ auctions currently in progress).  Now that the support staff can respond &quot;we don't support out of game sales, thx bye&quot;- they don't much care if stuff is actually changing hands.<br />
<br />
As for the income tax evasion thing- I fail to see how this relates to the morals or ethics of selling EQ stuff.  I suppose you get outraged every time someone speeds on the highway, too?  Yeah, it's illegal... and if he gets caught, he'll pay.  So what?  His choice, and it has nothing to do with EQ.  I didn't declare what I made in the garage sale I had last summer- shhhhh- don't tell anyone!  Point is, this is a separate and unrelated issue.<br />
<br />
To the core issue of ethics... I'd say at the very least that this isn't exactly clear.  UO (the predecessor to EQ) not only allows Ebay sales but encourages them... and the game seems to be holding up just fine after over five years (lord knows I can't get my wife to stop playing- she's in there right now!)  For every argument you can make about how Ebay farmers monopolize spawns and ruin the game for everyone, an argument can be made that the ability to conduct commerce in and out of game increases replayability, makes starting out a little easier, and generally increases the overall enjoyment of the game.  Tit for tat, and this has been argued in countless threads already.<br />
<br />
In the end, I believe it comes down to &quot;Sony tells you not to do it, and you do it anyway.&quot;  I can't really argue this one.  I think it's safe to say that the legality of their ability to limit these sales has not been fully explored, so let's just leave it at that.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, it doesn't exactly seem like the ethical disaster you make it out to be.  Sony is asking us to do something that many of us disagree with.  Some people choose to do it anyway.  Others choose not to, but don't really care who does.<br />
<br />
/em shrugs.  I just don't feel all that unethical for not caring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The bottom line is, like Big said - - Verant DOES NOT CARE.<br />
<br />
IF Verant wanted to crack down on selling accounts, it would be EASY as hell.<br />
<br />
They could:<br />
<br />
Look at a playerauctions.com character profile.  There is almost 100 percent chance no other char on the server specified has that race/class/equipment combination.<br />
<br />
After that, monitor the account.  Look at the day the auction ends.  See if it changes password and billing information.<br />
<br />
Bingo...you nailed someone selling a char.  Easy.  However, they don't do that.  They don't want to deal with it, and I doubt they really care how it affects the game.</div></div><hr />

It's like the PnP rules.  They were put in there so customer service would have less work and could successfully be staffed by fewer people, not to pursue some moral agenda.  Some guy stole your camp?  Hmm...PnP says, so what? :)  Problem solved!<br />
<br />
Lol, a moral agenda.  This is a BUSINESS, guys, not a church.  They're there to make money.  Period.</div></div><hr />
