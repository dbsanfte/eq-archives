<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Itun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw 2 guides at N Ro playing around with the players at North Ro today and they hung around quite a while before they suddenly poofed and 5-10 mins later, the serverwide msg popped up stating all servers are coming down.<br />
<br />
There was a GM online to at the CSHome as well.<br />
<br />
Very unusual to see that since most guides and GMs have quit and none of them are being replaced. The positions are on a hiring freeze.<br />
<br />
I read other boards about guides in other servers as well, including a guild member running around as a guide when he wasn't supposed to be one.<br />
<br />
So, I surmise that a loophole was discovered from today's patch and it was taken advantage of and exploited.<br />
<br />
Fortunantly the 2 so called guides at were nice to everyone and no harm was done to anyone. Last thing we would want is someone to go on a killing spree using the GM god mode and /commands like that rogued GM did 2 years ago.</div></div><hr />

Sony never says anything direct, it could be anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The servers probably crashed because there was a GM logged on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A few weeks ago I saw someone I knew being referred to in a chat channel as having a GM tag next to his name.  I know for sure this guy is not a GM, and he himself was saying, what are you talking about?  I'm not all that surprised by little weird bugs, so I didn't do a /who on him to see if he really was tagged as a GM.  Since quite a few people pointed it out, I assume he was.<br />
<br />
Lots of people have figured out hacks, it seems, so I wouldn't be surprised if someone figured out how to get GM powers somehow -- or will eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Itun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Last I heard something like this before tonight was a turd who managed to hack into the GM mode and he was a little assling running around killing mobs, causing monsters to spawn that don't belong to the zone that was waxing everyone in the zone.<br />
<br />
He was also running around in ungodly run speed, way faster than a bard speed.<br />
<br />
Then I find out from sources that this turd had somehow hid himself from being tracked by GMs and Guides, they had absolutely no idea where he was, so they called every single GM and Guides in every server to come down to that one server to assist each other in finding him so they can nail his butt and ban him.<br />
<br />
They did a good job of it too, without resorting to the need of shutting down the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes because god knows **** still falling through the world, insane lag spikes and beneficial icons being farking PINK wherent problems that deserved an emergency patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sometimes when GMs fix something to do with your character, they leave you flagged as GM. It happened to someone I knew after they got reimbursed offline. I don't know if they would have had any extra power, because I have heard the GM client isn't available outside of SoE, but seeing someone tagged GM doesn't mean they're a hacker.</div></div><hr />
