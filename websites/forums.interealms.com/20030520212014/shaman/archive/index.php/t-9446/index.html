Personally i would drop all 3 of those spears and get a Rune Etched IceWurm Fang  (http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=drakkal&amp;item=3358)  There's some guy selling one in AB's bazaar for 5.5k, or has been the last couple of days, altho i'm not sure if thats too much as he is selling a howling harpoon for 2k (i got mine for 200pp so his prices may be steep).<br />
<br />
I don't know what your playing style is but you have much WIS. I am 12 lvls below you and actually the same AC (my profile is b0rked for some reason when it comes to my AC) and only 116 less HP's, the discussion of AC&gt;HP&gt;WIS blah blah is hotly debated on many threads in this forum. Maybe sacrifice the WIS rings for something like a Shadel Bandit Ring and something else with AC and HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">5k  is a decent price for a REIF. 6k is highish, 4k is lowish, anything below is a steal. At least on RN.<br />
<br />
Coldain Skin &gt; Leaf, if you can afford it. <br />
<br />
For the helm, I would personally recommend the feathered owlbear circlet. It drops off Prince Skarat in the moor, is no-drop, has a 3% to mediate modifier, about 15 hp, 3 wis, and no graphic. I really like the no graphic bit. Plus free is a nice price. The thurg one also has no graphic, but IIRC, no hp. <br />
<br />
Helms usually look dorky on vah shir, so I'm picky. Loving my circlet of the faulkaen right now for its no-graphicyness.</div></div><hr />
