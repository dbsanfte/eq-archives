<br />
I've come to the conclusion that you can't cure the blindness proc that Black Reavers cast. Is this correct?<br />
<br />
And is there any way to resist the proc? I'm guessing not, as I've never seen a &quot;You resist the blind spell&quot; message.<br />
<br />
So, failing that, any tips for tanks fighting blind? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a great tip for fighting blind that my wife and I use all the time.<br />
<br />
I cast Assiduous Vision on her so I can see from her POV.  Then I tilt my monitor over towards her and she looks at my screen while fighting, hehe.<br />
<br />
AFAIK Cure Blindness would work on this proc, but the problem is you'd just be reblinded shortly afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maerjyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, unfortunately Cure Blindness does not work on the reavers proc, for whatever reason.  On a few occasions, when the proc wears off I believe I have seen it say &quot;You are no longer afraid.&quot; which implies it's not a true blind spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great idea for 2 boxers weissblau.<br />
<br />
I want to try the Nightmare hide (5 charges of cure blindness).<br />
<br />
But as Maerjjon indicates I may be wasting my time. If it's a wierd fear spell are they Magic based ? Or is it just unresistable and deal with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe I've just been lucky, but I've never had a problem with cure blindness on the reaver proc.  It's worked every time I've used it.  My understanding was that it used to not be curable, but now is.  However, it's been months since I went to CoM, so take that with a grain of salt!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We've killed around 20 BRs over the last week, and my experience has been that cure blind has no effect.<br />
<br />
I'd already had the 2-box idea - I think our tank has a second computer, I suggested he make a &quot;seeing eye halfling&quot;, and sneak them to the battle zone :)<br />
<br />
I've seen on a few occasions people say things like &quot;any decent tank knows how to fight blind&quot;. Is this just general bragging or can anyone offer tips I can pass on to my tank friend on blind fighing? Maybe I should be asking on the warrior boards?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice so far, anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've never ever been able to cure the reaver blindness.<br />
<br />
I tried again last monday, helping a friend with Rak.  This was after the patch message that said you could now cure it.  And I still couldnt cure it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The big problem with fighting blind is if the BR moves away, or you get pushed away, then you stop fighting.  If you're not a dual-boxer and have two phone lines or broadband, maybe it would be sufficient to get on the phone to your cleric and have them tell you where to move.<br />
<br />
No melee will have a problem continuing to mash the buttons for kick, etc. so as long as they are facing the BR and in melee range everything should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Been a while, but I have tried everything to cure reaver blindness, and nothing works.<br />
<br />
Tried:<br />
<br />
1.  Cure disease line spells<br />
2.  Cure Blindness<br />
3.  Cure poison line spells<br />
4.  The upgrade cure disease &amp; poison (purifying aura?)<br />
5.  Remove curse<br />
<br />
None of these work.  The tanks are blind until it wears off.  I never get any sort of a &quot;Your target has been cured&quot; message.  I've chain cast cure blindness through a few fights, and no cure.  (Once the Reaver's been pulled,  the shaman has to get creative about contributing to the fight.  Good time to practice that 2hb skill.)<br />
<br />
What I have not tried is dispell magic.  Assuming blindness places an icon in the buff box, this may be the best way to go.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep, it is not curable as far as I can tell.  I was spamming cure blindness on our tank as fast as it refreshed a couple nights ago and he said it did not cure once.  So I did what any good shammy does on magic immune mobs.  I melee'd :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was hoping remove curse would work, oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only times I have been able to &quot;cure&quot; blindness is when I cast the spell and by coincidence it wears off the target at the same time.  Cure Blindness doesn't work, and never has, yet every BR run I go on: &quot;Baxstarr will be on Cure Blindness duty&quot;.  More like Cure Blindness Doody!<br />
