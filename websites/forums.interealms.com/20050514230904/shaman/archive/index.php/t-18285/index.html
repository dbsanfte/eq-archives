<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Licck Nfrogz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok ok so the otherday i dueled a shaman and he has this aa sneeze thing that sucks!    I was knocked back and turned around.  Then next thing i Hear is &quot;Pet Storm to Licck&quot; and i was mauled by like 12 large wolves. *pant* <br />
<br />
I barely survived the onslaught and was getting ready to at least quick throw a quick dd at him when i keeled over from some damn proc or something from his real pet *sigh*  Where is the justice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this shaman probably had better gear and about twice the aas you had, so what's your point? You can't justify nerfing shaman because of 1 duel, especially because it's a pvp fight. There is absolutely no ballance to pvp.<br />
<br />
He also used the tools that he had on hand and spent about 20 AAs for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get better resists.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Licck Nfrogz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was mostly joking.   I thought it was an awesome display of an aa i've never seen before being relatively new to eq.  A aa that roots / interrupts and throwsback and away is HUGE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, Virulent Paralysis rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">VP is wonderful, and a great trick to haul out during duels.  It certainly doesn't hurt that MD casts in essentially zero time and that most people don't have much DR.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's DR resist if you want to resist it, get about 120-150 DR.  Course the thinking shaman will debuff you with our unresistable DR debuff, which does a bunch in PvP.  So realistically you need like 200 DR to resist that particular AA ability.  <br />
<br />
We shamans do love it tho.  I have maxed all levels of it and it throws a mob about 16 paces away.  In PvP it seems to be slightly bugged, often even the first level of it will toss a player a long ass way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/sigh<br />
<br />
He's angry because he talked trash to me for months and when I finally dueled him he died in 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about your personal experiences with VP, but I know VP gets resisted a lot. I have had resists at &lt; 20 DR. <br />
Obviously the nature of the PvP servers facilitates things for Shamans, so that to be safe you'd want to have 150+ DR, as Malicious will reduce your DR by 82.<br />
But what's 150 DR nowadays?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Erm, on blue servers in duels and in the arena VP is fairly useless unless your using it on someone with basically sod all resist gear or sense, I've had naked 65s resist it np.  It is very nice for dealing with annoying lowbie gateline campers though =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I find players will resist it as well, I use it on the tanks who get charmed by the Birds in PoFire (yeah, not needed, but its FUN!) Most times I have to MD em first though.<br />
<br />
VP could very well be the second best AA there is in LDoN though. The ability to totally remove a mob from combat is HUGE. Did a run the other day where the 2 healers were just a couple shaman, and everyone was amazed at how we bounced stuff all over the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Isn't Malo the debuff that whacks you across the board? (Magic, Poison, Disease)?  I've been Maloed before without knowing it (PvE) and when I checked my character I nearly panicked. (&quot;W.T.F! Why is 'X' resist at 20 and in the red?)  That debuf suxorz.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Checked Malo on Lucy's. Let me see if I understand this....Shaman get a Disease based slow...but Malo does not reduce DR? It's like  Monty Python and the Holy Grail <br />
<br />
&quot;Witness the inequities within the system! I&quot;m being repressed!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We have a dedicated DR debuff line, which culminates in an unresistable spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Feel free to try and land any shaman spell on me to any degree if you wish (Beyond malos/insid decay of course),  VP is far from unresistable, anyone with half decent resists will resist it without fail, mid 100dr = near immunity to VP and all disease dots regardless of if malicious decay is used or not.  For some reason our poison dots are a lot harder to resist in bluebie pvp.<br />
<br />
Granted, sure if your dueling joeblow bazaartwink who has practically zero resist mods then yeah, VP lands to a reasonable extent and with debuffing its not bad.  But that does NOT make it an unresistable spell in the slightest.<br />
<br />
*Edit* whoops, misread your comment, apologies =)<br />
<br />
Although this explination is still half decent I guess.</div></div><hr />
