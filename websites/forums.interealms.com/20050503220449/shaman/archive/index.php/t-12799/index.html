<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I really should know the answer to this, but for some reason I dont.  I am scowl to giants so cannot turn in heads to the trainer yet.  If I group with someone who has good Kael faction and have them turn in the heads, will I get the faction hit as well? I have spent 3 days killing coldain and am still scowling to giants.  I really dont feel like spending more time there if I dont have to. I have 30+ heads atm which I am hoping will at least get me to dubious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, you wont get any faction hits, just a share of the non-existant exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chewy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It'd be easier for you to go on a few WToV and NToV raids for faction poking.  Your faction will raise much faster, unless you're looknig to stay good with CoV which is damn hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Once you get good Zek faction you can turn in heads to capt bev.  For me starting at max scowl it took ~75 heads, 1 velk kill, and 1 dain kill to become unkos to t-max.  If you want Rif faction you can turn heads into the recruiter, I believe he takes them at kos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you can do head turnins while kos  invite yoru friend who can invis ( druid or an other shaman etc etc)  give the recruiter 4 heads at a time  dont accept till your invised  you will get the faction hits  <br />

btw giant faciton sucks to get i had to ae with a wizzie  now that was fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">this is how i did it, group up with someone who can invis you,  go up to the recruiter and open up the trade window, have the person your grouped with cast invis on you, then turn in 4 heads. i had to re do this each time i turned in the heads. do this until you are dubious then turn in heads to captain bvellos in the bank. sometimes he wanders around or people that are hunting there will kill him. a couple of dain kills is nice and killing in skyshrine helps also. still waiting to turn in my dain head to tormax for the belt of dwarf slaying, once a week spawn  :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i found camping tmax was harder then getting the dain's head itself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe i am off on this but iirc upon zone in frome the wastes side of kael there is a lower giant that is there just for turn ins that is complete magic resist and will not attack yu regardless of faction. <br />
<br />
Kinda like herald in chardok, turn in heads to him until you are not kos then go to the bank and do turn ins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The invis trick reportedly no longer works, it was nerfed/fixed a while ago.<br />
<br />
There IS a factionless turnin mob that will take the heads, that's your best route.</div></div><hr />
