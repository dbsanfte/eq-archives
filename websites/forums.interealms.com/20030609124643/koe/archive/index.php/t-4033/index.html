<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some of us got together last night and just had a lot of fun. It was Kind's enchanter, Never's wizard, Ryu's cleric, Venom's warrior, and my bard. We stayed right outside the bottom of the well, played for hours, got a lot of exp, and a lot of loot (for this level).<br />
<br />
I must say we owned this place. Everyone did a great job on the first pull which had about 6 Orcs. <br />
<br />
At the very end Ryu went LD. We waited a while but ended up having to leave. I hope he knows his way to the Frostone fort. If so he'll make it fine. If not let me know and I'll be there for invis and help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kindonini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This was a BLAST last night! I had an incredible amount of fun, the exp was fabulous and the company couldn't have been any better! :) <br />
<br />
I'm sorry we had to leave you Ryu, but Zapster is waiting in Frostone to give you a ride where ever you want to go (that a 32 wizzy can go that is hehe) Just give a holler when you want to get him out or get him to safety and we'll come help.</div></div><hr />
