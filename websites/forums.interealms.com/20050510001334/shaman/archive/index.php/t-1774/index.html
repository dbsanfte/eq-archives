<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quackums</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think we all have realized now that troll shamans are the best shaman race, and easily beat barbarians in dead sexiness.<br />
<br />
The real question now is, which diety of the two should be picked?  I made a troll shaman with Cazic-Thule diety before I knew anything about the two different necklaces.<br />
<br />
I believe this is the diety that gets the fear necklace, is it not?<br />
<br />
This isnt really a question on which diety would be better, but rather which necklace is better?  I seemed fine once I read about the necklaces and that I would get the fear one, but do you think the snare one would be better?<br />
<br />
Any comments would be helpfull, but i'm not too interested in restarting my char anyway :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fear is dangerous if a mob is not snared.  It hauls ass away from you at full speed.  Completely useless in a dungeon, and if you tried it you would probably create a massive train.  If you don't believe me, try casting flash of light on a critter and then backing out of melee with it.  Watch what it does.  That's fear.<br />
<br />
In all my soloing experiences, it's rare that I think to myself &quot;Damn, I wish I could fear this thing&quot; but near the end of almost every kill I say to myself &quot;argh I wish i had snare.&quot;  It's far too often that a running mob rounds a corner and I get the &quot;you cannot see your target&quot; message before my JBB finishes casting, and the mob then makes it into the next room to get help from his friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quackums</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Would it be worth remaking a level 10 shaman to choose the diety with the snare necklace then?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quackums</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ignoring the Kung-Fu the Legend Continues &quot;the tiger defeats the mountain&quot; type comments, does anyone think I should restart a level 10 troll shaman to get the better diety?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kung Fu?<br />
<br />
Your not serious are you?<br />
<br />
10 can be done in a day of serious play now pretty easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kung Fu ? <br />
You have much to learn, young padawan. <br />
<br />
<br />
I would....getting to 10 is no big hassle anymore. If you were like 20+ I'd say forget about it, but I'm a casual player so I really don't have the time to get back 20+ lvls.<br />
<br />

<br />
I guess I will have to :P, although it wont be very fun buying all of my spells again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ditch the troll - find a nice quite spot in the swamp and transfer your gear to the new troll.  lvl 10 is amazingly easy now.<br />
<br />
Then when you get this one to lvl 10 you can ditch it and start an oger.  That's the real 'best' race. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Quackums</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">While im at it, should I change starting stats?<br />
Last time I started with +25 wis and +5 agi<br />
Would sta be better because of the extra hp?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just to be a pain I thought I jump into this one!<br />
<br />
Didn't know about Snare/Fear necks till well into the late 40s... and I wasnt even going to open the Innoruk vs CT discussion at that point.  Welp, I'm stuck CT so make the best of it.....<br />
<br />
Best place to use the fear neck is to solo in BW(say 45+) by the giant fort.. Mob pathing takes the mob under the fort if you pull to the west side... Pull with slow, run under fort, hit fear and sic pet... Easiest mana-minimal kills at 56... Mobs I pull are all dark blue(skellies and apes)... BUT what EVER you do, dont try and solo Gullerback... (frinking resisting azz moronic stoopid no-spell landing dimwit that rips through my precious pet.. umm I meant I NEVER pull him)<br />
<br />
But back to you... kill the CT dude and make an Inny Troll ... As it was put Snare &gt; Fear ... Wish I had snare when soloing in the hole :(</div></div><hr />

Stick with the religion you first chose before you read too many necklace posts.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baz thinking 2 hours not a lot of time to redo in land of Norrath, aka the Timesink.  I have gotten quite a few skill-ups while at bind point waiting on a rez .... somehat after level 10 ...</div></div><hr />
