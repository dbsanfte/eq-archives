<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hollah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I run a pretty up to date system, 2.6 GHz processor, 512 RAM, 128 MB ATI Radeon 9800 Pro.  Up until lately everything has run very smooth.  Within the last few weeks though, my screen will lag every once in a while, or even every few seconds.  Everything will freeze up for about 5 seconds, then unfreeze and everything will be lag free as normal.  Any suggestions on how to fix this?</div></div><hr />

i had the same problem, its either 1. your connection, or the problem i had 2. youd cd drive is broken and keeps trying to read itself, now it won't show up as broken in the system profile, but it is broken. now when you get this lag does it happen every 15 seconds for about 5-8 secs then stop and repeat ?<br />
does this happen only after about an hour or so after doing a restart ?<br />
if so its probably #2.<br />
i had to rip my cd-r out because it drove my comp nuts.</div></div><hr />
