<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With my last shammy I never even tried melee and JBB at the same time...just expected that with an 8sec cast time I'd be interrupted all the time so I just did the Root / JBB thing. Now I hear that JBB can be channelled thru 90% of the time. Any truth to this?<br />
<br />
At lvl 41, and self buffed, my AGI is about 145ish and AC 902...both should be a bit higher by the time I hit 45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Surprisingly enough the JBB is rarely interrupted even though the casting time is quite long.  Big factor would be the mobs hitting you are most likely slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">in that situation I would always melee with the jbb, if you are using a weapon with a decent proc to it such as a rain or a dd proc its really nice to catch a process in between casts.  JBB channeling is pretty unique in that my experience would be if you get interuppted its usually at the beginning of the cast and you can just clicky it again quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Letting the mob beat on you while JBBing is the way to go for sure.  You will drive yourself batty rerooting if you try to root n nuke.  You will channel through the hits most of the time.  Melee swings in between are nice too if you are not on horseback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hiya people,<br />
<br />
It's been 4ever since I have posted here and I'm happy to be back. If you are going to solo and not farming PP ya may want to<br />
make and use our DS potions and a pet in the backround.<br />
And get yourself an ODS. Not sure what lvl Mana Conservation lll<br />
works for casters &lt;Shm&gt;. When I solo in AR I use DS, wear ODS. After SLOWING I BoN, POX, and use Epic DOTs. From there just JBB. Even slowed on an avg I get hit 22 times. 31 X 22 = 620 dmg<br />
mana free. To melee once every 8 secs between JBB casts is ok<br />
also. If ya hit the mob fine if not thats fine also, I just dont melee anymore =/ Dont worry about mana cause you can always CANN<br />
in a couple mins, about half the time or so it would cost ya to med.<br />
If all ya do is JBB it can take ya 4ever to kill a mob. We want to increase the number of mobs we kill in the least amout of time.<br />
Now being a lvl 60 shm I obviously have a bigger mana pool then a shm that is lvl 41 BUT the lvl of mobs is perpetuated by the mana we use, I suppose =) Anyway with my current mana pool and C3 on, Wis 233 have something in the neighborhood of 3500<br />
or so. Dont know the exact mana usage for BoN and Pox exactly and to lazy to have a look from here heh but its something like 800 mana or so. I can cast those 2 dots FOUR times or 3200 mana. Not bad id say and Cann does 3 mins downtime. Not bragging here keep in mind just using a formula to show DOWNTIME costs vs. just the JBB. I know a couple Shms with 4k mana + so im a tad behind =/<br />
Ok enuff babble. A nut in a shell Dont be afraid of a little DOWNTIME for cann 1-4 or 5 if you have the needed lvl and AA pts. Its an ability we have like no other class has w/o some help along the way. IE Mana Robe etc etc. Ok Im off to post elsewhere,<br />
and remember most of all HAVE FUN !!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was browsing through old screenshots and found one where I took 4 hits from a mob and still channeled through a JBB blast.  The only thing that really interrupts it constantly are bashes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">55 shaman here , my slow reduces normal attack speed mobs to about 1 melle round every 8 seconds, roughly .<br />
<br />
Slowed mob = almost never interupted with JBB<br />
<br />
unslowed = interupted often<br />
<br />
So slow that puppy , get in his face , auto-attack on and JBB away. With ac/hp gear and regen I walk away from a blue con with 70-100 % health and 90 % mana. canni 3 times , regen health while i look for next victim .<br />
<br />
It's a pretty sweet deal =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye Tweadle nailed the basic mystery of the JBB, in that when you hit 51 you get the best slow and then the mob will really only have one chance to hit you during that 8 sec cast time.<br />
<br />
At 60, most xp mobs are slowed enough so that they *barely* get that chance to hit in.  I have my ac as high as it can get and many times they dont even hit me so channeling isnt a problem.<br />
<br />
However, even if I do get hit or bashed I still channel the JBB well over 90% of the time Id say.  On the other hand, the epic is much harder to channel for some reason, even though its also a clicky.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind though that channeling clickies does not increase your channeling skill.</div></div><hr />
