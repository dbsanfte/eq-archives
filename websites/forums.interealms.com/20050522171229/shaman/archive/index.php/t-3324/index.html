<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What does everyone think of quad kiters?<br />
<br />
I was in Maidens last night sitting on Umbral hill for about 2hrs when I decided it was time to take a bathroom break. Much to my surprise when I get back here is a 60 druid and chanter sitting right down in front of me almost on top of my pet. So I says to myself -- self lets just pull to the same spot we always have been and they can move. Next thing I know there are no mobs left to kill because the nice quad kiters had killed everything in site. So I get my brain working again (this can be dangerous) and start to try to kill faster to get my share of the mobs. I also send a tell to the druid saying I don't mind sharing mobs but I do need some to kill. Answer I got was &quot;you have already stolen 4 of my pulls, I guess I could let you have one out of every 4 of my mobs. So now I am urinated off and start doing stupid stuff, next thing I know my pet is dead and I  am out of mana. So I said to self &quot;ok Mr dumb trollie it is time to move&quot;. Since I have no pet I invis up and move over to kill goranga at the Chief spawn. This is good because nobody is around. Next thing I know there are no more goranga around either. Yup you got it different quad kiters moved in and took all the mobs. <br />
<br />
I do not mind a class using their abilities to play the game but it seems to me that quad kiting is getting out of hand when it starts to cause trouble where the average player stays right out of zones because of it ie: CS.<br />
<br />
I am getting to the point where I don't want to even group with classes that can quad kite because of the crap that some of them pull when soloing.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a reason Druids and Wizards quad kite... Nobody will group with them post-50.(Wizards can do AE groups after 57 though, but they take forever to set up)<br />

There are plenty of zones for you to fight in... If people are there, go somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

6. You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area.<br />
Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or inconvenience a number of groups rather than a specific player or group of players. This includes things such as:<br />
<br />
Monopolizing most or all of the kills in an area.  <br />
Deliberately blocking a doorway or narrow area so other players cannot get past. <br />
Refusing to cooperate with the other parties at a contested spawn site after having been instructed to do so by an EQCSR. <br />
Making excessive and inappropriate use of zone-wide communications (/shout, /ooc, /auction).<br />
<br />
I've been aggravated by quaders for a while myself and just wondered if this would possibly be enforceable against them or AE groups? If so has anyone tried this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok I'm an exwizard and coulddn't resist chiming in:<br />
<br />
You want to quad, go somewhere where there aren't people.  That's a pretty damn easy concept IMO.  Camped zones are NOT the place for it.. it's rude and it denies other people who aren't going to solo like you are any chance of soloing.  ME is good, I'll admit, when there aren't people there.  <br />
<br />
And yes, if someone did that to me I'd w/o a doubt petition.  Not because he was quadding but the sheer arrogance and rudeness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bulx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hi I just signed up as a member.  I've been reading these boards for a while and figured I would finally join as i'm starting a new shaman.  <br />
Figured this would be a good thread to start off on as my main is a 60 wizard.  For those that don't know there is only one viable place to quad as a druid or wizard at 60...Maiden's Eye.  All of our old spots ...raptors in TD, CS mobs are all light blue or green.  <br />
In ME there are 3 mobs classes we can quad ...gorangas, toilers, and bats.<br />
As a wizard especially the earlier comments on your thread are 100 percent correct, wizards are not wanted in xp groups.   ON raids everyone screams asking for the wizards,   when its time to xp ..all we hear is TL me plz.  Frankly i'm starting a shaman because I see the enormous utility of a raid class, king of the soloers at 60, and an excellent xp group class.  <br />
Just remember as a shaman you can solo in a 100 spots quad kiters can't.  And usually just ask a wizard to take a few mobs before tattling to teacher ( petition), most wizards are very cool and reasonable people.  For druids ...well umm ..yeah they are annoying =p.<br />

<br />
Shissar in the Grey are prime quad victims, I'm pretty sure they are still blue to lvl 60s.  I could be wrong.  Now you have *2* zones to quad in out of the 120+ zones in EQ. :)<br />
<br />
Of course, I group in the Grey at 47 so just pretend I didn't mention the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the grey is fairly difficult to quad in, mostly cuz of the traps and such. but let me explain a few things<br />
<br />
1. druids do not have infinate mana to quad with.<br />
<br />
without a good source of mana regen i can quad slightly slower than a necro soloes, and slightly faster than a shaman soloes. by the time i get 4 mobs. round em up, snare em all, start killin, get oom from all that, and med up again, most good shaman will have killed 6+ mobs.<br />
<br />
2. there has to be 4 mobs up for him to quad with. that being said, if you can't clear the spawn, and there are 4 extra mobs up at all times, he is well within his rights to start exping there, and you have no right to keep him from it.<br />
<br />
3. it's a very large myth that quad kiting is great exp. at lvl 60 a druid is MUCH better off root/rotting multiple kills for exp, as you can med while you kill, and we have free dot items to use. i kill mobs while i med with my epic and dot bracer :D<br />
<br />
<br />
basically what i see here, is someone who had extra mobs on his spawn (which he is not allowed to monopolize by the way) and the druid started quadding them. then there was a 2 minute space where there was no mob up and the druid was medding. so the shaman here got real annoyed that he had to share a spawn, like he does under the rules.<br />
<br />
that being said, if you think it's too crowded someplace, you have the option of leaving. if it's too crowded in seb with groups, you leave. if it's too crowded in ME with quadders, leave. i don't see a difference, if you do, i might suggest a slight bias there.<br />
<br />
please don't take this offensively, it's meant to be constructive, and dispell a few myths i see lying around about druids and wizzies just sucking in exp from quadding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My own personal experience with a quad kiting druid in The Grey was simply this:<br />
<br />
Druid pulled 4 Shissar from behind the temple (I don't know what he did to pull them).  One of them aggroes on me as I am medding in my group.  When it engages on me my group takes it down, and the /shout's start:<br />
KSer!<br />
You took my mob!<br />
Do it again and I'll /petition you!<br />
Bleh.  <br />
<br />
So I ask an honest question:  How do druids/wizards start the quad?  How can a meditating shaman (at about 50% health) generate more aggro than the druid?  Do they pull with a DoT or snare or just run by the mob and hope it aggros?<br />
<br />
basically what i see here, is someone who had extra mobs on his spawn (which he is not allowed to monopolize by the way) and the druid started quadding them. then there was a 2 minute space where there was no mob up and the druid was medding. so the shaman here got real annoyed that he had to share a spawn, like he does under the rules. <br />
<br />
<br />
I find it extremely ironic (and humorous) that a quad kiting druid is wanting other people to share mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
that being said, if you think it's too crowded someplace, you have the option of leaving. if it's too crowded in seb with groups, you leave. if it's too crowded in ME with quadders, leave. i don't see a difference, if you do, i might suggest a slight bias there. <br />
<br />
Does it matter who was there first?  I wasn't there in ME with Lumppy, but his version of the story has him being at both camps earlier than the other chars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Depending on the distance between the mobs a druid is looking to grab, it's almost always easiest to start with ensnare.  Wizards are probably different, as their snare is AE-based, but I've not played one, so I don't know.<br />
<br />
I don't know shissar agro, but if the mob is undead, it'll obviously just agro whoever is closest. If you are sitting, that's agro.  Low health is too. The druid most likely pulled too close to you, or you were sitting in a higher traffic area and he didn't see you, or was attempting to avoid a trap, or was just cresting a hill.  <br />
<br />
Another rumor to be dispelled is that quadders don't care about running over you with their kites - nothing ticks a quadder off more than to have their tightly bunched foursome broken up, so they have to rebunch. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">See Im normally a pretty mellow kinda guy(yeah on a zek even), but if that situation happened to me on RZ (particularly his assertion that YOU had stolen HIS mobs) I would just malo him and root his arse =p(malosini on top of malo if he has good resisists).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And that is why I would never mess with anyone on a Zek.<br />
<br />
I don't pay enough attention to the game :)<br />
<br />
I will admit that the idea that I could do on a blue server what Karelan would do on a red server is sweet :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bulx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wizards start quads by proximity aggro ( n00bs) or with a staff of temperate flux which has an instant cast debuff of like 6 fr and cr ..bascially can aggro the mob while running as long as he's in casting distance.  Get 4 mobs round them up by doing circles around them till tightly packed and then run away till out of range of casting then stop cast AE snare and start AE spells till dead.  And yes people are right quadding if done right is better xp than anything ...even AEing.<br />
With epic, C3 ( i can always get this in the nexus for TLing a random chanter ), pet, MC3, horse and manarobe, i can be FM from oom in 4min.  I can do 2 full quads on a full bar of mana ( i'll regen mana while rounding up the second set of 4).  That's 1 blue of xp per quad, if i want to chain cast manarobe and quad nonstop i can get an aaxp in 2 hours.  <br />
Rule of thumb if there are 3 level 60 quad kiters or necro's ...leave the toilers alone ..because you won't be able to grab enough mobs to justify being there.  Besides you can solo those 8 arms thingies, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hello, i killed some many toilers in ME.(near the lake),now i kill shrooms better xp.IMO and we can be afk whitout any problem,<br />
at many places.<br />
<br />
ok,when i hunted in ME (for about 30 aa levels),there were one wizzy lv 60 and one druid lv 60 whit epic (both whit same big guild.<br />
<br />
they were quad kiting their own mobs (toilers),<br />
and i didnt quad kite but was able to kill 2 or 3 mobs at same times,(whit no downtime).<br />
they were killing faster but had to get mana after.<br />
and  for a 1 hour + killing,i am pretty sure i was able to kill as much toilers as them ( i checked them many times).<br />
when you see  a quad kiter running in your area you are checking the mobs.<br />
<br />
i prefer FG now, we don t see those quad kiters.........<br />
well you must have a good spot in FG because many AE killing there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My main is a bard and I quad kite as well.<br />
<br />
I will address a number of points from that perspective:<br />
<br />
&quot;Next thing I know there are no more goranga around either.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you are waiting at a camp that has a respawn right on the point you are waiting I would never think to take the mob(s) from you.<br />
However, if you are moving around engaging mobs as they pop, then it is a free for all and the first to a mob pretty much gets it in my book.<br />
If I see you casting on or heading to a mob that I just saw I will still give it to you even if I can beat you to it, I can see that you intend to engage it.<br />
Exception to this would be something like the AC where we are ALL looking for it, and then I would (and have) give it to whoever actually engaged it first (got aggro).<br />
<br />
&quot;It is bloody frustrating in places like FD/Chardok etc when you are camping a set of mobs and somerun runs through the middle of em taking them off to be slaughtered by an AE.&quot;<br />
<br />
That is a KS in my book.<br />
That's when I load up my spell book and cause a wipe-out of the AoE group.<br />
HOWEVER, if they were there first and camping the zone then I would give them the camp so long as they proved able to keep it.<br />
(I am likely to question your holding multiple camps if you cannot use or clear them)<br />
<br />
&quot;there has to be 4 mobs up for him to quad with. that being said, if you can't clear the spawn, and there are 4 extra mobs up at all times, he is well within his rights to start exping there, and you have no right to keep him from it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmmm... well, I typically will not contest a camp if someone is on it. However, it is very frustrating to see someone claim a camp that they can't/don't even use.<br />
<br />
&quot;it's a very large myth that quad kiting is great exp.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's sick exp for a bard.<br />
<br />
&quot;druids do not have infinite mana to quad with&quot;<br />
<br />
Nor do bards (bard higher level charm, the core of bard quad kiting at higher levels requires mana), however, with proper AA/FT items a bard can regen at a rate equal or exceeding their usage for charm.<br />
<br />
&quot;there has to be 4 mobs up for him to quad with.&quot;<br />
<br />
VERY true, if there are not enough mobs up then the xp efficiency is GREATLY reduced.<br />
<br />
&quot;if it's too crowded in seb with groups, you leave. if it's too crowded in ME with quadders, leave. i don't see a difference&quot;<br />
<br />
I agree, unless you are camping a specific spawn point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Druid pulled 4 Shissar from behind the temple (I don't know what he did to pull them). One of them aggroes on me as I am medding in my group. When it engages on me my group takes it down, and the /shout's start: <br />
KSer! <br />
You took my mob! <br />
Do it again and I'll /petition you! <br />
Bleh.&quot;<br />
<br />
That druid was an idiot that should be yelled at for not handling his aggro.<br />
However, I have had it where I was quading in an area by myself and players come up and aggro off my mobs.<br />
Generally I have no problem in taking them right back, but this is really not acceptable in my book.<br />
Bards DO NOT hold anything more than proximity aggro on all but one of the mobs they are using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There's too much quad kiting lovin going on here.  Quad kiting sucks and I'll tell you why.  Druid rounds up 4 mobs, then starts running them all over the place.  Usually this involves trampling other people, and god forbid one of them aggros on you, you'll hear a shouting druid all night long &quot;KSer, leave my mobs alone!&quot;  Anyways, back to the point.  While the quad kiter is dragging around those four mobs, NOTHING IS RESPAWING.  Even the mana efficient but slow necros kill most mobs in a couple of min MAX.  Now get a few quad kiters in the area, and you just increased the spawn timers on all mobs from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.  Plus, it seems that quad kiters love the nice secluded spots that are ideal for a nice quite morning soloing.  Nope, no mobs for you mr shaman - I'm a quad kiter and I'm gonna use kewl d00d speak to annoy you into leaving - you soxxors!<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Now I will say that it's always been odd to me how I have never had a problem with a wizard quad kiting.  They are always respectful and I never even notice them.  But why is it that druids seem to have a problem understanding a little basic respect for other gamers?  <br />
<br />
I personally think a wizard is harder to play than a druid, and that separates the man from the boys so to say.<br />
<br />
My rants for what they are worth,<br />
Kongar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Pesty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Here is my most recent exp with a quad kiting Wizzy. I was in the Grey with my Mage and SK and was fear kiting along the wall. About 4 different times this wizzy ran by with a bunch of skeles and other crap following him. Now why he decided to run by me when he knew I was there is beyond me, but everytime he did he trained me. I had to gate 3 times and one time I had an exp death.<br />
<br />
I am also on a Zek servor and I kill a quader whether it is a druid or a wizzy whenever I can. Preferably while he is still quading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">9 times from 10 I have no problem with Wizards quadding. They're actually pretty good at it because they've got to manage with just Jboots/Run3 to make their space and THEN snare them. I'm personally not game to try it, so they get my respect. It goes bad, you eat an exp death.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Druids pull with Snare and have sow. MUCH safer. MUCH easier. That's why I personally think they suck at it. It's so easy that it just breeds laziness. Plus, because it's so easy people who want the easy path (read: jerks) will go for it. They don't care if they train you. They'll just be annoyed at you mucking up their quad. Bastages.<br />
<br />
Haven't had much experience with Bard's kiting, but one time really sticks out in my mind. Bard was swarm kiting Spectres in Oasis and thought it was a good idea to pull them through the Docks. First time I asked him if he could find another place and caught some abuse. They weren't attacking ME so I should shut up, etc. So I just sat down and let myself get trained. GM showed up shortly after that (I didn't petition) and he started pulling towards Sro like every other Spectre group. So yeah, I don't think I should really talk too much about Bards. Slightly tainted.<br />
<br />
The best way to keep quadders away is to pick a camp that you can keep clear. If you can't keep your camp to less than 2 or 3 mobs up at a time then you're not killing fast enough so someone WILL move in on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Geez.  There's a huge number of mobs in ME.  It takes multiple groups of people to be able to kill all of the gorangas on just the hill.  Another group of people can occupy the zone to akheva.  Another gorup can camp the scouts near akheva and the nearby wanderers for xp while camping shards.  Then there's the umbral zone line you can camp.  There's lots and lots of bats inbetween akheva and dawnshround.  This is all IGNORING the massive number of mobs that wander the zone, and all of those many many 4 arms and cloaks in the ruins on the north end of the zone next to the chieftan tree.  ME could have about 60 peoeple in it and still have enough mobs to go around.  And the poster has the gall to say that he doesn't have anything to pull because 2 people came to hunt near him.  Hey brainiac, try pulling another mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">First of all, I would like to say that the class-hating needs to stop.  I, too, used to have an intense prejudice towards druids, but I finally got over it.  It's just a bunch of dumb stereotypes.  Yeah, druids have a higher jerk to nice guy ratio than most other classes, but for every jerk druid out there that doesn't know how to quad, I promise you there is at least one yellow-boot shaman wielding a book that runs around like a moron when he takes aggro, has never cannibalized in his life, and won't slow unless asked to.<br />
<br />
Second of all, to the original poster:  your complaints seem to stem from the fact that quad-kiters kill faster and more than you do (at least in your eyes).  Get over it.  It is great exp for them and they are entitled to do it.  Telling a wizard or druid they can't quad kite is like telling an Oracle with all his toys than he cant use jbb epic or torpor.<br />
<br />
If a zone is being sucked dry of mobs by too many soloers (ex:  velks is now a worthless zone unless you are in dogs.  there are about 20 level 60's soloing spiders for AA at all times.  not a bug to be found), go elsewhere.  There are about a billion places we can solo that kiters cannot.  If a quadder is really giving you grief and you want to piss him off, dispell or root his mobs.  Preferable, stand behind a rock or something where he cant see you and dispell his mobs from there.  Dispelling will remove..... nasty damageshield.  Yeah... thats it :)  You were just helping out.</div></div><hr />
