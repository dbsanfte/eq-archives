<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jendaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The strength of a Shaman amazes me. At level 29 I was able to consistently solo mobs level 36-37. That isn't the most amazing part... it only took me on average 30percent health and mana during the entire fight !! Slow, Dot... haste/regen myself in bearform and go at it. My shaman isn't even twinked. The mobs i have fought are in DSP. just wanted to get the word out to all the other baby shamans out there, btw i did have KEI.</div></div><hr />

Enjoy it now. Shamans arent super soloers in PoP. We are on par with every other class then.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have just started grouping in the tier 1 planes, and over the course of the past two weeks or so, I don't recall ever sitting there with my LFG tag on for more than 10-15 minutes.  Seems everyone is looking for some shammy lovins these days. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kohn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I solo in PLane of Fire no problem. Not the most effiecient tho. 5 to 7 mins per kill. Plus a bit of down time to recover mana. I get 5 aa percent per mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grab a mage (who sees the same kind of decline in soloability / increase in downtime) and you've got yourself some nonstop fun in tier 1 and 2.  Have yet to find out about 3.  :)</div></div><hr />
