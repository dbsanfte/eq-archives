<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sardak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started playing on Sullon Zek to experience eq with the threat of human mobs. I choose Iksar shaman and am now nearly level 20, however I recently heard that Iksar cannot use this JBB which is so highly spoken of. Everyone I talk to says that Iksar mak ethe best shamans, however if this item is as useful as I gather from reading these boards.. is Iksar a good choice?<br />
<br />
btw, something annoying about Sullon zek is that I can only be evil races now since i have an iksar shaman. So no vah shir for me :/</div></div><hr />

Prob coz they have never met a Troll shaman :)<br />
<br />
Seriously tho - JBB is nice and all, but the game is about fun and playing what you want to play.  If you wanna play an Iksar, play one, if you group a lot then the JBB is nowhere near as useful as if you solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This has been pretty well beat to death many times. Quick summary: JBB is nice and at 45-50ish you can probablly level faster with it then just about anything else. After this, your dots and Iksar regen can probablly even this out with some work. However, you have to get a JBB and normally people don't just hand those out when you hit 45. I didn't get mine until 54ish when I paid 17k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Prob coz they have never met a Troll shaman  <br />
<br />
Ive met plenty of troll shaman, does it really make you that much better because you can use JBB?  No.  It helps level faster from 45-55.  AFter that the JBB doesnt play such a big part in the overall scheme of things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well i know you can at least get to lvl 60 without a jbb. You can do great as iksar shaman or any other shaman just fine without a jbb. I have a iksar shaman would if be nice to use a jbb? Sure would be but i can never use one and i still have alot of fun playing my shaman. My slows still work great and i can buff people just as well as any other shaman. <br />
<br />
  Also dont forget they arent cheap and isnt like every non iksar shaman gets one handed to them at lvl 45 as a right of passage. Not trying to down play the jbb cuz i am a iksar. They are nice and DO help those shammies that have one but you can still thrive just fine as an iksar shaman.</div></div><hr />

Without a JBB you:<br />
<br />
1.  Can't hit 60<br />
2.  Can't ride a horse (dead?)<br />
3.  Can't get AAexp<br />
4.  Can't pee<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />

<br />
JBB is just a crutch for the weaker races hatchling. Iksar need no unnatural aids such as this bracer to be great. We realized this long ago, which is why although we created them, we stopped using the bracers thousands of years ago.<br />

<br />
Um, lol, ok. Are we playing the same game here? Run around nekkid and see how far your skill gets you in a group or solo then. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
a) Please note smiley face and sig - was saying it coz I am a troll and would therefore obviously defend my race<br />
b) Did I at any point say Troll shaman are better because they can use a JBB? Didnt think so.<br />
<br />
If you read the whole post I will point out that the JBB whilst nice is not a necessity and in some cases is barely used.<br />

Jeez - some people need to cut down on their caffeine intake.</div></div><hr />

- There is no skill involved in EQ. To be successful in EQ you need to have a lot of time, and time is not a skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mmmm disagree Zorlac. You have at least gottah have good hand-eye coordination. <br />
<br />
I love watching a keyboard only enchanter try and get a train of mobs mezzed without using an aoe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">#1: It's highly probable that you're going to get griefed off the server before you hit lvl 45 so the JBB will not be an issue<br />
<br />
#2: The economy of SZ is screwy because of low population so there's no way you're going to be able to buy a JBB for a normal &quot;market&quot; price.  If you see one for sale it's going to be hella expensive.  You will not have the cash for one by the time you are lvl 45.<br />
<br />
#3: I rarely see anyone selling JBBs because noone camps the crypt.  Sebilis usually has 1 AE group doing everything from disco to chef and other than that it's empty.  Any JBBs you see on the market are probably from legends.  You will probably not have a chance to buy a JBB even if you do have the cash and finding a group willing to camp the crypt will be difficult and will require you to be in your mid 50s when JBB will no longer help that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ok fine, you need a very limited skill to know how to operate a keyboard, preferably not looking at it and looking always at the screen. <br />
<br />
Or if someone is totally incompetent and can't operate a keyboard then install a voice recognition software and use a mic instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The more you advance levels and with focus items, the more other means of doing &quot;mana free&quot; damage will be just as good as JBB and better. JBB is still an excellent item, but if you are an efficiency maniac, there are other ways to surpass JBB damage efficiency.</div></div><hr />
