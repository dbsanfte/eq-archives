<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so pets are supposed to be best pet every time ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>HerkeeLees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What level are you? I think it mentioned something about &quot;you can summon the best pet for 'your' level&quot; so if you are only level 50 or so, you won't be summoning 51 hitters. At least thats how I read it /shrug...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seeing posts that pets are being summoned at the &quot;average&quot; level in all cases and not the best level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OMG!  This is what I was afraid of, Verant decided that making you summon a strong pet every time would be too much so they make it not the weakest and not the strongest and call it good.  Dammit!  I would rather have the 47 - 51 and summon multi times to get the 51 so he doesnt miss as much and does more dmg.</div></div><hr />

Alan VanCouvering posted this small update for people who are noticing their pets are a bit weak: <br />
For those of you with characters that summon pets, we are aware of the problem with pets. Currently they are not being summoned at their highest level. Sorry for the problem, we’ll get it fixed as soon as we can. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is there a place with hard data on dog-dog? I want specifics. Now that they will be a particular level, I would think it would be easier to gain this data. Any links?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Specifics on what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">specifics on hitpoints, what they hit for, special attacks that are new to the new pet level....you know.....things!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">another bug that could have been seen pre-release by actually entering the game, casting one pet spell and attacking a mob. GO VERANT!</div></div><hr />
