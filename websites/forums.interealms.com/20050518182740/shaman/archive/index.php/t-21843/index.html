<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I need your help with some suggestions.<br />
<br />
I would like to raffle off the following items from the Guild Summit:<br />
<br />
1. That keyboard thingie with the EQ overlay (I admit, I did open the package to peek at it, but it is unused). I'm pretty sure it's this:<br />
<br />
http://www.ideazon.com/ <br />
<br />
2. 2 EQ lithographs (Velious and Planes of Power).<br />
<br />
3. OoW CD key<br />
<br />
4. EQ 2 ball cap<br />
<br />
5. An EQ pen and paper guide book (sorry, I will update this later tonight with the actual title).<br />
<br />
I need your help trying to figure out the best way to &quot;random&quot; items for the 12K plus subscribers we have. I have this terrible image of me writing down names on 1000 scraps of paper to draw out of an enormous hat!<br />
<br />
The only basic ground rule I can think of is that anyone who would like to be included must have been registered BEFORE today. Also, of course, anyone who would like to enter must feel comfortable sharing their mailing address with me (via PM or email).<br />
<br />
The other rules I can think of:<br />
<br />
An individual would enter the raffle, eligible to win any of the 5 prizes (a person can't enter just to win prize 4, for example). I would random 5 times (I know the odds are a longshot, but no one person could win more than once).<br />
<br />
I would come here and announce the winners for each of the 5 prizes. I can also contact the winners via their registered email addresses. Winners would have 2 weeks to contact me with shipping information. If I don't hear from any of the winners within 2 weeks, I would do another random for that particular item.<br />
<br />
Basically, I'm going to need an easy way to collect names of interested parties and an easy way to &quot;draw&quot; the results to make this feasible.<br />
<br />
Thoughts? Suggestions? Comments? Complaints? <br />
<br />
Oh, just to the &quot;why am I doing this comments?&quot;:<br />
<br />
1. I am addicted to my ergonomic keyboard, I type like a spaz on a &quot;normal&quot; keyboard.<br />
2. I don't wear hats due to hair issues.<br />
3. I already have those lithographs, gifts of a friend who attended E3.<br />
4. I want to share some of the excitement of the summit with you guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's very nice of you, Glori. :)<br />
<br />
Maybe write down a number from 1 to 100k or something, and anyone who's interested posts a number to this thread.  Closest 5 win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh. That is pretty clever :)<br />
<br />
BTW No one act on any of these suggestions yet (ie don't start spamming numbers at me). When we decide on a suggested course of action, I'll have an &quot;official&quot; raffle thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like a good idea.  <br />
<br />
As far as finding winners, if it's possible get get a list of canadites, it wouldn't be hard to do a /ran 0 xxx or even write a simple random number generator if you didn't want to use the broken EQ random number generator (though it seems kinda fitting)<br />
<br />
Or you could do it the easy way and have people post here if they want to be included in the raffle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, you have no way to trust or believe me, but I first mentioned the idea of a raffle in my hotel room on Sunday morning. I had taken John (my boyfriend) to San Diego with me and we joked around that he should do the raffle since he was &quot;impartial.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, and to be really fair, Fricka from the Safehouse had mentioned doing a raffle for her site during the EQ 2 demo - which gave me the idea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Vigdis, I love the idea, but it would be difficult to be an impartial judge. I think a random of some sort would be themost fair.</div></div><hr />

I personally think that she was underpaid for taking several days out of her personal schedule to go try to express some of our concerns to SOE.  Thanks, Glori!</div></div><hr />

I would hate to arrange a time and some people can't participate due to real life schedules or being on an alternate time zone.<br />

how would they even take her serious when she is messing around ON OUR MONEY, talking nonsense about shaman's getting bixie pets and what not.<br />
<br />
<br />
i say our money, because i pay the same damn 12.95 you do. and im not seeing any satisfaction, and it just went into her pockets and onto her computer.<br />
<br />
and now that she gets called on it, its suddenly a raffle ?<br />

Just to clarify, YOU did not &quot;call me&quot; on anything. I had planned to do this since Sunday morning :)<br />
<br />
As I said earlier, I don't want the keyboard and I already HAVE the lithos (signed by Keith, no less). There is no reason for me to keep them and every reason to give them away!</div></div><hr />

<br />
so, in me saying that henora would have done something other than go to a ball game and hang out with her hubby in a hotel room, im an idiot?<br />
<br />
amazing, think of it this way, this is a game we PAY for not a free game, if this was diablo 2 i wouldn't care, but this is EQ, i payed many months ahead in advance.<br />
<br />
i basically gave sony money to wine and dine her. and for her just to get smiled and nodded at, i seriously think henora would have spoken up and said something, even if henora had to be mean abut it just to get heads to turn.<br />
<br />
but then again, shaman are great in ryan's eyes $$$$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Kurth,<br />
<br />
If you'd open your eyes rather than your mouth, you'd see that Gloriana did us a service. By telling her that she used your money to attend the summit is the same thing as telling a highway patrolman that you pay their wages and they should let you go for doing 90 in a 65. I understand you're bitter, maybe even jealous that you didn't get to go, but Gloriana went out of her way to address the Shaman community's concerns, so that summit wouldn't have been just about the higher end guilds, but about classes as well. If anything, you should thank her for taking time out of HER schedule to do this. She didn't have to. She could have sent someone else or just turned the invitation down and let allowed Shaman to get a voice in that at all. I'm glad she did. And so what if she made a comment about Bixie pets? Seriously, are you going to hang onto that like some sort of twelve your old in a temper tantrum when presented with facts? Seems to me that you are. So chill out, take a breath and step away. If you still don't like it: tough. Gloriana is a respect member of the community and we trust her to represent us. Maybe next time you should go instead, and show us how wonderful a job you would have done in parading around SOE in a frump and demanding answers like a tyrant?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Anybody who runs one of these sites, with all the pain and headache involved, then had to actually INTERACT with those schmucks at SoE, then decides to raffle off her &quot;ill gotten-gains&quot; is showing a bit more commitment to the &quot;Shaman Community&quot; <br />
<br />
than somebody who is dinging her.<br />
<br />
Perhaps one criteria for invite to SoE San Diego HQ was the ability to display a modicum of civility?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot to add - if we go to a raffle with numbers - dibs on 69.</div></div><hr />

honestly, I've known you for a while, just come up with a method and the rest of the the shaman here will abide by it.  You'll always have a few people detracting from your bona fide gesture so don't worry what anyone else has to say.   Come up with something, and we'll do it that way.   That said, I have no interest in any of the items so you can leave me out of whatever raffle you're holding.  <br />

Another idea is there could be a literal prize draw, people post their entries, and get numbers assigned according to the post number of their entry (Warren Maguson Emarr's post being #43 for instance) Then set a time &amp; place on Glory's server. An easy to reach, but lag free zone. Qeynos Hills for instance, and have Glory do the prize draw there (people being able to attend if able to witness the event so no body moaning about it being a fix etc)<br />
The actual prize draw would be /random 1 X (where X would be the highest entry number<br />
The first one out would win 1st prize, second one would get 2nd prize and so on and so forth.<br />
Any numbers that did NOT match someone's entry (for instance, someone who had already entered posts a 2nd time, or someone who doesnt want to enter posts saying so) would be ignored and rerolled.</div></div><hr />

with 20% haste (our best lowest haste) hes at 16.51-15.96 (can't tell reliably i went berserk twice out of 48 samples, because a mob got me from behind and stunned me alot (light crawlers) .)<br />
<br />
with group prinmal essence (it does hit low lvl chars) hes 16.88 to 17.20<br />
<br />
this is with max skills for my level. and dark blue mobs (tribal hunter) in dsp.<br />
and some wolves and what not i could get.<br />
<br />
i dodged a total of 13 hits, while they missed me 35 times total and i parried 9, riposted 2.<br />
<br />
i proced a total of 15 times over the course of this. for total damage of 600 (some got resisted)<br />
i proced my offhand 6 times (lack of will)<br />
<br />
so far im very close to lvl 39, lol im about 25% from it.<br />
<br />
im not sure how much of an improvement i can make with this, but so far haste seems to improve my warr more than anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
/shrug best i can do, im excommunicated from my guild for thinking we are dying, so i can't very well ask some of our best tanks to help.</div></div><hr />

If you do decide to do an in-game raffle, would you entertain the thought of making it a 'Shaman Summit Day&quot;.  Pick a server, pick a lag-free zone, Qeynos Hills comes to mind, and start level 1 shaman.<br />
<br />
I would honestly take a day off work, or stay up late or get up early to stage a &quot;shaman summit day&quot;, where we would see something tangible come out of the summit (your kind donations), and get to know some of the the people behind the Crucible posts.<br />
<br />
Heck, if you get enough interest, we could zerg Hadden !<br />

Post a huge numbered list of all the entrants in a sticky post then in game /ran x and screen shot it. I'm sure there will be plenty of voluenteers on your server to verify the result</div></div><hr />

I would hate to arrange a time and some people can't participate due to real life schedules or being on an alternate time zone.<br />

Damn, I love the idea though!<br />
<br />
Kamidari, thanks, but I'm okay :) I knew there would be some angry comments when I returned (no matter what I said).<br />
<br />
Gnome races are fun, I have run a few. Rules typically include:<br />
Pok books, ports, Xlocs and Nexus spires are all off limits.<br />
The only gear allowed is what the toon starts with.<br />
Any other buffs you can beg are allowed. (sow, etc)<br />
Also include check points NK/EK bridge works well.<br />
<br />
Races can be scheduled for RL locations with the top 1 or 2 moving to the finals, scheduled on a weekend. <br />
<br />
First 5 to finish in the finals get a prize. <br />
<br />
For added fun only let them cross Kith at night. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I do like the idea of a Shaman Summit. We could actually talk about some of these issues, with out the lag of posting. <br />
<br />
And at the same time we could do a Scavanger hunt for the raffle.<br />
First 5 to collect say<br />
5 bone chips<br />
5 rat ears<br />
5 snake fangs<br />
 the items would need to be gatherable by a level one toon. and the actual list not announced till all are present.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Daslowah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">I think the race can be a bad idea, what about people with Dial up.  No chance a dial up could race a DSL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Iscariot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">amazing, think of it this way, this is a game we PAY for not a free game, if this was diablo 2 i wouldn't care, but this is EQ, i payed many months ahead in advance.<br />
<br />
Then your issue is with SOE.  Feel free to take it there. <br />
<br />
i basically gave sony money to wine and dine her. and for her just to get smiled and nodded at, i seriously think henora would have spoken up and said something, even if henora had to be mean abut it just to get heads to turn.<br />
<br />
No, you &quot;basically&quot; gave Sony money to play a game.  What they do with that money once you pay it is none of your concern.  When you buy a car, do you go to the car company CEO's house and whine about how he spent the money you paid for the car with?  Does your job harrass you about paying you money and then you playing a game with it?   I doubt it.   You paid for a service, you received said service...a GAME.  If having payed in advance chaps your hide that much, do a chargeback on your credit card and be done with it.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I have only been playing Everquest a few months.  Yes, an actual NEWB.  We do exist still.   My main was a bard but I decided to try a shaman.   I find these boards invaluable.  And as a moderator of many message boards myself, I can tell you it is not an easy job...and quite thankless.  So why hassle her because she finally got a little recognition?<br />
She doesn't get paid to do this.  She does it because she enjoys it and wants to contribute.<br />
<br />
What do YOU contribute to the &quot;community&quot;?  Do you run a message board or a site?  If so, I would love a link.  What do you do to make the game better?  Please, enlighten us...because I would like to think you do more than whine and moan about your $12 a month and how Sony screws you.   Simple solution: Walk away.  Don't pay anymore, don't play anymore.  But don't hassle those that do.<br />
<br />
Hell, I am to the point that if you send me your address, I will send you $12 just to shut up and go away.  I come here to learn about my chosen class and to read posts from those that have more experience with it than me.  <br />
<br />
And Glo?  Good job...and sorry my first post on the boards is so negative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Gloriana,<br />
<br />
I think it's great of you to raffle these items off, and I also think a condition of entry should be that the winners are willing to stump up the shipping costs. <br />
<br />
It's okay, I already planned to pick up the shipping! Luckily, nothing is very big or heavy.<br />
<br />
Glor would raffling your OoW cd key be a breach of the EULA?<br />
<br />
Well heck, I don't know. It's just a number on a piece of paper! I will double check, thanks for the heads up.<br />
<br />
If you do decide to do an in-game raffle, would you entertain the thought of making it a 'Shaman Summit Day&quot;. Pick a server, pick a lag-free zone, Qeynos Hills comes to mind, and start level 1 shaman.<br />
<br />
That's the plan! I think I'll start a poll that will let people vote where they want to meet up. I don't want to talk about any serious issues or anything, this is JUST FOR FUN.<br />
<br />
Why dont you charge a dollar for each ticket for the raffle and put the money made towards hosting the site ?<br />
<br />
Don't I wish! The Crucible (along with the Ranger's Glade) had actually made every donation drive when Sunmoon decided to accept IGE sponsorship. I won't re-open THOSE wounds, but proving that people can/will pay for the site won't accomplish anything.<br />
<br />
And at the same time we could do a Scavanger hunt for the raffle.<br />
<br />
If we do any sort of race/scavenger hunt, it will be JUST FOR FUN. I want to be really fair and not penalize anyone that can't attend due to real life concerns, or maybe because it's in the middle of the night for them. You won't have to be present to win!<br />
<br />
Thanks for everyone's suggestions, I have a plan :) I just need to confirm a couple of things before I put up the &quot;official&quot; thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Kurth,<br />
You gave SOE money, so you could play the darn game, what SOE does with the money isn't an issue.<br />
While I agree that going to a baseball game was a little silly, that's SOE's fault, not Gloriana's.  What was she supposed to do, sit in an empty room talking about gamming issues to....NO ONE???</div></div><hr />

Bonestomper, look at your post where you posted that quote... if you look at the post, you have where your name is with info there like post date, board title... Then you have the msg in the middle with signature at the bottom and profile/pm/etc below that. In the upper right corner of the actual post is a little bit of text saying 'Post #79'<br />
That 79 therefore would be your entry into the raffle</div></div><hr />

Fuudce, thats why Haleice said the winners should pay the postage. He's in the UK too, same as us.<br />
<br />
Personally should I be lucky enough to win, I would be sending the postage to Gloriana</div></div><hr />
