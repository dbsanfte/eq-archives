<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ardvaark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure this has been posted before but I'm new here and was wondering how this pet is. I've read alot of posts saying that he is level 36 and others saying he is 40+. Does anyone have some good info on this pet. I'm am only level 51 and was kinda looking forward to getting a better pet for downtime soloing.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's level 40. It used to range between 37 and 40, but a while back there was a change for all pet classes that meant you always summoned the highest possible pet.<br />
<br />
It's slightly disappointing that it's already light blue the level you get it, but it is still an improvement over the 49 one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ardvaark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you. I guess oatmeal is better than nomeal :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Check out the FAQ thread, towards bottom o' thread are some links to that info.<br />
<br />
Our 55 pet tops out at level 40.</div></div><hr />
