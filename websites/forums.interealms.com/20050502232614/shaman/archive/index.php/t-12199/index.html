<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Irontree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry for taking up any bandwith, try to get the word out, as our community has had no working forums for 3 or 4 weeks.<br />
<br />
The EQ Beastlord community is temporarily reverting to its old tried and true location of http://pub140.ezboard.com/beqbeastlord as its new phpBB community has been down for almost a month and community leaders have lost contact with the owner.<br />
<br />
This move is probably temporary, but having no community for almost a month has orphaned Beastlords, and we want to get the community back together somewhat.<br />
<br />
The new (old) site currently is not ezboard gold, as it had been abandonded, so bear with popups until we determine what to do.<br />
<br />
We hope to get people back there to get a discussion going about how to proceed going forward.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
