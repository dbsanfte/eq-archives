<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I logged on a friends inactive account, and made a rogue, and it got me to thinking about powerlevelling. The first thing I did was look up boxing characters. I went to http://www.eqwindows.com and downloaded it. This works best with graphic intensive options turned off. EQW allows for quick switching between windows.<br />
<br />
Secondly, and I didn't even realize it when I began, get ornate legs. The mana free root is invaluable which I will get to shortly.<br />
<br />
Quick overview of where I leveled:<br />
1-3: West Freeport<br />
4-22: Paludal Caverns<br />
23-28: Sol A Goblins<br />
29-36: Sol A Gnomes<br />
36-40: City of Mist<br />
<br />
I basically wanted to go as fast as possible, so on trivial mobs (trivial to the shaman) I pulled with the level 1 fire nuke. The fact you are 65 allows for easy singles usually. Every camp I did I found a nice corner to pull to. As soon as the mob got there I clicked the ornate legs root on it. Using root proximity aggro rules, basically closest person has aggro, I had my rogue attacking and backstabing while my shaman tanked. This method worked at every camp as I leveled. One thing to note, pull with slow once the mobs become tougher.<br />
<br />
Its been 16.5 hours according to /play and my rogue is level 40 with all offensive skills close to cap. I headed to HHK to do nobles, but my shaman client crashed and could not log back on. I hope the root proximity thing helps. If you want to use this technique on a caster, pick up a dps melee and offer free PL. This will make things go way faster for the caster.<br />
<br />
I will try to post a follow up once the rogue hits planes level. Only been doing this for 3 days and am new to both boxing and powerleveling. If you want to ask a question cross server me. ;t stromm.rtugok<br />
<br />
Good luck and level fast!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its interesting that you picked a rogue. I too just started a a rogue twink.  I wanted a player with the absolute least responsibilities in a group.  Sure, I might have to drag a corpse occasionally, but no buffing, no healing, no FA FA FA FA, canni canni canni, haste haste haste..<br />
<br />
Shaman=handcramp hehe.<br />
<br />
Glad you posted those locations.  I had almost forgotten about Sol A.  Just finished Paludal, so I guess Sol is next.<br />
<br />
And yes, root aggro is the only way to go.  I also found that cripple seems to help quite a bit at the low levels.  Really helps the rogue hit those mobs easier.  <br />
<br />
I like keeping him on auto follow, so I just backup after crippling or slowing, and he's right behind the mob, ready to backstab.<br />
<br />
Seems like something had changed though.  I used to be able to finish the mob with my jbb when it was less than half life.. but now, touching the mob at all means the twink gets zero experience.  Has basically cut powerleveling in half.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, wish I had enough cash for the root legs.  But honestly, I never seem to be short on mana using slow, cripple, and the 3min root.  I regen for more than the mobs hit me atm.. which might change as he gets higher.  But for now, I never need to torpor unless I canniV.</div></div><hr />

If 263 dmg is greater than 50% of the mobs hp's, whether it lands for full damage or not you get the KS...<br />

as I understand it...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why not just make some DS potions, drink them and pull a train and root them all?  The toon being PLed needs only to hit each mob one time while they murder themselves on the DS.  Sit a lot to get hit and throw a HoT on yourself to heal the damage you'll take.  If the &quot;PL&quot;ee gets aggro you can heal him and reaggro the mob.<br />
<br />
I have a few places I like to PL other than those you mentioned, but I'll keep them to myself for now because they're always empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyone tried Nurga for PLing at around 35-40?  What kind of results did you get?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Never use HoT's as your main form of healing when doing powerleveling through reverse ds, stick to direct heals and you wont have to worry about losing aggro or having to root mobs.<br />
<br />
If you want to use rds then I can recommend the beach in Gunthak, it nicely bridges the gap between Sol A and lvl 46.<br />
<br />
For the more traditional shaman plvling we have poachers in Jaggedpine, they hit fairly hard and fast for their level but have very little hp and the respawn is hideously fast.<br />
<br />
Nurga is also a nice place for this, but be aware that it was upgraded a while back so they are quite a bit meaner then they used to be. Jumping down the waterfall near the entrance will put you where the goblin are lowest level (green to 65) and moving through the mines will put you up against tougher and tougher gobbos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As my main is a rogue I feel that I should offer you a little advice on PLing one. Do not neglect his defence skill. Having maxed out defence is as vital as it is on a shaman. Evade fails frequently (40% failure rate) and it can be quite easy to steal aggro so if your defense is bad you will get nailed and nailed fast. Plus if someonme flipflops a mob round you will get eaten alive by ripostes.<br />
<br />
Spend some time each few levels at least tanking and maxing out defence or your rogue will be a liability not an asset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If 263 dmg is greater than 50% of the mobs hp's, whether it lands for full damage or not you get the KS...<br />
<br />
as I understand it...<br />
-Monjay<br />
<br />
Seems to me that's correct.  Having a ranger helping my paladin, if the ranger got a decent sized crit on a bowshot to finish a mob under 50%, I would not get experience.  Only happened on the larger crits so I assume it read either ranger's damage &gt; my damage or ranger's damage &gt; 50% of mob_HP and did not award experience to me.  Eventually she just stopped shooting. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not sure if this has been posted elsewhere, but I generally allow the person I am levelling to take the mob down to 49%(tanking, casting, whatever) and then send in dog to help finish him off...that way you don't 'overnuke', and buffed up pet with weapons will tear it down quick.<br />
<br />
This will not work with DS potions though in my experience, as the PL'ee has not done 51% of the damage.  If I am using DS potions, just pull a couple, root them on PL'ee, and keep him healed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't forget HHK basement raider/warrior room for PLing.  I run a warrior from 25 to 32 (raiders turn blue at 33) in 4 h down there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If 263 dmg is greater than 50% of the mobs hp's, whether it lands for full damage or not you get the KS...<br />
<br />
This is true.  They changed the way kill assignment went just a little while back to where it is &quot;possible&quot; damage taken instead of actual damage.  If you fire off a 263 nuke, even when the mob is only at 1% health, it will KS the rogue, if that number was more than 50% of the mobs hps...  One thing I do not know, is if the rogue shaved off lets say 300 hps from the mob, and it's now at 1%, will your nuke still ks it.  The rogue has done more damage long term, but you did exceed the 50% mark...  My guess is the rogue would still get it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, another &quot;technique&quot; to powerleveling that I don't see mentioned often is Greeny killing.  As soon as your rogue is of level to group with your shaman, you can use this technique.  Group up with the rogue and go hunt things that are green to your shaman (but still blue to your rogue).  ALL of the exp from the kill will go to the rogue.  This way, you can plow through greenies and rack up the exp fast with the rogue.  It doesn't matter which one gets the kill, and you get to start practicing your reall duelboxing skills before the mobs are too much of a threat.<br />
<br />
Now granted this technique is alot better for a quad-kiting druid, or a necro (or a bard swarm kiting greenies  :p), but it still works, and if you find the right zones it works well.<br />
<br />
Usually this technique is mostly utilized in the lower levels (like 30ish) with a mid/high level melee as the PLer, as a 50 melee can whipe through those green cons fast...  but again, it still will do ok for your shammy =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Coragar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I know I could take him to the planes, but I've never found a really great spot with unlimited pulls in a safe spot, which is one of my powerleveling requirements.<br />
<br />
PoJ Jail - 15 regular mobs (punishers, enforcers and one Wraith of Retribution) all within easy reach. (More if you go thru the Jail doors) Lt. Blue or Dk Blue to 65. I have PLed Multiple characters thru here. Great exp. Safe as it can get. I have had 4 mobs on my shaman at once and with them slowed and Quiessence it is no problem. If you want the alt to have agro, then just use the slow, dog dog at 49% rule. If u want to have agro use the slow, Poison Dot. Usually i will group my Shaman with the PL toon to grab an AA every once in a while.<br />
<br />
Another fantastic thing about this camp is the loot. Usually i walk with anywhere from 2-3k per couple hour PL session depending on the damn RNG. BD's, Raw and Reg Diamonds and vendor loot.<br />
<br />
Hardly anyone ever in there on my server. If so i just go to POI until they are done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Anyone tried Nurga for PLing at around 35-40?  What kind of results did you get?<br />
<br />
I skipped most of this thread but with my paladin, he has 14 hours /played and he's 39 with 3 LDoN adventures on him (so I pl'd the crap out of him).<br />
<br />
1-9:  SHadeweavers Thicket (kill aliens)<br />
10-20: Paludal Caverns(start in the 3 shroom camp, and kill shrooms/fiends, then move to shiknar by the named shroom)<br />
20-29: Warslik WOods(giant fort)/Frontier Mountains(Giant fort)<br />
29-39:  Nurga.  And still there.<br />
<br />
At 29, my frog paladin was getting 5-6% exp off the entrance mobs and I was pulling a good 10-14 of those before respawn started.  at 39 he's getting 2-3% exp at the exact same place and they are ranging from dark blue(often) up to red (mostly named and deeper in mobs).<br />
<br />
The other benefit of Nurga, is if you have plans to do the spirit wracked cord and so forth in Chardok and you are KOS there, you and your alt are both getting +CDok faction.  Although aftfer 10 levels my frog and I are still scowling..I have hope!! :D<br />
<br />
Another note:<br />
In nurga, I'd gank with slow, run to the tunnel, switch to pally, stun the inc, smack it with a bow while stunned, flip on atk and fire taunt right as it got near me and it'd never leave the pally.  Soon as it drops to about 35% life, I slap it with Spear of Torment, and go get another.  I was using velium strike at about 45%, but on occasion I'd crit VS and KS the alt.<br />
<br />
And..hopin this helps.</div></div><hr />

level 9 beastlords can get Harnessing, as you know but their warders can take Focus of Soul and Swift like the Wind and Virtue...easiest way to PL a Beastlord...let the pet tank but make sure the owner of the pet (or someone in the group) does at least 1 damage. Just an observation. <br />

DS is &quot;neutral&quot; damage - it doesn't get counted for either party's portion of the damage done.<br />
<br />
Take a mob with 1k HP.<br />
<br />
If twink does 501 HP damage, he gets the exp.  Pretty straightforward.<br />
If DS does 200 HP of damage, that leaves 800 for the exp factor.  The twink must do 401 HP of damage in this case.<br />
You could actually let the DS do 999 HP, as long as the twink does the remaining 1 point of damage and not you.<br />
<br />
51% of non-DS damage is the watermark.<br />
<br />
Also important to remember that when a spell is cast, it's the POTENTIAL damage of the spell damage used for calculations.<br />
<br />
So if a mob has 2k HP, shaman can do a sinle 925 nuke, and twink can do the remaining 1075 and get full HP.<br />
<br />
Combining this with DS, though:<br />
<br />
Mob = 2k HP<br />
DS = (say) 300 HP<br />
Remaining = 1700 HP<br />
if shaman nuke = 925<br />
then remaining damage = 775<br />
and twink gets no exp.<br />
Shaman could use 625 nuke and let twink do 1075 for exp.<br />
<br />
Just use caution when using both DS and damage spells, whether DOTS or nukes.  DOTS count the full POTENTIAL damage of the spell, whether or not it goes full term.</div></div><hr />
