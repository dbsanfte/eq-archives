dropped off a small named in Ferubi last night.  This is lame.  Is this a fluke, or happening to others as well?  <br />
<br />
Nice death emote there too... corpse weapon, anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is a good thing, in my opinion. Some of the rarer spells will become more available, and therefore making them cheaper. Plus a [greater]chance of getting spells while grouping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh common, these spells are much easier to get nowadays.  There is no reason they shouldnt be dropping Gates spells instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bleh. =/<br />
<br />
What's next...Giant Scalemail and Coldain Beards?  Sounds buggy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only problem that I see with allowing earlier expansion spells to occupy the loot tables of the Gates mobs is that it reduces the chances of getting a new spell.  If there is coding to allow gates AND luclin spells to drop from the same mob then I dont really have a problem with it.  If, however, there is a matrix set up with 30 Luclin spells and 2 Gates spells then I forsee a problem.  <br />
<br />
Jinheim (I think) posted about betting Cloak of the Akheva from a Gates zone; I see an unhappy trend starting here....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I may not have been clear in my original post.  I am not happy about getting KEI, I will edit to reflect that.   There are 100003894954958 copies of KEI in the bazaar, it isn't rare and it doesn't belong on a Gates mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The biggest problem with luclin spells taking up loot space that GoD spells should be occupying is that afaik GoD spells are still no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wasn't this the reason we had such a pain in the arse time getting ahold of Malo and Torpor, really?  Guilds had moved on past Kunark targets (VP especially) and they weren't dropping on stuff people still killed.*  <br />
<br />
If RGC and Lost Composition are dropping in GoD, that would be something I'd consider a good thing.  If it's only stuff like KEI and Khura's Focusing, that would kinda stink.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* OK, Harla Dar and Sontalak did.  I got my Torpor from Sontalak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya it is a little odd that spells from previous expansions are dropping off nameds. I spent some time wandering around natimbi trying to spawn nameds there, and see what tradeskill stuff drops. That archer guy (Kly something or the other) drops 50 something piece of armor (bracer, belt or sword) and also a spell usually. Most times it was 50ish beserker tomes, but it also dropped translocate and a mid 50s druid spell (I forget which one, it rotted), which kind or surprised me. I'm guessing that mobs at lower levels/difficulty drop level appropriate spells, and since there basically aren't many in the new expansion, the loot tables are filled up with fillers.<br />
<br />
It's also possible that the drop tables for these zones were designed before the spells were finalized, and they were filled with old spells as placeholders. They might have just forgot to update them prior to going live. If I were you, I'd /bug it just in case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do know you can buy RGC from Lost Dungeon adventure merchants, dont you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Would be easier to get it off a mob in GoD though, potentionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You do know you can buy RGC from Lost Dungeon adventure merchants, dont you?<br />
<br />
Yes, tho mine came from spell research.<br />
<br />
Doesn't stop people from paying fascinatingly large sums for it in the bazaar.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've gotten cloak of the akheva and decession (luclin era spells) so it definately isn't a one-time fluke.  I am hoping it is just a bug in the loot table and these spells are accidentily taking the place of Gates spells.  Having spectrals and runes drop wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing since people still need them, but luclin spells?  Come on =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This definetly sounds buggy imho.<br />
<br />
We've gotten very few reports of people actually getting spells.  We've only gotten a handful in my guild over the last week and we've been hitting Gates pretty hard.  <br />
<br />
Then again the design team may have made the conscious decision to actually make spells extremely rare.  I wouldn't put it past them.  The same guys who put wandering see invis mobs near quest mobs in Barundi could certainly do the same thing as make spells not drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I gotta agree, its hard enough to get spells in a new expansion without old expansions cluttering the the loot table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Rare spells isn't a bad idea, but makeing them no drop imo is.<br />
<br />
If the luclin spells are takeing up spell loot spots that just makes it that much worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, I understand the frustratoin of you lvl 65 folks if these spells are taking up the loot table of new spells, but if not...  I couldn't be happier.<br />
<br />
This is happening Widespread on my server, and old/rare spells are showing up in bazaar.  3 coppies of Primal essence was in the bazaar today, and teh price was at 5k.  I bought torpor, malo, ios, and pe for 23k total.  Being a younger shaman, and thinking I was never going to see these spells (especially since a new expansion makes less people go to those zones, and further reduces the supply end jacking up the prices more) I was pleasantly surprised that gates actually addressed one of my biggest concerns as a mid-level shaman ...  spell availability.<br />
<br />
Sorry for all those 65's if this is hurting your drop rate, and if we find out it is, I'll suck it up and /feedback and /bug right along with ya, but if not, I couldn't be happier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm with Litgruv (Did I just say that? *snicker*)<br />
<br />
The new spells are rare enough as it is.  Add too much junk to the loot table and these will turn into our Kunark spells all over again.  Sure, you can get them now...how many years later?<br />
<br />
I'd love to have the new spells now, but at this rate, it could be quite some time (If ever, for the new canni :-/  )<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">rep point++   4 zorash !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
/bonk :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm not too torn up yet. From what spell drop info I've seen on many class boards, the spell are dropping from the difficulty of encounters I had expected them to. Random named in the &quot;starter&quot; zones of the expansion might not have ever been considered to have GoD spells on their loot table. <br />
<br />
Now I haven't explored GoD extensively. If luclin spells are dropping off of GoD raid level content or 6 hour instanced flagging events on the level of LDoN hard adventures, then thats wrong.</div></div><hr />
