Thats how I did it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dang, I was going to suggest EF Mammoths. I took some soirees into Perma, too, and killed the occasional Icy Orc as a diversion.  I also spent 26-27 or so in Mistmoore, but that's occasionally bad in a PK sense as well.  Especially if you're deep in the dungeon and you start seeing high-level Evils enter the zone - means they're between you and the exit.  Unless you're a caster bound somewhere else, of course.<br />
<br />
Someone in my guild suggested DSP when I was 27 or so. Problem there is very little loot, although you can turn in four Zelniak Meats to someone in SS for exp and 4 plat, if you don't mind wrecking Katta faction.   But I then went back to EF and did a few more Mammoths, and I swear the exp was just as good, with easier kills and better loot than Zelniaks.<br />
<br />
Hollowshade Moor sounds interesting.  Marus Seru isn't bad, but again, very little loot except for various Greyhopper hides that you can sometimes sell.  But keep a tight rein on any hoppers that you fear - adds are very common and numerous.  And the Zelniaks there have a freakin' HUGE aggro range - they'll come at you from halfway across the zone.  And they're social, unlike the ones in DSP.<br />
<br />
I'm 30, debating where to go myself right now. So many choices. Still thinking about Stonebrunt, actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>baelang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It depends a lot on which team you play on.<br />
<br />
I think the good team has the better options, really.<br />
<br />
For the neutral team, and the brave among the goods, you have the gorge, and all of the karanas, especially south karana from level 20 to 30.  When that starts to bottom out you can move into paw for a nice ZEM. once you hit 32 or so you can move on to the more profitable zones in Vellious.<br />
<br />
of course, some people go from level 10 to 50 in just HHP/HHK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He's Good team, Baelang.  Never thought about it that way, however - that once you hit your 20s, Goods might have better zones than Neuts, interesting.<br />
<br />
I also now the problem with DSP - Lightcrawlers. If you're very good about resisting Flash of Light, or can fight while blinded, you'll be OK.   A blue /con Lightcrawler jumped me, however, and I died, even though I thought I was doing OK with using my keyboard to cast spells and kick, etc.  I was probably stunned back out of range or something, so kicks and melee weren't landing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Falwan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For grouping at around 32 or so, a great place is Tenebrous Mountains.  If you can get a group together, the xp in the grimling caves is awesome and so is the loot.  You can do this until around lvl 42.  For fear kiting in the 30s, I would do EF/Dsp for low 30s and then go to Jaggedpine and kill the basilisks there in the middle to upper 30s.  Shoot me a tell in game if you need some help/advice on anything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Won't need to, as this helps immensely. But I'll drop you a /tell if I see you online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Winker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i know this may sound like it sucks...but i think you should level in PC.. it builds character when you get pk'd and pick yourself up and level again..and where else are you going to find evens to pk in the same zone? plus it has to be the best xp in the game short of exploiting... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thnx for the advice guys, i did PC to 27 and then went to DSP.  i been doing red fearkite zelniaks getting up to 8-10% xp. its awsome there and not hard at all as long as u keep fear up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>sz_howlur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you have good gear, go solo in Unrest.  Stay on the second floor clearing, near the stairs.  Otherwise, you can stick to Mistmoore on the Faydwer.  Like other people have suggested, try some of the luclin zones.  You might be able to make it in Echo killing the mosquito thingies.  Keep your ds up and they kill themselves.  Not entirely sure how the pk environment is there.  I have also heard you can go into permafrost and lvl there around your 30's.  <br />
<br />
Other than those already mentioned, those are the only ones that come to mind.</div></div><hr />
