<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Currently... it'd be pretty hard to top what I have due to how we raid (HCC - Hard Core Crew for late night small raids, gets much lewt on top of normal raids).<br />
<br />
If I have some good luck with drops, I'll be at 250 innate within a couple items, on top of having crazy hp and other stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Negil Wintersfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Someone posted this to our guild website.  Could be a fun link to answer that very question.  Assuming everyone used accurate magelos.  <br />
<br />
I've not a reason in the world to doubt that Sean's gear's number one, but wouldn't it be fun to see the top 100 serverwide?  And how you stack?<br />
<br />
Anyway have fun !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lenas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best I've seen is Sean and Kraiven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lowi Bladeslinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sean are u going to stick with your currnt weapon combo or go for the ranger whip in offhand ? and are u going to replace legs 1st then shoulders/ earing ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll replace Legs and Shoulders when/if they drop I guess. As for Earrings and weapons, I think I'm going to wait for time on those slots...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">youre at 240 innate atm Sean or did I miscount ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm at 210 innate. Legs would put me at 240. Then Haste shoulders + Elemental Boots would put me at 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dimstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">haste shoulders from who by chance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thicket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Moss covered shoulders I am assuming are the ones Sean is talking about.  They drop from a named at the end of and event in poearth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Isen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Earring of solstice  is really hanging in there for the long haul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Korkrest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">nice site negil...doesnt appear to be working though, cant load my profile to it /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaggezin Bloodsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shoulders from peregrin rockskull in earth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Paluwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Doubt you're going to find one ranger with overall top stats in all areas. Depends on what you go for i guess &amp; what you judge based on if you're looking for a &quot;top&quot; ranger it doesn't exist.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rathaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That list posted by Negil isn't entirely accurate, at least as far as TT is concerned...I see no one at all from the top 6 guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ruparin01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pardon the ignorance, but innate what?<br />
<br />
Atk?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Alexzander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Attack. It is that Stat under AC. It helps you hurt things. Some items have inate attack. The cap for such items is 250 raw attack. You are now in the loop, continue rangering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>UsuRpeR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That is some amazing gear Sean. I'm drooling all over my keyboard   I'd love to see a screen of your ranger, have any shots up of what you look like in game with all that cool gear?:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samoht_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Woot!<br />
<br />
Two of top five are on BB.<br />
Cant believe I used to heal Thicket's butt when he was leveling up in EC/WC in his teens and I was running by about level 30 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cujoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hehe it's not too surprising we have 2 Rangers high up there on list we have 3 guilds that used to be pretty neck and neck, and our Server is REALLY populated. Good to see Thick and Rim sticking in there especially on such a competitive server =)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah another thing that helps these guys a ton is our server crashes so much you can get the same 7 day spawn 9 times a month, hehe not completely true but close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nitewhisper65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There LOTS of rangers who don't post here so... heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Negil Wintersfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">yeah, that list is only a DB sort of the folks that go to the site and plug in their gear, surely doesn't represent all the rangers out there, just thought it was kinda fun.<br />
<br />
Not my work ,or site by the way, but really kinda fun to see some of the folks you post with and chat with from diff servers and how they stack up!<br />
<br />
=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tuvan Truearrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Or in my case, how we don't.<br />
<br />
Time to get back to work and start upgrading....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tarmaniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm surprised Sean is still dual wielding. Warder's Ornate Broadsword/Sword of Ssra/Bloodied Berserker Blade outdamage AHB/Render by a fair margin, and the Stone Etched Warsword leaves AHB/Render in the dust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sadbast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">mine didnt show up :O<br />
<br />
Not that it's that special or anything :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Paluwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think he means how do you figure your &quot;innate&quot; attack -vs- naked attack, not what is attack.<br />
<br />
Paluwen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">hehe sean is pretty tuff to beat statwise :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kinidyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm surprised Sean is still dual wielding.

<br />
These items have a greater utility factor for a large raid setting than any of the weapons you mentioned.  Taps are the bestest, 2 of em are even better.  DPS is our ultimate goal, but, there are a fair amount of PoP encounters where lifetaps help supplement a high regen rate to the point where you become low maintenance from a healing standpoint.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Harijan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I had a question on some of Sean's gear.  I notice that many items have vengence line and aura of battle line. <br />
I assume these effects stack since he is wearing them on multiple items.  What exactly does Aura of battle and Vengence do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Azarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">vengeance is +atk its 5 for every level, so vengeanceIV would be 30 atk without modifiers.<br />
<br />
aura of battle is 10 atk 2 regen, there are other aura affects that range from 15 atk 1 regen to 50 atk 5 regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Elindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The Aura line is hp regen and ATK.  <br />
<br />
Courage is 1/5<br />
Battle is 2/10<br />
Daring is 2/20<br />
Bravery is 3/30<br />
Valor is 4/40<br />
Resolution is 5/50<br />
<br />
Vengeance is 5atk, so vengeance X is 50atk.<br />
<br />
And 2hdrs are just un rangerly, even if I do lug 3 of them around :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Hopefully I won't be dual-weilding for long, I'll get a Stone Etched soon enough. I really hope there are dual-weild weapons in PoTime that are equal in DPS to the 2 handers, but I really don't see it happening.<br />
<br />
As many have quoted Furor: &quot;Dual weild is dead&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Lendien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">here's mine!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Maegwin Darkenwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I'm hoping for a Stone Etched too...those things own.</div></div><hr />
