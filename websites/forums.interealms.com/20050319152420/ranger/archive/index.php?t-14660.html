Pity the damage bonus'll be smaller with that delay; though if I were in a position to use it likely I would be.</div></div><hr />

I picked one up a few weeks ago.  It's a fun toy.  I had like 12 skill in 2hb (yeah yeah, I'm a slacker) and it went up like mad.  I need to cap my skill before I parse it. <br />
<br />
I can post a pic of it when I get home.  It does have a cool graphic.</div></div><hr />

Add tripple attack, and I won't regret giving up swiftwind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What an incredibly strange weapon.  A fast-hitting 2HB that has frankly mediochre stats and no proc.  It would be a dream for training 2HB and might even be a decent choice for damage but I somehow doubt it.<br />
<br />
The Greatstaff of the Four Winds (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17278)  is much more fun, all the more so for being Rogue usable when we have no 2HB skill at all ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm pretty sure even dual wielding lamentations will outdamage this .... i'd love to see the look tho :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The nerf they added to specificly hit the silver swiftblade was aimed at any 2-hander under delay 27 or so?  I don't recall the details on the threshold of the nerf, but I think it was 27.  I am quite confident that a Woodsman's Staff is a better weapon than this, shame that the damage bonus does not show in the screenshot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Force? How about giving you the option to? Previously there were only a few 2H you could use that would compare to DW or archery, and they were all sought after by other classes.<br />
<br />
 As for Great Staff. I did some quick parsing with it. To compare it to my 2HS(53/45) and 1H(16/20 + 13/20).<br />
<br />
2HS: 78.75 dps<br />
1HS: 83.50<br />
Great Staff: 97.73<br />
<br />
 Ferocity 1. All fights with same buffs. Grim Aura, Avatar, 61% haste(Eyepatch + GoD's). From front. Not real large sample sets though. But the gap is big enough to convince me to use the staff when not tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mantha Roo</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the damage bonus on it?<br />
<br />
The fast 2h'ers I've seen for Paladins and SKs have a 1h damage bonus, so in effect, they'd be considered a great-ration 1h weapon ...</div></div><hr />
