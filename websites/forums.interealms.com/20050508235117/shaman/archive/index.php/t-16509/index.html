Ok... some of you may have heard from me in the past, some not.<br />
<br />
I am one of those beta players that played hardcore to 50 quit....<br />
<br />
Came back....quit....<br />
<br />
Came back... and JUST HIT 60 with my first char....<br />
<br />
I just thought I would say....yes the old days were tougher... but the new days are more fun...<br />
<br />
This is now my 3rd shaman... (Original post name though)<br />
<br />
I am a super casual gamer and I MADE IT.... I know.. I know... 5 more to go... but hey....even a casual gamer can make the 60's now....<br />
<br />
Actually I forgot to post and in the week of slow play I hit 61. (You know its bad when you hit 61 faster than your I hit 60 post happens...<br />
<br />
Anyway... it was a goal of mine that I can put in the books... and after soooooooo long... the game is still appealing which I feel is quite the miracle.</div></div><hr />

congratulations Oracle.<br />
<br />
I'm still shaking my head at level 53 (about 14 days played so far), when it took me approx 6 months of steady play from beta to get a rogue to 40. I find eq to be heaps of fun no doubt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can relate to what your saying quite a bit my friend...got in at the end of beta and I am still playing to this day albeit real casually....In all my years of EQ I've never been in a hurry to get to any certain place :)<br />
<br />
I notice your name when ever you post because Conan the Barbarian is one of my favorite movies...assuming thats where the name is taken from....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Evel, yes... its my favorite as well.... I have Subotia the Thief and Rexxor the Warrior, my current toon is Phorgrim which is the actual name that is spoken before the tree or woe...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its not a race,  it's not even a marathon.  EQ is more like a stroll in the park.  Enjoy the journey,  not the end result.</div></div><hr />

 I completely agree, I played since release, casual guild, never even made 60 and quit, twice. Game now really is a hell of alot more fun, places to go that aren't camped to hell, bazaar, exp group bonus, etc, is god stuff.<br />
<br />
Made 62.5 so far with my Enchanter, was gonna play a shaman but our group fo friends already has a badass mo fo 65 shaman, and no chanty.<br />
<br />
Fun stuff.<br />

I wish more people would see this point.  I can't even tell you how many people have come up to me with the whole &quot;why's it taking you so long to get to 65?  I have 3 65 toons aleady and this will be my 4th&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Way too many people think that the game is a race to the mythical town of Uberville and can't understand why others want to take their time or, gasp, have a life outside of EQ.<br />
<br />
So the next time someone comes up to me and says &quot;You're not 65 yet? Yeesh, I levelled my necro to 65 then made a shaman and got him to 65 because I was so bored&quot;, I'll just look over at my two kids, smile, and be happy that I spend more time reading to and playing with my girls than racing to get as many toons to 65 as possible.<br />
<br />
Just my $.02 though...<br />
<br />

IMO its just the competitive nature in people.......<br />
<br />
In every sport, hobbey, ect. most of those who are involved are going to want to believe the are the 'best' and have the most expensive flashy equipment.  In the end dose it really matter?  To people like me and you(apparently) no, but to them very much so.....<br />
<br />
EQ is no different I think in this regard I think.<br />
<br />
There are really two different styles of players...well three maybe....The casual-fun-chatting-easy-going-player, the hardcore-elite-stat-gear-player, then I guess there may even be roleplayers hiding here and there ;)<br />
<br />
Dont mean to hijack your thread Fulgrim and congrats on 60 btw :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey Fulgrim, did you play on Karana with Rexxor?  I remember a warrior in the guild I was in (Validus) that had that name.  I used to play Axlon (a Monk), but have done the same path as you.  Playing a Shaman on Ayonae Ro now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yup... Rexxor is mine.... On Karana... My roomate took him over long ago... well before I leveled to high.... He is still playing him every now and again... but mostly plays his necro... Thanatos...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grats on 60eerrr 61. <br />
<br />
 Its funny i have 3 65's and almost a 4th but i dont ask other people whats taking them so long. I tell people i liked to sometimes exp really fast. Like putting a buch of exp on at one time so i can do other stuff like quests, but than my aa points arent nearly as fast. Had to convince my wife as she is playing she doesnt need to catch up to me tomorrow just enjoy playing else your going to be lvl 65 and not like eq. Not much point to that.</div></div><hr />
