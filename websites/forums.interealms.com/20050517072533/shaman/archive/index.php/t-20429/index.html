<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in a shaman heavy guild. Leader is a shaman, roster is packed full of shamans there are a few 65 shaman bots too. <br />
<br />
I'm the new shaman on the block. I just got 65 about a month ago. Working on AA's slow but steady have canni 5. I want to get MGB but this is how current raids go in my guild.<br />
<br />
My guild can be described as a VT/Pre-elemental guild. We raid allot and are pretty well organized. <br />
<br />
I can be described as a total noob who is from the kunark days but left to daoc for 2 years ago I did the ebay thing. I said I would never come back to eq.(I lied to myself hehe) When I  came back and was PLed back to my former glory and beyond by his EQ obsessed multiple 65 character having cousin. Kind of a unique situation.  Sometimes I still feel like im just visiting and am gonna log out of  and log in to DAoC. I am here to stay though.<br />
<br />
The PVE raiding strategy thing is all new to me...<br />
<br />
And since im the new guy the older shamans delegate what my role is. Which is fine since im so new to raiding i just sit back observe and learn.<br />
They make us join a shaman channel. The shamans with seniority say what buffs to cast.<br />
<br />
this is how it goes:<br />
<br />
Myguildshamancg1&gt; Oldershaman_01 says: Ok guys time to MGB DOODZ I GOT FO7!<br />
<br />
Myguildshamanshamancg1&gt;Oldershaman_02 says: OK I got BOAR!1111<br />
<br />
Myguildshamanshamancg1&gt; Oldershaman_03 I got teh Dikehos11!<br />
<br />
Oldershaman_01 tells you: d00d you got MGB? Do Agi!!!11<br />
<br />
/tell oldershaman no i dont have mgb but i can do agi I guess.<br />
<br />
/me alt-r click tgb buff agi<br />
<br />
Oldershaman_01 tells you ok<br />
<br />
I dont know if I am being clear enough but here is my question. Is it really worth 9 aa points at this early stage in my rading career for MGB. So I can do Agi ? Is my mgb agi going to make or break a raid? I just fail to see the importance of this. Now I can imagine if on occasion I am the only shaman at the raid. But I have yet to see this. I truely doubt I ever will.<br />
<br />
Any advice I can get on this would be great. thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ND3 First<br />
QB2<br />
RC3<br />
MGB in here somewhere.. <br />
Then defensives (LR5/ID5 and prereqs)<br />
Then Virulent Paralysis<br />
then healing<br />
then crit nukes<br />
<br />
Although on paper you might not need to really MGB, once you guys start learning new encounters like RZ, Mithaniael Marr, TT, Saryrn etc, you're going to start wiping a lot and you'll want to be able to MGB Focus.  But get ND3, QB2, and RC3 before MGB.<br />
<br />
Stamina is TGBable.. and if you have shaman buffing agility, diaku, and acumen on raids, you need to find another guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We can do all those targets minus RZ. We still have trouble with him. But yes the other shamans do MGB Boar,diaku and agi I regularly get asked by them to mgb Agi too. Even though I already have told them I dont have mgb.<br />
<br />
One thing that bugs me about EQ now since I have been playing again is.<br />
<br />
I think allot of the level 65 characters automatically assume everyone has been playing eq for 4 years with 80+ days played and 100+ aa's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would suggest the following:<br />
<br />
1) get MGB <br />
<br />
As Haagen said, raids often wipe and no matter how many shman with MGB you have it will always be handy to have one more.<br />
<br />
2) say no to agi<br />
<br />
Its useless.  If I were to MGB this spell, my entire guild (except one guy) would laugh at me, ask me never to cast it again, and possibly curse me for wasting a buff-slot that could be better used by almost any other buff.<br />
<br />
3) say no to diaku<br />
<br />
Same as above.<br />
<br />
There are other AA's that are arguably more important than MGB (canni5, some others) but if your guild raids alot then MGB will make you an asset instead of a liability.  There is more to MGB than focus and sta, though.  You can also MGB talisman of the tribunal (very useful in some encounters) and various junk buffs (also useful in some encounters).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">there is no need for any shaman buffs beyond fo7th and sta in a raid, daiku is garbage, agi is even worse, I get pissed when the new shaman casts that crap after I told him not to, why? because now there are 8 melees who need random buffs that they missed because they didnt notice agi hogging a slot. 2 clerics and 4 int casters are pissed because they missed voq/pot9/sd for diaku/agi.<br />
<br />
forget mgb til you have the stuff that counts.<br />
in my book aa's worth getting first and fast are those that help you exp the fastest.<br />
VP will help you solo in ways you never imagined,<br />
scr and scrm are very expensive but that 2k+ Q makes soloing cake and adds a ton when I group.<br />
RC and Dogs of Zerg have limited pve use but I have found both we worth while in tactics. RC for cureing random crap from casters and the Zerglings for eating ht's for me. <br />
you have canV so my guess is you have run/regen3 and mc3 already.<br />
all of those help you gain exp faster, if you group alot or primarily then the healing aa's would be a path to take. <br />
ND is nice but not all that depending on your play style/gear. <br />
get the aa's that will help you get exp faster. forget everything else. once you pin those down get crap like mgb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If all of your other shamans (who have MGB) are active, you can probably get other things first. If not, though, you will find yourself having to pass around Fo7 to an entire raid. MGB will definitely speed that process up. Honestly, I only find myself using MGB for Fo7 and ToT. I avoid MGBing ToT but sometimes I do just to save time. Any spell I can cast 10+ times without having to stop to canni isn't high on my MGB list, but passing Fo7 around to an entire raid is time-consuming. If you won't be in that situation, you're definitely justified in getting some other AA's that are more useful for your playstyle. :)</div></div><hr />

heh..I'm such a slacker. Almost 5 years, 273 days played, but only 63 AA.</div></div><hr />

hehe, well quit logging in and going afk for hours and hours :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you use your shaman as your vendor bot or something? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No, I'm just not hardcore about progression. I did that before Kunark - leveled to 50 faster than all my friends, went to the planes to get my armor, and then sat around bored until Kunark came out. I dont want to 'win' the game anymore, I just play to have fun.<br />
<br />
My 59 warrior has probably a tenth of my play time, but he's also the character I would use for trader mode usually. Him or my 50 ranger blacksmith. <br />
<br />
EDIT: Slight exaggeration there, my warrior probably has more than 27 days played, but it's no where close to 100 even. Even the ranger, who is only my blacksmith now has something like 30 days played, but he was created in Feb 2000. Warrior is only a little over a year old, I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I was just joking around. <br />
<br />
<br />
Had I stuck it out with my first shaman, I would probably be in the same boat as you. Im just trying to catch up to the level my friends and family are now since i have been gone for so long.<br />
<br />
its all new to me again, sorta..<br />
<br />
all the new content is. The old content I still know like the back of my hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">your in a guild. as part of a team its really your obligation to get MGB and RC ASAP just FYI.<br />
<br />
Doing AGI will not make or break a raid , but having a back up MGB for when the whipes can.  Oh and also, doing MGB agi is very useless, even if you have MGB you should always agi by group and if possible Boar and Diaku.  Always think ahead and try to reason out wether yout hink you will need a MGB for a wipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You could do what I do, though it's kind of silly and I don't really recommend it.  Just bank the 9aa points and sort of think of them as earmarked for MGB, but don't actually train it until you get to the point where someone actually needs you to MGB something important.<br />
<br />
That way, if you're doing something else and something like VP or RC would come in handy, you can instantly train them and use them out of your &quot;mgb&quot; points, then just replenish the MBG points.<br />
<br />
I'm in a similar situation to you, where other more senior guild shamans or bots tend to take care of the MBGs, so that's what I did.  I currently have about 14 aa points banked and will probably just spend down to 9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The old content I still know like the back of my hand.<br />
<br />
Yep, I pretty much know my way around any zone that I've been to, and I at least know how to find the entrance to zones that I've never been to. It always bugs me when people dont know where someplace is, or cant get there without dying, or dont know which port/tome/magus takes you closest to your destination. Most of the time I can run there faster than they can all find the druid or wizard who is offering ports there, especially with the tomes. Just boggles my mind.<br />
<br />
Heh, I even upset one of my guildies when I was talking in guildchat one night and told them that I had /feedbacked making Plane of Knowledge level restricted to 46 and higher (like every other plane).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">IF you solo or ever have to CC in LDoN`s i would suggest at least lvl 1 in VP &amp; RC</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really pissed off a lot of folks in my old guild when I said that I could run to Western Wastes from PoK before they could get there through porting if they had to hail a port which wasn't prearranged (since I learned about the PoM entry).<br />
<br />
However, I was right, and only two peeps took me up on my offer to teach them the route. They would mostly prefer to sit in Nexus and wait for a guild porter to give them a ride and SoE in CS than be self-sufficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">your in a guild. as part of a team its really your obligation to get MGB and RC ASAP just FYI.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lit your totally right about keeping the needs of the guild in mind when getting AAs, but I hardly see MGB as an 'obligation'.<br />
<br />
Spending 9 AAs so you can MGB *Wrulan* is just silly.  Spend those points on Radiant Cure (RC1 at least).  Then I suggest Healing AAs or Nuke AAs or SOMETHING that will make you more useful on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My guild seems to be getting more and more shaman every month. We regularly have 4 shaman on every raid, and we go up to 10. Doesn't matter how many shaman there are, 1 of us always does MGB fo7, another always does MGB sta, and everyone else saves their mgb till it's needed(wipe or need MGB resist or somethin)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">How about MGB Focus after a wipe, when the others' MGB is still down - like Lit said?<br />
<br />
We always keep at least one Shaman with MGB in reserve - two if possible, for a quick focus/boar and head back in. By the third wipe, the first set of MGB is back up. :)<br />
<br />
However, I agree: I am in a shaman heavy guild. Leader is a shaman, roster is packed full of shamans there are a few 65 shaman bots too. - in this case, MGB is less of a priority than RC, and I'd say even SCM3 for the mana savings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Also you can mgb f07 in a pinch for a quick heal!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Get MGB.  As you start the RZtW script, and (hopefully) the elemental  mobs soon, you're going to face timed scripts, and wipe as you learn.  Having a MGB in reserve to rebuff can be vital.<br />
<br />
That, and Hannd may be too busy giving Talvor another Fish Shot to MGB anything ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: Wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't add that spam = teh debil ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's all about those shining glorious moments, isn't it?  Here's where MGB paid for itself for me.<br />
<br />
Raid near-wiped, down to the last group.  I'm among the first rezzed, and begin my mana recovery process.  Most everyone's rezzed, half naked, and have no mana (much less hps) when someone trains, or wanderers add by and chain aggro - whatever.  In spite of being the worst-equipped noob shaman in the guild - due to blind effin luck - I'm the only one with enough mana to squirt out a MGB Fo7.  <br />
<br />
On a 30 person raid?  I just fired off 16000+ hps at my friends.  No other aa will allow you to do that in an emergency.  Usually, it's a minor convenience - but sometimes, you just have to get the buffs done that fast.</div></div><hr />
