<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The elementals in nadox.  I tried one at 44 and died because I didn't reslow it.  So, I carted my tail back to Dulak's for a bit to get Stoicism and a little easier xp.  Came back at 45 and OMG, I get at least 3% per kill here, and sometimes 4%.  If you have stoicism, you don't need any other buffs other than your own to do this camp.  I do have to Reslow them once, but it's no biggie.  They won't run when low on health.  The only negative here is there aren't enough to kill.  I can kill all the spawns and still have 8 minutes or so to wait.  Usually, I zone out, kill the PH in gunthak on the right side (troll guard) or kill the named that can pop there.  Then come back in and start again.  Hands down the best spot per kill I've found at this level.   GL!<br />
<br />
P.S.  Upon death, any of the elementals can spawn a named elemental that is level 51, so beware.  I think I could take him, but have only seen him when scouting with my druid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Absurdum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After dinging 44 in Gunthak and getting Stocism, I immediately hopped my froggie butt over to Nadox to check this camp out, and it is awesome. I highly recommend that you get buffed up before going in though. My usual buff set is KEI, a shammy Focus, and PotG/9 (Aego/Virtue if no druids available for PotG/9). I prefer the PotG/9 buffs because they give added mana regen which is always nice.<br />
<br />
There are 3 summoned creatures at zone in; usually two &quot;a scorned element&quot; and one &quot;an abhorrent element.&quot; The scorned can be level 44-45 while the abhorrent is level 43-44. Like most mobs in LoY zones, they are all undercons. Also, they are all warrior mobs so you don't have to worry about spells being cast on you. Max hit I saw froim these guys is 111.<br />
<br />
Each kill of the scorned nets me 3-4% xp every time while the abhorrent gives 2-3% (overall average is 3% per kill). I am now level 46 so this may start changing after I ding 47. If it does I will post an update here. The nice thing about this spot is that you are right at the zone line. Two drawbacks are that you must be careful and not zone yourself while running around fighting, and you will get the occasional train from peeps that use the lava river to leave Nadox.<br />
<br />
The respawn on the three mobs is 20 minutes and they are all single pulls if you start with the closest scorned to zone in, then the abhorrent in the back right, then the scorned at back left. I have never tried pulling them in any other order so can't say if they are always single pulls.<br />
<br />
They have a lot of HP but are not very resistant to slow, poison dots, incapacitate, or instill. I am fortunate to have a Soulstripper so I just pull with slow, then Venom of Snake, and incapacitate. Then I jump into the mix with dogdog and melee away. Self buffed (Fury included) my DEX is around 213 so Soulstripper procs fairly often and that 75HP life tap helps a lot. If I have a bad fight I just root, back off, and Stoicism/Canni but mana isn't as big an issue as HP with these guys. Of course results will vary from person to person due to differing stats so just modify your tactics to suit yourself.<br />
<br />
I usually re-slow when the mob is at 30% and will cast VoS about 3 times per fight. If you wanted you could cycle in other dots, but I just use VoS because my gem slots are full with spells that will be needed for the named mob that is a corpse spawn off the scorned elements.<br />
<br />
This guy is called &quot;a Lava Etched Doombringer&quot; and is a tough SoB. He conned yellow to me at 46 so he is level 47-48. He regens like mad, hits fast and hard (max I saw was 121; but a few fast rounds of double 121 will eat you up quick) and since he is a corpse spawn, you have to deal with him immediately following a fight, so your health and mana resources are already depleted.<br />
<br />
My first encounter with him (I was at around 50% health and mana when he spawned) resulted in the death of two pets and me being forced to zone with 131HP and 2% mana. I had him down to 13% health and when I zoned back in to finish him off after a mad Stoic/Canni session in Gunthak, he was already back to around 65% health. I never had a chance to get another pet up because instill wouldn't hold him long enough, and I had to zone again. This time someone else was leaving Nadox and when I zoned back in, he had the mob all but dead (62 Chanter with Pet) so it was an opportunity lost.<br />
<br />
Note here: If you zone out, he will return to his spawn point which is NOT the spot where the scorned spawns...it is where you killed the scorned. That said, you should kill the scorned elements as far from the zone line as possible so if you have to zone when the named spawns you may get lucky and dogdog will keep him at the kill spot while you zone. That way when you zone back in he won't be camped and waiting for you.<br />
<br />
While back in Nadox yesterday I was fortunate enough to get this guy to spawn again, and this time I was ready for him. It was a long fight, but because I had conserved mana and self healed during my fight with the scorned, I was at around 95% health and mana when he popped and was able to run away from him while dogdog got aggro. Slow, VoS, and Incapacitie all landed on first shot and I jumped in to melee.<br />
<br />
As I said, he has a lot of HP and regens like mad so you will have to slow him often (I slowed him 4 times IIRC) and keep the dots on him. Do not get stingy with your slows because if slow breaks things will get ugly fast. IF you are lucky enough to get him rooted again and back off, dogdog may very well die by the time you are able to cast slow. He hits HARD and FAST and you don't want to give him a chance to kill dogdog (or you for that matter). It is easier to root, stoic/canni and before jumping back in for melee, hit dogdog with stoic to heal him back up while you take aggro. Did I mention that you should NEVER ALLOW SLOW TO BREAK?<br />
<br />
I took him down without a problem and he drops two decent items: a INT caster earring and a WIS caster neck piece. Nothing spectacular, but decent. He dropped the neck piece on my first encounter and the chanter that killed him let me have it, and when I killed him myself he dropped the earring (that goes to my mage alt). At level 46 I got 8% xp from this guy.<br />
<br />
Well, that's about all I can think of to help folks out if they choose to try these guys. I would highly recommend it because it is a really challenging encounter and will put your skills to the test; especially if the named pops. The beauty of it is that you are right at the zone line so you always have an easy escape at your disposal if necessary. The rewards are well worth the risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Absurdum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After another long session at the Nadox zone in, I can confirm that the &quot;a Lava Etched Doombringer&quot; will spawn off of &quot;an abhorrent element&quot; also. Every time I have seen him prior to today it was after the death of &quot;a scorned element,&quot; but today he popped when I took the abhorrent down.<br />
<br />
Also, there are at least two more mobs of this type in the lava river that really make this camp a lot better and bring down time to a minimum.<br />
<br />
To pull the others (an abhorrent and a scorned) clear the 3 mobs at entry, then cast resist fire on yourself (minimizes lava damage) and swim out into the lava to the wall on your right. Stay on the wall and keep trying to climb out of the lava. Eventually you will get onto the cave wall after a short while and you can then walk along the wall near the lava's edge. Do this slowly and hit F8 often until you target &quot;an abhorrent element.&quot; Once targeted, you must swim to the bottom of the lava to cast slow for the pull. You can't cast on him from above even though you can target him. Once you tag him, swim for your life back to the stone area at zone in where your pet should be waiting to give you a hand.<br />
<br />
After you kill this 4th mob, heal and med as quickly as you can and swim back out to the cave wall. Just past where you targeted the abhorrent, you should be able to pick up &quot;a scorned element&quot; on target by using F8 again. Once you have him targeted, jump in and swim along the river bottom toward the bridge. You should see a large round rock under the lava. If you swim around the right side of the round rock and beyond it a little ways, you will be within casting range of the mob. You have to do all of this fairly quickly because you will be taking damage from the lava (at 122 Fire Resist I take 10 damage each time) and once you tag the mob, he will catch you...just keep swimming back to the zone in.<br />
<br />
Once you kill the 5th and final mob, just sit tight, heal and med, and wait for the cycle to start over.<br />
<br />
Note: If you do not have Aego or Virtue, I wouldn't recommend trying the lava pulls. Having Aego or Virtue allows you to stay in the lava longer (obviously) and get comfortable with the area. If you aren't buffed up and get stunned under the lava, things can get bad quickly; especially if the mob resists slow on the pull.<br />
<br />
Well, I dinged 50 today and the mobs still give 2% per kill, so I think I'll sit in Nadox for one more level before moving on to something new.<br />
<br />
By the way, from 44-49 I got a solid 3% per kill on average and that didn't change until 50 where I am now getting a bit over 2% per kill. At 49, the named gave me 6% xp.<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting!!</div></div><hr />
