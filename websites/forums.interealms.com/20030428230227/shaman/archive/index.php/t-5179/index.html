<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently skill level 24 in alchemy and I have been using dyes to skill up.  Did most of yall do dyes, or SOW potions?  I really can't afford to make SOW potions, though I guess if I can make and sell a 10-dose potion I could put the rest back in to components for more SOW potions.  <br />
<br />
Will PC's buy dyes?  They sell for like 1 silver to merchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dyes were popular when fine plate steel first came out.<br />
<br />
That was over two years ago, now everyone goes for stuff with much better stats than the fine steel.<br />
<br />
So your answer is, unless you have a masochistic smith or someone who just /has/ to be the flaming pink warrior, no.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say there's a small market for them still.  I know quite a few personal friends who bought or made full sets of dyed fine steel for their Bazaar mules.  I'd chat up the smiths on your server and see if anyone can suggest the best colors to use.<br />
<br />
But even with the low resale price, the low ingredient price more than makes up for any lack of a market.</div></div><hr />
