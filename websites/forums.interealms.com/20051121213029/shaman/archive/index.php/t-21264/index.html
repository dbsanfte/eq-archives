So dont worry about it, have fun, pick the skills you want your character to be doing and really, have fun!<br />
If you really want to make your char out from a template you should check out http://cohcb.yogn.net/  it is however not 100% up to date, but close enough for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I picked an Empathy/Psychic defender because I can heal and slow, which fits nicely with anyone. I can duo with any of my tanker, controller, scrapper, or blaster friends or solo. The psychic abilities slow the enemies down a bit, and can be very powerful if you pick the right ones. For example, I use Psychic Lance to pull, since it does a great deal of damage ranged-wise and needs time to cast, follow up with Psychic Blast to slow them, and Subdue to root them if they're still alive, just in case I need to do more damage. I chose Hover at level 6 from the new power pool, so I could lift up out of melee range and saved me quite a lot of damage. Plus I can damage the enemies pretty much freely. It's pretty slow, but it'll do until I get Fly at 14. <br />
<br />
I've found that to be the closest to a Shaman;s ability. Slows and Heals, and better damage abosrption than most of the other non-tanker classes through an alternate ability (Hover). I just picked up Resurrect at level 10, too. Perfect group-friendly class.<br />
<br />
So far, pretty damned fun. I found my first tough flying enemy the other night while screwing around, and was shocked when he flew up to me to take some whacks at me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As a caveat, I'm not the world's greatest expert on CoH game mechanics, but here goes...<br />
<br />
My only character above level 2 is an Ice Blaster. I bought Ice Sword and it SUCKS!! Now, I'm stuck with it<br />
<br />
Delete, start over...level 2 is just finishing the tutorial, Glori :P<br />
<br />
With the possible exception of scrappers, it is REALLY DIFFICULT to gimp your character beyond all redemption. About the only way to do it is to take large number of pool powers, as they tend to be nowhere near as good as primary/secondary abilities. This is one of the nice things about the game, that almost any combination of powers can work.<br />
<br />
For the shaman duplication, definately controller or defender would be the choices. With so many different skillsets, there are a lot of ways to go. A forcefield defender plays WAY different than an empathy defender. The descriptions for the abilities are typically pretty useful, and give you an idea of what that power set will give you. The closest I can come to a shaman would be an Ice/Empathy Controller, or a Defender with either Kinetics or Radiation primary and Dark secondary.<br />
<br />
As far as Magic/Tech/Science/Mutation/Natural, there's really no difference. These are primarily roleplaying tools. They do have *some* influence over the initial missions you receive and what enemies your contacts will have you fight, but after level 7 or so, you won't notice. They also affect which Enhancements you can use.<br />
<br />
Enhancements are a little more complicated. Think of them as items. They *can* be sold, to the red and white field training heroes that are near most of the trainers in the city zones (Miss. Liberty and the Back Street Brawler, for example). They are a good supplementary source of Influence, which you'll need once you get to level 12 and can start buying dual-origin enhancements (which cost a fortune).<br />
<br />
Enhancements come in 3 varieties, Training, Dual-Origin, and Single Origin. Training can be used by anyone. Dual-Origin can be used only by people in one of the two origins they cover. There are 5 types of Dual Origin...Magic/Natural, Magic/Mutant, Natural/Technology, Mutant/Science, and Science/Technology. Each origin type is represented twice, and shares with another similar types. Then the single origins (5 again) are only useable by people in that specific origin.<br />
<br />
The basic mantra with enhancement types is:<br />
Training is always better than nothing.<br />
Dual Origin is always better than Training.<br />
Single Origin is always better than Dual.<br />
<br />
That of course comes with a disclaimer...red enhancements provide NO BONUS. So a green Training is going to be better than a red single origin, because the red one is not doing anything.<br />
<br />
Ideally you want to keep your enhancements above your level if possible. You can use enhancements up to 3 levels higher than your security level, and enhancements 4 or lower become red and ineffective.<br />
<br />
A 5++ enhancement functions the same as a 7 enhancement. A 7+ enhancement functions the same as an 8 enhancement. A level 40 training enhancement provides the EXACT SAME BENEFIT to a level 40 character as a level 1 enhancement does to a level 1 character. <br />
<br />
As a rule, Training enhancements provide +8% bonus, Duals are +16%, and Singles are +32%. Specific enhancements can vary (example, +range enhancements for distance powers are 5/10/20%), but most follow that rule.<br />
<br />
When you get an enhancement higher than your level, it gets a bonus. When it is lower it recieves a small penalty. It is about 1% per level. Not something you are generally going to notice a great deal. A training enhancement 3 levels above you is giving about an 11% bonus. A dual-origin 3 levels below you is giving 13% (thus, why duals are better than training).<br />
<br />
If you have a level 5 damage enhancement, and pick up another one from a kill, you can go to the enhancement screen and combine them into a 5+ enhancement (effectively making it level 6, and more effective). This can be done up to twice to make something ++. When you do the combine, there's a chance it will fail. Worst case, the lower level enhancements gets booted. If enhancements are the same level, it never fails. Every level step they are different, is a 5% chance of failure on a combine. Once you get an enhancement up to ++, the game will only allow you to combine it with something higher. A 5++ enhancement can't be combined with anything less than an 8, which will result in an 8+.<br />
<br />
I think that covers about all of it for enhancements...<br />
<br />
For the slots, this is where some of the greater flexibility comes into play. In the current level 40 cap, you get a grand total of 72 enhancement slots (23 powers which each come with 1, and 49 by leveling up), so you have quite a few to play with. Many skills (like brawl, rest, sprint) should never get anything but their initial 1 slot...more is wasteful. Any one power can have up to 6 slots.<br />
<br />
Care needs to be exercised with putting in slots, because even though you do get a lot, you do not get an infinite amount, and currently there's no way to change them once you've placed them. Don't be afraid to put lots of slots into your beginning powers. Those are the &quot;bread and butter&quot; abilities, and unlike low level EQ spells, do NOT become obsolete with age.<br />
<br />
How you put enhancements into a power can greatly effect how that power works. If you put 6 damage enhancements into a power, it will do a big old sh*tload of damage when it hits...but that specialization is coming at a cost. Someone with a +accuracy, -endurance  cost, -recycle time, 3x damage setup is going to hit more, use less endurance to activate, and activate the power more frequently. But they won't hit as hard. It is a playstyle issue more than anything else.  You can't really place enhancements wrong, because you can replace them any time you want by dropping a different one into the slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm using the cool little tool that Mintyfresh provided. I'm still a little confused. You get to purchase new powers every 2 levels? What if I had skipped the crappy Ice Sword at level 4, would I be able to purchase more spells later or would I just lose it?<br />
<br />
I also don't understand the three pools!<br />
<br />
I am LEVEL FIVE Arriana!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You start with 2 powers, and get to choose a new power at every even level up to 32, when it switches to every 3 levels (so, 35, 38...and when the level cap goes up, 41/44/47/50). Picking one bad power is not going to destroy you :P<br />
<br />
You are best at your primary powers. Some of the archetypes overlap (especially controllers/defenders and defenders/blasters), an empathy defender is going to heal better than a controllers with empathy secondary. An electricity blaster is going to nuke harder than an electricity secondary defender. When in doubt, pick a primary ability, it is what your archetype is best at. But don't ignore secondary powers, they can be quite good.<br />
<br />
Power Pools are available to everyone. They tend to be catch-all abilities that don't strictly fit into other power sets (like flight...lots of &quot;real&quot; heroes can fly by various means that aren't strictly related to their other abilities). You can start taking them at level 6. The first 2 listed powers in each pool become available at 6. The third power requires A) Level 14, and B) Having picked one of the first 2. The 4th power requires A) Level 20, and B) Having picked any 2 of the first three.<br />
<br />
So, if you take Hover at level 6, you can take Fly at 14, and then Group Fly at 20. Or you could take Air Superiority at 6, Hover at 8, and Group Fly at 20.<br />
<br />
You can have a total of 4 different pools. So if you went Hover, Hasten, Combat Jumping, and Heal Other, that is 4 pools, and you could not take (for example) Stealth. That gives you a maximum of 16 power pools possible to purchase (4 pools, 4 powers each). Course, with only 20 abilities to pick, that leaves you with only 4 out of your prim/sec abilities, and I can't really see a character built like that being too great. There might be a way though, and the game is flexible enough that it might be possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So, pretty much every two levels you get to pick 1 power (or a pool, or a power and a pool?)<br />
<br />
How often do you get to pick slots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mintyfresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Every level you dont get a new power you will get 2 enhancement slots(not sure if this still applies to 30+).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Page 29 of the manual has a precise breakdown of exactly what you get, and at which levels you get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Once again, did not play tonight, just created outfits. Managed to get some really great names (no Greek mythology buffs in COH?)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am honestly so terrified of drastically ruining a character through poor power/enhancement decisions, I haven't played (beyond creating tons of fabulous outfits).<br />
<br />
I found the best thing to do is experiment.  Characters are easy to create and level up to level 6.  If you don't like one, delete it, unless you absolutely have to keep it for the outfit.<br />
<br />
My only character above level 2 is an Ice Blaster. I bought Ice Sword and it SUCKS!! Now, I'm stuck with it :(<br />
<br />
Not familiar with Ice Sword, but basically, for a blaster, you initially want powers that allow you to deal damage at a distance.  Look for a combination of a primary power that allows you to nuke from a distance with a secondary power that allows you to root or immobilze a foe.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any &quot;templates&quot; for any good &quot;character trees?&quot; I'm specifically looking for &quot;shaman-like&quot; characters with lots of utility (AND HEALING). I guess Defenders or Controllers most closely match our skill set. But how do you pick? Why is radiation better than levitation, or whatever. Does magic matter vs. mutation?<br />
<br />
I chose the radiation power set for my primary for Gard L Tron because it has a decent self/group heal, Accelerate Metabolism, which is an awesome self/group buff, and at least 3 different kinds of debuffs.  Radiation as the secondary power set gives me several damage dealing options, all effective at a distance.  I'm sure there are other combinations that give buffs, heals, and damage potential.<br />
<br />
I don't understand the enhancement thing at all. I find them, and I can't sell them back to the trainer. If I don't like them, do I put them in the trashcan? What happens if I get more than 10?<br />
<br />
Each power you choose intially has one slot that you can put enhancements into.  You can only put an enhancement into a slot that remains lighted (if full) or green (if empty) when you left click on the enhancment. There are vendors near the trainers and your initial contacts that will purchase enhancementst you can't use.  They are dressed in white and red outfits.  In Galaxy City, there is one immediately inside the door as you come into the building where you meet your first contact.  She will buy back any enhancements you have.  If I'm not mistaken, there is also a vendor to the right of Back Street Brawler, the trainer in front of the building in Galaxy City. Similar trainers are available in Atlas Park. From a distance, you might mistake them for player characters.  So if you get more than 10 enhancements, simply sell them to one of these vendors.  If you're still having trouble finding them, PM me and I'll make a character on your server to show you where to go.<br />
<br />
What about the extra slots you can add to powers? How do you decide where to put it?<br />
<br />
Most powers will accept more than one kind of enhancement.  For example, a damage dealing power will accept accuracy enhancements (light yellow), damage enhancements (red), etc.  So if you're missing a lot with a damage power, add an accuracy enhancement.  If you want more damage, add the damage one.  But maybe you find you want both, better accuracy and more damage.  Then when you get new slots, put a second one on the power that you want both accuracy and damage enhancements for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I hit level 6 last night with my Grav/Rad controller. I was tempted to start buying Pool powers, but instead went with Propel since I don't feel like I'm contributing much in a group.<br />
<br />
Best...power...ever... <br />
<br />
So far, I've thrown:<br />
<br />
A safe<br />
A barrel of toxic waste<br />
A computer<br />
A desk<br />
<br />
I love it! And it does significant damage! About twice as much as I was doing with lift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes tell you the truth most people (but not all) should wait till 12 and 14 to pick up a movement power.  If you picked up Hover you cant fly till 14 so while it helps a bit a power at 6th can help you level faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Good, that's what I figured. I'm really excited about Super Leaping...but I thought &quot;heck, I can't super leap until 14 anyway!&quot;<br />
<br />
I got Accelerated Metabolism, your thoughts on its usefulenss now that they changed the recharge?<br />
<br />
Oh..and invis...necessity or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Here's my plan for my Grav/Radiation Controller (I realize it's heavy in the Pool Powers, but I LIKE THEM).<br />
<br />
Grav -  Crush <br />
Grav -  Lift<br />
Grav -  Propel<br />
Grav - Crushing Field<br />
Grav - Wormhole<br />
<br />
Rad - Radiation Emission<br />
Rad - Accelerated Metabolism<br />
Rad - Ennervating Field<br />
Rad - Mutation (am I reading this right, is this a rez?)<br />
Rad - Lingering Radiation<br />
<br />
Swift (who doesn't like to run faster?)<br />
Health<br />
Stamina (heard this was super important, in EQ terms, this would be a built-in clarity, right?)<br />
<br />
Aid Other<br />
Stimulant<br />
Aid Self<br />
Healing is important for me, I realize that rad secondary powers can do this a bit, but I want to be able to do it better.<br />
<br />
Jump Kick<br />
Super Jump<br />
(acrobatics, worth it?)<br />
<br />
Then, I have two powers up for grabs, I'm kind of waiting to hear if invis is a necessity like it is EQ. If so, I'll go for grant invis/self invis. I'm playing with my boyfriend, so I made him swear to go into the teleport pool.<br />
<br />
I wish I had a knockback effect..I was tempted by Kinetics as a secondary power with Repel, but John has a knockback.<br />
<br />
Do powers stack? If I'm crushing a foe who already has Crushing field on, does it double the damage?<br />
<br />
Thoughts? It's much harder to create a &quot;unique&quot; template than to build an EQ character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I wouldnt bother with the healing pool powers (aid other, aid self). They are really REALLY weak, even in comparison to radiations healing. make your radiation heal a 6 slot power, load it with 4 healing upgrades and 2 timer reducers, and you should be ok on that.<br />
<br />
You have no real movement powers I noticed. Grab teleport other, its insanely useful for mobilizing a team and dragging corpses.<br />
<br />
I would ditch jump kick/super kick. The damage is going to be very trivial to using your crush powers. Replace it with Singularity, the pet power. The pet not only deals good damage, but has crowd control capability, as it  has its own paralysis powers.<br />
<br />
Combat leaping or hover are both defensive powers (think LR 5), either is worth it. They dont stack however.<br />
<br />
Mutation is a combat rez (wellit can be done out of combat too). It brings the dead person back stronger than before. However, after a short while, it causes them to be sick. I really like how the rez powers are there for different classes/power sets, just unique.<br />
<br />
Focus on lockdown powers. They are AMAZING. My mind controller/empath rarely needs to heal if things are done right, since a held mob deals no damage. So sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Here's my plan for my Grav/Radiation Controller <br />
<br />
Rad - Mutation (am I reading this right, is this a rez?)<br />
<br />
Yes, this is a Rez.<br />
<br />
Stamina (heard this was super important, in EQ terms, this would be a built-in clarity, right?)<br />
<br />
Yes, it is a lot like built-in clarity. And it *can* be important, but it isn't necesary for every build. My Earth/Forcefield controller is getting by quite well (She's level 6 now) and the only time I've run out of endurance is when I got ambushed by about 6 5th column soldiers (with 2 LTs) in atlas park. If it keeps up this way, I plan on skipping stamina. It has some hefty pre-reqs to make it viable, and I don't know that the build has that many powers/slots available for something I don't really need.<br />
<br />
My scrapper on the other hand, is picking this up at 20th.<br />
<br />
Jump Kick<br />
Super Jump<br />
(acrobatics, worth it?)<br />
<br />
I'd take combat jumping over jump kick. Combat jumping provides a great +defense bonus, and it's useful indoors (which super jump is most definately not) for getting around. If you *really* want an attack, then jump kick will work, but IMO, you have propel and a constant teammate with your BF, and don't need another attack.<br />
<br />
Then, I have two powers up for grabs, I'm kind of waiting to hear if invis is a necessity like it is EQ.<br />
<br />
One option would be to just take Stealth for yourself. It slows down your movement a lot, but it grants defense (which stacks with combat jumping, if you get that), and also lets you move around stealthily...good pulling tool too, I'm told (I won't know til 22, when my scrapper gets her dark armor stealth power).<br />
<br />
I wish I had a knockback effect..I was tempted by Kinetics as a secondary power with Repel, but John has a knockback.<br />
<br />
You only really need one, especially if his is a cone style. My controller uses force bolt for her knockback, and it works splendidly...although the damage is absolutely wretched. <br />
<br />
Do powers stack? If I'm crushing a foe who already has Crushing field on, does it double the damage?<br />
<br />
Unless a power specifically states that it won't stack, it stacks. Mostly this applies to the same power cast by the same person. If two forcefield users each put a field on a tanker, the tanker will get double benefit. If a single FF user casts the same field twice, it just refreshes the duration, doesn't change the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dullsville</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Anyone have any idea if Stamina stacks with Quick Recovery from the Scrapper Regen line?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It does, according to the Regen FAQ on the warcry site, it works as follows:<br />
<br />
Quick Recovery increases the Endurance recovery rate by 33%, while Stamina increases<br />
the recovery rate by 25%.<br />
Fully enhanced with 6 single-origin Endurance Recovery enhancements in each power, Quick<br />
Recovery and Stamina will bring a character from 0 Endurance to full in 21.8 seconds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dullsville</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So does anyone have any experience with whether or not taking Fitness as a Regen Scrapper is overkill or not?  I've read conflicting opinions; some say it's overkill and others say its required if one expects to run a few of the togglables simultaneously.  Granted, it would be nice not to always have to be struggling for endurance, but at the same time I know of a few others things I'd like to have instead of spending the three picks on Fitness.  Anyone have any first-hand experience with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If Fitness is the one that provides enhanced endurance regen - OH YEAH.  My little scrapper bought it, and I basically get to mash buttons constantly.  I didn't take it till my 10th character or so (yeah, I deleted a few), but MAN, I'm considering taking it with most of em now.  The damage my scrapper could put out spiked seriously when I took that skill.  I'm also able to mash the high-damage skills, and augment them with quicker recovery time now.<br />
<br />
It's a winner in my book, but I'm seriously addicted to watching those little numbers float up.</div></div><hr />
