<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jebeksis Stormcaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering why nobody wears the legs i do (choice or circumstance). Tell me which you think are the &quot;best&quot; (by whatever criteria you like), and why.</div></div><hr />

I'm currently wearing Rune Crafters.  Of the legs that you listed, I'd probably only spend 'merit' on Ancient Wyvern Hide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh even toward the end game legs are problematic for shaman.<br />
<br />
Wear mine because, they dropped and I got them - Wolfcallers. So the question then would be what would I take them off for.<br />
<br />
Wyvern Hide? No, similar ac, no mana, wis and resists (albeit few) compared to Wolfcallers, tho the stamina on them is very nice and would end up more HP. They are all/all, would imagine monks would get first crack at these. Had I seen them drop before I got my legs and no monks needed? Hell ya!<br />
<br />
Shennanigan? Nope, not having less HP.<br />
<br />
Spiritcallers? Nope, less HP again. Although at the time I got my legs my faction was dragon friendly, had the guild been on a different path then things would be different.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm very happy with Wolfcallers, one day it might be nice to have Onyx Chain just cos im terribly jealous of all those dashing black clad shaman!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't personally care for the onyx chain legs much at all since all the really have over commonly availble spiritcallers or wolfcallers is ac. Loose pretty much everywhere else.<br />
<br />
Serpent Skin Leggings (they Drop off Rhag 2) 15 AC 5 Str 5 Agi 10 Sta 10 Wis 40 HP 40 Mana +5 MR/CR/FR<br />
Not bad but light on the ac ac and I'm already sta capped too =(.<br />
<br />
IMO legs are like boots, No really good options. Either missing hps, or low ac, or no wis etc. There aren't any really uber peices that are great ac, high hps/mana sv all with the obligitory 20 wis/int on them. As such i'm going to stick with the nice commonly availble stuff and upgrade other slots first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ronfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">While I personally use Onyx Chain legs because they look so damn good with a Vindi BP, the legs from Shei Vinitras in Akheva are by far the best shaman legs outside of VT, as they have 100hp (can't remember other stats off the top of my head, sorry). The problem about them is that they use a plain leather graphic. Yuck. Still, a nice alternative for those that don't worry too much about fashion and haven't yet broken in VT. Black Runed Pants are also another good choice, with 85hp/mana. Those drop off Vhyz'Dra the Cursed. Not certain what the graphic is, so beware!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Most Cursed BP's seem to follow the Burrower Parasite look of having Shapeless Black or &quot;Gnomeskin&quot; looks...  I'd wager the legs look like that too..<br />

I've had opportunity to trade out my Skyshrine legs for all those listed above from NToV, and I didn't. Either you lose HP or you lose mana. Skyshrine legs have plenty of both, and an effect that is suddenly actually convenient in a world of curing tanks of slowing spells with disease cures.</div></div><hr />

Break away from the fashion mentality :p<br />
The more uber the Luclin loot gets, the worse it looks on us.<br />
<br />
-Mace of confusion...looks like a small fine steel mace.<br />
-Leggings of Serenity, look like you're wearing newbie leather pants.<br />
-Ssraeshzaen Honor Guard Bracer, looks like crapola too.<br />
-Burrower helmet, looks like a black sack on your head (or a bear head if you're a barbarian).<br />
