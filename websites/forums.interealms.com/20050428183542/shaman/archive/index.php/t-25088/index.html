<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">to make a decent ammount of silver take these two skills early on, skinning and leather working.<br />
<br />
with those two every mob you kill because a source of equipment and of money.<br />
you can craft armor patches to up your ac, extra gear, bags, etc.<br />
and ! the stuff you craft is wanted buy merchants and players.<br />
<br />
i've made over 5 gold doing this, and i am very close to making magical leather now :D<br />
<br />
<br />
have fun guys</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually Herbalism works great, too.  Stop and loot every herb you see... one Peacebloom = 10 cp, and a single plant can have up to three Peacebloom on it.  I am not having any trouble buying my spells so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Leatherworking early on but after that it's all about going to instances then selling what you got there.<br />

Basically true - and the faster you can the better.  If you can supplement the killing by harvesting trade goods, mores the riches.  If you have a character that you don't plan to level up in tradeskills, skinning and mining are the to easiest and most profitable harvesting skills for selling back to vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Quests from 15-20 range start handing out 6-9 sp, this is nice.  Places like Pyrewood have mobs that drop at least 1 sp plus a lot of good items.  Selling your old soulbound gear to vendors is good money.  As a warrior, even the packrat that I am has found that there is no reason to keep more than one of each type of weapon.  Lack of inv and bank space sort of forced me to this, but I sell some of my soulbound weapons to vendors for 10sp or more.<br />
<br />
Most tradeskills can be pure profit, costing only the time to collect the materials.  Or if you are able, buy cheap materials and make more items to sell in volume.  I can sell easily crafted armor that costs 4 or 6 copper bars to make for 2 sp from vendors.  Free cash money there.<br />
<br />
I still really hate player economies.  The AH is screwy as ever, maybe it will stabilize.  High level players rape the lower levels that need tradeskill components (wool cloth, for example), selling it for up to 50sp per stack.  And other things they totally screw people over the opposite way buy selling TS items for the same price a vendor will give, thus eliminating people's chances to make money.  Eventually you'll have a small percentage of people with hundreds of gold and the rest of the masses struggling to buy their spells and then they will probably add another money sink to counter the small minority.  Player economies are sucky.<br />
<br />
Btw, I have over 4 gp now as a level 19 warrior.  I have spent 10sp on all weapon skills except for dagger at this point and I have all my skills :).</div></div><hr />
