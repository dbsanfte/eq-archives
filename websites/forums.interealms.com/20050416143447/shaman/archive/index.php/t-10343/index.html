<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm almost 42 now, and I'm looking for a good spot in velious to work on my dorf faction.<br />
<br />
Where can I setup for constant giant pulls, that I can solo?<br />
<br />
And ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only been playing 2 months.. so take my advice with a grain of salt.. I was around 41, and I took the battle shammy route of the velium fire wedding rings+sanark battle shield+ anything that could give me ac like all the jaundiced/totemic items I could find. At 41, I could root/rot with slow+vos+scourage+kei+debuff+regen+dog and take out frost giants scouts very easily. I did it newb style by just zoning in through pok book and going a little south. The further down you go the more of them there are and the more adds you get, but I would start there and as you progress go further down. I destroyed all the heads I got, but I think they go for AT LEAST 10pp sometimes 100pp at the bazaar. <br />

You can single pull from the fort entrance on the hill side of the fort pretty easily.<br />
