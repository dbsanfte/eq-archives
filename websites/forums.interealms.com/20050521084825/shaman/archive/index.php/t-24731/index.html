<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If spirit of might is a +5% melee boost why does the 67 puppy hit for 70 with spirit of might.  It should be<br />
<br />
1.05 x 68 = 71.4  which rounds down to 71<br />
<br />
<br />
My big issue is EQ's calculation of line of sight for casting spells.  Looke like the programmers were to lazy to include the elevation factor.  It is annoying to be satanding on a hil side looking down on target and getting the message that &quot;You cannot see your target&quot;.  Just plain bad math!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Again, none of the melee damage modifcations are applied to the &quot;End Damage&quot;. Damage in EQ is split up in Damage Bonus and Damage Interval.<br />
<br />
Damage Bonus is a fixed value(weapon or mob base damage). Damage Interval is another set value. The end damage calculation is a result of Damage Bonus + 1-20*Damage Interval. The number(1-20) the Damage Interval is multiplied with is random(like rolling a die), except that the aggressors ATK vs. the defender's AC heavily factor in there(closer to 1 for a high AC tank against a low ATK mob and closer to 20 for a low AC tank against a high ATK mob).<br />
<br />
An example:<br />
<br />
Assume a mob has a Damage Bonus of 200 and a Damage Interval of 100.<br />
A mob will hit for 200+100(1*100) minimum and 200+2000(20*100) maximum.<br />
Only the Damage Interval portion is affected by any damage modification effects.<br />
In this example if you charmed a mob with above traits and cast Might on it the min and max damage would be modified like this:<br />
<br />
200+105(1*100*1.05) for the minimum and 200+2100(20*100*1.05) for the maximum<br />
<br />
If you post the minimum hit for our pet, I will show you how the calculation results in it hitting for 70 with Might using above forumla.</div></div><hr />

im sure this was either a) the result of bad math, but left in for exploitive purposes, or b) an intentional exploit prevention method</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bottom line, though, if you read the spell description, it says it adds 5% to all skills damage modifiers.  It does not say it adds 5% to raw damage.<br />
<br />
Essentially, as noted above, it means that the random number generator averages that 5% into its calculations.  The actual parsed effects, if I remember from test, were on the order of between 1.5-2.5% increase in damage.<br />
<br />
Champion is a like amount, I believe.<br />

This is what i was told by a GM when asking about why archery doesnt work up/down hill etc.<br />

<br />
The in-game spell description?<br />
<br />
Essentially, as noted above, it means that the random number generator averages that 5% into its calculations.  The actual parsed effects, if I remember from test, were on the order of between 1.5-2.5% increase in damage.<br />
<br />
Any links to that parse?  As far as I was aware, the +x% damage effects basically increase the 'damage' stat on your weapon by x%.<br />
<br />
So a 20/20 weapon with 15 damage bonus, with Champion up should be the same as a 22/20 weapon, with 15 damage bonus.  (don't round)<br />
<br />
Pet &quot;weapon damage&quot; can be calculated as follows:<br />
(Max_Damage/Min_Damage)/1.9<br />
(if you give a pet a weapon with more weapon damage than their innate ability, their damage will go up).<br />
<br />
The pet's damage bonus is (Min_Damage - WeaponDamage/10).<br />
<br />
Or, in other words<br />
Min_Damage = Damage_Bonus + Weapon_Damage/10<br />
Max_Damage = Damage_Bonus + 2* Weapon_Damage<br />
<br />
So, take a pet that hits for 30 min and 106 max.<br />
<br />
(106-30)/1.9 = 40<br />
<br />
So, the pet has a 40 innate &quot;weapon damage&quot; and a 26 damage bonus.<br />
<br />
Toss Champion on that pet, and the weapon damage goes up to 44.<br />
<br />
We get a min damage of 30, and a max damage of 114.<br />
<br />
Champion is a like amount, I believe.<br />
<br />
Champion is 10% vs the &quot;post-Str&quot; buff's 5%.  There appears to be a 10% cap or something, or a stacking problem.  (or so the mages have reported)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I beleive that was an intentional stacking choice. It basically functions like haste. Only get the best one. Can have multiple buffs up if they don't have the effect in the same slot.</div></div><hr />
