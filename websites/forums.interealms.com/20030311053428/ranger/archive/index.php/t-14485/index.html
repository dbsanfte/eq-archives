<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently PL'ing a level 48 ranger w/ the assistance of a lvl 58 shamen.  I've been in DL for the past 2 levels and the kills are now 2-3 per 1%.  Any recommendations on where to go to get 1-2% kills?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">your shaman can do a 2K heal along with tugur's for slows, so try dungeons : chardok would be the better i think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Went to chardok, everything coned red.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nocture</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The hole entrance perhaps :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

You can stay til 52 on the terrors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thought about Howling Stones.  Any advice there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raeber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jagged Pine Poachers....mad exp at 48, not too bad solo at 51...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if you are afraid of chardok, dont even try howling stones, it is much worse (many sk mobs HT) and harder to pull.<br />
btw mobs cant be all red at 48 (mean 51+) in chardok.<br />
at 60 i can single pull everyting between zone in and zone out, meaning they are 49 &lt;b&gt;max&lt;/b&gt;.<br />
and many of them are light blue (lvl 44 or less).<br />
<br />
now if u want to single pull with your ranger, heh, DL is the place for noobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Everything inside chardok did con red. Tried doing Sarnaks from the fortress ent and although the canned DBlue, the weren't soloable. due to there casting and gateing.<br />
<br />
Ended up doing all of 48 in CC on terrors and geos.  Left there because some of them are now conning green.  Went to SoLB today for a little bit today and may duo there.  The kobolds are all DBlue, but allowed single pulls.  Was getting 1% per kill also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daeroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sol B LDC's and Lava Beetles are always good.  Best place is to set up shop in the room with three spawns.  You will net 1% exp per kill until about level 51 if solo.  With a shaman buffing you, healing you and slowing them it shouldn't be difficult.  To speed up kills have the shaman send in their pet once the mobs is below 2/3's.  That should help decrease kill time but ensure you get the exp.  Only hard part is splitting out the spawn a bit and breaking the room, as at level 48 your aggro radius will be larger and you have a good chance of having to deal with a couple lava beetles from outside the room in addition to the 3 LDC's inside.  Once you break it and setup against the wall though it should go smooth.  You can pull the LDC's and Stone spider from near the ramps up to the FG's as well.  Just note that the Stone Spider is 100% MR and stuns with a spell effect like crazy, so make sure you have your dmg shields up.  Killing the stone spider will be a long fight, but it's a rare spawn. The rest should be easy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">CoM was good until 51.  Now it seems i've gone from 1% per kill at 50 to about 3 kills to 1% for 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lefoiette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Was just in Chardok with a couple friends 2 days ago and I'm 48... all entrance/exit mobs were dark blue.  There was lots of red on track, but those mobs are down in the pit... tracking is messy in Chardok because of the dungeon layout.  I'd vote for either Chardok or the Hole entrance as well...although I know at least on my server the Hole entrance is camped nearly 24/7.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually went to Velks.  Could do single, and sometimes double pulls on spiders.  They give decent XP (+1%) but take a few minutes to kill.  I'll try HS next.  Only problem there is the odd exit points.</div></div><hr />
