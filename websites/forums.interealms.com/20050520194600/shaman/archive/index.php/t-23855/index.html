<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Subject says it all, where do you go to farm platinum?  This can either be through vendor loot (killing in Sebilis for gems) or bazaar loot (killing the king in Drooga so you can sell his copper hammer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MaryieneD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd have to say my favorite platinum farming spot would have to be in Sol Ro Tower farming ornate drops with an SK &amp; cleric.  They sell pretty well in the bazaar, the exp isn't that great now though.</div></div><hr />

I have tried time and time again to get into a group that goes there and does this and the named up there and I can never get a group.  Anyone know of someone who could use a Shaman up there on The Nameless Server please let me know.  What I would give to go up there, gosh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kandadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Technically you (shaman) can solo Sol Ro Tower.  That's &quot;solo&quot; as in buy all the buffs you can in PoK before you go.  It's not worth it though.  Too risky.  What I do is 2 box sk/shm.  Very nice duo though I wish the DPS was better.  Now here's the kicker.  I CAN farm Sol Ro Tower but I DON'T because on multiple occasions I've gone from zone in to the end of any 1 of the 3 ramps and back and gotten nothing.  Then of course I start getting lazy and die but that's beyond the point.  The point is I have better things to do than waste my time looting nothing.  Ok so maybe there's a slight possibility that some day you might have a minute chance of getting a crappy bracer but really that's quite a test of patience and I can't handle it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sol ro mobs aren't that hard to solo.  the problem is getting them solo.  you can use a few tricks to get them solo, those have been posted somewhere on the forums already...<br />
<br />
Kandadar is right though, you can clear a ton of mobs and not see a single ornate piece drop...xp isn't that horrid while doing it.<br />
<br />
one more thing:<br />
&quot;That's &quot;solo&quot; as in buy all the buffs you can in PoK before you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
this quote isn't really true as it depends on gear, level, AA count, spell book, and skill.  i was able to solo singles in sol ro self buffed with considerable less hp than i have now and several hundred less AAs.  It really depends on the shaman imo...<br />
<br />
for better cash, you may want to check out oow solo spell farming...i know for a fact we can solo some PHed named mobs that drop low level oow spells...</div></div><hr />

I haven't tried soloing them without crack but I'm willing to bet I can't.  I would need that at a minimum.  For damage I use Ultor, Saryrn, and Bane.  I also have a pet with mage items and my weapon is the Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic with 150 ice dd proc augment.  I fully buff myself and pet and I have Q up 100% of the time.  I also have all the extended buff AA so my Q lasts quite a while (a few seconds after the blue glow effect disapears).</div></div><hr />
