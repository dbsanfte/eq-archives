<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stick with the Troll, I think you'll find them to be quite fun to play. It also really depends on your play style as well, if you're a casual player that plays just a couple times a week then the Troll exp penalty will slow things down a bit. My first &quot;real&quot; character in EQ was a Iksar Necromancer they share the same exp penalty as Trolls, my next 3 characters were either Troll or Iksar so the penalty doesn't bother me, I don't really notice. <br />
Stick your Troll for a while and if you decide you don't like them as much as you thought, try a different race.<br />

<br />
There is no &quot;best&quot; race for shamans, if you like the look of trolls, play a troll. If you'd rather wear a skirt, play a barb :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>korinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its a Kilt darnit!. barbs are the best race, we are sexy!!!!<br />
Would you want to look at a female troll or a barb female :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bobdz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok remade him just didnt really like the troll so i made a Barbarian Shaman i am level 10 now and love it :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Trolls aren't bad, now that they don't spend all the time scratching their butts (or adjusting a thong?  I just don't wanna know!).  However, I've always had a Barb Shammy, and have been happy with him through all the levels.  As far as Scaleybutts go, nobody really likes them, we just keep them around for free luggage :)<br />
<br />
The one issue that's a pain with a Barb is night vision.  I mean REALLY, ours is a race that likes to spend all their time hunting in the dark, but we can't see in it?  But the perks of a Barb far outweigh this little prob and you have the spells at your fingertips to help yourself.<br />
<br />
And let's face it, Barbs are the second race most likely to get their bones jumped (after the DE Females, of course!).  If yer dead and waiting a rezz, just WATCH all the females melt over your tatoos and pecs!  MOVE OVER FABIO  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if you're only level 10 you won't lose much time by...<br />
rerolling as an OGER!!!!<br />
<br />
we get nightvision!<br />
we have more hitpoints!<br />
we can't get stunned by frontal bashes!<br />
we can bank in neriak (once we get shrink)!<br />
we're FRIGGIN HUGE!<br />
<br />
but make sure to turn on your luclin oger graphics, because pre-luclin ogers sure do look dumb.</div></div><hr />
