<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Terakkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, the Sleeper has finally be awoken on Karana, and it wasn't by any certain guild on a raid, nothing so noble as todo it just to be the first. Nope on Karana these days we have a band of roving jackasses whose sole pleasure it has become is to screw the hard working lesser guilds out of rewards.<br />
<br />
We have a mob rotation system on Karana, which while I don't always agree with works. Sometimes it takes a while to rotate back around  to Keeper, Cazic, Yelinak and the like that it can be a pain in the ass. So, come up a month or so back, rotation mobs were disappearing before said guilds could move in and claim or fail or pass their turn onto the next hard working guild. We lose Talendor one week, rangers scouting for 30 minutes combing every inch of the zone. Come to find out at least 3 more rotation targets have been wiped before ther respective guild have their people on that day gathered. Bunch of peopel don't like the rotation system, which like I said, I may not like either, but I agree with it as a fair enough procedure for us, Allows up and coming guilds who can't permacamp/kill rare and difficult spawns a real attempt at them. You get your shot, if you make it, you've done great, if you fail, next in line gets their turn, same with passing.<br />
<br />
That said we have a rogue band (saying that makes them seem important, they're an annoyance) Who like to piss people off, rotation mobs was the first, with the claims of &quot;We just wanted to see if anyone would notice, or if it could be done...&quot; or some such nonsense. Truth of the matter is they're in in for the drops, get as much as they can sell to screw someone else out of having it.  Basically screwing someone out of their chance to really move up, gaining what on perma camped mobs they would be stuck paying to loot or buy from another permacamp. Now I'm hearing they've awoken the sleeper, just because they're *******s. They did it so no more SoD's, no more Gnome masks, no more primal weapons, no more monk robes would drop, and just to piss people off more who are already mad at them for screwing with a whole server's worth of guilds simply because they are bored. Reminds me of a little kind who destroys their sister's or brother's toys just because they don't want them to be able to play with them anymore.<br />
<br />
I can be a selfish bastard, in my life. But, and i know this is a game, people work hard for their sleeper's keys, it's not  like a seb key where you can get an entire guild in in one afternoon, nor is it the time consumption of a Vex Thal key, but it's an accomplishment, and to have left the sleeper alone for those people who worked hard enough to get there was a great and unselfish thing that happened on Karana, and now a bunch of bord people with so little to do with their little lives except for messing with someone else, just to get a rise out of them, have taken that away from those up and coming guilds who are working hard to become great, what had been preserved in an unspoken oath for all of those guilds to come. Basically a big **** You to everyone on Karana. It's not a great system, but it's honest, and it's fair.<br />
<br />
*Edit* Woops, missed the rant further down on the new message windows, but what the hell, I wrote it in ranting and raving, so I will leave it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With the Revamped Sleepers I dont see how this is any big deal in terms of Primal weapons, in fact you should see more Primal. Shame about the other loots though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Sleeper, if I remember right, was taken out of Lanys T'Vyl because a bunch of people found an exploit. If you stand in the water around The Sleeper then you cannot be hit by his AoE. It took the three strongest guilds on Lanys at the time, Conquest, Riders of the Apocalypse, and Sigil, to do this with all of their strongest members. None of them were banned, because the Sleeper was never meant to be killed.<br />
<br />
So, they removed the Sleeper because half way through this huge rumble a GM discovered it, and Chealed The Sleeper. Needless to say the raid wasn't too thrilled, but, if the GMs wouldn't have been around to stop it they would have beaten The Sleeper. So, they removed it for those times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Umm... I hadnt heard that Siriath, but I did see the threads about various GM's at Fan Faire standing there and chain death touching The Sleeper (32khp) without dinging his hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got me. Just what a bunch of people keep saying on Lanys. I'm nowhere near my ST key yet, so I can't verify. Wish I could, hell, wish I was high enough. Almost 48, not quite yet, still need a blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's a shame that people messed with a system that sounds like a positive thing in general.<br />
<br />
However, now you get a taste of what servers like Fennin deal with every day.  All mobs are FFA.  The general rule of thumb is &quot;first to engage gets it&quot;, but that doesn't gaurantee people will be honorable.  You see lots of leapfrogging, training, whatever.  Welcome to my nightmare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Karana and Stormhammer are the only servers I am aware of that had any type of mob rotation schedule that was actually adhered to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Erollisi Marr has a rotation with Venril Sathir and Trakanon.  But after those two Kunark mobs the first high tier guilds to get there and argue about who got what and dominate what else became fed up and said &quot;Free for all, no more making rotations!!&quot;, so... everyone else still goes with the VS/Trak rotation on Emarr, but everything else is first come first serve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dalantia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Scary thing is, you get used to it after hating it for so long.<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
First in force proves who can mobilize faster, and it turns EQ into a sport.  The attitude of EQ is that no one &quot;deserves&quot; something, you have to work for it.<br />
<br />
Triggered encounters and virtual spaces would be great, but until EQ decides to borrow AO's idea (I know of one, uno, single contested ubermob in Anarchy Online, and the clan/Omni people fight over him, and the team works together to take it down while keeping the other team at bay.), first in force gets the mob.<br />
<br />
Do I think a rotation would be good for Fennin, though?  Probably not..  I'm having a hard time just wrapping my mind around the thought of the larger guilds talking to each other rather than KSing..  (Kudos to Hidden Circle for being courteous to our monks that helped them pull tonight, by the way.)<br />
<br />
I do think we stay here by choice, because we have friends here, we do.  *shrug*  Until those of us who desire a rotation can monopolize a mob until the others will listen, I don't think it'll happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I feel when people go around saying they &quot;deserve&quot; something and not &quot;I'll work on it&quot;, it makes them sound a tad bit more loot whorish. O.o  But that's just my opinion.  Because everyone could &quot;deserve&quot; something... just in their own special little way. :o</div></div><hr />
