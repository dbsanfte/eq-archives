<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>noober</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are the good high end droppable mask and waist for shammy? <br />
Saw that the Tae Ew Mask is very good as it provide free invis, Anyone can give me a PC of that? <br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Last time I saw that mask for sale it was 40K, but CT prices can get a little loopy.  If the Orc Fang Earring came from CT it would prolly be 10K at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">tae ew mask and death mask of elysians are both good choices.  I keep both with me (the tae ew for free invis, other for wearing).  I think the death mask runs around 10k or so, it's rare to see for sale, but not terribly pricey.<br />
<br />
Belt, I wear a walrus fang belt, 15 ac 50 hp 0.0 wt.  Girdle of mithaniel is a really good one if you can find one cheap, or have access to HoH.  Runebranded girdle pretty good too, I had a frog hand me one in sebilis a while ago, I keep it for the haste, but it's got 40 hp 3 sta and some other stats with the haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wear the blue diamond cultural veil and belt.  Most races' will have similar stats.  Check my Magelo for Ogre pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Omakay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Face - Death Mask of the Elysians (5kpp) or Crystal Spider Eyes (800pp)<br />
<br />
Waist - Girdle of the Blood Fiend, Girdle of Mithanial, Artificers Skirt or something (forgot name)... or if ya got pp or luck on drops Bone Clasped Girdle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">barbed rubicite belt is nice too 12ac 3 sta/wis/int/agi 40hp 25mana. I picked one up for 4k in the bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you're a barb, Artificer's Ringmail Skirt:  15ac, 5 wis, 40hp/mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chitinous Belt is junk now, but it's extremely cheap and is only slightly worse most of these other belts that cost x10 or more as much.<br />
<br />
AC 13, 5 wis some hp 10 v. disease.<br />
<br />
Death Mask isn't that rare really, if you bring a group to UP and slaughter Elysians in the SE corner.  We've gone ripping through there a few times.  Corrupted spawns soon enough.  Keep the druids twinks camped nearby for better than ToV gear for them.  <br />
<br />
I don't get that Shojen is worse than Ry'gorr and yet Elysian armor is better than ToV.</div></div><hr />
