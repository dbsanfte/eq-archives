<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">AA experience and I have a slightly amusing relationship.  I got my ranger up to 51 and excitedly read up on AAs.  Then I started playing my druid again.  I got him up to 51 and again started reading up on AA points.  Then, for reasons not worth going into at the moment, I started playing 19th level shaman.  Now my shaman is level 52 and I’m once again excited about AAs.  Unfortunately, I have yet to find a good guide explaining what our AAs really do.  There’s an exceptionally good guide for rangers at the Ranger’s Glade that not only explains what their AAs do but also suggests which ones to take in what order to take best advantage of them.  I could really use something like that for my shaman.  I’ve read about our class specific AAs on Casters Realm, but to be honest they sound like they more or less suck.  I think this is mainly due to my lack of understand of how they will effect my game play.  <br />
<br />
I’ve tried reading through a lot of threads, but unfortunately most people tend to use two letter abbreviations that only serve to totally confuse me, assuming that the reader already knows what they’re talking about.  Is there any kind of guide for the shaman AA beginner?  As soon as I’m a full yellow into 52 I plan to turn on 100% AA experience to get run three.  But after that I’m not sure.  <br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Level up to 60 before you worry about AAs other than run3. A Shaman at level 60 with Torpor and Malo is easily twice as powerful if not more than a level 59 Shaman with 100aas. <br />
<br />
And when you get to 60, go for Mental Clarity 3 and Cannibilization. When you do all that feel free to come back and ask again. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, tons of posts here about AA really...<br />
<br />
<br />
But I will give super short summary:<br />
<br />
1)  Spend 1st 3 AA points in Run to get Run3.  Each point increases innate run speed about 10%, for a total of 30%, almost like sow but you have it ALL the time, even in dungeons.<br />
<br />
2)  Spend next 3 AA points on Regeneration.  You are a Shammy and can canni-dance--enough said.<br />
<br />
3)  Most spend next 3 AA points on Mental Clarity.  You need Mental Clarity at level 3 before you can get Canni V (need to be level 59 to spend AA for Canni V).<br />
<br />
4)  Spend next AA points on Canni V</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you for your quick replies.  I’m still reading other posts, though the search feature won’t let me search for AA posts even using “AA**” as my search.  *shrugs*  But I do have a question about leveling to 60 before doing more than run three.  My understanding is that by level sixty most old world mobs will be green.  That would seriously reduce my options for hunting grounds.  Wouldn’t I be forced to hunt in PoP only at that point?  I’m grouping with a friend in Seb at the moment, hoping to loot a JBB at some point.  We’re having fun and I’m a bit worried about not being able to get xp there. <br />
<br />
Is this something I should worry about? I’ve only been to PoN a couple of times with my ranger so I’m very inexperience with the planes.  Is there enough opportunity for a non-guilded shaman in the planes that I should look forward to it instead of feeling forced to hunt there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No, 60 is fine, nothing really starts turning green/lt blue until 61+. I spent hours and hours in Seb at 60 and 95% of it will be dark blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">100% agreement with the above - canni5 &gt; all.<br />
<br />
After that, it's about what you want.  Spirit call isn't available till 61, but WOW, what a fun cheap ability.  Virulent paralysis is a lot more useful than I'd have thought - the pushback allows you (with some careful positioning) to knock a mob away from the pets (or tank) and root it all in one go.  Saves a LOT of time -- and lives, if that stuff isn't slowed yet.<br />
<br />
Pre-pop aa, personally I concentrated on quick buff.  With torpor now on a 3 second cast time, I put away chloroblast for good, since it has long since ceased to save anybody's life.  Not standing around dealing with the obscene long cast time on some of these buffs has removed a (to me) senseless aggrivation from the game, too.<br />
<br />
I also agree that leveling before aa is the key.  I don't have the greatest gear or the uberest friends, but I pull in an aa every day without a lot of effort.  It's a lot easier 60+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had 63 aa at 59 and it was very nice.   When I got to 60 with torpor I was perhaps only 30 or 40% stronger not 100% LoL.<br />
<br />
Core shaman AA stratagies mostly revolve around our level 60 torpor spell.<br />
<br />
Torpos is a heal over time spell that givies you 1200 hp for 200 mana.  A shaman can convert this back into mana using the various canabilzation spells for about at about 2 hp for 1 mana so you end up net 500 mana and this is the core of a high level shaman.<br />
<br />
run 3  (3 points)<br />
regen 3 (3 points, 6 total, Baron)<br />
<br />
mental clarity 3 (12 points, 18 points total,  Veneralbe title)<br />
<br />
Canibalization (Can V) ( 5 points, 23 total)<br />
This ability takes a huge chunk of HP and convets it to mana all at once every 3 mins.  With torpor and the Can IV spell and Can V you can make great chunks of mana.<br />
<br />
Other great skills to pick up...<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Reinforement 3 (SCR3) and SCR mastery (SCRM).  This extends the length of buffs and when compleated torpor will last 50% longer giving you a self heal spell that will heal 1800 hp for only 200 mana.<br />
<br />
Quick Buff (QB1, QB2, QB3)  This allows you to cast buff spells faster including torpor.  Torpor is normaly a 6 sec spell but with QB2 and a spell hast item or QB3 you can get torpor down to about 3 sedonds wich makes it a lot harder to interupt.<br />
<br />
Naturela Durabilty (ND3)  This gives you more HP and makes it safer to use Can V and thus makes torpor more effective.<br />
<br />
These are all pre PoP skills but post pop has some very nice skills also.  I would just say that most shaman choose the core aa skills to optimize for the use of torpor and mana recovery.  That takes about 70 or 80 aaxp depending on which kind of focus items you might have.  Lots of shaman also pick up some PoP skills because the are cheep / fun / effective, but I would think that most shaman spend the bulk of thier AA points for torpor.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and sorry for the garbage spelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For shaman its all about canni v.  Its power is unreal.  You must have mental clarity 3 to get canni v.<br />
<br />
Run 3 is the single best aa you will ever get (even better than canni v) as it will allow you to outrun mobs indoors.  If you are in seb, you understand this already :)  With a couple points in run I could make it from the chef to the exit alive and alone... there will be times when you have to run and cant just gate.<br />
<br />
I disagree with regen 3.  If you have torpor, you wont need it.  Until you do regen is very important.  As I had torpor before I finished run 3 (yah, I had 1 aa at 60) I spent my other 3 general aa points on metabolism 3 (less food/water for my horse to eat).<br />
<br />
Once you have canni v, its all about your playstyle.  I am a raiding shaman, so i went for Mass Group Buff.  If you dont raid, skip Mass Group Buff.<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend Radiant Cure, as it saves a spell gem, and works on curses and roots and snares as well as disease/poison.<br />
<br />
Virulent Paralysis is highly recomended as having a good root with interrupt that doesnt take a spell gem can be handy.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call is fun, and an easy way to add damage on demand.<br />
<br />
I am working on Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery now for longer buff duration (again, not as useful to a non-raid shaman).<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Mastery will save mana on every spell you cast, and is a good choice for any caster.<br />
<br />
Beyond this.. I just dont know yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well Radag I stand by my statement regardless of your LoL. Some of the best Shaman AAs revolve around the useage of our HoT spells, namely Torpor which we don't get until 60 and which you mentioned in your discussion of AAs (SCRM, QB). Fortunately for our younger Shaman they now have access to Stoicism and our wonderful non complete heal spell which I did not have. So 60 is not as big a step as it once was but compared to the power gain from 51-59, it's fair to say there is no comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Litchebane,<br />
<br />
I have been both 60 with a very few AA points and 59 with a significant number of AA points and it was my direct experiance that the differance between a level 59 shaman with 63 AA points and a level 60 shaman with 6 AA points / malo / torpor is not all that great.  I am not talking about speculation or theary,  I am talking about direct experiance in game.  Simply put,  I could kill things just as fast at 59 with a large number of AA points as I could when I was 60 with only a few.<br />
<br />
(60 + malo + torpor + 6 aa) &gt;&gt;&gt; (59 + 6 aa)<br />
(60 + malo + torpor + 6 aa) &gt;= (59 + Krags + Can V with 63 aa total)<br />
<br />
Your statement that a level 60 shaman with no aa is easily twice as strong as a level 59 shaman with 100 aa is simply in error.  I would not be surprised if a level 59 shaman with 100 aa and exactly the same equipmen as a level 60 with none could toast the oracle with some ease.<br />
<br />
I think it is likley that the statement you are standing on is build on speculation and not direct observation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks so much for your replies.  I&#8217;ve learned a lot about what some of our AA skills can do for us.  For now I&#8217;ll take your advice and after I get run three I&#8217;ll return to skilling up until I hit 60th level and go from there. But I&#8217;m going to keep reading up on them so I&#8217;ll be better prepared for spending my points when I get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stormaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One last use for AA's.  Being a very casual player, when the regular xp isn't coming in very fast, it can be pretty satisfying to switch over to AA's for a while and actually see the xp bar move, no matter where you're hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have been both 60 with a very few AA points and 59 with a significant number of AA points and it was my direct experiance that the differance between a level 59 shaman with 63 AA points and a level 60 shaman with 6 AA points / malo / torpor is not all that great.

<br />
This is true now, more or less, with kragg's mending now in the game but prior to that spell I would have to disagree as there was no good efficient way to use Big Can.  Back then Torpor and Big Can would have whiped up big over Big Can and Chloroblast or Sup Heal.  And that was a large complaint around here... well for the non uber or extremely lucky.  So in other words yes you have some support for your theory but that is due to changing circumstances and the general agreement around here is still to level to 60 as Torpor with Big Can is still more efficient than Big Can and Kragg's... and alot safer too...<br />
<br />
Kragg's and Big Can gives you 800 mana while un-AA-modded Torpor and Big Can gives you 1000mana.  The difference is not that much but in a pinch the extra mana will help you regain faster when you big can and have to do the Can 4 Torpor cycles... with AAs you can of course get an extra tick out of Torpor as well as decrease its casting time to 3 seconds!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just to be clear ... Cani5 is the best aa in our class and arguably in any class.<br />
<br />
It will cost you 23 aa to get cani 5.<br />
3 for runspeed<br />
3 for regen<br />
12 for mental clarity 3<br />
5 for Cani 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Also, since you asked, I've stopped at 60 for AAs and XP isn't bad.  The very very lowest mobs in OS have just gone green, but it's still almost entirely blue.  PoD/PoI/PoN/PoJ all have plenty of stuff to kill, I just got flagged for Valor and Storms, after getting blind invites to go hunt there for a couple months, Cazic Thule is fun, and there are a number of other very healthy XP areas around.<br />
<br />
However, I'm not going to 61 until one of the following happens:<br />
- I get Cann V<br />
- I'm convinced I don't need to XP in smaller than tier 2 zones, or the bigger parts of tier 1<br />
- My wife tells me I can.  ;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with most of the above, but I'm thinking that Run 3 is not all that necessary.  I did put my points in there, but as a guildmate pointed out<br />
<br />
  A) I don't run from mobs that often any more,<br />
<br />
  B) I don't go to &quot;indoor&quot; zones that often due to POP<br />
<br />
I would say Run 1 is useful since it allows you to outrun the &quot;default speed&quot; mob, but there are some other nice stats you can improve with your next AA's rather than run speed which is covered up with SOW 90% of the time or more.</div></div><hr />
