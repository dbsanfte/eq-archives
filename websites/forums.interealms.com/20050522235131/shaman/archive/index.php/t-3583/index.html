<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Several people on this board, and others, have talked about using a multi pc switch to control multiple accounts on multiple boxes, for example:<br />
<br />
2 computers in a room, 2 accounts active, all controlled by one computer (without EQW).<br />
<br />
The switch supposedly allows a user to hit a hotkey and run computer #2 from computer #1's monitor, keyboard, and mouse.<br />
<br />
Is this possible? And if so, where might I find one? : )<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gallaena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are looking for a KVM device. It's basically a switch box that you connect two or more computers to, along with monitor, keyboard and mouse. You only use one each of keyboard, monitor, and mouse. You can get them quite cheaply now - less than $100 I believe.<br />
<br />
I use one at work switching between a Win98 and Win2000 box.<br />
<br />
I just checked and there were bunches of them on Price Watch. Do a search on KVM. You want the entire unit, not just the cables that show up first (assuming you are sorting on price).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KittensDaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I started using a KVM (Keyboard Video Mouse) switch this weekend when I painted my office and had to consolidate the pc's.<br />
The only problem I notice is the keystrokes needed to switch between the computers includes me hitting the &quot;ENTER&quot; key, which has led to some funny things (logging in the wrong character as an example).<br />
My advice is that you dont necessarily want the cheapese one, as they are cheap for a reason.<br />
Also, talk to the sales person and see if they will let you open the manual so you can verify how to switch between the computers.<br />
<br />
I use a Belkin brand at work, and I love it as I have to hit  Scroll Lock , Scroll Lock, Up arrow to swtich between pcs. This is better than my generic one at home wheres its Scroll Lock, Scroll Lock, Number of Station and ENTER...<br />
<br />
Probably more info that you wanted, but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use a two port Linksys KVM at home.  Pushing the Ctrl key twice switches between the two PCs.<br />
<br />
As long as the two PCs are running at the same resolution and refresh rate, I can switch between them very quickly.<br />
<br />
Buy.com is selling a Linksys 2 port PS/2 KVM and two sets of cables for $35.00.  The sku is 10232552. <br />
<br />
There are USB KVMs now, and some KVMs will let you share speakers as well as the keyboard, video and mouse.</div></div><hr />
