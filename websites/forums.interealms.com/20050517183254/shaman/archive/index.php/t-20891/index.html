<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>junaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I start Junaper in August of 2000.  I must say that she was the best character I've ever created in any game.  <br />
<br />
As of late, there seems to be a mass exit from the game, and I can't say I blame the people for leaving.  I left the game for the Luclin &amp; PoP expansions to venture out and find a new better game.  I wasn't very successful and came back to EQ to hopefully rekindle the friendships/social environment that I had when I first started playing EQ.  <br />
<br />
I canceled my payments 2 months ago, and haven't played or thought about playing since.  I've tried multiple ways to change my play style to get more excitement out of the game (Trade Skills, Quests) pretty much anything other than XP grinding.  I've explored the old level that I was excited to see and explore when I was younger, and it brings back a lot of memories, but get very discouraged that I can't see the higher end game without turning EQ into my full time job.  I have put almost 3 years into playing Junaper, and feel that I should be able to see the elementals planes/Time without have to dedicate 40 hours a week to some guild to raid.  A game should NEVER require that much time to see what could be considered the end game.<br />
<br />
I'll admit on my way out that Shaman are really broken compared to the character that I started in 2000 (Kunark Era).  But that is the way the game has evolved, and it is no longer the game that I enjoy.  I remember when I start playing the game lore that was involved in the game was great, the game no longer has the sence of RPG, but more of a stamped out set of level/zones.  I personally don't think that their will ever be a game (for me at least) like the Original EQ. <br />
<br />
I've always loved my Shaman and will greatly miss all the friends that I have met in EQ.  It looks like it is time for me to find a new hobby or game.  Have fun all, and thanks for the memories.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  You hit the nail on the head with that post. For me anyway. I left EQ for about 3 months while I tried to really get into Final Fantasy XI but like you said, it couldn't do what EQ did for me. As with allot of other games out there none can match the feelings and celebrations that EQ gave me back in the original game in 99. It's amazing how much EQ has provided for players and how it managed to keep them for years. No game since the Atari days has kept me for 5 years like this one has. It's trully amazing how RIGHT the game designers got it when they created EQ. Good times and bad, EQ was really the correct way to make an online roleplaying game. To drive so many people to play for so many years is just unreal. <br />
<br />
  As you posted, the new EQ is really empty as far as lore and storyline . It's all over but the crying as far as I'm concerned. The game expansions coming out fit into the original story of EQ like a square peg in a round hole. It was really evident, as Troll kicked out of Grobb, that the deep and truly interesting storyline of Everquest was dead. Frogs were the flavor of the month and helped push the sale of the expansion that, to be honest with you, was the first of many flimsy expansions. None of them added to the geography of Norrath at all. They were &quot;clicky object&quot; zone expansions that felt completely disconnected from the world in which they supposedly exisited in since the beginning of Norrath. I guess I am rambling now, but it's a few examples of the lazy mind at work on a story they obviously didn't read or care to expand on in any logical manner. The new boss is running EQ now and has no clue what EQ was and should have been. Shaman have been expansioned out of the SoE EQ future and soon the game will be nothing like what we all fell in love with.<br />
