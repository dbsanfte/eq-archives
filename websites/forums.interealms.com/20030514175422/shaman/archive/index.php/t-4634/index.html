<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Those of you who have completed it... how difficult was it? Fixing to do this quest soon, wondering if I'll be able to do it all with 2 ish groups of 60s. Well, mostly wondering about Yael; I know we can kill Phini, the WW dude, and it takes one person to pick something off the ground ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only real bottleneck for this quest is Yael.  I know many people waiting on the Yael bit because he is up about as much as Tormax on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would imagine Phinny is a big bottleneck as well :&gt;<br />
<br />
2 well balanced groups should be all right though. What I would do is get your groups down there, log off and get on your CR halfling rogue (never leave for the Hole w/o one) and have it take the initial DT, then quickly log back on and help with the battle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nah... Phinny is a 16 hours spawn that every wizard and mage on the server as to kill half a dozen time AT LEAST to luck out on their epic pieces. He may not stay up very long but he goes down a LOT, unlike tormax who does not stay up very long but only shows up once or twice a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">been waiting on yeal for months here, guy is never ever up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Phini isn't hard to attend for a killing, and most of the people who kill him have no idea what the piece of Coral is for. So it's relatively simple to obtain. Mages might have to kill him like twice before getting their staff -- it's not that rare. Wizzies and Bards however, have to kill him a LOT before their items drop; Wizzies especially.<br />
<br />
Hoping to get some Burn assistance for Yael, if I can catch him alive.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info guys =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mages might have to kill him like twice before getting their staff -- it's not that rare.<br />
<br />
Quite untrue. The average drop rate for the Water staff is the same as the Wizard and Bard pieces. 10+ Kills is not even slightly abnormal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am sorry to sound ignorant, but what is the Strength of Elements?  ( I tried to do a search, but nothing came up).<br />
<br />
Could anyone let me know where the quest starts, if there are any Race / religion limitations on getting the quest, etc.<br />
<br />
All your help is much appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<br />
&quot;strength of the elements&quot;<br />
<br />
Is all you need to type. Include quotes for more accurate results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Soupy,<br />
<br />
I was searching the boards, not google.  Thank you for the tip though.<br />

<br />
Strength of the Elements<br />
AC 15<br />

Fire Resist 15<br />
Cold Resist 15<br />
Hit Points 100<br />
Should slot - all/all<br />
No Drop<br />
<br />
A very nice shoulder slot for Troll/Ogres.  The 100 hps goes along ways although I have just picked up an ODS again and prefer it over SotE.<br />
