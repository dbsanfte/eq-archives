<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been gone for a while but at first it was hard for me to get groups... Possibly cuase I was looking around BoT and other PoP zones.  I was soon told about WoS and DoN.  I was told Exp wise you couldn't go wrong with these spot, they were called the latest BoT.  I tend to work swings so when I get home after 12:30am I go looking for a group in WoS.  On the weekend this works ok but on weekdays good luck finding any group out there at these times.  I'm on the nameless server, and I need a small idea of what other places I can go later in the day to goot good groups.  It's just hard to find a group late in the evening I know.  I considered trying NC but it seems my mana would be strained by some of the mobs out there.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion is a good suggestion.  Also I just turned the big 65.  So I hope life gets easier getting groups for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Webbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WoS would be my best bet for a place to get a group.  I usually get home and online around the same time as you.  Once you group a couple times there and distinguish yourself a bit you should have no problems getting a group.<br />
<br />
Equipment wise it is a pretty good option as well.  Take a look at my face, head, range, and one of the earrings.  They all dropped for me in groups in the last couple weeks.  Not to mention I have about 8 runes banked for when I level.<br />
<br />
While you are in WoS keep your eyes open for OoW armor quest items.  Samanna has a great listing that has served me well.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DoN is the new LDoN, you can get groups there pretty consistently there as long as you make yourself available, and make yourself known. this doesn't mean spamming constantly in OOC &quot;blah blah LFG&quot; but its ok to say something every 5 - 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
WoS is a good zone to get groups, but the numbers are a little low at that hour, make friends with the few that stay there and you'll get a regular group there.<br />
<br />
typically, if I want to group, I'll put up LFG and go solo in nearby areas, if you want to group in WoS, try your hand at NC murks, if that doesn't work for you, farm faction in DS. if you want a group in DoN, start GM ancestral armor quest and work on that in Stillmoon. there are mobs that you can kill for a little EXP/loot while LFG, that way you aren't idly getting bored for nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've got a pally friend, and he learned something pretty quickly. He'd go where he wanted to group, and if nobody wanted him, he'd try to solo stuff there. If he couldn't, he'd just help the group that was there with heals and stuff, small as they were. When a slot opened, they'd usually take him.</div></div><hr />
