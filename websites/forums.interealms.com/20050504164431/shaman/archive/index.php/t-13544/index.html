<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
      We were in PoD last night (a 59 warrior, 59 necro, 54 druid, 52 monk, 51 Shammy (me) and a 50 cleric) camping the CCY (center courtyard).  Thing were dying quickly and it was going great, but then about a half-hour later the cleric ays that she has to go (bummer, but ahhwell).  Do you believe that we didn't kill annother thing for over an hour because we couldn't find a cleric!!?!!<br />
       OK, here my question... I'm really just starting to play in the PoP zones, so my experiance is nill here; could the druid and I have kept up with the healing necessary for the camp?  The mobs were red to me, and I think yellow to the druid.  There was no doubt that the exp was great when we were rolling, but overall I could have done better in Dulak (due to the downtime).  And I know that I could have been healing in Dulak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Next time, before the cleric leaves, ask him to let you guys try healing and see if you can do it :shrug:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you even try to go on without the cleric?  Only way to really know is to keep pulling and see how it goes.  My suspicion is that it would have been significantly slower since the druid wasn't 58 with Tunare's Renewal and you don't have Kraggs or Torpor, but I don't know how much damage your tank was taking, how fast you were killing, etc...  With the necro mana tapping as often as possible, you using mini-torpor between pulls to help top off the tank, keeping Regrowth on the tank, and both you and the druid healing I'd think it was doable but of course slower than with a cleric just popping a CH every so often.<br />
<br />
Like I said before though, the only way to know for sure is to give it a try.  I'd have had the monk pull singles carefully for a bit and see how it went then judge from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, you will have been using Superior Healing, and the druid also, or maybe the 44 quest heal from LoY if he had it. It would have been tough, but if you could slow mobs reliably, it might have been worth a try.<br />
<br />
I find, if a cleric leaves, I will offer to heal. It might mean slower pulls, but it's certainly better than none at all, while we wait for a healer to come along.<br />
<br />
Oh, and don't forget in a group like that, the necromancer can help a lot with his own heals. This is often overlooked, but he can give his health to someone else in the party, and this can be a lifesaver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think that it would have been very nasty.<br />
<br />
The reason I like having a cleric is so that if I get a slow resist (which is very likely fighting yellow and red mobs) then the cleric can heal me.<br />
<br />
If you've only got you and the druid then an unslowed mob would've ripped you a new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">IMO the hardest part would have been managing aggro with all those Sup heals though.<br />
<br />
You had a beefy tank so if Malosi landed and you got Turgurs in it would be cake.  You would have needed to work out a healing routine to control aggro.  At 59 the necro probably wasn't getting many resists and could always crowd control in a pinch.<br />
<br />
Stoicism is your friend.   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the quick responses, It seemed as thought he tanks HP's were going down pretty fast with the cleric there, so. I duuno, but you guys are right.  We should've tried with the cleric there, I didn't think of that (/em smacks himself in the head for being shortsighted).<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Necro can do amazing things..they get a group lifetap at 59 or 60 that is REALLY useful.  They can do some mezzing, and can Dot like crazy.<br />
<br />
Have you tried aggro-kiting with a necro? It's pretty damn awesome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A properly played Necro is a force to behold. <br />
<br />
Fast heals no. That is what the druid and the Shaman are for. The panicy spam heals.  But That necro could keep a tank in health all night long. If they knew what to do.<br />
<br />
Also. Our regen is so often overlooked. People always say What difference is 15/25 hp when the monster is hitting for 300.<br />
<br />
The difference is huge. Try it some time. Let people bleed. Dont use top off heals that waste alot of mana. Let the regen do its work and you just might be amazed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I functioned as sole-healer + slower there at 53 for over 3 hours without a death. Without any form of clarity.<br />
<br />
You and the Druid could have handled it.</div></div><hr />
