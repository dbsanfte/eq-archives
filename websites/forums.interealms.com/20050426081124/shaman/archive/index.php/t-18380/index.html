<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why do so many people talk of farming IA?<br />
<br />
I've had a look at the prices of things on Allakhazam's and ...well...averagge about 3k an item :P why bother?<br />
<br />
Is there something I am missing that puts this place on a par with Droga...or Veksar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I made over 200k in about a weeks worth of casual camping there.  Bought all my level 65 spells.  I assume the price on the drops has gone down a bit since I farmed there but the drops are still very worth it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The drops are fairly stable in price on RN and for Shaman it is pretty easy to farm 5 nameds. Getting to the first named is easy without having to fight. Just invis to the skellies, then invis vs undead up the stairs. Re-invis and run straight ahead through the room. The spawn directly in the middle is a single pullable ph or named. Kill him. Go right through the door (invis) and click on the statue. Welcome to IA. Head down the stairs and into the big room. Ph/named on the pot there. I usually just run into the corner if he is up and go toe to toe with the mob in the corner, then pull the named to that spot, or ph to start the cycle. Head back out, and right through the door guarded by 2 mobs. In that room are 2 cells, which you can ignore. There is one static spawn between the two jail cells which is a named or ph. Kill him. Go back out of the jail and up the stairs to the right. Head diagonally across and down the stairs. Round the back is a room. Directly across from the door in the room is a chair with either a named or ph. Just handle him there, or pull to the middle of the room. I think there is a named up more stairs from the courtyard but I haven't seen him pop.<br />
<br />
mobs hit for less than 200, named around 400 and all are easily slowable without malo/malos at 65. Average drop from trash is 5-20pp in cash/runes. Swords dropped sell for about 150pp. It isn't difficult to make 50K a week there, if you can handle the boredom.<br />
<br />
I used to spend a lot of time there but with all spells bought, and most equipment in the bazaar either stupidly priced or just not that much of an upgrade I just use it to farm for alchemy cash.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I guess part of the thing with IA is that the trash mobs often drop 20pp worth of vendor junk, and the swords are 150pp. Combine that with the named drops and its not that bad.<br />
<br />
Some loot there goes for well over 2-3k. Not spent ages there but I did get a compass (range slot item, decent stats) that sold for 8k so fast I think I should have asked for more :)</div></div><hr />

the compass regularly goes for around 12k on karana.</div></div><hr />

From Grimling forest you just invis into the cave and run to AC. If invis drops or you get caught by a see invis mob just train to the zone in. Once inside refresh invis and head forwards, take the first right, then the second left. Go round the corner and you will see a gate with two mobs guarding it. Go through the gate and take a left, quick right into the courtyard, and hug the left wall round until you see the stairs. I have only ever had a see invis mob one time out of tons of trips to get here. If it happens you can either fight or gate. I don't even /con until I get to the first gate anymore.<br />
<br />
Stop before you get in agro range of the skeletons guarding the steps .They see invis. Wait here until you see a grimling path to the steps, stop, and path back. As soon as he is out of sight again take an invis to undead potion. Run up the steps and turn left. Stop before you get to the opening and re-invis. Run straight into the huge room and turn right. There is a gate to the right. Go through there, up the stairs and click on the statue on the right wall of the room. Welcome to Inner Acrylia.<br />
<br />
I just realized that there are other posts on this that can help. I thought typing this felt familiar. You can find more info here.<br />
