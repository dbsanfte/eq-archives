<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bronzestar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After a year and a half &quot;clean&quot;, I have fallen off the wagon and started EQing again. Rather than hunting down my old chars and servers, I decided to start a new character (Ciarraide) on a new server (Ayonae Ro), and see how it all worked out. Here are my observations/strategy so far....<br />
<br />
Level 1: I arrive in Halas, admire then new UI, note that I have some free spells, free backpack, etc. After dumping 5 points into 1hb, I immediately speak to Jinkus Felligan, and start off on my quest for the Initiate Symbol of Justice. For the unaware, this is a No-Drop AC3, WIS+1, MANA+3 item that allows you to summon a magical hammer. (1HB, 6/32, BANE vs undead +3). Makes early life MUCH easier, especially against skellies. Since the quest hauls you through Qeynos, I also stop in N Qeynos and kill rats, collecting Plague Rat tails until my inventory is full. Return to Halas nets me the Symbol, 12pp and change(from selling tails), and level 2.<br />
<br />
Level 2-5: I buy all my spells, and exiting notice a new (to me) Shammie Master. Lo, and behold - a Shammie Newbie Armor Quest!!! I used to bitterly complain of the lack of this quest, and now it has been created. I collected the kit, the molds, etc, and head out onto the tundra, pausing only to buy a sewing kit and 2 each of the patterns to make a full set of Tattered Armor.<br />
<br />
I note that Polar Bear skins are required en masse to create this armor, and assume that Polar Bear Cubs still drop them about 1 in 5 or 6 kills. I am proved to be sadly mistaken. The drop rate on these skins has been severely cut - I started keeping track after my first drop, and managed to pick up a Polar Bear Skin one in ever 17 or so cub kills. Sigh. While amusing myself in the hunt for bears, I do manage to create a full set of Tattered, and give away two others to Trivial my sewing skill on Tattered.<br />
<br />
I park myself at the tree at the three-way intersection below the PoK book, and begin pulling every Cub, Skellie and Spiderling that walks by.<br />
When the dust settles, and after 6 fatalities (Wolf Packs and Vengefuls) I am level 5, with a full set of Shaman armor, 4 HQ pelts, 2 stacks of silks and 4 stacks of Bone Chips. Time to head to the PoK!<br />
<br />
Level 5-8: I head up to the PoK, aiming to sell off my loot quickly and make enough money to buy all my level 5 spells and a couple of other armor pieces to fill in the gaps left by my newbie armor. (Which is awesome, btw - better than the armor I had on my old Shammie char at level 25....). I send out an /auc in the PoK advising the availability of my items. 30 seconds later I am blinking, 50pp richer, with my inventory empty. I decide to investigate. I head to the bazaar, and find that Bone Chips are now selling for 20-25pp a stack, HQ Skins anywhere from 20-50pp each, and Silks are going as high as 10pp EACH. Inflation at work. This begins the process of collecting these items from a few newbie areas each time I am on, then selling them in the bazaar at 50% of the lowest going rate. I am never in the bazaar longer than 10 minutes as a trader, and by level 15 I have 2K pp banked.<br />
<br />
Back to levelling. I now head to the Everfrost entrance to BlackBurrow, and begin soloing the 4 guards posted along the hallway. With a six-minute respawn rate here, after breaking spawn for the deadly duo at the entrance, you have a minute and a half to finish each combat. This area can be used to collect rusty weapons and gnoll skins for resale, but I chose to ignore these items for my nefarious purpose of collecting Gnoll Fangs. About 1 in 6 or 7 gnolls drops a Gnoll Fang, and they even stack! When I am finally nauseated by the sounds of gnoll voices whining, I gate back to PoK, and Book it to Qeynos. I seek out Captain Tillin in the arena, and turn in 20ish Fangs. I then turn in the resulting Moonstones to McNeal Jocub in Fish's Ale as well, and have achieved level eight after about 6 hours of total work.<br />
<br />
Comments? Ideas? Improvements? I am actually level 16 currently, and will also write up the 8-16 notes if anyone is interested. Thanks for all the great info on these forums!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, get your but to Paludal Caverns asap . <br />
<br />
There is a NPC at the enterance his name is luvtehnoobs. He hands out free level 24's to everyone who hails him hehe.<br />
<br />
Just kidding, but the exp is just that sick there that one day it just could happen hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bronzestar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the tip, Zodiaxx :-) I actually have my char in PC right now, at lev 17. It is one of my least favorite zones, but the soloing in &quot;Mushroom Alley&quot; is tough to pass up. At 18 I will depart, never to return, probably headed for KFC in S Karana.  I'll keep notes, just in case any other newbies are interested at some point in the future.<br />

Before going to PC make a stop at Warrens. wipe out all the kobolds you can find and collect the teeth that drop. Head to the pally guild in Erudin and turn in the teeth for xp and ring mail which sells nicely to the merchants.</div></div><hr />
