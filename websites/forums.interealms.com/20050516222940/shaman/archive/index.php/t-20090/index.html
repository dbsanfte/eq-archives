<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alrighty, a friend and I decided to make a little trio action because one of his friends is coming back and starting fresh.  As of this moment, we have been duo'ing a monk and my shaman.  Now my question is, what would be best to add to this mix, were both 52, and are going to pl his friend to 52.  We were leaning towards a SK or pally, yet really are unsure, plesae help! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meogurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SK, can't beat the snare.  I made one to duo with my shammy and she rocks. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if you're just making a trio - I'd have to recommend:<br />
<br />
SK / CLR / ENC as about the best trio you can get for yourself.<br />
<br />
Slows, Haste, tankage, HP/AC buffs, rezzes, FD, snares, heals, mez, DoTs, HT, pets, charm, summon corpse, reverse damageshields, clarity - KEI , etc.<br />
<br />
Pound for pound those 3 classes together would be pretty versatile IMO and provide better all around support than a monk / shm - and you could all level together and have some fun, plus have the shm in reserve for when you just want extra buffs.<br />
<br />
If you want to stick with the monk / shm / ??? , then I'd recommend paladin for rezzing later on, although you'd do well with either knight class.<br />
<br />
I still think clr/enc/sk trio is darned near impossible to beat for self-reliance and versatility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only thing weak with what we going going, would be crowd control.  Who cares though? Both sk and pally can fd, and well I can boot it out if I need.  As for KEI, I always get it before I go anywhere and also I always have druid buffs because when I need pot9 them onk logs his druid to buff.  The shammy can slow, haste, and also tank if things get bad.  The sk later on with his taps will also save on mana.  Still would like mor efeed back though on what I should choose :) thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm going to assume you meant to say the monk and SK could FD.  Because the only time I've ever seen a paladin FD - it was closely followed by a cleric /rs INC REZ on Pallie_01.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paly's cant FD homey...<br />
<br />
*Edit - Beat me to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My bad, didn't reread my post.  Meant to say monk and shadowknight.  lol damn it :P Not that stupid sheesh lol.  Sorry hah, damn people couldn't even be supportive to just say I think you missed typed something :P they gotta cut me down ;) lol. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pally or SK would be ideal.  Can't go wrong with either one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I assume that you are a shaman , and your friend is the monk.  To add to this?  That's a hard choice.  <br />
<br />
I'd say Paladin.  <br />
<br />
Paladin can tank (and hold agro great),  great DPS against undead.  You have resses,  a backup healer for your shaman.   The monk or the paladin (with Lull) can pull depending on the situation.  <br />
<br />
Shadowknight would be great for snares, but you would lose hp buffs/symbols,  extra healing, resses, and i think those would be more important in my eyes.<br />
<br />
With your slows, and yours + paladins healing, you should be pretty well set I would think.  Paladin can hold agro, and the monk can FD and mend himself, so you wouldn't have to concentrate on him too much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would go with Pally or Necro.<br />
<br />
If you want a tank, I'd go Pallie over SK in your case. Monk has FD and pacify for pulling. Pally has stuns, res, and backup heals over SK.<br />
<br />
Or go necro for all out DPS, snare, res, undead mez/charm, etc.</div></div><hr />
