<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Morizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any ideas how to get the guys to spawn.<br />
<br />
#1 Is he always up after a patch?<br />
<br />
#2 Is assassin are better than the tubes to kill him?<br />
<br />
anyone have the answers to this, thi is even more frustrating the finding the stupid page in com, dumb named courier.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I do not think they are up after patch.<br />
<br />
As far as i know any mob in their respective spawn area is a potential place holder.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what you mean with #2 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've seen him faster in assasin camp but that of course ma have been luck, so no idea I'm afraid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are actually 3 Comm1 camps and 2 Comm 2 camps.  <br />
<br />
Comm1 :<br />
Assassins room - Seems to be the quickest spawn rate.  Need a rogue to pickpocket the door in.<br />
<br />
North C1 - from the temple front door, veer right (past the see invis snake), thru the short L corridor, the next room he can spawn at any of the lower level spawns.  Been a few months, I think 9 possible spawn points here.  All mobs are PH's, clear them all.<br />
<br />
South C2 - from the temple front door, go up the ramp in front of you, thru the door, thru the L corridor, first door on your right.  There are 8 spawns in this room, he can pop in any of these spots so while some people pacify thru it, it is better to clear it.  Then thru the short corridor, there is the mirror to North Comm1, another 9 spawns where he can spawn.<br />
<br />
<br />
Comm2<br />
North C2 - up the tube from North C1 - 9 spawns in this room, again I think he can spawn in any of these spots.  Then out the door of this room, there are 4 spawns do the left and 4 to the right, and he can spawn in any of these as well.<br />
<br />
South C2  - up the tube from South C1.  The only camp I never actually did, I think it is the mirror of North C2 but I'm not sure about the 8 spawns outside the main room.<br />
<br />
From months of camping these on various toons, I'd say :<br />
<br />
NC1 is the easiest of the camps for a shammy, you can solo it.  <br />
C2 is the hardest to get for most classes because they can't get to it alone, and depending on the skill / abilities of your group it can take 5 minutes to an hour (ugh) to get everyone up to C2.  Then after you are up there it is a monotonous grind to kill the PH's over and over and over waiting for the Commander to pop.<br />
<br />
South camps seemed to have better drop rates, but maybe it just seemed that way because a guild we were competing against was always there and we were always in North  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One thing that should be made clear is that Comm 'camps' only refer to places people pull mobs to, not where the mobs pop.  Every mob on the 1st floor is a PH for comm1 just like every mob on 2nd floor is PH for comm2.  I've had a Comm1 spawn in the 4spawn past the center door, in the 8spawn next to Rhag1's room and also the back tube to the basement.<br />
<br />
As to the assissin camp being faster, it may be.  But thats only because you have a high quantity of mobs in one place allowing for faster pulls.<br />
<br />
Finally, like many zones with named w/ PHs, there is usually 1 up on server reset.</div></div><hr />

This is wrong.<br />
If you go near a tube going up or down, the comms can spawn at one of the 3 spots right around the tube or one of the 2 guard positions guarding the ramp going into the tube area.  They have never ever spawned for anyone I know of at any of the 4 spots around the box that contains the tube.  I've personally helped camp about 20 comm 1 and similar number comm 2 for myself and friends.  It's totally a waste of time to kill them unless you like bad xp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had them spawn on the corners...<br />
And the above poster is correct, C1 can spawn in any location on first floor.<br />
C2 can spawn on any location on the second floor.<br />
The only camp for them is where ever you decide to stake a claim...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He isn't wrong, if you haven't seen it doesn't mean its incorrect, I've seen them spawn round the outside of C1N around the sides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've never seen comm1 spawn at the entrance mobs, but I haven't killed them extensively so that isn't really conclusive.  However, I have seen comms spawn in just about every other spot and position on the first and second floors.  I killed about 40 comm2's before I finally won the piece.  I can safely say that all spawn points give the same chance at being respawned as a commander - it is completely random.<br />
<br />
Also, they are almost always up after a patch, just like most mobs that spawn from PH's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have killed so many damn snakes it is beyond reason....<br />
<br />
It is true that EVERY snake on F1 and F2 are potential placeholders.  Even the once in the entry room - killed one commander there before.<br />
<br />
No camp is any &quot;better&quot; than another camp in regard to the pop rate... it just appears that way because there is a high concentration of MOBs in certain areas (e.g., assasin's room).<br />
<br />
People usually kill at the tubes for two reasons:<br />
<br />
1) They are pretty clearly identified so as to easily establish your &quot;camp&quot; to avoid cross-pulling.<br />
<br />
2) You can pull from areas where BOTH commanders may spawn.  Most people need both commanders so this gives folks a shot for them.<br />
<br />
Me personally?  I liked the Rhag2 tube (South tube as described before) because once I'm there, I can be pretty choosy over who I allow to join my &quot;farming&quot; session and also because it's the area with the most least contested spawns (I have no worries about someone quickly moving in to kill my commander pop if I'm engaged with something else).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wanted to add a bit of insights....<br />
<br />
The biggest one is... ONLY one Commander on each level can be up at a time.. PERIOD.... Sorta important when you are camping him and he happens to be up behind a locked door which you cant get to (Ass, AL Door, XTC/HP Door)<br />
<br />
Seems to be a higher frequency of pop rates in Ass room, the middle pop of all the 3 spawn areas, or the two guards set in front any tube.<br />
<br />
Temple Patrollers pretty much not a PH... Soloed the front room, none.... The 8 pop outside of Rhags1 while waiting, none...<br />
<br />
There are certain spots Coms I've never seen em pop... ie Mystics, XezochanterMobDude (forgot name obviously /wink), and oddball mobs associated with a named(like all the undead snakes.. Rhags1 room for example)... <br />
<br />
Aside from that, every other snake is a placeholder, INCLUDING ones behind the 3 locked doors...  <br />
Ass/AssTube = Rogue<br />
AL Door key drops from Com1 dude<br />
XTC/HP Door Key drops from Com2 dude</div></div><hr />
