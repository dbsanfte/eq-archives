<br />
What we need is Hi end mobs to drop arrows, and get bane fixed on arrows. So have sissar bane/seru bane/ human bane etc etc so we have to carry a few arround with us.  Archery just sucks against hi AC mobs ie in SSra. Sissar bane arrows would make it worth while, they could even make some questable .</div></div><hr />

why? cause it will only be of any use to endless quiver rangers.<br />
If you take up a loot slot on something like the emperor/cursed/blood etc for an arrows other classes will go ballistic. ( kinda like how everyone was pissed when 3 loot slots on a mob went to monk only gear)  <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, you can put some bad ass arrows on upper end mobs as RARE drops that would be great. ie: ssra rhags, arx key mobs, doomshade etc.</div></div><hr />

How about weapons with +archery mods etc. I really dont see a problem. With a loot table of 10 items and 3 drop, dont see a problem they drop 2handers that rot often enough anyway.  If they can get bane arrows to work will make a big difference, i just got my primal bow but on ssra mobs archery still sucks major ass, to be honesy im looking for shovel of the harvest and haste item for these mobs  :) onlyway i can really have decent dps.</div></div><hr />

That would just prove that Verant has no common sense. Imbued emerald jewlrey all has poison resistances on it. It would be way more logical to have it be +5 Poison Damage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylvos</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really do not like the way that Verant is catering to only certain players with these new trade skills. I have done a lot of hunting and I have not found *yet* an arrow recipe for Karana arrows nor anything that would allow a half elf to make use of these new skills. Granted a half elf isn't a &quot;pure&quot; race since it is both human and elf (high,dark or wood) but that is also a big &quot;so sorry&quot; to the players who have gone through hours and hours of fletching to attain 241 fletching and not be able to use the really good arrows. I do not feel that being a half elf and Karana worshipper should nullify my ability to do the same damage or take part in tradeskills and equip an item like an arrow as a wood elf who worships Tunare.<br />
Sean can attest to the bitter outrage that exploded in guildchat when I tried to use both the Fier'Dal Forge and then the Fletching kit and was denied. <br />
Verant really should think about exactly how many variations of each class/race/diety they have before the put the time into developing these really neat tradeskills( I am really pleased with these new skills don't get me wrong -really nice ideas) before they alienate even more players. <br />
*rant off*<br />
Now as far as arrow drops, I am in complete agreement with perhaps a quest arrow or even better a dropped arrow that really gives the already overpowered archery mastery a new facet.<br />
examples of how they could scale like melee weapons, no ranger is gonna use any bow over a Primal bow. the 33/35 and the proc make it more damaging than any bow in the game. So in order to give the rangers who go on raids and kill the higher end mobs, perhaps a progression like this.<br />
1. Ssra Rhag 1 &amp; 2 - dmg 12 150 range <br />
2. Basement - Glyphed-Exiled - dmg 13 175 range<br />
3. Basement Cursed - dmg 14 200 range +2 bane disease.<br />
4.  Emporer - dmg 15 200 rng +2 fire bane damage.<br />
5. Vex Thal - dmg 16 250 rng +3 fire/magic/cold/disease bane.<br />
Just an idea of how archery can have a scaled damage table dependant on what mobs you fight and the rewards you reap, since like last night like Sean pointed out;  in order to compete with the damage from AM3 we would have to dual wield 2 22/16 weapons. <br />
Just some thoughts.</div></div><hr />

My guild compared to most guilds has a crap load of rangers. We have I think 6 or so. Of those 4 of us curently have endless quiver. Once we get 6 arrows the rest that drop are totally useless since all the rangers will have one. however, if mob_00 drops some great bow that a FEW classes can use.. then the rangers will of course get the first ones but after we get 6 of them the rest of them can go to other classes to use. A good example is the war bow of rallos zek. ( although this bow sucks). AT this point our rangers don't take this bow but instead of rotting many other melee are using it as a 100hp range slot item. <br />
<br />
*shrug* I agree awesome arrows as drops would be cool.. but I HATE seeing class specific loot rot. We have twinks using avatar of war legs.....</div></div><hr />

I haven't gotten much of a chance to play lately due to finals week here, but I only have 202 fletching and haven't made any of these arrows yet anyway.  Anyway... will take a look when I get some time... but I'm sure you'll see them in a patch before then.</div></div><hr />

Do you know how many cultural tradeskill people I know that can and/or will make Seafarer Chain?<br />

<br />
HALF     ELF ... you have no culture =( This is why you can wear Tier Dal Armor. it says it in the description when you pick your char, in the manual, and on many sites. It wouln't be fair to give them both cultures, or their own. <br />
<br />
now the karana/tunare thing, i think you should get some seriously sweet stuff coming soon, just hang on. They need some uber items for their little halfling rangers! =P</div></div><hr />

Ivandyr hoop is crap compared to HoT...  saying that Karana rangers got a fair trade by being able to use that while Tunare rangers get HoT is ridiculous.  Ya, I certainly hope that when PoP comes out that Karana rangers will finally get some items to balance things out.  Not going to hold my breath on it tho.<br />
<br />
A new high dmg arrow is too important of an item to be race restricted like this.  After busting my ass to get the 27 pts for archery skills, I'll be damned if I'm gonna think its ok for someone who chose Tunare instead of Karana to have a better arrow (and consequently higher dmg output) than me solely on the basis of clicking one box instead of the other when they created the char.  That's just lame.  VERY lame...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Ivandyr hoop is crap compared to HoT... saying that Karana rangers got a fair trade by being able to use that while Tunare rangers get HoT is ridiculous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ivandyr's Hoop wasn't crap for the first two years of the game, and was in fact one of the best earrings you could get.  The same was true of the Minotaur's Ribcage back then, and to some degree the Hero's Bracer till they changed it after 4 months.  Things progress and its relative value compared to post velious gear has diminished.  I suspect the same will be true of the HoT as more players and their guilds build strength to kill Dain, Tormax, THO, etc.  When Karana items are found, I likewise suspect they will be very nice compared to what came before them, but as PoP is torn apart, its relative value will decease just as the HoT did.<br />
<br />
And from looking at the stats of the new test arrows compared to the old ones, it looks like the only advantage the Tunare only arrow MIGHT have is a slightly longer range.  But with a 200 range bow and 150+ arrows, you are already well outside the AE range of most encounters to begin with, so the extra range is moot.</div></div><hr />

Um... that is hardly comparable to Karana rangers not getting:<br />
- equivalent to POG helmet<br />
- no Karana-only cultural items<br />
<br />
Also, as a follower of Tunare, I can use that also. Least we forget that there are rangers that follow tunare besides the little elves?<br />

<br />
Both half elves in general and half elf ranger options have been around since the beginning. It's not like every player of a half elf (or a half elf ranger) started their character after culture was added to the game.<br />
<br />
Many players of half elves started their characters blind to knowledge that much later after they had already invested a lot of time into their character that they would then be officially classified in 2001 as cultureless to point of not being able to create cultural items due to mixed heritage. We had no pre-existing warning or knowledge that half elves would get the very short end of the tradeskill stick.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think what many players of wood elves (and especially those who started their wood elf ranger after culture was added) here fail to see is that most of the fun with tradeskill items is by creating them yourself. Many of us players of half elves would gladly throw away the ability to use everyone else's cultural items for the much more limited useability of those who can make cultural items themselves. Sure, one can make an alt to make these things for you.. it really isn't the same as being able to do it with the character that you primarily plat.<br />
<br />
<br />
To blame or criticize those who play half elves for their lack of cultural tradeskill options (as if they knew) is just tossing salt on an already festering wound.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Similarly applies to Karana followers, and their lack of Karana worshiper items. Did they know they would get left out a lot due to their choice of diety? No. Could they have known ahead of time? Definately not.</div></div><hr />

Looks like &quot;blessing&quot; is adding 20 range at least on these arrows. In theory this would give us 11/170 on the blessed champion arrows if the pattern holds. <br />

I hope that given the high skill needed blessed champions are at least damage 12 but we shall see. <br />
