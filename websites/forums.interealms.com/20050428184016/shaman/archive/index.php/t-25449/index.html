<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been playing EQ2 for about 2 months. The first 20 levels were very well made, they are fun to play, fresh and entertaining. However, after level 22, it is EQ1 all over again: grouping is mandatory, endless grinding of exp, killing the same mobs over and over at the same place for hours...it started to feel like a 2nd job and before I go too deep I must stop.<br />
<br />
My RL does not allow me to glue my butt down in front of the puter for hours every day. There are many stuff around the house I have to take care of and that requires frequent afk. I hate to join a group, play for 30 mins and then disband because I have to go afk 10 mins and then log back on to spend 30 mins looking for a new group.<br />
<br />
Heard WoW is more suitable for people like me. Here are my questions:<br />
<br />
1) How solo friendly is the game? Do I need groups to advance my character? In EQ2 there are many locked zones that single player can never unlock without a well balanced group.<br />
<br />
2) I heard the game is built for PvP. If I don't want PvP and pick a PvE server, am I losing a lot from the game?<br />
<br />
3) I mentioned that I don't want a game that feels like a 2nd job, ie mindless exp grinding, killing the same mobs over and over and over for hours and days etc...will WoW be any different?<br />
<br />
4) Regard to my RL situation mentioned above, will WoW be more suited for me?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) Solo friendly? Absolutely, but there are some areas which will require a group (instanced &quot;Elite&quot; dungeons).<br />
<br />
2) I play on a PVE server and PVP at my leisure. Completely consentual. Personally, I think playing under the PVE ruleset that prevents unwanted higher level killing of lower level people a GOOD thing. Others will disagree. It's an ongoing debate here.<br />
<br />
3) The game is built around questing, and guides you through those quests rather intuitively. You can grind if you want, but by no means is it required. I'm 41 and have leveled exclusively by doing quests with exception of when I'm out killing things to skin for leather so I can increase my skinning/leathercrafting skills.<br />
<br />
4) Sounds like it, at least to me.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) WoW seems very solo friendly - almost on the verge of too friendly hehe. I have seen very very few artificially locked zones. There are plenty of locked zones in reality since they are guarded by mobs you cant get past when you are low level. But that changes over time when you level up. A good solution imo.<br />
<br />
2) PvP was never my thing so I picked a PvE server and dont miss anything. But that might be different for others.<br />
<br />
3) In WoW you get a lot of your experience from finishing quests so its a little different. But many quests will have you kill a lot of the same mobs...sooo...not too different. To me it just feels more interesting and relevant in WoW than it ever did in EQ.<br />
<br />
4) You can log on and accomplish things solo in 30 mins. You can camp out anywhere as long as you are not figthing something. Only danger is that WoW is very very addicting ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1 Wow is the most solo friendly mmorpg to date. 90% of the quests are soloable and the rest are easy enough to complete cause there are always people that want to group to get their quests.<br />
<br />
2 PVP is consensual on pve servers. If pvp is really your thing then you could play on a pvp server np.<br />
<br />
3 Unless you choose a FOH or AL type of guild it won't become that.<br />
<br />
4 Welcome to the new crack cocaine. I hope you have enjoyed what you called &quot;Life&quot; so far because starting with the first time you run the game you won't have one anymore.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heard some people say the game is so unstable to a point that it is unplayable most of the time: lockups, reboots, blue screens, high latency...and it also seems that Blizzard isn't rushing to solve any of these problems which created many angry people in their official forum.<br />
<br />
Have you guys experience any of these problems? I heard the game is basically a one big zone with no little sub-zones like EQ1&amp;2...it is more like the old Ultima Online. So those with better connection speed are usually the winners especially in PvP...is that true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know about the PvP side of it, but I have not experienced any stability issues like you describe.  Occasionally there is lag with response times when playing in the auction house, and sometimes you get a little lag when looting a corpse (like, a few seconds max) but otherwise it's extremely stable for me. <br />
<br />
I have never had lockups, bluescreens, or high(er) than normal latency. Of course, my normal latency from here in Australia is 450-500ms. <br />
<br />
Apart from moving between the two continents, yes, it is one big zone. Transitions are quite smooth, and in many ways it feels more natural than what you may be used to from EQ.  There is a server reboot each day at midnight my time (no idea what that is in US time) but it usualy means I can't login for, oh, around 1 minute.  Hardly what I consider terrible to have to put up with.<br />
<br />
The other thing to remember, is this : The 'official forums' are a cesspool. Every whiner and wanna-be-powergamer is in there getting vocal and bitching and moaning. The silent majority however just play the game and get on with having fun.  <br />
<br />
As far as things such as daily server reboots, well, anyone who was around at the start of EQ or DaOC would be familiar with this. It simply seems to be that these memory leak issues (or whatever is causing it) really don't come out until games go live simply due to the sheer number of people playing compared to closed betas. Over time, as problems get solved; I expect to see these daily reboots dwindle to weekly etc.<br />
<br />
So my 2c on the matter are that you probably won't hit any of these problems unless you're one of the unlucky (very) few. I suspect many of the 'lock up' and 'blue screen' problems are due to driver and/or hardware issues on the PCs of the people playing, and probably the only place you'll experience major lag nowadays is in Ironforge at the bank/auctionhouse area.  Even this should soon be changing, as they've announced in the upcoming patches that they intend to add an AH to every capital city which is linked to the other AH's for that faction.<br />
<br />
[edit] Might I add that my RL situation is very similar to yours, and I absolutely have no trouble fitting that into my WoW playstyle. It really caters quite well to the casual player.  I can spend 1 hour and actually feel like I've progressed in the game.  Find a good guild, and those harder elite instances may well be doable, even on your casual playing times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1) How solo friendly is the game? Do I need groups to advance my character? In EQ2 there are many locked zones that single player can never unlock without a well balanced group.<br />
WoW is very solo friendly.  All classes can solo up to level 60.  They can all do so well.<br />
To advance your character you do not need groups.  To advance your character faster and gain the best possible gear, you either need to save up your money for the expensive Rare items that hit the AH, or get groups to do elite instances.  Rare items are usually about 20% better than anything else comparable that you can acquire solo.  Rare items are either bind on pick up from harder quests, elite bosses, or very very rare random drops.  Cash drops are better off elites, and they drop higher level gear more often than what you can usually kill solo.<br />
I have not seen any locked zones so far, except for Onyxia's lair.  Then again I'm only 44 and it might just need a quest to be able to go there.<br />
<br />
2) I heard the game is built for PvP. If I don't want PvP and pick a PvE server, am I losing a lot from the game?<br />
If you play on a PvE server, you can play the entire game without a single bit of PvP, almost.  There are a very very very small number of quests that require you to kill an NPC of the opposing factions, which will flag you for PvP for 5 minutes.  You can look around for opposing people before you hit the npc for your quest, and then run away or gate out to your home city where you will be completely safe.<br />
If you go on a PvP server, you will have more to deal with than just NPCs trying to kill you.  On the plus side though, you will have much more to do once you hit level 60 than just farm mobs for cash/drops or raid.  Fighting other players is entirely different than fighting against robotic npcs that have predefined combat styles.<br />
You can at any time type /pvp to flag yourself for pvp though.  And doing so will most likely get other people to attack you.  So there's always that option if you want to do some PvPing.<br />
If you play PvE only, you won't be disappointed though, for what you might miss out on playing PvP.  <br />
<br />
3) I mentioned that I don't want a game that feels like a 2nd job, ie mindless exp grinding, killing the same mobs over and over and over for hours and days etc...will WoW be any different?<br />
Most quests in WoW are designed to be able to be completed in about 5-30 minutes, including travel time to and from the quest destination.  Some are as simple as &quot;bring this item to soandso&quot;.  The longer quests are ones that involve you travelling to far off places, killing npcs in the area to get X number of item drops, then returning back to the quest npc.  Those take a lot longer if you've never been there.  Though those quests are a lot fewer, as they are usually the &quot;linking quests&quot; that are designed to get you to explore newer higher level areas that you might want to hunt in at your current level, or possibly in a few levels from your current level.<br />
The only quests that take a lot longer are the ones that need for you to go into instance dungeons.  Instances have elite mobs in them, which have about 3 times as many hps as your average creature.  Some classes can kill elites of equal level, some can't, but in any case they are usually difficult fights for any class.  If you are familiar with LDON from EQ, then going into an instance is about as close as you'll get to an expedition from LDON.  Instances will have about 4-6 quests associated with it that you can do while inside it.  You'll have 1 or 2 that involve collection and/or slaughterfests of certain npcs.  You'll have to locate an item in the instance and bring it back to so and so.  You'll have to locate a particular place in the instance and report back.  You'll have to kill the boss npcs in the dungeon and report back.  Doing an elite dungeon can take as short as 30 minutes, but will usually take closer to 1-2 hours to go through the entire thing.<br />
<br />
4) Regard to my RL situation mentioned above, will WoW be more suited for me?<br />
You'd probably be happy with WoW.  You can solo very easily, regardless of class.  You can attain equipment upgrades solo, with zero need for visiting the auction house.  Most quests (like 85%) can be completed in 30 minutes or less.  You can often do 2 or 3 quests simotaneously off the same npcs or in the same area before returning to town to be even more efficient (for example, one quest needs X items that drop off panthers, while another quest giver wants you to kill Y number of panthers).  You can log in, go do a quest, or pick up on the progress you made previously, then camp.<br />
<br />
One more thing that is of huge benefit to a part time player.  Your offline time gives you more xp for when you play online.  When you are camped out, your rest meter goes up.  The longer you are offline with that particular character, the higher your rest meter goes up.  While you are online killing things and are still rested, you get double xp for killing stuff.  Xp from questing is unaffected, and doesn't affect your rest state.  Once you've killed enough stuff to catch up to your rest state, you will once again be at normal state instead of resting, and go back to normal xp.  So, in your case, if you play very seldom, you will probably be fully rested every moment of your playtime.  Another thing you can do to (ab)use the rest state is to have multiple characters.  When you are no longer rested on your current character, camp out at the inn (to make rest state go up fastest) and log on another rested character.  Your normal character will become rested while you are playing the other characters.  This way every character you play should be getting double xp bonuses from hunting.  It's something that is designed specificly for part time players so they get can try to see the higher end gameplay as well, without the need for grinding xp.</div></div><hr />

Thank you.<br />
1- Solo friendly.<br />
2- No.<br />
3- Yes, but it's what you make it.  I grind but it's not required.<br />
4- Yes.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.  Doing dungeons with real life friends over Teamspeak puts this game at the best all time for me.  It is bar none the most fun game we have ever played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heard some people say the game is so unstable to a point that it is unplayable most of the time: lockups, reboots, blue screens, high latency...and it also seems that Blizzard isn't rushing to solve any of these problems which created many angry people in their official forum.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about most posts on the official forums - I've never seen such a group of whining, misinformed (or lying) posters on any other board.  There are some good posters there and I do read those boards...I just ignore the whines because most of them have no basis in reality.<br />
<br />
As to stability, after the first few days I've only run into a few isolated problems.  If the people complaining are correct, my only guess is it's server/zone/time zone dependent.  I play a Tauren on Argent Dawn from 8 to 11:30 EST on the weekdays and noon to midnight on the weekends and I've had very few problems.  In the last month I can remember 1 day when the zone I was in was lagging (other zone's were not - I asked some guildies that were on when I was) and 2 days when Blizzard had general stability issues - right before Christmas and after a patch.<br />
<br />
For me, WoW seems just as stable as EQ1 currently is.  (no idea what EQ2 is like)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">wow is great for casual play, and you can probably solo all the way to 60 if you were so inclined. lot of ppl grouch over that for some reason, but to me it's just more variety to an already variety-heavy game. i solo about 80-85% of the time and tend to only grp with the same ppl in instances. most of my xp has been from solo grinding and quests (seem to grind while doing collect/drop quests, it's not intentional), while nearly all of my better gear is from grouping in instanced dungeons. it's a balance i like, tbh. when I don't log in for a day or two, I don't feel like I need to 'catch up' with anyone, and as Aby says above, the rest bonus helps make up for that. <br />
I don't have any experience with EQ2 so no comments or comparisons from me on that. <br />
<br />
my post had a point, but I think I lost it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There is high latency, especially in congested zones.  Do yourself a favor and pick a low population server.  There are also extended periods  of time when the log in server is down.  There are also server-wide lag spikes where absolutely nothing happens in game except chat for 1+ minutes.  These aren't the norm, but they are there.<br />
<br />
There is always something to do.  Quests can be fun, but often just consist of killing a certain npc or a certain number of npcs.  It's not like a second job though...<br />
<br />
You can definitely get to level 60 solo with all classes, though some have it easier than others.<br />
<br />
Read my review post as most of that is how i still feel about the game.<br />

 Actually, if you are going to be soloing a lot, and not on a PvP server, then a Hunter is the best class. Semi Decent Melee (leather, then Chain Armor) Awesome Ranged DPS, a pet that can tank for you. Nothing solos like a Hunter. With my Hunter I can take 3 mobs of equal or lower level at once, and be ready for the next in the time it takes to loot them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm on a &quot;medium&quot; load server and my congestion issues are pretty much non-existant.  Crucible is the only board I read regarding WoW - which was the right decision, from the sounds of it.  WoW boards seem to be worse than EQ1 server boards.  If you believed those boards, every single class in the game is underpowered (all tradeskills, too), which is kind of funny.<br />
<br />
I have to agree with you Sekin - I already have two jobs, I do NOT need another.  I love WoW because I have my life back.  I'm thoroughly addicted, but I can still manage to unplug and do laundry, clean my house, play with my kittens, snuggle up with my man for a movie.  And all without feeling like I'm going to pay for it when I get back to my game / 3rd job.</div></div><hr />

ok, after seeing the female NE's dance, I have to agree with you on that one. but, I think that all of them are looking at the NE guys and asking 'where's the beef?' <br />

Reminds me of the Male, Tauren, vocal emotes:<br />
<br />
1) &quot;Mess with the bull - get the horns.&quot;<br />
2) &quot;Here's the beef.&quot;<br />
3) &quot;Moo - there happy now?&quot;<br />

IIRC the NE female dance makes me think they have a pole and a slew of $1's in their future.</div></div><hr />

one thing that does change, at higher levels, is damage taken, I can still whup ass big time on mobs, but they can hurt me in return more so.<br />

She joined groups to do it several times, but they kept failing (pickup groups) So, I took her in with my then 30(or so) Hunter, and basicly soloed the whole place, including the bosses (I know I was at least 30, cuase I had Feign Death) I know all the mobs were gray, but it is an elite Instence. I am sure all classes can solo. My advice on the Hunter is because they are the Solo Machine. When I said 3 mobs at once, I ment 3 even or +1 lv mobs (beasts only, mostly, Good thing thats most of the mobs in the game, lol) pet on one, while I shoot it, one hitting me, and one feared and snared. I can drop them all in 40 secs or so. and end fight at over 50% Hp on me and pet, and mana at 70% or more. by the time I loot them all, I will be at full mana, and pet at full HP. I never eat or drink unless I am fighting mobs 3 to 5 levels above me, or else Elites even to +3 (+4's always win when elite). After lv 30, dieing to PvE mobs is mostly a ting of the past unless you royaly mes up. By the way, Just cause I can fight multipules does not mean I do, A hunter from lv 30 and up is the best single puller in the game, with any room to work, I can split up any number of mobs by using traps, and FD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that the official forums is filled with a bunch of whiny people.  However, there IS a problem with the lag on some of the high populated servers.  Unfortunately I play on one of those servers, and we have frequent reboots (especially on the eastern continent), insane lag in Ironforge (the central city in the Alliance).  Sometimes you get rolled back, sometimes  you don't.   I basically do not play late at night to avoid the peak of these problems.  It has been very frustrating, but I do know that Blizzard is working on it as their highest priority.<br />
<br />
The good news is...You shouldn't experience any of this if you choose a lower population server.  <br />
<br />
Its a great game with very few bugs, an expansive world, great quest system, and well done classes who can all solo to some extent.  I highly suggest trying it out.</div></div><hr />
