<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK all you hard core raiders, Gimme some help here please.  My guild has a fair number of people in it, but we have a hard time getting coordinated, so...we are looking for a target that can be taken with 2 groups (55-65, and mixed classes).  We have been in HoT, and done ok, but the time it takes to get everyone there can make it difficult.  Ideally 3 hours from start to finish, would be best. Thanks for any comments/ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Could try doing Vadyn or work your way deeper and try Itra and Shei if you get more people showing up. named in Umbral would be good to try. Also the ring of slime in CT aswell. there are quite a few options actually.<br />
Plan ahead, and schedual your raid if possible, try to minimise your gather times.</div></div><hr />
