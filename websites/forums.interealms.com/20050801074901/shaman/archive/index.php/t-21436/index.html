<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok...maybe I am missing something with our slow spells.  I have looked around the posts trying to find some things out but haven't seen anything on this that explains it well.  I am a 61 Shaman and I typically use Tugur's.  Now, I just got Grummus and I can't see how it would be better than Tugur's.  Tigir's is the AoE and has it's own place for certain situations.  But, why would I use Grummus, or even Plague of Insects, over Tugurs?<br />
<br />
Tugur's = 75% slow (at lvl 60) for 250 mana, adds 16 disease counters<br />
Grummus = 40% slow for 400 mana. adds 16 disease counters<br />
Plague of Insects = 25% Slow for 250 mana, adds 7/16 disease counters<br />
<br />
Maybe I don't understand the correct use of these spells, but Tugur's just seems to be the best choice all around.  I am hoping that someone on these boards can explain this to me.  And, I do not know a whole hell of a lot about the disease counters, so does that make a big difference?  Or, if there is a post that I missed that explains it, can someone link it?</div></div><hr />

Turgur's is a magic check. Grummu is a disease check, some mobs are completely MR while their DR isnt, so you would use grummy because turgurs wouldn't land.<br />

thats how i understand it anyway<br />

This link leads to a thread with a discussion about mob slowability and a link to a good chart: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=12590&amp;mode=linear&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=1<br />

Some mobs are theoretically magic slowable, but with high resists, so it makes sense to Malicious Decay, then Grummus to get him slowed, then try to land Turgur's. For example, the three times I have done Mithaniel Marr, Grummus landed on the second try, but with four shaman's spamming Turgur's, we couldn't get it to land.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shoa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good example is Emperor Ssra... in Ssra Temple (cant spell that name, sorry). Completly magic immun, but Grummus lands without problem. You just have to recast it more often than turgurs. Mithaniel Marr is Turgurs Slowable with a little luck, or, much better, with the new GoD Slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Same with LiS.  Grummus lands without question.  But you can spam Turgur through the entire fight (was 30 minutes or longer first few times) without ever landing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks all.  Makes better sense now.</div></div><hr />

That seems kind of odd, i'd assume Mithaniel Marr is a paladin and paladins have an inate higher disease resistance =/, not calling you wrong just found it funny, more hehe not haha</div></div><hr />

Kinda like a spirit wolf not having Spirit of the Wolf or the age old question of where a cockitrice keeps his plat. Some times game mechanics wins over game immersion.</div></div><hr />
