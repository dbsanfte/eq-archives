<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>maggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what do u mean is a better addition to our shaman class:<br />
<br />
1. pali (rezz in higher lvls, stun, heal, LoH, buffs)?<br />
or<br />
2. sdk (fd, ht, debuff and selfbuffs, pet)?<br />
<br />
know they r nearly equal and there shouldnt be a huge difference in dps when they r same equipped.<br />
<br />
thx for input :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just twinked up an old warrior I had, to avoid casting and medding on 2nd box. I wanted it very uncomplicated :)<br />
<br />
With some decent aggro weapons he has no problems pulling aggro off me (hes 55 now) and dps is &quot;ok&quot;.<br />
<br />
Besides that I think I would pick SK over Pally - I always liked the dark side better :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've always prefered Paladins over SK's tbh, snare isnt a factor for me as I have a vp spear, but the fast healing, decent buffs and stuns are all immensely useful.  The only thing SK's have on that league is the group mana/hp tap which is just plain great =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krygor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im 2boxing with a 58 Ranger. The ranger can give attack buffs to my pet and myself if I want to do some melee. The ranger can keep agro pretty effectivly and if need be can loose agro so that she can back off and heal when im outa mana while dog tanks for a bit. while not in melee she can plunk away with arrows between heal casts. With Epic she always has at least 40% haste if I forget to rehaste her. All in all I would choose a Ranger over an SK/Pally any day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its all personal preference.  You want to rez yourself?  Do Pally then.  When a pull goes bad, and you want to FD and try again?  Do SK.  When a pull goes bad, you want to zone or do a CR?  Then do Pally.  You want to 2-box your chars to 65, and still be able to duo for good xp in planes at 65?  Then you may reconsider the ranger.  Rangers are great to 60, and as alot of people just group in higher tier planes, then it really won't matter.  Rangers will also out damage the SK and Pally at the lower levels.  At 65 with a ton of AA's, well it will just depend on what you are hunting and who is tanking.  Oh, and rangers have track, which is just awesome when you are out hunting named mobs.<br />
<br />
Now if SOE looks at chain and plate class mitigation, there could be some more improvements made to Rangers as far as tanking abilities go.  So it could be a better option.  Another thing concerning rangers in PoP zones, toss out the dual wield, get a nice slow 2hs like Windblade and a CoF.  Riposte dmg can really add up when mobs are hitting for 400.  Not to meantion the windblade and CoF will outdamage almost any Ranger epic/other combination (excluding archery with appropriate AA's)<br />
<br />
I play the SK/Shammy Combo.  Why?  Personal preference again.  When I rolled my SK, I cringed at the thought of making a Pally or Ranger.  I have managed to make a Ranger Alt since then, track is so handy.  I still have no desire at all to be a Pally.  I would miss FD/Invis and all the other utilities the SK has.  Plus toss in the OT gate hammer, with the PoP books, and you can get yourself from deep down in the pits of hell to PoK in seconds.<br />
<br />
To each their own.  Looking at SK/Pally/Ranger, all 3 classes have great things to offer.  Just depends on what you want to do, and how you want to do it.</div></div><hr />
