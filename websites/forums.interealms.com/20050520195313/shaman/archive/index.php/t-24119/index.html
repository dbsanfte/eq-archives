<br />
Hi Gloriana,<br />
 <br />
Yes, Nadox is on a 3-day timer.  However, if you do the quest in the correct order and have the appropriate bits, Spiritseeker Nadox will spawn when you zone in.  If someone has recently killed Spiritseeker Nadox before you arrived, you will have to wait two hours before you can zone in again to trigger the spawn (that also counts for retries if you fail).  Once you have completed this portion of the quest, you will not be able to trigger the spawn anymore.<br />
 <br />
If you are doing this event out of order in the epic, you will have to wait the general 3-day timer because it is outside of the progression of the quest.<br />
 <br />
So, be sure you are at the correct spot in the quest before you do this event unless you're willing to camp it for the 3 days.<br />
<br />
Vahlar<br />
<br />
UPDATE OCTOBER 5!!!  <br />
<br />
After Vahlar described what was supposed to happen, many shaman were still stuck at that step. Vahlar immediately investigated the issue, found a fix and is implementing it across live servers.<br />
<br />
Howdy folks,<br />
<br />
I've made a few changes that should make this a little easier the next time we get the zones patched. I'm doing my best to have this change in asap (within a day or so).<br />
<br />
If you are at the correct portion of the quest (have the correct flag), you will be &quot;notified&quot; when you zone into Nadox if you have awakened a nasty spirit thief. This still functions the same way in that you have to be at the right &quot;spot&quot; in the quest or he will ignore your presence.<br />
<br />
It seemed this didn't work for several of you and I apologize for that. All should be well when we get this change on the live servers. I honestly did everything I could to remove bottlenecks from this quest and am very sorry several of you had to endure long camps.<br />
<br />
That said, if you are not at the right spot in the quest, you will have to endure the natural spawn time of Nadox. That won't change. Awakening Nadox is a gift to those who are at that point in the story.<br />
<br />
I'm still reading these boards with regularity, so I'll be keeping an eye on the progress.<br />
<br />
Again, apologies for any hard times,<br />
<br />
Vahlar/Holly<br />
<br />
Some additional clarification:<br />
<br />
1. If a shaman spawns Nadox successfully and another player kills/loots the mob, the shaman who spawned Nadox will not be bugged. In 2 hours, the shaman can spawn him again. My recommendation - have some friends on the spawn point to ensure your group gets the kill of your spawned mob!<br />
<br />
2. Swarmfiend, chests and you (per Vahlar)- As far as the Swarmfiend, you have to be at the right part in the quest and only have killed it once in order to get the chest loot.  We added that into the quests to provide rewards for encounters where you need several people to help so you don't go through the agony of begging a ton of friends to come along to help with your event with no reward for them, but it's a one-time deal.  So, if you've gotten the chest once, you shouldn't get it twice from the same encounter.  And, if you're not at the right point in the quest, you won't get it either, so it pays to do some things in order in this case</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hadn't started the quest yet and went to Nadox. After 5 minutes in zone he appeared. Take that as you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So... what happens when one shaman is ready and zones into Nadox only to find another shaman that's been sitting there for three days and claims the spawn ?  Can the shaman that is at the appropriate step continue to spawn Nadox every two hours for anyone ?<br />
<br />
Wudo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well that was nice of them to give that information up...... I do feel a ton better about the mob now.... As long as I have all the rest done up to that point I should be in good shape. 2 hours isn't bad to wait either. I just hope it isn't bugged since I was hearing that people with all the items were zoning in and he wasn't up. <br />
<br />
Thank you Gloriana for looking into that.<br />
<br />
And thank you Vahlar whereever you are for your response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm just a little concerned, I know my guildmate Vanyaurd has been camping it for nearly 2 days. I can't confirm with her, but I *KNOW* she has to be at this step - she's done the sky turn in, has the torture bit..it's possible she hasn't actually turned them in yet. As soon as she responds to my post on our guild forums, I'll report back!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Most likely you'll want to be with at least one person to help with this part. Have them zone in ahead of you and run to the spot to make sure no one is there. <br />
<br />
Should help any people trying to claim your spawn. ;)<br />
<br />
I lucked out with this part. Was the second piece to my epic I got. First time I heard Nadox drops one of our pieces I got some friends and went to check on him. I figured get this part done and over with quick before more Shaman read the walkthrough and it becomes a bottleneck. <br />
<br />
Glad to hear it won't be though. Now if only they'll do the same for the elites in CoD. That's the last actual &quot;camp&quot; i need for my epic 1.5. (still got CS, UP and PoJ too, though they're all triggered)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never said we should be able to.  I've been working on it since a couple days after OoW came out.  But after 4+ days camping a spawn that's supposed to pop when ! zone in, or at the most 2 hours, I might complain.</div></div><hr />

When I originally posted the issue on the Guild Summit forums, I mentioned that my guildmate was currently in a 3 day camp. Vahlar answered and added that if Vany were still having issues, she could email her. Vahlar did not say &quot;give my email address to all the shaman on the Crucible&quot; so I don't feel comfortable sharing that information.<br />
<br />
Vany appears to be bugged, she's emailing the quest designer, any answer she receives, I will immediately post here. I don't think Vahlar needs 100 identical &quot;help, I'm bugged at Nadox&quot; emails.</div></div><hr />

Hi Gloriana,<br />
 <br />
you will have to wait two hours before you can zone in again to trigger the spawn (that also counts for retries if you fail).  Once you have completed this portion of the quest, you will not be able to trigger the spawn anymore.<br />
 <br />

Wonder if this is actually how it works... cuz that's exploitable in its current explanation...<br />
<br />
Shaman at that point zones in... Poof (or 2 hour window poof) Spirit.. Let's other shaman kill... Leaves.. repeats in 2 hours ....</div></div><hr />

<br />
First Shaman gets the chest. Second one (and his helping raid) will get a kick into the arse.<br />
I experienced this firsthand.<br />
<br />
Basically this sloppy event programming flags *EVERY* Shaman who helps killing the Swarmfiend as unable to spawn the chest. <br />
I am sure the intention was to flag only the Shaman who loots the Swarmfiend as not being able to do this a second time.<br />
So if you have ever the intention to spawn a chest for your friends at the Swarmfiend event then *never* ever help another Shaman with this event. <br />
<br />
This chest thing is a grand idea which went down the drain by bad implementing and no proper testing.<br />
<br />
What makes me real angry about the whole thing is the answer i got to my petition i wrote.<br />
I asked why i didnt get a chest and i asked to look into the problem. And i asked to get a refund in the form of my own spawned chest, cause i didnt get one when i looted my Swarmfiend.<br />
The answer was quite blunt: <br />
I was told that this chest spawning is an inner secret of the game which is not to be revealed to me and my petition was closed.<br />
Way to go to treat bugs and errors! Its all a secret!</div></div><hr />

My name is **** ***** ****** and I play Bethiana on the Mithaniel Marr server. On September 30th of 2004 I completed a step in my epic quest that was supposed to spawn a chest but did not. Now, it is a known bug that sometimes the chest will not spawn. This has been stated to the Shaman community (http://forums.interealms.com/Shaman) by Vahlar/Holly at SOE who has been very helpful in issues regarding the epic and our problems. It was stated that any Shaman who is at that step of the quest will be able to loot the talisman from the Netherbian Swarmfiend and a chest will spawn providing an item for those who helped with your epic. I completed the quest up to that point exactly without skipping text or skipping ahead. I even killed Spiritseeker Nadox first before attempting the Swarmfiend, since the NPC text stated the Swarmfiend was the second beast we needed to kill. Vahlar also stated that it would not spawn if we had killed the Swarmfiend before, which I had not done. According to all the information from your developer I should have had a chest spawn. I petitioned this with the date and time of the kill and who was in attendance, but the GM who responded gave me a cut and paste response which did not relate to my issue at all. A link to a screenshot of the petition is below, as well as a cut and paste from the Shaman class boards from Vahlar telling us that a chest should spawn. I am requesting an item reimbursement for this, as a reward to my friends who dropped what they were doing and came to help me achieve my Epic 1.5.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time,<br />

Sony Customer Service at its best. I am positively disgusted that they couldn't even take the time to read my email before sending me this cut and paste form response.</div></div><hr />

you need to contact our manager please contact nwright@soe.sony.com. He<br />
may be able to forward your issue to our Ingame CSRs or Managers.<br />

Once again, they completely ignore my email. &quot;Talk to a GM.&quot; I did. Feh.<br />
<br />
Oh well. George Scotto is getting a printout of all these. I just wish the first person had provided a name like this last one.<br />
<br />
That means there is no hope of getting your friends a prize for coming out to help you because of a known bug that made chests spawn randomly, for those of us who have already done this.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I wouldn't being flat out told that due to the bug there would be no reimbursement, but obviously they don't have any way to translate that from Indian, or to translate what I said into something they can understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Nadox worked perfectly for me.  I zoned in, I saw yellow text that he spawned, we killed him and I looted.  <br />
<br />
I love it.  That's the way encounters should go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>esma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">So what is the current strategy on the Swarm fight, If 2 or more shammies, buff up and then have all other shammies disband from raid and exit zone? Thanks but you can;t see this part until you are ready?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Bethiana's discussion relates to the way things were working before the last patch (look at the dates on the screenshots of her tickets) when chests usually were not spawning after killing mobs that were supposed to drop them. It was well known that they were not spawning. Basically anyone who proceeded with their quests at that time should have been doing so fully knowing that they were probably not going to get additional loot.<br />
<br />
As far as I know that no longer happens and chests spawn normally. None of the encounters that are supposed to spawn chests which we have done since the patch have failed to do so, while all of those before the patch did not spawn chests. So it looks like its fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Technically, the chests were spawning ... but randomly. I was the fourth or fifth Shaman on my server with this, and was doing my parts as they were being discovered/discovering them myself. It should have worked like they said it would. I didn't know about it being bugged (there were mixed reports at the time) and had it been confirmed the chests didn't spawn I wouldn't have wasted my friends' time. (I'm still happy they came out to help me, and I'd still like to see them get something out of it. A few of them could use the upgrades.)</div></div><hr />
