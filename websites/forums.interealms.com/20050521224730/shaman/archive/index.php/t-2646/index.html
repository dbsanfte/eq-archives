<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, was looking for some info on duleing a SK i play a shm lvl 36 ATM and my brother play's a SK lvl 35 we both have desent gear and i got an ikky BP how ever i cant seem to ever kill him. with all my buffs up i can get about the same hp as him and he can get most of his resist to about 65 or so.<br />
<br />
the fight jenarly starts with all buffs up and pet leveing 2 open spots so i can debuff his dots. I sart out with a  deis debuff and deis spells and try to kite him with my pet. hes got a big 2hnder 30 dmg 40 dly and cast the darken typ of spell tell it stick and takes off sow but i can never dispell it and get sow back on me befor hes right next to me and then not long tell im ded. i have aslo tryed to blind him but for some reason the ac tap hes has makes it so i cant land blind, every time i cast it it sys spell did not take hold or something like that.<br />
<br />
i dont see it getting any easyer as we get lvl's ether as he will just get better hp and better taps any info on taking him out would be verry helpfull</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buff your own MR. This is very important. If he lands darkless on you, you are dead.<br />
<br />
Make a pet, haste it.<br />
<br />
Mem your best heal, your best nuke, and Scourge. I forgot if you get a desease debuff at that level or not, but use sow to get out of range, then cast scourge at maximum spell range.<br />
<br />
He would most likely try to cast spells on you, which is to your advantage. All of his spells are rather sucky compared to yours. If you can land 1 Scourge and do ~200 damage with nukes, your pet should be able to finish him off easy.<br />
<br />
Watch out for his HT, which should do ~ 240 damage in pvp at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">use malise, and try to slow him with drowsy (fast casting, easy to stick, low mana) once that sticks, try and overwrite it with tagars insects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some shaman say that the overwrite method isn't a reliable way, but my playing has shown differently. anyway, good luck.</div></div><hr />
