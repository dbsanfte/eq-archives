<br />
A good friend of mine - 58 Druid - would like to do the DE Corruptor part of her epic next week.  Because I am only 43, I can not initiate my epic yet, but I would like to help her with hers.  She seems to remember Giz X' Tin and the Corruptor being linked somehow with faction, thus preventing you from speaking with Giz after you have killed the corruptor.  <br />
<br />
I can't find anything to definitely refute this... and as much as I want to help her, I really don't want to hurt my chances at getting Swiftwind/Earthcaller.<br />
<br />
Anyone know for certain?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You don't need to speak with Giz exactly, all you need to do is sneak up behind him and do the turn-in (need to make sure you have SoW or wolf form up for this, otherwise with sneak on it's hard to keep up with him long enough to do it).  Killing the EK corrupter won't affect your ability to do this part of the epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice to see a new Xegony Ranger here at the glade /bonk.<br />
<br />
It is a long time since I did that part of the quest and I seemed to remember some talk of faction issues if you had killed the DE corrupter and then wanted to do the Giz Xtin bit.  Having said that I checked Crydee's  site (http://www.questing-ranger.com/quests/faqs/faq-ranger_epic.pdf) which has a detailed description of the quest, and it seems as if Giz is on an unknown faction different from the DE.  <br />
<br />
To be 100 % safe I would not help, but it looks to me as if there will be no problem with you doing the EK bit.</div></div><hr />

I  helped a guildie with the Corrupter in EK before I started my Epic Quest, and while Gix would not speak to me I was able to sneak in Wolf form and do the turn-in just fine.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In case any evils helping out wonder, these are the faction hits on the DE kills:<br />
<br />
Your faction standing with Indigo Brotherhood got worse.<br />
Your faction standing with Emerald Warriors got better.<br />
Your faction standing with Steel Warriors got better.<br />
Your faction standing with Primordial Malice got better.<br />
<br />
Only Indigo Brotherhood goes down, and I believe that IB is the Neriak SK guild.<br />
<br />
My faction with Gix was dubious, I still sneaked and it worked just fine. It's more fun that way too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SoW, and sneak behind Giz, works just fine, no matter what your initial faction with Giz is.  Remember, sneak makes you indifferent to anything not facing you; so by staying behind him you're gonna be indifferent.</div></div><hr />
