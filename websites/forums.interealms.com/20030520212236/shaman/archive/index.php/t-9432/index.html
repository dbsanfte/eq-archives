<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering, from what I hear a horse is priceless for medding while JBB nuking. But as an Iksar I cant have the luxury of a JBB =). Also I heard that you dont get sitting regen rates while one a horse which would make me never want to buy one (mabye if/when I get torpor =P) I was curious about other iksar shamans views on horses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am an Iksar with the cheapo horse.<br />
I absolutely LOVE it.<br />
It is, in my opinion, BETTER then having constant KEI.<br />
Medding while casting, and not having to canni dance is a HUGE benefit. Not to mention no sitting aggro...<br />
I absolutely love my Horse - his name is Bob, and he likes to eat gnomes...<br />
I suggest you go for the horse. You will love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye if you are hunting outdoors the horse is worth it.  Shrink so you dont have to stare its head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol...<br />
<br />
Thought came to mind... can you bear form while on a horse?  if so what does it look like?   I'm guessing no, but since no one's said anything I thought it was worth questioning.<br />
<br />
And what about sitting regen while on a horse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">no bear form on horse. People say that you only get standing hp regen while standing on horse, but get sitting mana regen. I haven't tested it myself but the mana regen is huge. I really cant believe how much of a difference it makes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I say my horse is the best thing I ever bought.<br />
<br />
I can slow a mob, and not have to stand thru half the fight fearing that I will draw agro if i sit.<br />
<br />
I am medding while cannibalizing, healing, buffing, blasting... those ticks of meditation while casting the epic dot are nice :)<br />
<br />
I can swap spells mid combat without drawing agro.<br />
<br />
Since I am 60+ and have torpor, I dont rely on my own regen rate anymore.  I'm not sure for pre torpor -I couldnt afford a horse till I was 60.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lots of Xev shammies.  The horse is a very nice tool.  I don't miss the sitting regen rate because the mana regen rate is very high all the time.  Get the cheapo horse.</div></div><hr />

Any suggestions for where to get money?  plz don't say RM... hehe ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">To me, or horse is mandatory for any non-melee caster.  The mana regen more than makes up for the loss of sitting regen rate.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sssythe Malosepsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Something about having a horse just feels not shamanish to me.  My scaley butt has never plunked down on a horse and probably never will :)  I'm not an rp'er or anything, and I cannot explain my visceral dislike of horses.  Sitting on a horse would make me feel like, I dunno, a druid :P<br />
<br />
Yes the mana regen is nice, the standing memming of spells, blah blah blah.  But to give up the bear, that is something I cannot do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I love my horse, but I hate 99% of the people that use horses.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am sick of seeing people die because a cleric was in the middle of a 10 second CH and couldn't interrupt it to heal someone else who needed it more.<br />
<br />
I'm sick of enchanters/shamans ping ponging mobs because its to much trouble to position themselves on the tanks shoulder while there on a horse.<br />
<br />
You don't want  aggro when you switch spells?  Learn to play your class better.  Sit aggro is part of the game, as is learning what spells you need to have memed.    <br />
<br />
The solution to this is to turn models off but when you tell someone this it normally gets you a &quot;but old models are fugly dude&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't have one yet for my shammy but have one for my druid. I have old models on and have no problems with some of the issues others have with thier horses. The view with models on sucks, a set of ears in front of ya face makes seeing whats goin on a lil difficult. Once I can afford one for my troll butt I'm gettin one, but I'll probably get me an iksar bp first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I prefer old models myself, but having them off makes having a horse so much nicer.  You can sit and get sitting regen rates while having the horse buff on, and while standing or casting get med rates.  You don't have the annoying startup/slowdown issues, and you can duck to interrupt spells, and you dont have to shrink to get the horse head out of your vision.  Only downside to it is you can't really benefit from the expensive horses, because you are regular speed (and can sow).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats exactly what I would say =(<br />
<br />
Make sure you have *ALL* new models and horses/elementals turned off and you'll never have a problem with mobility, the annoying head or being unable to interupt a spell quickly again.</div></div><hr />
