<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure its burried somewhere here but all this recent talk about quick buff and spell casting reenforcment etc in conjunction with torpor has got me curious:<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the maximum cast time a buff spell can be lowered to?  If for instance I have QB3 (thus lowering cast time of buffs by 50%) will an enhancement haste 4 item be redundant.. thus unable to lower it further or not?<br />
<br />
<br />
Along the same note , whats the maximum a buff can be extended for, likewise 50% in addtion to the base?<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks for your help as these answers will undoubtably dictate my gear progression and aa selection. 92 aa so far whats another 18? :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">max buff haste is 50% (about 9 months ago mage spell haste rings and QB3 would stack, rendering a 2.1 sec cast time on torpors. it was sweet)<br />
<br />
max buff extended, my spell casting renforcement mastery adds 50% duration .. and my 8th shawl adds another 20% .. so .. they stack, max buff duration for me is 70%.  i belive on lucy i saw the highest foci effect that was 30%+ duration, so my guess is 80% is max<br />
<br />
<br />
oh ya back to your enhancment haste 4 item, well a few of my guildies have QB2 + enhancment3 (shissar ring) thus giving them 50% buff haste. BUT, it doesnt work on torpor.  i belive the generic focus efect items require the buff duration to be over a min or something i forget.  so if you want 3.0 torpors .. your best bet is QB3.  however i heard some of the &quot;named&quot; focus effects work differently than the generic ones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For haste the best you can do is a 50% reduction. Past that it doesn't do any good. So if you have QB3 and an enhancement haste 4 item you still end up with a 3 second torpor. Standard enhancement haste items won't work with Torpor tho. The speed of mithaniel and some of the VP enhcancement haste items do worth with it tho. The standard spell haste 4 items do work also.<br />
<br />
On the buff reinforcement side of things there doesn't seem to be a limit. scrm + 8th shawl = 70% longer buffs. Once again note that most focus items don't work with torpor. There is one crown from VT that does tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah from the posts i read it seems torpor the best you can get is QB3 since most focus effects don't allow you to hasten it, my question was more for other buffs.. IE group focus, someone with QB3 and an emp ring can answer this.  normally its what 30 second cast, QB3 would make it 15 does the ring or any other focus effect anyone has drop it below that?  Thats my real question.  I am going to spend AA for QB3.. but should I spend plat / time / dkp on a enhancement haste 4 item or haste of mithaniel or whatever its called or not.  That is once you have QB3 does it render all buff haste items forever useless?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It doesn't matter how long the spell is it's still a min of 50% cast time. So group focus goes down from 26 to 13 even with quick buff 3 and an enhancement haste item.<br />
<br />
Haste of mithaniel items are nice since it has no min duration and ends up working on any benificial spell including heals (except KM), torpor, gate and even summoning pets.<br />
<br />
You can see haste of mithaniel at http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3531&amp;source=Live<br />
or the best version at<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3533&amp;source=Live<br />
As you can see they range from 20 to 30 percent so 2 lvls of qb and one of those maxes out your buff haste and hastes alot of other spells too.</div></div><hr />
