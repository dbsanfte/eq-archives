<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So who's doing what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like the grass here. It does however look very nice and green on the other side :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I ll probably check it out but I currently see no reaon to quit EQ, I m having fun with my guild and friends. The cartoonish look is really not my thing, neither screenshots nor the ingame movies have convinced me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like the fact that you get exp for everything that you do. It's not just kill, kill, kill. <br />
<br />
The one thing that let's EQ down for me is the lack of really good quests. There are a few that are very enjoyable, our epic, the coldain Shawl and ring, but they are very few and far between.<br />
<br />
That said I'm still waiting until I hear more about the classes etc before I'll decide what I'm going to do. Anyways It's going to be ages before it's released in the UK.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Going when WoW is out and I get the box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't logged on EQ in 6 weeks (don't I get a chip for that?) but my account is still active.  I'm really feeling the MMORPG itch though, so I'm greatly looking forward to WoW cause it looks like its gonna be teh awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Regardless of anything else, i simply feel its time too move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I was done with POP I might be inclined to agree with Litgruv, but my guild just got to earth/air/water and there's new content for me.  I give EQ another 6 months for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I may check WoW out, just based on the positive reviews from alpha testers, but I admit I'm not realy excited about WoW.<br />
<br />
IMHO the graphics look juviniel, and after beeing disapointed with Diablo 2, and Warcraft 3, I'm not as excited about WoW as soem pepole are.<br />
<br />
I'm still holding out for more info about the Warhammer online game, so I guess its a wait and see attitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The way our shamaistic issues are adressed (aka we get a quick upgrade to the amount of healing we SHOULD have had in the first place) made me realise that SoE simply does not care for my class.<br />
And thus I wll move maybe WoW or maybe Warhammer but I am done with SoE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My guild is about to hit EP's.  It's pretty exciting, from an EQ standpoint.  But I've become so aggrivated with EQ and SoE.... I can't WAIT to leave and never look back.  If WoW is 1/10th of what the alpha testing commentary reflects - my EQ days are quite numbered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have a group of friends who i play with regularly, <br />
<br />
When they decide to leave i will too, and then go to whichever game we decide to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Since I play the tabletop game, I too am checking out Warhammer Online. I will probably mess with it, but I am pretty sure the only thing that will make me jump ship from EQ is EQII.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i figure ill play eq till vanguard (sigil) comes out<br />
<br />
WoW wont do it for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Regardless of anything else, i simply feel its time too move on.<br />
<br />
Agreed, i just got flagged fro elemental and i find myself looking for a guild to do some of the content and there is alot of challanges ahead. but there will always be challanges coming. I think change is a health and needed experience and if one stays in a place too long they run the risk of getting stagnate. Im not ready for that, i still wanna be fresh and moving around, EQ's time has passed for me, as much as i might want to stay, the time has come for the new. Thats me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zorshaaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">See the dust at my heels? That's me leaving...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'll continue to play EQ till I've got no reason to log in or I find something better /shrug.  Whether that comes from sheer bordem or all the rest of my friends leave who's to say, still got a decent amount to do and have fun with yet.<br />
<br />
Will have to wait and see how WoW is once it's out but thats a bit off down the road yet, not to mention some of the other MMO's coming out in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Staying. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm still in that happy place, pre-Elelemtals, where people WANT ME in regular and hard LDoNs, and even GoD groups. I guess I have made a favorable impression. :)<br />
<br />
Also, some RL friends who stopped playing last winter have actually come back, and are transferring servers to join me on MithMarr - for my company, for the casual guild I've joined, and for the swell pickup raid opportunities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My girlfriend and I are talking about going on a cruise in November. I still have to figure out a way to pay for that. I dunno about any new MMOGs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My response is obvious. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Soon as WoW is in my hands, I'm history... the only reason I came back to EQ at all is because WoW is taking so damn long (there's only so much Morrowind one can play), and I have some RL friends and family still in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Do not hold your breath on WoW coming out any time soon...there are so many damn problems with it right now. I was on Alpha and am on Beta now...there are so many issues to work out. I stopped playing a few weeks ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Not leaving for WoW, though ask me again when Vanguard comes out. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'll probably stick with EQ for a while.  I'm still having fun anyway.<br />
<br />
...and Litgruv, you know you need a break when you post in agreement with your own post. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I already know what I'm going to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Try it. Just like I will eq2 just like I did DAoC. For 2 years as a matter of fact. When I stop having fun somewhere I leave. Just like I do a bad relationship in real life. I have no  long term commitments to anything :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm out given two things...<br />
<br />
1) A better computer to run WoW on<br />
2) WoW in the box</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I like most will try WoW before canceling my EQ account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm definitely staying with EQ. Only thing that would change my mind is if most of my eq friends changed to WoW. EQ is still fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Agreeing with your own post, that's hilarious :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">When WoW introduces Ogre Magi as playables, and incorporates defection, then Flufy, Fuzi, Likk, Shokilaat, Bubianaya, Kulidenai, Lapier, and a mule to be named later are getting combined onto one account and mothballed.<br />
<br />
Beyond WoW, theres no chance of me going to any other mmorpg unless it includes better customer service, more internal 'logic' (gnomes can bash and interrupt ogres?  /slap), and shotguns.  <br />
<br />
I am close to burnt on D&amp;D-based games.  I believe I'll have a well-done dark future/cyberpunk mmorpg plz~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Helzik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">...(gnomes can bash and interrupt ogres?  /slap)...  <br />
<br />
<br />
Do not underestimate the power of a good swift kick in the shins.  That sudden sharp pain might be just enough to distract one from the spell one is casting.  Plus, it often leads to a great game of gnome-ball.   :D<br />
<br />
I will be staying with EQ for a while.  I play very casually, I am in a fun, casual guild, and I have a whole lot of zones and content that I'd like to see before I hang up my black fur boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">OMG they gave gnome clerics kick now!  ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">There really should be another choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will give WoW a chance to be the EQ killer I have been looking for, but if its not I will be back to EQ&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats basically how MOST people who have been playing this game 5 years feel, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I used to try the rest, now someone will have to prove that WoW (or any other game for that matter) is better.  Alot of games were great in Alpha/Beta, but graphics and a storyline just don't cut it.  PLAYABILITY, that is what will get me to hang up my Shamans, Ranger, Cleric...etc.<br />
<br />
I won't be seeing PoT and parts of GoD, but I am OK with that.  When the game gets old, I like to go bash frogs in Seb (My Cleric is OK with that even tho he's a frog too).  I still like alot of old zones, and frequent LoY zones too.  PoP stuff is somewhat fun, but very overcrowded with people I would rather avoid.<br />
<br />
If WoW turns out like expected, I may scoot on over.  But, every game has that potential, only EQ has delivered IMO.  Maybe if WoW gets close, SOE will clean up EQ a bit (If you're gonna dream, dream big).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">When even upgrades to older games force you to pay for upgrades to your system, it might be worth it to get a new game to go with the new system. I may be done for good with EQ soon, the time suck is getting agrevating, not sure measuring accomplishments by the hours you spend online are really worth it anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I like the grass here. It does however look very nice and green on the other side :)<br />
<br />
That is exactly how I feel about it so I will atleast give it a try. If it feels like EQ did in the early days I might go WoW 100%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Months of feedbacking, posting, EMails, and even direct conversation with a GM.<br />
<br />
Result: the understanding that SoE wouldn't piss on a shaman if we were on fire.<br />
<br />
I have put too much work into Mathi to delete her, and I have some friends who will not be leaving EQ.  Personally though (and I never thought I would say this) I am sick and tired of the way EQ is being run and I want something better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I'll play both and see which one I play more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Same as Lumor, I'm not quitting EQ until I either get fed up or something else comes along that is better. I'll play both while I decide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Mathi even considering leaving the game?!?!<br />
<br />
Never thought I would hear that...then again, alot of things have been outta whack for awhile /shrug<br />
