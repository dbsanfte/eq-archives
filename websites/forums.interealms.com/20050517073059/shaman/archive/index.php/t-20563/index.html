I see only a few whiners, and overall a pretty reasonable group of people in that thread.  Yes they need tweaks, but they aren't rabid about them (except for the 1-2 extreme players posting).  Their boards are tame by comparison to much of the ranting we've had here recently.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree with the Berserkers.  It's been long enough now since GoD's been out, and yet they have zero AA's besides the barebone basics every melee has.  Having played a zerker into the 50's and probably will continue to level him, I can identify with the issues at hand.  The snares are completely unreliable, as it has worn off so many times just seconds after landing.  The stuns are fine, with the exception that of all the upgrades you get, it still confines it to level 55 mobs.  The war cries are nice, except that it only lasts a minute for every 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
It's just like how beastlords were when they first came out, it took SOE forever to figure stuff out for them.  For the life of me, I just don't know how a company comes up with a concept but no details and still move forward with it.  It's kind of like coming up with a cool parachute backpack system, only you forgot to put the parachute in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They have every right to complain. They are, hands down, the most worthless class in the game. No raid role at all, unless you count killing the MA by overriding his /defensive with a crappy war cry. Look ma, a ranger with less dps and no spells. So they got a nice epic. BFD. If it was as bad as half the epics out there, it wouldnt get done. Tell me again whats the point of making a new quest with a worthless result?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This may all be true, but it is ridiculous to be whining about class balancing issues for a new class 5 weeks after introduction.  <br />
<br />
They are just going to have to muddle along and things will expand for them as, somehow, a role is identified that isn't going to make the other classes go nuts.  <br />
<br />
It was incredibly stupid to make a new melee class, and while I appreciate that you guys have berserker twinks, if you seriously expected a unique role, incredible power and completed design, that was not realistic.  <br />
<br />
Be happy you got that stupid epic that should be nerfed.  Or require you to quest in Teir 3 PoP zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lessons learned over the life of EQ do make it seem ridiculous for a player to expect his class to be balance a mere month after introduction, but...<br />
<br />
What's ridiculous is that SOE adds a new class without even making an attempt at completing it (Class specific AAs, SOME sort of unique role in a group/raid setting to make the class useful)<br />
<br />
I can understand where people are coming from with the whole &quot;you shoulda known better&quot; but that doesn't excuse SOE. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think if the class is having issues this early they should speak out about them. That way if theyre bugs that require small tweaks SOE can handle them fast. They did buy an expansion just to be able to play this class. Theyre paying customers.<br />
<br />
I also think its pretty obvious that this class is a copy and paste of a warrior with an armor handicap and a few extra skills. I recall a couple patches ago when they were getting bash skill at level 6 and they had it removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dunno, i mean what do rogues bring to the table in a raid ?  DPS right ?<br />
<br />
I really dont think zerkers should have anything other then pure DPS to bring to a raid. It makes life simple. <br />
<br />
When i read the zerker desciption i thought another pure DPS melee. Maybe im wrong though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail, Beastlords.  Took them a while to get balanced into a rather nice class, and there was a lot of talk from the BL community about how to implement their class, much like this 'zerker discussion.  I'd like to see them get some interesting skills and a more viable role in the game, they deserve it just like every other class does.  They can start by upping chain drop rates in all zones to help them out =)<br />
<br />
The discussion on that thread overall is vastly more mature than most of the discussion here over the past months.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Rogues bring more to the table besides some of he best DPS in the game - terrific invis, lock picking, and trap disarming in addition to DPS.  <br />
<br />
I also would expect that Zerkers would be pure DPS melee - but there are better classes for that, including rogues.  Can't think of anything zerkers are best at. What's wrong with THAT picture?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I never quite understood the purpose or role of zerkers to begin with...  I dont think soe really thought through the purpose of the class at all beyond hey a new class might generat some new interest in our droping subscription rate.  The last thing this game needed was a new class, never mind one so porely implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah. The class is on the low end of melee dps, and can basically ONLY do dps. Stunning/snaring noob (under lvl 55) crap with thrown axes (requiring them to be out of melee) is so lame it makes Baby Vallon cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just to clarify, the Berserker stun/snare abilities can be done from melee. <br />
<br />
I have a berserker in his 20's now and so far is a fun class. I do see some very big gaps coming in the high levels for him though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kraglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with Lit.  I think the ber role should be simple: Pure unadulterated DPS.  Much better dps than rogues and monks, but without some spiffy special skill like SoS or FD.  I honestly couldn't see them playing any other role, because what role needs to be played at this stage in the game other than melee dps?  But I feel that in the same respect, to balance it, rogue's sneak and monks FD/pulling abilities should be tuned enough to make the adjustment fair lol.  But then again, a lot of classes need tweaking.  I'm in the same, small mindset of people that think classes should have defined, necessary roles and not be molded into one.  I&quot;m also rambling incoherantly, so I'll stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Rangers really don't have a role other than DPS in raid situations either.  Zerkers are the only 2-hand DPS class, isn't that unique :P<br />
<br />
I have no sympathy for people that PL an new class then gripe because it's &quot;broken&quot;.  Anyone remember when Plane of Time was first reached?  SOE never completes things when they are new.  They push and push to get it out hoping they can patch out the fixes faster than people can obtain the parts they haven't finished.  This is how they work, get used to it people.<br />
<br />
I can hear the raid shouts now &quot;ZERKER DOWN&quot; &quot;ZERKER DOWN&quot; :D :D :D<br />

Zerkers need work as a class.  They have a right to bitch until said work is done.  Shamans also need work.  Nuff said.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The big problem for zerkers right now is that thay gain attack via there wep skills and offence at the rate that a knight does. WHICH means thay miss around 60 percent of the time on a good day. the stated DPS classes all hit 60 percent of the time. and seeing as how thay have to use the large two handers thay can not or will never do more damage then the knights do in melee untill thay make a change to the way there attack is figured. since the vast magority of there weps thay got acssess to are the KNIGHT class weps this means there more then likely useing the same one that SK is useing which means that SK will out damage him if the SK is going for DPS and not pulling and other some such becouse the SK suppliments its melee with spell damage. this is probley the biggest miss coded thing that I have seen right off the bat on them ( have a 23 zer, have a 32 SK and a 30 war and have been montoring the attack incress per skill point in wep and offence on all of them [becouse was so pissed that a shaman ( pre planer power ) could nto get over 1k attack base]).<br />
<br />
actully if thay coded them back to be up with the DPS classes in hit rate there DPS would go up to respectable levels.</div></div><hr />

You mean like not even test how the new graphics changes affect the content that the most devoted players access every day?<br />

&quot;TZ warps when he's cornered?!  Perfect!&quot;<br />

&quot;VZ warps to origin when his arm goes into the wall?!  That's fabulous!&quot;<br />

&quot;Quarm warps whenever comes within 2 inches of an obstacle AND he gets stuck in the wall with a modicum of melee push?!  That's just what we wanted!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The berzerker class was only intended to allow GoD to be marketed to the pre-Time crowd.  'Zerkers and Tribute...they were supposed to be the hooks for the majority of EQ players. <br />
<br />
Now whether that was implemented correctly, I'll let you decide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Stardestroyer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">**** theres too many whiners on this board, the zerker class is incomplete in its current state</div></div><hr />

<br />
Litgruv, how many times will that make it again? I get confused.....<br />
<br />
Anyway, the beserker thread didn't have much content in it. I think they could use a special ability but think that crying after 42 days that the class is broken is a little amusing. At least we are crying after several years of walking to Halas uphill both ways through the driving snow with grandma on our back, blah, blah.<br />
<br />
No one should be able to out complain Shaman, I say we step it up a gear. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Berserkers can do this also.<br />
<br />
The big problem for zerkers right now is that thay gain attack via there wep skills and offence at the rate that a knight does. WHICH means thay miss around 60 percent of the time on a good day. the stated DPS classes all hit 60 percent of the time. <br />
<br />
Incorect, same damage and skill table advancement as Warriors. Same HP tables as knights. With the same weapon, berserkers will do more DPS than Knights by a good margin.<br />
<br />
Berserkers have problems, but let's make sure we understand the real problems or not spread incorrect information.<br />
<br />
Basic issue is that Berserkers have about the same DPS as monks ... maybe a bit more. This makes them the best 'any angle' melee DPS class. That is ok but doesn't say too much. Then they have zero utility after that. None whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Class balance requires that you either have to be the clear best at something with little to no utility or good at something with some or lots of utility. Right now, neither is not true for berserkers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Another minor problem that berserkers have is their &quot;special&quot; abilities don't work in PvP so one a red server you're just another warrior that can't use 1hs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i reaaly cant be bothered now, they are right beastlords wheer write we are right, most classes with problems are right as SoE cant get balance ideas or anything right. I personally would love to see SoE crash and die now.<br />
but anyhow what i would say is if you think eq2 will be different you are wrong. Apart from much improved graphics it will apartently continue all the other crap things that eq has, and then make it worse.<br />
but i am bitter and twisted, i liked my shaman but now i really cant be bothered playing him cos he so crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Even when I first heard of the Berzerker class, I wondered what they hell they were thinking.  They are in the middle of this melee balance nightmare, and they introduce ANOTHER melee class??  On top of that its another DPS class, and you know how touchy people get if they think another class can outdamage them.<br />
<br />
So now you have a warrior, who has less hps, no defensive, no spells and DPS much lower then a rogue.  What is the point of them.  They either need rogue+ dps, or some killer ability.  The thing that saved the beastlord class was SLOW being added to them and their stackable clarity/regen line of spells.  The berzerker class was DOA.  I actually haven't even run across a berzerker yet, thats how good the class is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">actually they do have some utility. they have snare/stun/de-agro discs and they have warcry which is a group buff. Unfortunately, Warcry only lasts 1 minute and has a 30 minute refresh time. The other discs only work on mobs 55 and below and don't have a guanteed amount of time they will last like snare spells. I think once SOE works out those issues they will be worth a little more. A little bit of bright side is they have the most ac/hp of any chain class. They make decent duoing partners in alot of Non-PoP zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Class balance requires that you either have to be the clear best at something with little to no utility or good at something with some or lots of utility.

<br />
<br />
<br />
Which monks dont have either. 9/10 times bards are better pullers, rogues (and now zerkers) are better dps, and level 1 wizards in their newbie robes are better tanks. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I think if you look at BER abilities and skills, its clear that they are a work in progress.
