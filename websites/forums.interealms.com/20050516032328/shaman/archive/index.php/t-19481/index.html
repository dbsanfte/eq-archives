<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gawds I HATE leveling. <br />
<br />
But yes Kudos to the Shaman community trying to make a differnce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hello Wytch. Thought you quit playing but apparently its SH for you. Still remember fighting you waaaay back. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi Asta!<br />
<br />
I thought I would have been back on VZ but found a group of hardcore players like myself who wanted to see time.<br />
<br />
Since you guys hate BBO (Big Beautiful Ogres) I had to go else where.  <br />
<br />
Honest I left due to the lack of Shaman prowess in pvp.   All those people I pk'd from level 1 to 50 started to look me up and and stomp me at 65.<br />
<br />
Rogues and Paladins give me nightmares :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You realize we've had ogres in the guild for quite some time now? Even have Reipin in it.   :eek:  Don't tell me you aren't bloodthirsty, just a little.<br />
<br />
I hear you though, I pretty much quit when meleeing people to death was the only viable option, and not a very good one at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes I heard you allow Darks in the guild now.  Call me funny but I just can't bring myself to sleep with the enemy.  <br />
<br />
I mean when I see you (or any Defiant but mostly you!) it goes all hazy and I hear this voice say to me &quot;KILL...KILL...KILL&quot;<br />
<br />
What sucks is when I walk up to any melee with decent resists and I am the one killled.   My inner voice is suicidal<br />
<br />
I miss you guys :(</div></div><hr />
