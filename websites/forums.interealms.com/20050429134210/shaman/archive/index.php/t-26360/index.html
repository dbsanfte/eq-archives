<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Olympe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK so I need to get to the Badlands to speak with the guy for the Dragonscale Leatherworking quest. <br />
<br />
Question is what is the best way for a Horde character to get there ?<br />
Its looking like Atari Highlands - Wetlands - Loch Modan - Badlands but of course that means running through Alliance territory and more so a tunnel with PvP enabled Dwarfs (play on a PvE server).  Is there a better way or a roundabout route through the above ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's the only way, unless you wanna travel through a level 55+ zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's the way... it's not so bad really.  The dwarf guards in the tunnels are level 30ish and you can run past them without worrying about flagging for PvP.  Or you can kill them all if that's your game :).<br />
<br />
Once there, you get a flightpath to Kargath that you can get to from Gromgol and Undercity and a few other places.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a friendly high level warlock summon you to kargath, that's what we do now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Olympe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys thought as much....looks like I got a fun evening ahead of me then playing tag with the guards :)</div></div><hr />
