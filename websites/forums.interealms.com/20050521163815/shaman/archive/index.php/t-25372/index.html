<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What AAs do you guys think are the most important you have to be able to solo the named mobs in OoW that drop the runes? I know I need more AC and HP/Mana but in general what tools am I missing? My magelo is up to date and in my sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your AAs and gear are good enough to solo NC nameds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spirit calling could help, the more defencive and dot crit AAs the better. spiritual channeling could come in handy but really you should be able to farm all your 66-68 spells with what you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sweet, thanks for the replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>pugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye you should be able to farm svl different names. I have bout the same hp's. Have a few hundred more ac and id5 on top of what you have but could do without em. Spirit call is nice on those quick summoning mobs....soon as you put the dogs on they stop summoning you...as long as you keep em rooted and it gives you plenty of time to put all 4 or 5 dots back on em and finish em off. Also good for the gating mobs as it allows you a better chance to stun the foo's while you trying to nuke em down fast.<br />
<br />
Just find out if its a quick summoning mob or slow....i.e. 6 seconds or 2 to 3. If its slow its cake...ques on you dots on them....youll outlast everytime. Fast summoners are tricky and I think yould prolly be bout 50/50 win lose on em. Bring a cleric hydra or a friend that can heal a little and you can stand there and tank em just fine.<br />
<br />
Focus on soloing 2 or 3 named and you should have your runes in no time. In a 6 hour name farming period I can usually farm anywhere from 2 (unlucky night) - 8 (good night lots of names lots of runes). Ive farmed all mine, most of my roomates and his womans on my non raiding time. As well as while in these zones you can get faction and get some of that faction gear. Ive gotten wrist/head/arm/feet while lookin for runes. And that will pump up your ac pretty quick.<br />
<br />
Anyway rambling a bit...good luck :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can probably do NC named with the Root/DoT/Back Up/Heal/Get Summoned/Repeat strat. You are going to want to get Affliction Haste 5 tribute though so that you can get your DoTs in between summons.<br />
<br />
1) Pull the mob with malos.<br />
2) Root<br />
3) Get Cripple, Sinia, Turg, and Malicious in<br />
4) Click your 1.0<br />
5) Cast Breath of Wunshi<br />
6) Cast Curse of Sisslak<br />
7) Get summoned, back up<br />
8) Click your 1.5<br />
9) Cast Bane<br />
10) Continue getting summoned and backing up, apply heals as needed. Sic doggies if you get in an emergency situation, as they will &quot;Tank&quot; if the mob is rooted.<br />
<br />
This was a generally viable tactic back in Gates for soloing Sewers named, sort of our variation on necro Snare/Summon/Mujaki kiting that necros can do. Back then Quies only healed 300 a tick, so straight up tanking partially slowable 950 hitters wasn't that feasable.</div></div><hr />
