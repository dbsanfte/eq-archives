I didnt have to scroll down quite one page between your post and the next.  Possibly, you could aim to have a 2 screen sig pic?</div></div><hr />

2. Resize it in Paint or whatever.<br />
3. Upload it to your own webspace, like through your ISP or whatever.<br />
4. Link that one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>drool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">While these formulas seem to make decent ballpark estimates, they are not as exact as people like to say.<br />
<br />
First, the amout varies not only based on your WIS stat, but also based on your level.  This formula from EQ expert seems to be closest:<br />
<br />
Formula 1<br />
<br />
If you have less than 200 wis/int: Mana = Level x ((STAT/5)+2)<br />
<br />
If you have over 200 wis/int : Mana = Level x (((STAT-200)/10)+42)<br />
<br />
Effectively you gain 10 points of Mana for each point of WIS/INT  at level 50, up to 200, then 5 points of Mana for every point over 200 Wis/Int . <br />
<br />
Although, as someone said, it is even less after 255 WIS.<br />
<br />
However, let me point out a clear example from my char.<br />
<br />
Character State------------------------------Mana Total<br />
======================================================<br />
All armor worn-------------------------------3266<br />
Remove a +2 WIS +5 mana item------------3248 (13 lost from 2 wis)<br />
Remove a +3 WIS +55 mana item-----------3197 (14 lost from 3 wis)<br />
<br />
Note above, that removal of a 3 WIS item only dropped my mana by 14, while the 2 WIS item dropped it by only 13).  Both items were the only item removed at the time, so compare the new total to the all armor worn total.. Also, don't forget to subtract the mana for the item first.<br />
<br />
So I was losing 6.5 mana/WIS on the first item removal, but only 4.66 mana/WIS on the second one.<br />
<br />
I did this with various other items, and the result bounced around alot.<br />
<br />
I also did this with my wisdom below 200, and verified that I lost alot more mana for the same piece of armor in that state.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">rofl, I forgot all about that post.  That was back in the day when I was still trying to get baz/farmable stuff for my shammy to better my self for the guild is was trying to get into.  Thank you for the formula for it, maybe it will help others of lower lvls to decide between that 20wis no mana item, and that 50mana 5 wis item.</div></div><hr />
