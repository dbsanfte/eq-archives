<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khavari Reborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know the difference between the two commands.  From what I have read the /q command takes you out of game with you acting like you went LD.  So instead of sitting down and camping like a peaceful little Ranger, you run amok whacking at stuff here and there.  Is this correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Narreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When you /q out, you are treated as if you were LD. People who are LD are controlled by the AI for a breif moment before exiting the game world. If you were engaged in a fight before your /q command, your AI doppleganger will continue fighting on that mob. When that mob dies, the doppleganger will stand still and aggro nothing. Wandering mobs who are KoS to you may aggro you, and you may start fighting again. If, in the course of a fight between a mob, you are taken to 15% (my guess, not sure at all) of your total HP, your character will start to turn and run away from the mob you were engaged.<br />
<br />
So in a nutshell, when you /q out or go LD, you act as if you were a nonaggroing mob. If hit, you'll hit back. If you're about to die, you flee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nift Trailhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also if you are sitting and /q you will be removed in 15 secs if not aggroed.  If standing it is 30 secs.  <br />
<br />
However, if you are aggroed you will not leave the game until either the mob is dead and you are not reaggroed for 30 sec, or you die.  Upon death you will be removed when the game tries to send you to bind point.<br />
<br />
Many times casters will bind a little too close and get into a death loop so the /q and accept death is better than the die spawn die again for however many times you take to figure it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Canson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The other night I brought on my Mule account to give something to my wife. I then /q'ed the mule out and brought on my main account. When I logged on the mule was still sitting there, no LD message just sitting there. I was even sending the mule tells just to see.<br />
<br />
Took almost 15 minutes for the mule to disappear. <br />
<br />
Kinda makes you wonder a bit... guess I would have gotten a 1018 error for all that time if I had been on the same account.<br />
