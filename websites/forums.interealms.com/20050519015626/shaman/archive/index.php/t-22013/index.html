<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's about time I started working on some Incorporeal armor.  I have only been in the Miragul's theme a couple of times, always in a pickup group with my now-defunct guild.  I haven't been able to find a lot of info about this theme, so I'm hoping some of my fellow shaman can share any advice or experience they've had there.  <br />
<br />
Since my guild died, I literally have zero active players in my friends list.  I'll be 3-boxing the adventures, with an enchanter, mage, and shaman.<br />
<br />
I know the general consensus is that normal LDoNs are super-easy, even in less than full groups.  My gear is only fair, however, and I have precious few AAs, so they won't be a pushover for me.  Does anyone have experience 3-boxing these things with minimal gear and AAs at the level-63 dungeons?  <br />
<br />
My prior LDoN experiences have always been with the lower-difficulty dungeons.  Are the highest level of normals, level 63, even doable with 3 characters?  I guess I'd like some perspective and opinions before I trudge all 3 characters out to Everfrost from their current location and bind point deep inside Droga, only to find out I have no shot whatsoever without another 50 AAs.  <br />
<br />
I've done quite a bit of enchanter-charming in the Takish theme while working on my mage pet focus, but that was at a level where all mobs were charmable.  I can't count on even finding a charmable mob at the level-63 difficulty, let alone one near the entrance, so dps might be a problem.  I've got the DPoC pet focus for my mage pet, which will help some.<br />
<br />
Again, I'm just looking for some general advice, opinion, and experiences on the Miragul's theme.  Given how many shaman will venture there eventually in search of the Incorporael armor, it may be a topic that helps others, as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Find a necro who's LFG, their DoT (Horror) is from Miragul's. Most of the dungeons will have either Undead (which necros can mez/slow) or casters (which they can mind wrack) or both. They also provide snare, which is something you currently lack, and respectable DPS.<br />
<br />
The only charmable mobs are the Holgresh, all of which are casters, and they can dispell themselved which is bad. in general charming there isn't worth it. pulls can get a little messy, but your enchanter can pacify so you should be ok. a lot of the dungeons in miraguls go up and down steep slopes, which can make pulling tricky. Ice nukes also don't work too well, but poison seems to do okay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that you will struggle to do a LDoN 3 boxing, especially without a melee class. If all 3 characters had 200+ AA and EP+ gear, sure....<br />
<br />
I have done LDoNs with 4:<br />
<br />
Bard &amp; chanter (2 boxed)<br />
SK<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
and it was not easy at all. I had about 70AA at the time and the bard had a lot more.<br />
<br />
Try it and see, I guess!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Miraguls is not all that hard,  I have pulled as a shaman on these a lot of the time and root-pulling is a good way to go.  Of course with pacification it is that much easier.<br />
<br />
When I did these I was the only healer in a group of all melee so my experience will be a lot different that yours, but I would say the mage pet should easily be able to tank after you shrug aggro on your shaman.  Just take it slow at first and learn the mobs that will spawn in these dungeons and you probably will be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">chanters can single or control virtually every pull in the mira ldons, I have done a ton of them...but then again I am not 3 boxing and theres a tank handy that I work well with. 3box solo will be hard as hell I think but tell us how you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Doesn't sound like it would be too hard, but I'd suggest getting 65 and Q, and also malos if you don't have malo.  Keep kei/VoQ on all 3 characters, and learn to pet pull with your shaman if you can't seem to get singles otherwise, since crowdcontrol while 3boxing would be annoying.  Tank with the shaman, and use the mage and enchanter for dps.  I've tanked slowed normal mobs naked before (not easily, but it was doable) so its definitely something you *can* do...keeping Q on yourself will pretty much eliminate the dps of a slowed, non-named mob.  If you're really worried about it, donate for a virtue before you head in (hopping around from one camp to the next will just about guarantee you find a cleric willing to buff you in trade for a small donation and/or some peridots) and be sure to take only slaughters and collects.  Invest in LR5 asap on the shaman, too, it will make you a much better tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've done 60 normals with my SK/SHM combo (65) and a 58 cleric.  Pretty easy (the cleric will CH occasionally).  I've also done 65 normals, which are a trifle tougher with that pair (trio), but not annoyingly so.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing if you can handle Droga 3 boxing, normal 65LDoNs won't be terribly difficult.  Get everyone to 65 first though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Velnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have done miragual's succesfully 3-boxing a 65 pally, 65 necro and a 65 shaman. It should be even easier with your set-up seeing as you can pacify and always get single pulls.<br />
<br />
My advice on adventures, is to always go with low collects (21-24)<br />
<br />
It's been hit or miss whether I succeed or not, but i blame it on lack of experience with 3-boxing.</div></div><hr />
