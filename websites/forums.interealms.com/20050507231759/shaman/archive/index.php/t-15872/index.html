<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ughlei Duukling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really like how spells and spell scrolls now list there effects when you right click them. However shaman potions do not offer a detailed explanation of what they do when you click on them or a link of them. I think if people were aware of what potions did they would be more apt to buy them. Aside from a small handful of potions that are well known many potions and their effects are unknown to the population at large there for they are never requested. I feedbacked this in hopes that they will add this feature I hope more will feedback it also.<br />
