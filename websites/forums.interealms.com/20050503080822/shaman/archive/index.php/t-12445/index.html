<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently, we got some nice parses of tanking some PoP mobs:<br />
<br />
1300ac vs 1000ac (shaman): ~3% difference<br />
1500ac vs 1000ac (cleric): ~4% difference<br />
<br />
The AA descriptions for combat agility and stability say, simply, that you will take 2, 5, and 10 percent less hits (or damage).<br />
<br />
Recent threads show that warriors parsing CA1 vs CA5 show an overall ~4% decrease in hits and increase in misses (no change in dodge, parry, riposte - CA does not work off the &quot;dodge&quot; skill at all).  Is CA3 vs CA0 the full 10% that is advertised?  That is, if you were getting hit 70% of the time without AA, after you would be getting hit 63% of the time with CA3?<br />
<br />
The same source said that C. Stability didn't decrease the max-hit damage at all, but did decrease the less-than-max distribution.  This seems to indicate that CS is not working as advertised.  From the description, the max damage for all hits should be decreased 10%.<br />
<br />
Since there is some significant doubt as to how combat agility/stability actually work for a shaman (or anyone), does anyone have some definitive parses?  Subjective &quot;got missed 8x in a row&quot; accounts happen for me already with CA0 =)<br />
<br />
IMO, even though shamans don't tank that often (especially with PoP), a 10% reduction in hits taken would be worth the 12AA for CA3.  An additional 5% for 15AA (LR5) would be less worthwhile, but something to consider after maxing out more exciting/useful things.<br />
<br />
Does CA work when attacked from behind/sides?  I assume so.<br />
<br />
Obviously, not taking hits makes channeling easier than taking less damage, so CA&gt;CS, but if CS3 also gave a 10% damage-taken reduction (I am doubtful), I'd think it would be a good buy after CA3 and before LR5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">CS does not work the way you assume. It is possible to decrease a mob's overall damage without touching its max hit.<br />
<br />
I remember with the onset of Luclin, warriors were eagerly parsing CS to figure out how it worked, since the assumption was that it was like a mini-defensive. The conclusion they reached was CS3 gives a 10% chance to lower a mob's DI (damage interval). Hence while they parsed at 10% less damage taken, the max hit remained the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CS works like this(at least that's how it seems to work to me):<br />
<br />
Let's say the max hit of X mob is 500 and his min hit is 100.<br />
<br />
Everytime you mitigate a portion of the damage(i.e. you do not get hit for full(500 in this example)), you will additionally mitigate a percentage(let's say 10% for CS 3) based on the damage you mitigated.<br />
<br />
So a CA 0 Shaman will get hit for 450, while a CA 3 Shaman will take 445 damage(10% of 50 = 5) from the same hit. You won't drop below the min hit however and obviously if you mitigate 0 you will still get hit for 500, sicne 10% of 0 is...0!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Everytime you mitigate a portion of the damage(i.e. you do not get hit for full(500 in this example)), you will additionally mitigate a percentage(let's say 10% for CS 3) based on the damage you mitigated.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, so warriors parsed a 10% *overall* damage reduction?  Every time they were hit for max, they didn't mitigate anything.  Therefore, the amount mitigiated when they *did* must be greater than 10% - say, 66% chance of mitigating, and when you do, CS3 takes off 15% ...<br />
<br />
This seems highly dubious, given that the amount of max hits is highly influenced by AC mitigation ... of course, I know it is possible to code so there is in fact an exact 10% dmg reduction regardless of AC/atk/maxhit/whatever, but it seems more likely that the description is misleading.<br />
<br />
Does this CS3 10%-dmg-taken hold for shamans?  Is &quot;chance of mitigating&quot; lower but &quot;amount mitigated&quot; higher in order to guarantee the overall 10% result?<br />
<br />
Simply: with 18AA banked, I want to know what I'm going to get before spending 12 of it - I'd be dissappointed to take more damage than the AA descriptions promise.  Can anybody reassure me? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So a CA 0 Shaman will get hit for 450, while a CA 3 Shaman will take 445 damage(10% of 50 = 5) from the same hit.

<br />
Well, that's only a 1.1% reduction ((450-445)/450) in damage taken - not exactly worth my 12 AA =)<br />
<br />
Which is why actual parses would be reassuring ... unfortunately it's not possible to &quot;turn off&quot; your AA temporarily so I'm not holding my breath =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe it works a bit differently.  <br />
CA3 should increase your &quot;to avoid&quot; number which is most useful with mobs that allow you to avoid their melee via AC.  Read . . non PoP mobs.  I find that I am a much much better tank in places outside of PoP where AC actually makes a big difference.  In PoP, I haven't noticed a great difference with CA3.  Perhaps that 10% or perhaps less.  <br />
<br />
With CS, you get a 10% chance to mitigate the damage done to you to a lower number.  Thus if the mob's normal max hit was 500, you would be hit as normal according to AC and evasive skills, BUT 10% of the time a mob hit you, the damage he did would be reduced significantly.  You wouldn't be able to notice this difference as it would only occur 10% of the time.  However, over time, that 10% does make you a 10% better tank since you take 10% less damage.  Not on all hits, but in the average of all damage you recieve.  Or that is the theory at least.  I imagine it was very hard to implement that and I would not be surprised to find that it wasn't working correctly.  <br />
I see that skill as mostly being beneficial to a MA sort like a warrior.  His job is to take damage, and 10% less damage on him adds up to make him a 10% better tank.  Which, when it matters, might make the 10% difference it takes between a CH landing and his HPs zipping up again and a CH landing on his corpse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CS couldn't only affect 10% of hits if it reduced overall damage taken by 10%.  In order to do that, it would have to mitigate those 10% to 0dmg.  So clearly, either CS affects more than 10% of hits, or it reduces overall damage by less than 10%.<br />
<br />
What you say seems plausible though - that the relative benefits vary by mob, AC, plate/chain, possibly even defense skills, and if it was tuned for a 10% damage reduction for the tank classes, it might offer less for shamans (or more, look at ferocity for bst/bard compared to classes who  already had 240+ dual wield).  It would be simpler to weigh the value of the AA if in fact the AA gave an across the board 10% decrease in damage per hit and 10% more misses, regardless of those variables.<br />
<br />
I think I'll pass on CA/CS until somebody invests the effort in parsing before/after vs PoP exp mobs (holds breath).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You lost me there. <br />
AC/ATK/Max/Min Hit play a significant role there. Somebody with a higher AC in theory will mitigate more damage and thus, he will have a bigger advantage from the 10% mitigation that CS 3 gives. <br />
The more you mitigate based on AC etc. the more you will additionally mitigate from CS 3.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, so warriors parsed a 10% *overall* damage reduction? Every time they were hit for max, they didn't mitigate anything. Therefore, the amount mitigiated when they *did* must be greater than 10% - say, 66% chance of mitigating, and when you do, CS3 takes off 15% ...&quot;<br />
<br />
Any link...why does the amount mitigated have to be greater than 10% if the 10% is based on what you mitigate ?<br />
if you mitigate 10 damage from the 500 max, you will mitigate an additional point with CS 3, thus mitigating 11 damage.<br />
<br />
Maybe i just misunderstood what you were trying to say...it's early over here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Combat Stability vs. Combat Agility - still a wee confused (http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=3086.topic) <br />
<br />
Hope this link helps answer some questions here.  The most(to me) relevant quote from this thread is this:<br />
Fortunately thats not the case. According to the only known LR/ID logs on Steel Warrior, both ID5 and LR5 reduced incoming damage by roughly 5%, 1% per level. LR (obviously) increased avoidance, while ID shifted the average damage of incoming hits downward. Assuming ID/LR work like CS/CA (it says so in the description) you can assume roughly 10% less damage with both skills maxed. There are various debates as to possible changes in CA/CS's effectiveness based on AC, but there have been no tests to prove this. <br />
<br />
The parse mentioned above comes from this thread:  Damage Mitigation VS Avoidence (http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=2742.topic) .  On the second page is a post from Aauminki that contains the results of these parses.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimmlukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, all the evidence points to CA as increasing your ability to make a mob miss...in the case of CA3 it would increase the mobs miss chance by 10%...but it wouldn't decrease your total damage by 10%: there are other factors involved with damage avoidance (riposte,dodge, block, etc), and then damage MITIGATION is seperate.<br />
<br />
Having said that, CA does appear to be effective.  Here's a post at the Paladin board that analyzes some parses of ZERO defensive AA Vs CA3 and PE...lots math, but interesting conclusions:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In a Nutshell....<br />
<br />
Combat Agility Reduces actual HITS you take.   CA3 has a 10% chance increace that you will Avoid a hit... it doesn't mean you'll get hit 10% less, just that you have a 10% greater CHANCE of not getting hit.    Lightning Reflexes increases this chance to roughly 15%.<br />
<br />
Combat Stability is similar in that it increase your chance to Mitigate a hit's Damage by 10% more percent, Not that you will mitigate 10% more damage overall.<br />
<br />
Here's where Rumour Steps in... I know Several HIGH AA Clerics who have CA3/LR5/CS3 and they say the following.... with CA3/LR5, you do INDEED notice less hits.   With CS3 you notice a small decrease in Damage taken, but apparently.. you also notice your ability to Channel a spell increases.<br />
<br />
Here's what I have seen....<br />
<br />
I play A Shaman with 88 AA, I have CA3, and LR2 so far,  I buff out to 1400 AC and 6500 HP,   I have Slightly more AC and HP than my friend's level 65 Ogre Warrior who DOES NOT have any points spent into Combat Agility, Stability or any other Defensive AA's besides Dura3.<br />
<br />
Against Golems in PoV, on a Slowed Golem, I can tank about 80% as well as he can.   Considering I'm a Caster with no Parry/Riposte skills and a pathetic Dodge skill.. that's a GREAT improvement.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can confirm a lot of what Warg says.  I only have about 6k hp and 1350ish AC, but I also have CA/CS3 and LR/ID5.<br />
<br />
First, CS:  The amount of max hits I get is dependent on the attack of the mobs.  For instance--Fennin Ro hits me for max (1962) just about every hit he connects with.  Of course, Fennin Ro probably has an obscenely high attack number.<br />
<br />
Conversly, let's look at a crystal golem from PoV since most of you will have tried those.  I would say that on average they hit me for 200s when they connect.  That's on AVERAGE.  I get a lot of one hundreds and a few three hundreds.  I VERY seldom get hit for max by the crystal golems.  BEFORE I got CS3 and ID5, they hit me for max most of the time.  For those of you a bit further along, I average about half damage when hit by Krigers in BoT or even-con soldiers/protectors/defenders of fire in PoFire.<br />
<br />
As for CA3/LR5, I can't recommend them highly enough.  Literally, I felt like I could see a difference each level of LR I got.  You could see them hitting less.  I seem to get hit maybe 2 of 5 hits.  Some of that is AC, I know, but a lot of it is the skills.  I got hit almost every time by a crystal golem from PoV before I got the skills.  Now, they connect very infrequently.  I tank better than a lot of plate tanks in PoV.<br />
<br />
I can't recomment the defensive skills highly enough.  Get CA/LR as quickly as you can, then CS/ID.  They improve your survivability factor by a ton.  I would go so far as to recommend them as the next skill after canna 5, with possible exceptions for MGB for raiding shaman or maybe RC1.<br />
<br />
I apologize for not having parses on these mobs, but I seldom use one.  These estimates are 'eyeball' guesses only.<br />
<br />
Good luck, guys!<br />

Combat Stability is similar in that it increase your chance to Mitigate a hit's Damage by 10% more percent, Not that you will mitigate 10% more damage overall.<br />
<br />
<br />
My analysis was based on the assumption, from the in-game AA description, that CA3 reduces hits taken by 10%, and CS3 reduces damage per hit taken by 10%.  However, what you say seems plausible.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the links to parses - since there are none for shaman, I'll have to just assume that the benefit is slightly less for shaman, because of our lower base avoidance/mitigation.  That is, warriors mitigate 40% and avoid 40% -&gt; CA3/CS3 -&gt; 44%/44%, shamans would be 20%/20% -&gt; CA3/CS3 -&gt; 22%/22%.<br />
<br />
disclaimer: all the numbers from me are made up, speculation, based on the AA description =)<br />
<br />
I find that a shaman with no defensive AA can already tank a fully slowed tier-2 mob 70% as well as a melee - mostly because of torpor =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd assume they are in high end guilds with access to appropriate gear especially when they mention things like fennin ro, the boss of plane of fire, and how hard he hes.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm at about 3600hps unbuffed and hit 6200~ hps buffed out. Lvl 65 buffs add a fair amount of hps and when your getting gear with 100+hps a slot it can add up to alot pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, My gear is not exactly Representative if the &quot;Average&quot; shaman.    I have a large Mix of Vex Thal items and a few Ornate Chain pieces... I figure eventually I will have a good chunk of Elemental pieces.<br />
<br />
I run at about 4000 HP Unbuffed... that's a lot by any Measurement.   Granted.. there are some Shamans out there coming close to 5K unbuffed these days.<br />
