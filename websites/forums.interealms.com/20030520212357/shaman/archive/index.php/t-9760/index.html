<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apikoros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi. Looking for a good place to hunt in the early 50's. I am 50 even, no jbb. CoM on Drinal is always always over camped. I have all the expansions and like a good mix of exp and loot. I was into Tenebrous Mountains, a zone like that would be cool. Thanks in Advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Karnor's, sebilis, chardok, howling stones.  All good kunark places.  Velious is a bit tougher for day-to-day exp, but you might try Velk's Lab or just exping in Kael.  Not real familiar with luclin spots, but the grey is good, so is Maiden's Eye and Akheva ruins.  None too tough.  Will be a little hard to get a group at some of those right at 50, but get up to 51-53 and you should be fine (turgurs at 51).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get 51 before entering seb, turgurs and SH is just too important to have there, I'd suggest waiting till 52...I found one level helped a lot with resists. Velks is good xp but if CoM is camped on your server I dread to think what velks is like since that place is always packed on my server whereas CoM is usually empty. Lots of retards in Velks too sad to say.<br />
<br />
Hate to say it but Karnor's is a good place at your level despite the constant trains. Get into a good DC/LCY/RCY group and trains are less of a worry. At 52 I spent some time there doing Hands/WL and it was riot.<br />
<br />
Chardok is BYOG and difficult to solo till 56 when you can single pull.<br />
<br />
Good luck :) Shame that CoM is overcamped on your server :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm. Most of the time that I've gone to CoM it's been ghost-town (on Drinal as well). Tenebrous sucks...too many see-invis mobs. Seb is nearly deserted also, quite often. (Level 60+ druids soloing stuff for pp's typically.) I think everyone's packed up and moved to PoT trying to beg-borrow-steal their way into groups there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I solo'd level 50 killing the Gnome guards in Echo Caverns.  If you don't mind becomin KOS to them, they are pretty easy and always came single with slow pull..  Dog dog with HoS can even tank them.  I used Venom of Snake (Ebolt was overkill).  There were 2 in front and 2 back a bit further by a curtain.  I didn't pull from inside the curtain as i'd sometimes get adds, sometimes not.  I would get about 1 blue per cycle of the 4 guards, 20min respawn approx and they would drop up to 6pp.<br />
<br />
Only warning is that while u only become KOS with those gnomes, the 2 Kings are tough (one can't be rooted) and sometimes they are pulled to the zoneline.  When that happens they literally sit right by the zoneline until a server reset, so you'll have to enter Echo invis every time just in case.<br />
<br />
I also had luck soloing in Tenebrous near Katta to get to 50.  Things might start being blue at 50 there but there might still be plenty of aliens and such that are dark blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Skellies in DL are also good till 51 ... some people stay there till 53 but any light blue mobs is too many in a camp that small.</div></div><hr />

I would recommend you do a search in this forum first.<br />
Open the search to say the last year, and not just the last 30 days worth of posts.<br />
<br />
My personal picks for 50 to low 50's.<br />
Ocean of Tears- Seafuries.<br />
Burning Woods- Giants (sarnaks and other stuff if you don't care about faction.)<br />
Skyfire- Everything except Chromodracs.<br />
<br />
Once you get Turgur's, you are a capable slower, and 52+ you will likely find the best exp to be Tier 1 PoP zones if you have friends to group with.  YMMV. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
