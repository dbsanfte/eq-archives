<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know when PoN &quot;Yard Trash&quot; turns light blue. Specifically the werewolves.... I saw in another post that some mobs(ravens, trees perhaps) turn LB at 62. Its it the same for the ww?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beohram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 62 about the only thing that is light blue in PoN are they young bats, and the Banshees that spawn on the zone-in side of the stream.<br />
<br />
At 63, werewolves and about 2/3 of the ravens turn light blue.  Coincidentally enough, the ravens that remain dark blue (the lvl 53 ones) are the ones you were never able to fear.<br />
<br />
At 64 pretty much everything that spawns on the zone-in side of the stream, birds, bats, trees, and spiders will be light blue to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you very much. I just &quot;found&quot; the WW camp lastnight and was quite impressed with the duo Exp there. Im still debating wether or not to push past 61 and after discovering this camp I might go for level 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some nice exp camps in PoN like the hedge and the castle, but for really killer experience, go to PoV.  You can get an AA point in five hours or less with most groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
depending on your group i have gotten 1aa in less than 2 hours and even in crummy groups 1aa in about 3 hours. 2.5 hours seems to be the norm to get a point of AA in PoV in a average 6 man group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arynduil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">By Werewolves, do you guys mean the Ravenous Nightstalkers? Can these be fearkited with Panic Animal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lanandrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think my favorite camp is the &quot;Hedge&quot; by the grave zone out point across the river...constant pulls of Wraiths and Banshee and when the spawn, the Foboding Guardians.  Those guys are just sweet!  that and you can actually see a two -three pixle exp movement every time you kill one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Concerning fear kiting Werewolves, is there a specific spot to do this, so you can avoid adds?<br />
<br />
When I play late at night they're usually open, figured I'd go see how it worked out, duo'd with a 56 cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lythe Featherblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just step back slightly from where you pull them from, stay at zone wall, they path straight out from wall when they run.  All I had to do was run back to wall when fear wore, then fear them again as they came in range, no problems with adds at all.  The hard part isn't fearing them, it's making sure everything is harmonied so that you only get singles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arynduil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;The hard part isn't fearing them, it's making sure everything is harmonied so that you only get singles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Exactly. I did this camp once with an XP group. Harmony is an awesome tool here, otherwise you're probably limited to 3 of them (the one out in the field, the one on the wall, and the farthest one to the left when looking at the rocks). Those ones were single pullable at 59 w/o Harmony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darkleaf Nightwander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can someone discribe for me how to get to the camp that you guys are talking about? I haven't been to PON very much, been farming bow parts for my guild in POI. But I have a level 57 cleric that I like to duo with my 61 ranger and this sounds like a pretty good fit.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me out?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">These are usually camped on my server, but are fun when they are not.  I'm only 57, just got Swiftwind and hunted them a little this morning.  In a little less than an hour I killed 5 (takes a long time solo).  I got about a blue of exp. and two blue diamonds.<br />
<br />
That was nice.</div></div><hr />
