<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maximillien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have a few equipment choices to make...<br />
<br />
Totemic helm ac12 5Wis or Jaundiced bone helm AC18 ? Kinda like the extra wis... not sure how the extra ac will effect me on the JB helm. <br />
<br />
Worked Dragonskin mask ac10 8cha 4sv fire or Bone mask of the Jarsath ac7 2str 8cha 4wis 5 poison and disease? I don't know about this one.. i think bone mask?<br />
<br />
<br />
Flayed Turmoilskin belt ac9 6dex 5wis or Spider fur ac10 5agi dex and 40hp? Wearing spider fur when i am soloing for the extra hps.. and flayed when grouped.<br />
<br />
Wearing the ac stuff puts me at 812ac at 40th (defense not max), wearing the wis items its like 786. Wis 138 with wis items,  129 without.<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you all think? Keep in mind that i have NO plats at the moment.. just paid 13k for a JBB.<br />
<br />
<br />
One other question.. any tips on keeping defense max while grouping? I rarely solo and it has been a chore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Everyone will tell you that AC wins over Wis...but dang, your Wis gear is only 138?  You need to get the cheapest helmet, mask and belt of the above items and then save your money for some more gear for your other slots.<br />
<br />
If you already own all of the above items, wear a combination of gear that will get you over 800, but just barely.  Juggle it to get max wis with 800 AC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personal suggestion: get your Wis at 150 - 160, anytime you get over 160 start looking for AC/HP items to swap out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My views on equipment have changed over time.  I used to obsess about wisdom.  Then I was focused on AC.  Now, I'm a hitpoint junkie.<br />
<br />
I do think that one of the shaman's greatest strengths is our ability to convert hitpoints to mana.  In that sense, I see regen and hitpoints as the two most significant attributes while considering gear.<br />
<br />
For masks, I would wear either an enshrouded veil or a crystal spider eyes (I know, neither on your list).<br />
<br />
For a belt, I would stick with the spider belt.<br />
<br />
Maxxing defense is free!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maximillien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I understand Gloriana... after reading this board for a little while now i have seen alot of them.. <br />
<br />
I want a crystal eye, but i can't afford it yet :)<br />
<br />
Can look at my equipment by clicking my sig. my wis is low, but i think my equipment is pretty good.</div></div><hr />
