<br />
Last night, I had a group try to do the Trial of Execution. We failed twice trying it with 6 people. I've heard though if you are in a 12 person raid, you can get all 12 in? Is that true?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Don't wanna spoil it here incase people wanna figure it out themselves, but toss me a PM Sun if ya want info on it.</div></div><hr />

All 60 or 61.  Was very challenging but after failing a few times we succeeded.<br />
<br />
I'm very happy they added content like this to the expansion.  This is the most fun I've had in a long time, even though we failed quite a few times while figuring it out.<br />
<br />
P.S.  6 people is the absolute limit.  Send me a tell in game if you want to chat Sun, haven't talked to you in a while anyway :)</div></div><hr />

I don't want a spoiler on it.. that's half the fun :) We got better at execution, so there's still hope.<br />
<br />
One thing though Sean, did FoH manage to do them all? I heard a few of them looked like they required some 63ish spells/players.<br />
<br />
Heya Galdraith, I'll try to catch you on soon ;p</div></div><hr />

There's a 30 min &quot;reset&quot; time after you finish a trial where noone can enter it. <br />
Even if you loo all the marks there's still 30 min til it can be done again, I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only problems I've really had with the trials, though, is mobs not spawning..  Like on exec trial, 3 mobs would spawn on a wave and we'd kill them but the executioner would keep walking because no fourth mob was killed.. that kinda sucked =\</div></div><hr />

Valor appears to be the next 'exp' zone while Storms is looking like its meant more for raids.<br />
<br />
Execution is the most straight foward of the trials, maybe not the easist, but easist to learn but it takes alot of DPS.  Common misconception is that CC is the way to go for execution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't started the Trials yet, still way to crowded and don't feel like waiting in line. But I was thinking, can you port pets into the trials?<br />
<br />
I know for excecution you need mega DPS, Could you have a Nec charm an undead prisoner, a Chanter DC charm something then accept the trial and have the charmed mobs come with you?<br />
<br />
probably not as this would make the encounter trivial, but wondering if anyone knew?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">does summon companion work on charmed pets?  If so you should be able to.  Pretty sure our mage summoned their buffed pet in.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes it gets bugged as far as the timer.  On our of ours we left 4 marks on the corpse and the next group up was pretty happy about that, but the trials were seriously buggy that day.  <br />
<br />
Not near as buggy as that stupid hedge though.<br />
<br />
the exe one is a blast.  Our first one when we were exploring was Stoning.  We were dead before we knew what was going on hehe :)  Can't wait to try the rest.</div></div><hr />

I never seem to get lucky and get the right type of people together.  /cry  Almost had the boss mob once in Exe...53% he was down to...then the cleric died and he came after little old me.  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muvandog</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Execution is a lot of fun.  I tanked for execution on our first attempt, and we go the boss down to 40% before he ate through my pajamas and cleric went OOM.  We probably would have won if I had the presence of mind to kite him around for a while to let our casters regen some mana.  We had discussed the idea of kiting, but stuff happens so quick in there, you really gotta target and attack quickly, and it was our first try so I think we did well.<br />
<br />
Added a warrior to tank, and after failing quickly on an unlucky spawn of multiple enchanters tashing and mezzing everyone, we finally succeeded.</div></div><hr />

Plane of Valor Exp is absolutely the best so far, but now that the exp word has gotten out, Plane of Valor will easily be the 100+ zone and contested mobs.<br />

Last time I heard, there was a 22 group line up for Trial of Execution.  Oh well, on to the next zone!</div></div><hr />

Had he not fallen thru the world - I'm confident we'd have won.  <br />

<br />
Warrior in meh guild did not have his Mavuin flag and couldnt get the flag off Tribunal for completed trial, he hadda run down to Mavuin then back up then back down before he was tagged for PoV/PoS.  so while yes you dont need the Mavuin flag you might as well get it before hand</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first waves of mobs are not that hard but you have to kill them fast. You need good dps. The main problem is that your leric, chanter will run fast oom. Some mobs also slow you. If that happens you will usually fail the trial. If you don't have a mage in your group try to get a rod at least. Could help alot. Endboss hits hard. Better have a warrior as tank.</div></div><hr />

Not all mobs are summoned but the rock guys are.  I got spell haste cast on me by a cleric, did not have any mage focus stuff sadly, but was able to output 200 -300 DPS on the rock guys with exile summoned.  I think 2 different clerics cast their haste spells on me because 1 reduced cast time to 2.5 seconds and the other to 2.8 seconds.</div></div><hr />

Gotta say, I really like these trials.  They're challenging, and fun.  Its all out, every group member working their a$$es off to get them beat, which makes it a rush for the 10-15 mins it takes to get through them.  Surprised to hear lashing is considered easy tho.  I haven't tried that one yet, but I've heard its rough from the people that have.  Heh, our cleric tonight straight rebelled when we said lets try lashing, so we did torture instead ;).<br />
<br />
Definitely lots of fun tho, try em if you haven't yet.  One thing tho, they are actually pretty level/gear dependant.  Tonight's group that I did torture/hanging/stoning with was me(65), monk(65), enc(65), wiz(65), clr(64), and dru(63).  We dominated hanging, but kept getting beat on stoning around wave 3 or 4, and just barely won torture.  All of us in VT/Ssra gear, so these things are no joke, heh.  Best bring your 'l33t skillz' if you wanna do any of them besides the gimp exe trial.  ;)</div></div><hr />
