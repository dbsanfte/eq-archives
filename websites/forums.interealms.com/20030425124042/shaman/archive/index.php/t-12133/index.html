<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While hunting in FV and killing the Froglok shamans I ended up getting two different kinds of Shaman Powder. One was white and the other black, and both were Lore and No Drop. Both dropped off of Froglok Nok Shamans. I know a black shaman powder is needed for the Canni II quest, but I've seen several references, both on these boards and elsewhere, that says that it must be a black shaman powder from Yun shamans in TT. However, I can't find any information on the differences between all these Shaman powders. Just how many are there? Will the black powder from FV work for the Canni II quest? Allakhazam lists a Shaman powder that identifies as Powder of Tsu, but I have no idea on how to &quot;identify&quot; something.<br />
<br />
BTW - I did find out that the Shaman powders I have are used in a Druid quest for a charm plant spell, which is a druid only spell. Go figure...</div></div><hr />

Hold the item on your pointer.  Have someone cast identify on you.  Wizards, Enchanters, Magicians, and Necromancers all get this spell.<br />
<br />
You'll get a text message saying what the item you're holding is identified as.</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
<br />
You can buy items that have the effect: identify as well.<br />
I have a Silvery Mask (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4761) for this purpose myself.  It comes in very handy every now and then, so much so I carry it everywhere I go. :)<br />
<br />
The click effect is useable from level 25 and up.  Rather decent low-mid level monk mask also even w/o the effect. ;)  There was a bug at one time where these were dropping incorrectly on simple mobs (I don't remember which or where) that caused a ton of them to come into the game, so they should still be available for purchase in the /bazaar if you keep an eye out.<br />
<br />
Here's a list of items with the effect:<br />

<br />
Much more satisfying to identify something yourself than have to beg from a robe wearer!<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

lol, destroy the no-drop powder. I'm a pack rat and when I finally got around to doing the cani II quest, I saw the black powder and assumed I had the right kind. Long story short, I had to start the quest over again...</div></div><hr />
