<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First run ever, doing it right now, up to Lucifron, I am pumping out massive, massive damage. although, got MC'd like 4 times and killed my groups warlock hehe.<br />
<br />
Fun stuff, tough, tough fights, and lucifron wiss boss I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I guess it depends on what mobs you are fighting.  Can pretty much go all out against the flame lords and surgers/annihilators, but the giants hurt bad.  Boss wise, not really sure since I've only been to Garr and Gehennas.  On Gehennas it was mostly team rogue and tank doing dps and Garr reminds me of the good old Emperor Ssra days.<br />
<br />
Grats on the McGowan mace too :P  Someone was selling it for 900g the other day.  Anyone on your server have an Ironfoe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can handle giants pretty well, the aoe stomp or whatever it is sucks but I am 4403 hps unbuffed with hp gear on, can take it.<br />
<br />
never seen an ironfoe ever, no one seems to want to run BRD, drops off head guy right?<br />
<br />
Lucifron stopped us, only 31 people in raid and very little mage power. Those 5 dogs were a pain in the ass. Fun stuff though, I enjoyed it. Don't usually raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep Ironfoe off of Emperor.  Funnest fight is probably Geddon...nothing like turning into a bomb and not realizing it and then blowing someone up hehe</div></div><hr />
