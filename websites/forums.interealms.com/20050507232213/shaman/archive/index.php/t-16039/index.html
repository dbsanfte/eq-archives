<br />
Recently I&#8217;ve been power-leveling a necro (34 now) using my 65 shaman.  Right now, I&#8217;m using EQW and it work real well.  Lag is not really a problem.  However, I just feel that a necro seems to need too much attention.  I switch constantly (thank god for alt-tab) between the two and its just seems like a burden now.  With my necro, I have to lich, sit, stand, dot, dot again, send pet in, back pet off..etc..etc.  I also have to be careful not to get too much aggro because of DOTs.  PLUS, I have to switch back to my shaman too, and canni, canni, canni, regen, buff, haste&#8230;.well, you get the idea.  Does this get any easier at higher levels?<br />
<br />
So&#8230;.I&#8217;ve considered starting an SK instead.  I&#8217;ve never played a melee and I don&#8217;t really know how much attention they need.  That&#8217;s what I need advice on.  The cons I see to playing an SK is: expensive gear (I&#8217;m poor so I can&#8217;t really twink it that well), DPS that isn&#8217;t as good as a necro (I&#8217;m assuming here, but honestly I&#8217;m not too sure), and starting from level 1 again (hate being a lowbie).<br />
<br />
So what do you all think?  Stick to my necro or move on and start an SK?</div></div><hr />
