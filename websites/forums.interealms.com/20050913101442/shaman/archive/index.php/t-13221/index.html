<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Belaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I decided to make a two box shaman, as I hate sitting around looking stupid doing nothing with my lfg tag hanging. I have leveled him to 21 in PC with some FD powerleveling.  My question is where is the next best place for the 20-40 range.  I want to get him grouped with me as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">High Hold Keep guards till 40.  Then nobles/bards if you can get them till 55.</div></div><hr />

<br />
up till 30 there isn't much better.<br />
<br />
mid 30s go to solb window room area.<br />
<br />
after 44? I am still trying to find the sweet spot..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did the mammoths in Everfrost up until 32 or so.  The XP is kind of slow, but the loot is great.  Went to DSP after that and thumped on zelniaks until 38 or so.  At 38-39 you can easily start taking down the DL glacier &amp; tundra yetis in the caves.  Static spawns, decent XP, and decent loot.  That took me to 49 real easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SolA Clockworks until lvl40, best and fastest exp in the game - bar none.<br />
<br />
(Went from lvl35-40 there in about 10 hours - no pl'ing, just me and dogdog).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">40-51 in Echo Caverns is excellent exp if you can get a camp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">FD pl in GD at tizmak caves  till around 30 - take some hits and work on defensive at this time.  Next look at Stonebrunt/DSP - you will want to solo a bit for defensive.  Once you can group you've got a couple of good options - KC is actually very nice  duo - you can slow the dogs from about 44 on and xp files for the shammy in LC/RC/Zone (I did corners as you can protect the Shammy on bad pulls trains mostly).  Once your shammy is 51 and has the better heal you can really do some nice stuff.  I did chardok zone in/out at 49/55 shammy monk, but this was pre-stoicism and was painfull on healing tho i could kill quite well.  Echo near deep end is fantastic 44-50 - have to have the monk pull till about 48 but I could ding every couple of hours at till about 48 in there solo.  <br />
<br />
I didn't work hard at it and screwed around for the first 6 levels plus pled other chars till level 16 or so but I did 1-50 in less than 12days played.  My wiz took 75 days played or so till 50. He's 58 now with not quite 100 days played so this was a nice change :)  <br />
<br />
I find LoY to be nice experiance and cash now that they are closer in range and I don't want to spend time LFG for planes groups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Belaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thank you for the very informative and helpful posts, I'll be pestering you all with my semi new questions alot from now on :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can find the answers to many of the where should I level questions... in the Hunting Grounds forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PC to 25 or even 26 exp is so good there.  Then for future benefit i would encourage killing those mosquitos in echo for 1 or 2 lvls between 25 and 27 to get defense up if you havent got hit much.  They hit fast but soft, perfect for skilling up defense.</div></div><hr />
