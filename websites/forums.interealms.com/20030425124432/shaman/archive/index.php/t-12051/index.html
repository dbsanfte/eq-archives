In reading other news stories about the goings on in France, I think more than a few French are beginning to get embarrassed about the behavior by many of those anti-war demonstrators.  Plus, I think many are also beginning to see that Chirac doesn't give a hoot about preventing war, and that his stance on the war was a straight up attempt to grab power in the internation arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With all due respect, a handful of French people vandalised that memorial.<br />
<br />
Your logic would, by a simmilar parallel be like saying &quot;Wow, White American Christians blow up government buildings&quot; because of Timothy Mc Veigh, or saying &quot;American soldiers murder babies&quot; because of the actions of a infinitesimaly tiny minority of soldiers during Vietnam.<br />
<br />
Some French support the war, some don't. Very very few people would deface such a monument, regardless of their beliefs on the war. you do yourself a disservice by making such sweeping generalisations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is fact that the vast magority of frenchmen disagree with the war, and dislike americans.<br />
<br />

Fact, france hates the US, but for a very few people who remember what we did for them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Calling something a fact does not make it a fact Millman. Perhaps a majority of frenchmen do disagree with the war, whether vast or not, it is not illegal or even cowardly to not support this war.<br />
<br />
It is sad and pathetic that US citizens should get harrassed by idiots in France. But it is also sad and pathetic that US citizens should get harassed and spat on by US citizens, in the USA, because of their religion.....<br />
<br />
Please quote your sources for these facts (sic) that france hates the USA and that few people remember what The Allies did for them. I am sure some, maybe many french people have no love for americans, but when was that a crime? I would, however, be suprised if any fail to remember that The Allies helped them out in WWII. Many french men and women fought very bravely and died during WWII...something that you appear to choose to forget</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't all of our countries have a pretty sizeable number of anti-war demonstrators?<br />
<br />
Its sad: I know that war is a very terrible thing, but so is Saddam Hussein's regime.  I am intelligent enough to realise that if I did all I could to stop this war then I would be helping to keep that regime in power: I'd be lending support to a dictatorship that has murdered thousands of its citizens directly, and has launched unprovoked attacks on two of its neighbours, leading to the deaths of many many more.<br />
<br />
So I'd have to be very confident in my knowledge of the situation to take a stance.  In fact theres no way I could have that sort of knowledge living in the comfort and security of the UK.<br />
<br />
So what are these peace protestors really doing?  Well there's such a thing as being 'Good by Proxy'.  You take a superficially moral stance on something, secure in the knowledge that you yourself don't have to suffer the impact of the position you are taking: someone else has to do that.  Its a bit like people who say they are 'green': they don't want a motorway built, but they use their car to drive to the demonstration.  Or they 'believe' in wind and solar energy but use a tumble drier rather than hang their clothes out to dry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No, the vast majority of Americans support the war, and support our president, we simply aren't loud and foul mouthed like the hippies are.

<br />
Weyalan ,<br />
<br />
I am not going to dig up polls, but it is a fact, that most frenchmen do not like the USA, how can you deny this? Hell up untill recently, most british did not like the USA either.<br />
<br />
Alot of weirdness in the world lately, but USA still is doing the right thing, France is a supporter of Saddam, they don't want to lose money, and they actively want to embarass/impede the US, that, is what an enemy does, not a friend.<br />
<br />
Weyalan,<br />
<br />
 Do not forget, who shouldered the brunt of the costs, manpower, machines of WW2 and the Normandy invasion in particular. Yes it was Allies working together, but saying that the US kicked ass for France is 100% true, British and to a lesser extent Canada helped as well, but it is a fair statement to say US helped France.<br />
<br />
We lost what, 80,000 airmen alone in our very dangerous, very effective daylight bombing of Germany? How many did France lose? Britian?(nighttime bombing only) Do not try and downplay the US and it's contributions, but for us, the war would have been lost. Battle of Britain, contrary to popular belief, did not by itself save England, the Luftwaffe still was mighty powerful, the RAF very much not, Hitler would have taken England, then would have been in a much better position to deal with the soviets.<br />
<br />
As far as brave Frenchmen, I have never heard of one since Napaloen. They don't call them surrender monkeys for nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Denying us flyover rights during the Lybia thing, costing us the lives of US pilots in the 80's, trying to give Saddam nuclear weapons, trying to sabotage our coalition now, that, makes them enemies, not friends.<br />
<br />
Sad thing is, we have been nothing but helpful to those ungratefull pricks.<br />

Notice you cannot argue with any logical point, go figure. Go ahead, launch some cows at me from your stolen castle in England.<br />

Or do you perhaps have a point besides being snotty? or are you simply jumping on the anti-american bandwagon? You like torturing children and raping women do you? Thats what France supports.<br />

<br />
<br />
sit down mill, time for a history lesson:<br />
<br />
<br />
80000 airmen? where did you get this &quot;fact&quot;? england lost 915 planes during the battle of britain, which lasted from august 25th 1940, to september 15th 1940, in this time they shot down 1733 german planes.<br />
<br />
then about a year later, in december 1941 the japanese attacked pearl harbor, and the us declared war on germany(they had to since germany was an official ally of japan)<br />
<br />
now i couldn't find the exact number of us planes lost after they officially entered the war on the ally side in 1941, but i can assure you it was a lot less than, let's assume it's bombers with an 8 man crew, 8000 planes. since the german airforce was severly weakened at this time, and hitler was busy trying to invade russia, on a sidenote: 750000 russian soldiers were killed alone in the battle of stalingrad, and 400000 german soldiers.<br />
<br />
<br />
while i'm at the number crunching, did you know there was reported 100000 incidents of rape in berlin after the invasion in 1945?<br />
<br />
5000 american soldiers where killed in the kamikaze bombings, 124000 japanese civilans where killed when the us bombed tokyo, and another 135000 when the brits did the same to dresden.<br />
<br />
16,112,566 Americans served.<br />
291,557 Americans died in battle.<br />
671,846 Americans wounded.<br />
<br />
let's list the actual losses for a string of nations shall we?<br />
<br />
German loss of 6.5 million<br />
Poland 5 (or 6) millio<br />
Japan 2.36 million<br />
Yugoslavia 1.7 million<br />
France 600,000<br />
Italy 500,000<br />
Romania 500,000<br />
Greece 450,000<br />
Hungary 430,000<br />
Great Britain 350,000<br />
Czechoslovakia 340,000<br />
Austria 374,000<br />
USA 300,000<br />
Holland 210,000<br />
Finland 100,000<br />
Belgium 88,000<br />
 and Canada 42,000<br />
Byelorussia lost 2,198,000 civilians<br />
The Russian SFSR, or Russia, lost 1,781,000 civilians and about 3 to 4 million military or about 5 to 6 million total according to Kosyk.<br />
<br />
<br />
sources: http://www.infoukes.com/history/ww2/page-18.html and http://www.unverse.com/WW2.html mainly.<br />
<br />
you asked &quot;how many did france lose&quot;? 600000! you asked &quot;how many did england lose&quot;? 350000! i ask &quot;how many did the us lose&quot;? 300000....still a huge, tragic number i'm by no means saying the us didn't help win the war here.<br />
<br />
BUT STOP BASHING EVERYONE ELSE BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Rasmus,<br />
<br />
<br />
this is just a paragraph about the army air force casualties in WW2, not counting Navy as well.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WITH GREAT DETERMINATION THIS FORCE WOULD GROW TO A PEAK WARTIME STRENGTH OF 75,OOO AIRCRAFT AND 2,411,294 OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN. DURING THE PERIOD OF JULY 1, 1940 THROUGH AUGUST 31,1945 THE A.A.F. WOULD ACCEPT A TOTAL OF 229,554 AIRCRAFT AND SUFFER CASUALTIES AMOUNTING TO 115,382, OF WHICH 52,173 DIED.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that is accurate, as all the in depth shows I have seen about the US aircraft and crews puts figures around there, I have heard 80,000 as a number factoring all the armed services flyers.<br />
<br />
france losing 600,000 seems about right, how many were civilians though? Rememebr this war was fought on non-US soil, so we didn't have civilian casualties, all of ours were combat deaths.<br />
<br />
I love how people cry nowadays when 10-50, or even 1000 civies die in a war, when we decimated entire populations and cities in WW2.<br />
<br />
What does raping in berlin have to do with this? I am assuming it was the russians, don't think Americans would stand for that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Russia lost a hell of alot more then 5 to 6 million, a conservative estimate is 20 million, when you factor in Stalin's brutal murders as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, time for a history lesson, sit down as you would say.<br />
<br />
Normandy battle casualties, can post sources if need, but generally numbers from german, americans sources from june 6th to september 44.<br />
<br />
germans, 30k dead, 80k wounded, 210k missing<br />
US 26k dead, 106,000 wounded or missing<br />
GB 11k killed, 54k wounded or missing<br />
FRANCE 12,202 civilians dead or missing<br />
Canada 5k dead, 13,000 wounded or missing.<br />
<br />
<br />
From those numbers alone, who shouldered the brunt of the invasion and liberation of France? That is what I was talking about, dunno why you list others deaths as a point.<br />
<br />
<br />
mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rasmus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the numbers are not counting civilians.<br />
<br />
and i just listed all the other for comparison, to help you get over the image that you singlehandedly won the war &quot;for the europeans&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Rasmus,<br />
<br />
 We did not single handedly win the war, but without us, the war had no hope of being won, where as without our allies, it would have taken more time and losses, but we could have done it.<br />
<br />
Why? Production, production, production, training, training, training. We, in a safe country with massive resources, out produced everyone big time, and our front line pilots and soldiers were often rotated back to the states to train others.<br />
<br />
Without the US, GB would have fell fairly quickly, the RAF was holding on the British airpspace by the hairs on their chinny chin chin, and only because Hitler was going after British cities, the RAF was close to destruction when he decided to chill for a while.<br />
<br />
I really do respect the Brits, make no mistake, they kicked ass, they were simply outmatched by the Germans.<br />
<br />
 Daylight bombing is what broke the Germans back, yes, the RAF bomber command bombed, but at night only, and was less accurate and not as much pounding, and they didnt attrit the  Luftwaffe by making them commit to the bombers. American flyers paid a very heavy price too.<br />
<br />
Just some of our losses by aircraft types:<br />
<br />
Aircraft Type<br />
 Number Lost<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
B-17<br />
 4,754<br />
 <br />
B-24<br />
 2,112<br />
 <br />
P-47<br />
 1,043<br />
 <br />
P-38<br />
 451<br />
 <br />
P-51<br />
 2,201<br />
 <br />
Total<br />
 10,561<br />
<br />
Now this does not include any of the other type medium aircraft and light aircraft (B-25, B-26, etc), the 11th tactical Air Force losses and other commands.<br />
<br />
SO, what I am saying, is that we did not win the war by ourselves, although we could have, but europe would not be there as we know it without us, it would be one big german territory.<br />
<br />
<br />
Germans were frighteningly ahead of the world in technology, if their industry was left unmolested, it was goodbye to the Russians, regardless of what they threw at them.<br />
<br />
As an example, there is a documented case of a German Tiger tank in a battle vs russians, taking 227 hits from tanks and anti-tank guns, and still going 30 miles more. T-34 was a great tank, but was still otumatched severely by the tiger. But, too litle, too late. Shermans of ours were even worse, we fire point blank on a  Tiger, it bounces off, as one of our tank commanders put it, &quot;and then he fired at us, and it did not bounce off, it went through the front, between by legs, and blew up in the engine compartment, blowing me out of the tank&quot;<br />
<br />
ME-262 if given time and was able to be produced in number, with the resources to keep it flying, would have cemented air superiority, easily. They should have made ME-262's and FW-190 D-9's exclusively, could have thumped anyone with them, but bombing kept production and supply low, as well as trained pilots dying to superior numbers.<br />
