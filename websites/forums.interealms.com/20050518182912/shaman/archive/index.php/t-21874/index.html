<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many people have been banned from SoE offical boards recently for pointing out the truths we all know about shaman?<br />
<br />
I've had two aco****s banned in 24 hours and none of my posts were &quot;personal attacks&quot;, used bad lanauage, or anything else illegal as indicated by SoE....<br />
<br />
this proves to me once and for all, &quot;they&quot; don't care....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol whats wrong with accounts? a c c o u n t s</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">by the look of it Oukast, in your first post you misspelled accounts by getting the second c and the first o the wrong way around. I am not surprised that the filter blocked the result. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i have had my account banned.<br />
<br />
my brothers account has been banned.<br />
<br />
so have at least 15 or so of my friends, we are chatting it up on aim, playing yahoo games and stuff, wondering when this crap will be fixed, but, im hoping, blizzard is seeing this, because, seriously they need to know, Sony is no longer anything of a threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
/chers for blizzard</div></div><hr />

<br />
nope just checked i was banned:) woot! it a crap board anyway. they just cant handle the fact that alot of shaman dont like them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wow. Are they slapping accounts, too? Is this their version of &quot;You can't quit, you're fired!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
funny thing is, when they ban your account, you wave the right to any monetary holdings put into EQ. (i heard once they ban you, an employee can change the characters name and play it, heard this back in 2002 just after a guid threatened some kid with soul marks)<br />
****, same thing when you cancel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">opps , hehe i doidnt mean they banned me from game, only from posting on they silly smoke screen board.<br />
<br />
they can only ban you in game if they catch you breaking ingame rules, like exploits.<br />
<br />
i belive that for about 6 months the chars are still yours after you canx, but if banned then they not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">just bumping this cos, is it me or are they getting more trigger happy deleting post? and is any more poeple banned?<br />
