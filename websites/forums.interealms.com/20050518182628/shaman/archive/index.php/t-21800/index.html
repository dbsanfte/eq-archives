<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My shammy is lvl 52, and her Alchemy skill is maxxed according to her lvl.  I tend to dual box with my 53 monk when I go places.  Where do I go for the fastest lvling?  Currently they are in Dulak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At level 51/52 range, I'd say either hunt in tier 1 POP zones if you can get a group, or if you just want to duel comp, go to Kunark dungeons or Velious to work on faction and xp at the same time.<br />
<br />
My 52 bard is currently rocking Natimbi for xp, but I'm doing charm tricks.  Since you have slow, you can probably suvive there.  The mobs have fairly high dps, but have low hps compared to some other zones.<br />
<br />
If you can, look into doing LDON.  I've never done ldon with anything but my level 61+ characters, but I hear my guildmates raving about doing ldon for xp with their sup 50 characters.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about that LDON thing.  LDON exp was nerfed pretty hard, and experience is crummy.<br />
<br />
You could *probably* duo in PoJ or something.  I wouldn't lean on LDON too hard though, exp is pretty bad.</div></div><hr />

Do you know what the exp bonus % is, or do they have any record of the patch that nerf the exp of LDON?</div></div><hr />
