<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ineluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am really amazed .. soemhow it looks as if verant FINALLY removed the DD components on DoTs on test.<br />
atm they are removed for the pop poison and desease DoT... this will mean only 2 resist checks instead of the 3 we had before .. LEss resists on our DoTs is something i have waited for so long.<br />
<br />
I hope you all understand how much of a change that will be .. we will actually be able to make DMG on raids.. in PvP and in our normal or in special solo situations... <br />
<br />
i am goin to kill myself btw if they change it back to where it was</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ineluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">btw i got this from lucy as i was just reading the new spell dat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No one has (to my knowledge) ever proved that shaman DoTs have 2 or more resists checks.<br />
<br />
&quot;2 resists checks instead of the 3 we had before&quot; - what are you basing this on? My personal suspicion is that the reason shaman DoTs are resisted more is that our DoTs don't have a built in resist modifier like some other classes' do.<br />
<br />
I think the main benefit we will see from losing the DD portion is that DoTs won't break root as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ineluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well... maybe you should talk to one of the devs one day and let them tell you what exactl is up and how resists are calculated....<br />
<br />
+ look at the raw spelldat that might enlighten you too...<br />
<br />
and .. compare the raw spelldat to the resists oyu experience with diffferent classes on different mobs<br />
<br />
your smartass comment makes me cry .... damn you are 58 and didnt figure that out yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Take it easy Ineluk, Grippa wasn't flaming you from what I can tell.  Don't get so defensive just because someone is challenging your comments.  Sheesh!<br />
<br />
Speak without offending......listen without defending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Exactly.<br />
<br />
I haven't spoken to any EQ devs and I've never seen a post by anyone who has, that explains exactly how DoT resists are calculated. If you have this information, straight from the horses mouth as it were, please post it.<br />
<br />
People quote the supposed &quot;2 resist checks&quot; for out DoTs a lot - I was just saying I have never seen any proof that this is correct.<br />
<br />
If you look at the spell data on Lucy for a couple of DoT I chose at random:<br />
<br />
Bane of Nife: Has initial DD of 150, adds 10 poison counters, NO resist adjust.<br />
Winged Death: No inital DD, no counters, resist adjust -100<br />
<br />
Now say we observe that Winged Death is resisted a lot less than Bane of Nife. Why does everyone jump to the assumption that it's because of the initiall DD, when there's a massive -100 resist modifier to the druid DoT? It could be a combination of many factors, possibly including the fact that what people observe in EQ often is just a run of bad luck with the RNG.<br />
<br />
And remember that some spells' data is altered in the code, so the values on Lucy are not guaranteed to be correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Because, for a week after the resist revamp, the druids' DOTs did not have that -100 resist adjustment. The druid cried bloody murder, as usual, and Verant kneejerk'd the adjustment RIGHT in with the speed and alacrity deserved by the class played by more than 15% of their player base.<br />
<br />
And you know what? even without that adjustment, their DOTs STILL were not resisted nearly as much as ours.<br />
<br />
And remember that some spells' data is altered in the code, so the values on Lucy are not guaranteed to be correct.<br />
<br />
And remember, this is an argument that works both way :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My dots are very rarely resisted.  I'm not trying to be obtuse, I've just never observed this problem with dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Originally posted by Cragael <br />
And remember, this is an argument that works both way :) <br />
<br />
Indeed - my main point was meant to be that we don't have any hard evidence one way or the other about DoT resistability. If you check the thread in the main forum about this, some people think the DD porion matters, some people think it doesn't.<br />
<br />
But I think we can say for CERTAIN that a DoT without a DD portion will break root less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Grippa... did you jump to the quote directly and forgot to read the lines before it? Let me repeat:<br />
<br />
And you know what? even without that adjustment, their DOTs STILL were not resisted nearly as much as ours.<br />
<br />
The problem with our DOT is that a partial resist on the DD component means the whole spells bounce. It's nothing new, it's not even unique... druid roots had the same problem, cleric stuns had the same problem. Both got fixed.<br />
<br />
We're not talking about DOT bouncing off resistant or immune MOBs there. We're talking about DOT bouncing from thoroughly resist-debuffed MOBs who didn't start with any special resists of their own. You can see it a lot on 55+ MOBs, but even on low blues the resists are there.<br />
<br />
And yes, they could fix it by removing the DD components and upgrade the damage/tick slightly to compensate. Would be lovely for those root-DOT time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ineluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hehe well i am not denying that i like to discuss hard =) <br />
<br />
take it easy ... but i love when people have a clue or get some info before they omment or deny stuff<br />
<br />
The DD component has a partial resist and it IS an issue because our DoTs get resisted too much .... not in PvE i know i stick my DoTs on exp mobs np....  BUT i am on sullon and i play PvP and everyone with 170 desease or poison resist after buffs is immune to me 100 %<br />
even after malo or ID<br />
this IS an issue to all the PvP shm in the highend game ( thats about 40 peoplee in whole eq i think ) <br />
<br />
And as alread stated.. if you would read more of the dev letters through the year you might have found out how resists are calculated</div></div><hr />

My dots are very rarely resisted.  I'm not trying to be obtuse, I've just never observed this problem with dots. <br />
<br />
as a oracle you honetly dont see this resist issue ?<br />
<br />
well , i dunno , i can say thi smuch , iuts a big enough issue that i m getting to the point where im casting them less and less caus eim so used to it. maybe Malo helps or something , but unless its a simple XP grind group , they get MAD resisted :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I cast mine all the time.  Usually just Bane, but often it's Bane, Pox and EB.  I get occassional resists, but nothing too serious.  I use Malo sometimes, but not often.  I don't even mem root anymore, I'm not too concerned about them breaking root either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">BUT i am on sullon and i play PvP<br />
<br />
This explains your rude-ass comments towards Grippa.<br />
<br />
Have yet to see or hear anything or anyone  good come from SZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I triple dot alot, on uber mobs and when soloing lvl 50+ mobs, and honestly I haven't experienced much in the way of resists unless the mob is immune. And I only debuff the resists on the uber mobs.<br />
<br />
The thing I'd really like to see is our dots create less agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">just my 2cp on resist rates. I don't have malo so that's not an option, malosini on 30% or less mobs on average and most the mobs in CT resist sini ALOT. moktors and gargantuans are the only mobs in umbral I can land dots on. the grey has a similiar situation. I can't solo there because most the mobs seem to be immune to poison and disease. <br />
<br />
OT abit I can't do alot of dotting on raids or exp groups anyhow because of the rediculous agro rates of the fast acting dot... bane of nife.</div></div><hr />
