<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings.  For the past 3 years or so, I've had the tremendous pleasure of traveling the world of Norrath as a monk.  Recently, however, I've felt the need for a change.  I've always greatly admired the skills of the Shaman, and thought I'd try one.  I come to this bastion of Shamanic knowledge asking my Elders for their advice.<br />
<br />
Since the release of Kunark, I've been an Iksar monk.  I decided this time around that I did not care to be attacked the minute I walked into every town, so I chose the Barbarian.  I put 25pts in WIS (giving me a 105, I believe), and the rest in STA.  I know many suggest putting the last 5 points into CHA, but there is much CHA gear to be had, and in my experience I've found little STA gear.  Granted, this could just be little MONK stamina gear, but I digress.  I have made level 10 so far, staying close to my home of Halas, venturing ever so slowly in the direction of Permafrost.  Any advice as to where to hunt, what spells to avoid/pursue, spell combination tricks, etc. would be greatly appreciated.  I find that I am becoming less and less able to take even con mobs, and even some of the blue con mobs give me trouble.  Of course, I do get over anxious and attack things at less than full mana, so much of it is my fault, but still.  ;) <br />
<br />
Again, thank you in advance for any help.<br />

EDIT--I apologize for posting this in the Quests &amp; Special Items section.  I didn't realize I hadn't moved back to General.  Please move this post to the appropriate forum.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's nothing wrong with how you distributed your starting points: Charisma would have been wasted. Some people might argue for putting more points into Stamina, and less into Wisdom, but it really doesn't make much difference.<br />

At your level, there really aren't any great tricks or tactics for the Shaman. Until around Level 24 (Cannibalize, Regeneration, and big poison DoT upgrade), or even more so Level 34 (pet), it can often be frustrating to solo, unless you have good equipment, as the class plays sort of like a weak hybrid. Obviously, SoW is the best spell you currently have, and Tainted Breath is a decent DoT at Level 10. One often overlooked spell is Inner Fire: not only does it buff but it can also be used as a heal, with a better mana/health ratio than even our Level 19 healing spell. Outside of fights, cast it between ticks (if you're fast, it can be squeezed in) to heal. Drowsy helps against tough MOBs. Stat buffs aren't too helpful at your level, and probably a waste of mana except for possibly Dexterity (raising weapon skills).</div></div><hr />
