<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I usually partner w/ a friend of mine over on Rodcet Nife(warrior) and sometimes when he is not on I like to solo.<br />
<br />
Anywho, at lvl 32 I found tizmak's fun but I wanted more of a challenge so I decided to go after Kodiak's near the Kodiak Caves.<br />
After soloing a con yellow kodiak(once mal lands you can throw everything at em and it will stick 99 percent of the time) I knew I was able to solo these for some nice exp.   Just start w/ mal, then rootit.  Once rooted I toss on walking sleep, Envenomed Breath and affliction(they have a nice amount of life ^.^)<br />
<br />
My only prob I always seem to get adds about half way into the battle.  Is there place to solo pull them w/o fear of adds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I love those bears. :)<br />
<br />
If you're hunting what we call Kodiak3 (the one right below the Velks entrance... and yes I know only 2 of the caves really have kodiaks in em, but it's still Kodiak3 :p) you can pull the mob to an area a little over to the right of the cave entrance.  That will minimize, but not completely eliminate, adds.  Very few bears path over there.  You might get an add every, oh 20 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
I duo'd those with my warrior friend up to around level 40.  Great exp. :) I've gone back with all my alts so far.  Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Great info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">kodiaks are charmable too .. <br />
if the tanks not around, try the lvl 34 charm (or what ever the high lvl one is ) <br />
really not sure how effect charm is for your level .. <br />
<br />
might not work .. might have to zone it .. but velks zone line is close</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>greatmilenko_00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hunted in the kodiak caves, and i noticed that u can charm bloodmaw, who is perma rooted and pull stuff to him. Hes got ALOT of hps  but dosent hit as often as the other kodiaks. Its fun and easy exp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the tips :)<br />
<br />
Ill try that &quot;kodiak3&quot; trick later heh.</div></div><hr />
