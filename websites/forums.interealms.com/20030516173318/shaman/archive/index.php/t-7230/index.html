<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Obadia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">getting ready to start on epic and trying to research.it says i need to go to nfreeport for the drunken shaman part,then to jade dragon.<br />
 well i can tell you,i dont think the pallys will appreciate my stomping around on their turf.how do i get around this? won't everyone in the building be trying to rip the ogre flesh from my bones? :eek: i could try and get lucky and make it there invis,but i have to appear at some point to start the yakkin.i scouted tunnels but they only appear to go to west and east freeport.<br />
           thanks!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did it invis, got there fine. Might want to scout with an alt first to make sure you know the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, escorted Iksar friend there.  Nothing KOS when you talk to the shaman in the tunnel.  <br />
<br />
Also nothing KOS on the top floor of the inn.<br />
<br />
Caveat:  Don't do what my friend did the 1st time-forget to re-invis as she followed Bondl.  I got her just as she was trudging into daylight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I also got to the Jade Tiger invis, prior to fixing my faction in NFP. Just tell Bondl the second line (You can buy booze?) and run for the Inn. Remember to invis. Once there, you're far enough away from the pally's that they don't aggro you, and nothing is aggro up there on the third floor.  <br />
<br />
I managed to complete the entire text of the doggie dialogue before Bondl showed up to introduce me. <br />
<br />
Then gate out. Have fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just check out the route with an alternate then do it invis, you'll be fine.<br />
