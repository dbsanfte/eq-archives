<br />
But..<br />
<br />
I was looking over the shoulder of a friend of mine's necro spells.<br />
<br />
I came back to my spells, read them all again, and still only 3 spells are on my list to get.<br />
<br />
#1  Pet<br />
#2  Disease Slow 40%<br />
#3  New Dot<br />
<br />
However, I must admit that our spells, really do suck in the expansion.  Seems like Verant noticed all the &quot;<br />

Gah, I hate posting a whine, but to be honest, I am not sure I really care about dinging 62, I still don't have my pet, its never sold in bazaar, I still dont have my 60 spells malo or torpor.<br />
<br />
Its getting to be a bit much...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nruter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On Quellious the spells were all in the bazaar last night.<br />
<br />
Pet--2 copies listed one at 30k one at 32k<br />
Grimmus--7 copies from 7 to 12k, most 10k+<br />
DoT--one copy 65k and disappeared within 10 minutes of my seeing it (sold or whatnot)<br />
<br />
Tons of Agility out there as well, other then to fill a spell book why would people even be tempted to pay over 10k for this spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well yes and no.<br />
The fact they gave us a bunch of stat spells, that excluding stamina, will very very rarely be cast if ever is rough justice.<br />
<br />
But, the pet, 1k heal, regen, improved malo, torpor, rain, dots and nukes are pretty decent upgrades i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think that the new spells are of moderate value.  Obviously, some are most useful than others.<br />
<br />
Stat-Buffs = Whatever.  If I get a group version, I'll cast it, otherwise people will be fine with my current group version.<br />
<br />
Group Buffs w/ Shorter Duration = Whatever.  If I need the buff for a raid and the duration isnt unacceptably short, I'll cast it.  If I need it for a group and its ongoing, I'll cast the previous verison.<br />
<br />
DogDog = The Rock.<br />
<br />
1K Heal = Life Saving HP in an emergency; if I am about to die, I hardly care if the mana cost is high (unless I am low on mana, in which case things are not looking too good).<br />
<br />
Imrpoved Malo = Something I have a chance of getting, unlike the VERY elusive Malo that I have spent months hunting Guardian Wurms for.  That can't be a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Improved Torpor = Nice.  Probably ultra hard to get, but I'll worry about that when I hit 64 or 65.  As it is now, I am pleased that they included it.<br />
<br />
Improved Nukes = Something to do when I am on a raid where the mobs die quickly.  They may not be a great help, but if I can drop 3k of damage on a mob in 30 seconds, thats not bad.  I doubt anyone will complain, anyway.<br />
<br />
Improved DoTs = Great.  Extremely great.  I want them.  I would much rather stack 3 dots instead of two dots.  <br />
<br />
I'm a little annoyed about the focus 3 items being outmoded by focus 4 items, but i heard that pottery skill can be used to make focus 4 items and thats not too bad at all.  We'll have to wait and see on that one.<br />
<br />
In general, I'd say that our spells are ok.  We didn't get rewarded with uber-spells like some classes, but we didn't get the shaft either.  Of the bunch, the only ones that strike me as useless are the single target stat buffs.  For an extra 5 agi, I'm not going to go through the hassle of single targeting 45 people.<br />
<br />
Edit:  My Spelling = The Suck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My only real beef is with the Torpor upgrade. As far as I'm concerned it should be 500 a tick like Supernal Elixir (thus putting it the same as torpor VS ce), and keep the downsides.<br />
But the fact is I'm not terribly likely to be seeing any 65 spells for quite a while, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Syrellian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well,<br />
<br />
I must admit, that upon first reading the stats on many of our new spells, I was a bit disappointed.  I know that many people have already stated they will hardly cast certain spells.  I'm sure that there are very creative Shamans out there who will find a use for just about every new spell there is.  Now, I have yet to get many of the new spells, but am hoping I will find a use for them when I do receive them.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The thing that really bothers me the most is the reduced durations. It isn't just us, LOTS of classes have similar &quot;upgrades&quot;.<br />
<br />
It is like VI thinks buffing is fun. What is wrong with them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">New pet is fantastic.  New nukes are great.  new malosini and upgraded insidious decay have their uses.  Cloud of Grummus is great if your guild still does ToV or emperor/seru.  new regen is VERY nice.  focus of soul is still 115hps or so, every melee in my guild is asking for it on raids now.  more sta is more sta, but the rest of the stat buffs are kinda worthless.  All of our level 65 spells are amazing.<br />
<br />
I think the only problem with our spells is accessibility.  I don't think I should have to be in a tier 3 zone to get my 63/64 spells, or killing the bosses in such zones for 65 spells.  I don't know when VI decided not everyone should be able to get their spells, but it's VERY annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samsonn Thunderfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I at least wish I could get some of the spelld. Out of 7 parchment drops I have 2 spells. I had 4 Dupes of Tallisman of the Tribunal and one dupe of Spear or Torment.<br />
<br />
As for the new pet spell, I saw it for sale in Bazaar on The Rathe for 40K this past weekend. Malo selling for 50K, Petrifying Earth is going for 10K.<br />
<br />
Geez I hate like hell the people who price gouge others in this game and the damn greedy clerics who master loot and never distribute any vendor loot. So basically you hunt for exp only unless you get lucky and get a parchment drop. With 6 people in a group it is not likely you will even get a parchment drop.<br />
<br />
It is sad to see myself and I'm  sure others level 65 Shammies with basically no PoP spells in their spellbooks. SONY SUCKS and so does their idea on so called random spell awards.<br />
<br />
So, no loot, no spells, what is the use of even playing this suck ass game?<br />
<br />
I seriously we shammies need to flood SONY with hate feedback and e-mails to get this dupe problem corrected or at least some spells for all classes to be places on vendors. I send the hate feedback daily. More of us need to do this. They say the squeaky wheel always gets the oil.<br />

Gah, I hate posting a whine, but to be honest, I am not sure I really care about dinging 62, I still don't have my pet, its never sold in bazaar, I still dont have my 60 spells malo or torpor.<br />
<br />
Its getting to be a bit much... <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok so you don't think that the New Sta, New focus, new Malos, New Sinia, New FA, New DR debuff, New DD's or the new heals are worth it to get?<br />
<br />
Personally the only things that bug me about our spells is :<br />
*Problem* - Useless Agi, Useless Dex, Useless Str, Gratz that is 6 wasted spells.<br />
*Solution* - Take all these away and give us and upgrade to CHA.  (only use for this upgrade is DI for cleric/warrior, but would still be USED)<br />
*Problem* - Focus and Sta Duration too short. <br />
*Solution*- Make them same as Last set<br />
*Problem* - Quiescence is Exactly same heal with out snare and slow. (Catch Slow for casters no biggy, on horse there is no snare.)<br />
*Solution* - Give Quiescence 2 extra ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well to be honest, no I dont think the new spells are worth it, save the 3 I posted.<br />
<br />
By worth it I mean, which of all these spells would you actually buy in bazaar?<br />
<br />
This started due to seeing the new necro spells, so I suppose it isnt a fair comparison, but if you have the time check them out, I think you will see where I am coming from.<br />
<br />
IE<br />
<br />
61 necro spells<br />
New Dot - 2480 dmg<br />
New DD - 1260 dmg<br />
New Lifetap - 850dmg/heal self (this takes 850hp from mob and gives back to necro)<br />
New Pet - Level 60 pet<br />
<br />
Just right there in level 61 they have an upgrade to every major line in thier spell book.<br />
<br />
I dont get a new dot till 64 !!  My 61 DD is 675 the same as my 54 DD spell !!<br />
<br />
in 62 I get ONE spell worthwhile, Tnargs Mending, which is a secondary line of spells for us in the healing category.  I get a single target upgrade to FOS that none of my EE3 items will work on.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile necro gets ANOTHER dot at 62 doing 1910 dmg.<br />
<br />
The list is very long of course, my complaint here was that it just didnt seem proportional at all.  I hate whining posts, so I will stop, I just get the feeling that all those Shaman can solo this and that posts got us sucking hind tit this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, I think our PoP spell line up is derivative and unimaginative.  What really bums me out is the pathetic 7 additional agility and laughable 10 additional stamina for the group agility/stamina spells.  They've raised the caps of agi/sta via level and AA ability and we're still stuck with a lousy 10 point increase for a ton more mana and shorter duration?<br />
<br />
I'm currently 62 and I'm really dreading spell acquisition through level 65.  I already went through the hell of getting Torpor and Malo once, I'm not looking forward to the nightmare of having to roll against every caster in the guild for 65 parchments (or runes or whatever) for Malos and Quiescence.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, they significantly nerfed the drops of spectral parchements in a Tier 3 zone like HoH.  That's completely ludicrous for me.  Why should a 62/63 player not be able to get their spells in a TIER THREE zone?<br />
<br />
The whole PoP spell thing just pisses me off, the line up is disappointing and the implementation is worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm still trying to aquire Cloud of Grummus.<br />
<br />
I'm missing some 62 spells but it's not a biggie yet as I won't go to 62 till I'm flagged for PoV/Storms... too much goes green old world for me to do that.<br />
<br />
The new pet is wonderful. Spear of Torment... well... okkkkayyyy... I would rather have a bigger nuke. It's the same nuke as we got in our 50's courtesy of PoP, only with a little less mana cost.<br />
<br />
I do cast Agility of the Wrulan, but it's nothing to write home about. Five copies for sale atm on Rodcet. <br />
<br />
Replenishment - nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.  Reasonable proposals that should be recognized and implemented by the devs.  Anybody have a connection?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Single Target STR and DEX for Spectral Parchments, but you get Single Target Focus of Souls for Ethereal???  Um... Yeah.<br />
<br />
IMO, the Single Target stat buffs should be vendor sold.  They're basically useless anyway.  The only person that the STA buff is really going to add a significant amount of HP to is an MT who quite possibly already has enough STA that 50 maxes them anyway.  <br />
<br />
Group Stat buffs I don't have a problem being turn in rewards, but they should all be 61/62 or Focus of Souls should have been 63 or 64.  <br />
<br />
I think most of us would have loved to have seen Quiescence actually heal more per tick with a higher mana cost, but I'll take what I can get.  With Tnargs, KM, and Quiescence a shaman is a pretty competant healer, IMO so... /shrug<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, if a spell is gained by one class turning in Ethereal Parchments, it should be the same for all classes IMO.  i.e. Petrifying Earth / Greater Immobilize.  Lucy shows Necros get PE at 62 and GI at 63, yet SHM/CLR get GI at 62 and PE at 64????  /boggle  Minor Nuisance again.<br />
<br />
It's just generally discouraging to look at your 63/64 spell list and know that 5 out of 12 spells possible from turnin quest are essentially wastes of parchment.  PE, Group/Single STR/DEX<br />
<br />
I look at Clerics and see 9 spells from Spectral Turnins, a couple are situational and of course they're stuck with PE as well, but a lot less utterly wasted parchments still.  Destroy Undead and the AE I guess are situational, but they still both will probably see occasional use.<br />
<br />
I look at Druids and see not one useless spell.  Even the root upgrade is decent.  same resist adjust as PE/GI and less than half the mana with potentialy 50% longer duration than our best root.<br />
<br />
So, I guess my biggest beef with our spell lineup is that such a high percentage of our spells are highly situational or just about useless (stat buffs other than STA).  We have more 63/64 spells than either other priest class, so we'll need to gather more spectrals, and we also have at least a third of those spells that are basically useless, so chances are we'll waste even more spectrals getting duplicates of spells we'll never use, and in my case won't even bother putting into our spell books.<br />
<br />
Did we get royally screwed in PoP?  No, I wouldn't go that far.  But the spell lineup and placement is VERY Poorly thought out and unimpressive for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sandrak Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have pretty much given up on turning in Spectrals.  As I mentioned in another thread I keep getting Tears of Saryn and Breath of Ultor.  <br />
<br />
I will just deal with it and wait for them to show up in the bazaar in a month or two and buy them.  I don't really have any trouble getting spectrals but I hate to keep wasting them over and over getting the same damn spells so I am just letting guildmates take them for now.  Perhaps something will be adjusted in the future and I can revist the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raxthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yep most of the spells are standard upgrades for the shaman. The new topor will rock, because all the stupid restrictions have been removed, that makes it more than worth it.<br />
<br />
But the best spell of all in my opinion is the pet. The wolf is 58 level and quads for 60. I use him all the time now on raids, exp groups and even have him tanking PoP mobs w/slow in solo mode. I solo all the time now in PoV and having a blast just because I can. The exp is not as fast as grouping, but gives me something to do while I wait for a group.<br />
<br />
Be creative there is a use for every single spell that we have. As a shaman you just need to be creative and think outside the box. A true shamans power is not in one, two or even three spells. The power comes from understanding where and when to use a combination of any these spells. In my opinion shamans are the most powerful class in the entire game. VI understands that and that is why you see other classes getting new toys and shamans getting upgrades.<br />
<br />
Feel the power and push the limits .....</div></div><hr />
