<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lothranin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am hoping to be headed to the WL soon and have been wondering about the raptors.  <br />
<br />
Near the entrance to SS (or whatever the dragon zone is actually called) there is an area where Tigersaurs spawn.  Are these the raptors that everyone talks about?  Or is there another area?  I was there once and the only Tigeraptors I saw were wandering ones. <br />
<br />
Additionally, will panthers aggro here?<br />
<br />
Any info I can get about this zone would be extremely helpful at keeping me alive.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on level most people are ussually talking about the Raptors in Timerous Deep on the island just north of the Fire Pot room.<br />
<br />
And yes the Panthers in WL will aggro on you</div></div><hr />

Tigeraptors and Tigersauruses are in WL on hillside to the left as you exit the SS zone. You can bind in SS (even if you are KOS to guards, find a nice caster to bind you just inside zone; you will be glad you did). Biggest danger is Woushi in zone over by Kael entrance and the other named dragon that once came over and killed me (I think he was trained) at raptor hillside. Also there are wandering mercenaries, including one Tier'Dal Shadowknight that gave me fits for a while. SS is a good zone to run to. On the raptors, use harmony and snare, use panic animal. About one in five drops a skin. First time I sold these skins I got 300pp each; since then prices have dropped dramatically. Supply and demand...keep the supply down and the demand (price) will go up. If there is competition in the marketplace, tuck them away for a few weeks and bring them out when no one else is selling.<br />
<br />
WL is a great zone for rangers, but BE CAREFUL! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kelric Stormwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hm, sounds like great advice, I've been thinking of doing the same thing (drooling over some of that Tigeraptor armor... it's good to know a high-level tailor ;)).<br />
<br />
Is 40 to young to try this, you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lothranin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did this in WL not too long ago and all the Tigersaurs(?) were dblue.  They also seemed to have lot's of HP, so I asked a wizzy friend to join.  Went faster then.  Not sure what the HP actually are, but at the time I was trying to raise my 2hs with my swarmy.  Got the guts and some skins.  Haven't sold the skins yet, so I have no clue what the go for on Fennin Ro.  Since leaving there though I have close to maxed out my Coldain faction.  Gonna go back there and hope Wuoshi doesn't kill me, I can safely zone to SS, and the raptors are still Dblue and easier to kill. :-)<br />

I did this at 45 with a 40 wizzy for nukes.  Worked well and is decent Xp.  BTW you can forage yew leaves and sell them for a pretty penny from this zone too.</div></div><hr />
