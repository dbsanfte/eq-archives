<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sharden_1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today I'm soloing in Feribu as usual awaiting raids and do my normal pull technique of:   Malos mob, its running at me I cast Virulent Paralysis, then hit Turgurs --- 50% of the time I get Spell Recovery Time not met.<br />
<br />
  I just bug it and don't think much about it then I read the Dev has &quot;fixed&quot; this bug.  I hadn't noticed it before the posting by the Dev that he has a fix in place for it next patch.   You can get it by hitting root right after the VP also.  I'm not sure if its related to the fact I have the VT mask with 18% spell casting haste on it....  Can anyone on TEST verify the VP--&gt;followed by spell cast is fixed?<br />

It is, however, allegedly fixed on test.  A couple testy friends confirm they haven't been bothered by it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wonder if its the use of a AA hotkey followed by a fairly fast spell....  that seems to be the combo I use to get it....<br />
<br />
Oh yeah i realize it was fixed on TEST.... hope it gets the combo of spells I'm using :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's AA followed by any spell. I get it with Can-5 and Can-4, or Can-5 and Q.</div></div><hr />

I should have named the thread differently.... (was raiding at the time).  I was more interested in the sequence of spell casts it took to see the bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Delvean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Paladins get this bug a ton. It is based on how fast you cast your spells. If you cast a spell in 1 second or less, and then immediately cast another spell of any casting length as soon as your spell gem ungreys, you will get this message. The time may actually be more than 1 second, but since all of the spells that I have that cast fast cast in 1 second or less I don't know.<br />
<br />
This is bad when you have a root, a heal, and a couple stuns that cast in 1 second or less. After casting any of these spells, I have to pause for a 1/2 second after the spell gems ungrey before casting another spell. Its actually pretty rare that I get this message anymore because I have trained myself to have that pause between all spells. Still, I am very disappointed the fix didn't make it into this patch.<br />

I get it with Can-5 and Can-4, or Can-5 and Q.I've never gotten this after casting canni5 and immediately casting Q to follow it(and I mean, I hit alt-7 as soon as I can, some times spamming it if it's a dangerous situation).  I've only ever seen this bug when you attempt to cast a short cast time spell immediately after another spell cast.  Not saying others haven't experienced this, but I've never seen a Canni5/Q combo fail due to spell recast time bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only see this on Shammy after doing AA (usually Can5 or maybe the pet AA) or pally with quickcast spells, pretty much in line with what people are saying. I am usually not close enough to &quot;the edge&quot; for it to matter but glad to see a long-standing bug get fixed (hopefully).<br />

<br />
It only happens with Q if you've got 50% spell haste for it. Unfortunately i've got qb 2 and fennins belt so Q is always at 50% spell haste and I have to delay or I will get this pretty much every time. Before that I was using agnarr's earring as haste and qb2 which put me at 43% haste for buffs. I'd never get it with that how ever with cleric haste buff up i'd get it. Seems to happen only with extremely fast casting spell or spells that are max hasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am getting it every time I canni V and immediately cast Q. It didn't use to happen, so was a recent bug (within the last 2-3 months).<br />

It is annoying.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Any AA immediately followed by a spell with a casting time of 3.0 seconds or less does it for me, every time.<br />
<br />
Extrapolating from that (and from the fact that the generic spell gem refresh time is 2.25) it would seem that the game will not allow you to cast more then one spell every 3 seconds. Thus you will get the message only after casting a sdpell immediately following an AA skill or with a spell of a casting time of 0.75 seconds or less.<br />
<br />
I always thought this was as intended (absurd, but intended). It sure would be nice for the time to get lowered to 2.25 at least, if not completely dropped. I would imagine this a safeguard against cheating though, so we are probably stuck with at least some sort of timer. But lowering it to 2.25 should get rid of the issue except for the fastest (less then 2.25 seconds) spells in combination with AA skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The &quot;spell recovery time not met&quot; bug was introduced a year or two ago, back when they messed with the ability of clickies to eliminate spell refresh time. They did a half-assed job of it then and it's been broken ever since. As a shaman, you will notice this bug more as you acquire spell haste effects.<br />
<br />
This is not a recent bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wish Zorlac were here.  He'd have a field day with this.<br />
<br />
Here's ol Faern's interpretation of what happened:<br />
<br />
A long time ago, in an expansion far, far away, casters of all types were able to defeat the greying out of spell gems (designed to prevent chain casting) by using an 'insta-cast' item (think J Boots, Gobbo earring).<br />
<br />
In response to this bit of ingenuity on the part of the player base, the dev's and programmers coded in something which did not allow for such action.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to be that something coded in the past 2-3 months or a problem with client - server synch has revived this situation like  The Mummy Returns .<br />
<br />
I do think there is some credence to the fast casting spells (think Tash a 1.0 second casting spell) playing a part in it.  I get it when trying to cast slow and tash or tash and mez back to back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I only have 43% beneficial spell haste (18% druzzil + 25% QB2) making Q cast in 3.4 seconds. Still happens every time I spam after Cann5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not a huge bump here... but this particular bug appears to be fixed. I was having no issues spamming Q as Canni V was going off. It was casting and landing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yep, appears fixed as of Friday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sweet if its fixed, see if malicious decay can be casted immediately after an aa though, because I am pretty sure thats our fastest casting spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sweet if its fixed, see if malicious decay can be casted immediately after an aa though, because I am pretty sure thats our fastest casting spell.<br />
<br />
Tried Malicious Decay right after Canni V and got &quot;Spell recovery time not yet met&quot; error.<br />
<br />
But Turgur's or Quiescence right after Canni V works now, as does Insidious Malady right after Malicious Decay, so I'd call it fixed. Finally.<br />
<br />
BTW Fleeting Fury and Burst of Strength are our fastest casting spells at 0.5 seconds.</div></div><hr />
