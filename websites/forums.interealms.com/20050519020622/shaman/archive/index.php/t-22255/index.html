<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok before you sigh and say oh sheez not another whiney post etc.<br />
This is about my personal experiences with a LOT of lower level shamans.<br />
While ive been levelling my Ranger up ive been grouped with a lot of shamans over the levels and a lot of them seem totally ****ing useless.<br />
Under 50 i can understand but once you hit 50 if you havent grasped the basics of a class then forget it.<br />
The amount of times ive seen Shamans who wont even back up heal is beyond a joke.<br />
As for trying to get a 50 plus shaman as main healer for a group even ldons you can just forget it.<br />
The amount of times ive seen shaman not canni then say oom.<br />
The list could go on and on.<br />
Dont know if this is me and i just notice it more because of my shaman or whether it is just a general decline in playing standards.<br />
Yes i may do a lot of things wrong with my shaman but i know for damn sure im doing the basics right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is a pretty common thing among all classes, really. I have played my twinks with some pretty crappy other twinks. There are very few &quot;true true&quot; noobies in this game, I would imagine most people have at LEAST 3 or 4 characters they like to play. But laziness is certainly one of the most common faults of people at that level, of all classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And shamans at 50 have it easy now with stoicism surely.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wulf, the ability to level at such a rapid pace even untwinked and not power leveled is what has brought about the decline of ALL classes.  People don't have the chance to learn like we did.  We grinded thru levels learning as we went. <br />
<br />
Remember KC?  Now its the what I like to refer to as the &quot;Last year camp was better&quot; syndrome.  Basically &quot;Last year it was so much better before you got here&quot;, that kids hear at summer camps around the world lol.  It was &quot;always&quot; better BEFORE.  <br />
<br />
Times change and sadly people do too.  While I am proud to be a Shaman and love to play the class, other ppl see it as a buff bot only.<br />
<br />
Well EQ as a whole is on the downward spiral.  Sad to see it go but there will always be another.  WAIT!  What do you mean...outside?   Outside ?!What is that?  What loot drops there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I heal a lot.  Doesn't matter if it is a raid or ldon.  I like to feel useful, and heals are never resisted, so I feel like I can contribute something positive.  Plus, it is awesome when you get a crit heal off and the tank is at like 2% *lol*.  Heck, I even healed in Earth.  It was pain in the ass because I had to click cann iv every time the spell gem refreshed, but I do not remember anyone dying per se.  Horse + VoQ + Canni 5 + Canni 4 = a nice mana supply.<br />
<br />
It is a rule of thumb for me that I want to stay full mana as much as possible, so I am always clicking Canni 4.  A lot of shaman do not do this anymore, and I cannot understand why.  Yes, it is a pain in the butt, but I think you are selling yourself and your group short if you do not use one of our most powerful tools.  /shrugs<br />
<br />
Also, a lot of shaman are bots.  When I was in a guild on Karana, for a while, I was the only shaman that wasn't bot'ed.<br />
<br />
Another point is that there are different skill sets for soloing and grouping.  I do the craziest stuff when I solo because I do not care.  When I am grouping, I try to take my role ( weither it is slowing, healing, etc seriously )  - yeah, I joke a lot, but if someone dies because I was too slow or whatnot - even if there was nothing I could do about it, I take it personally.  I had a guildie last night comment about that when we were doing the 6th izzy trial in KT.  He was killed so fast - I swear that I blinked, and he was dead.  I sent him a tell saying how sorry I was, and he replied to me - I doubt 10 of you could have saved me from that.  Which, I agreed, but still, I felt bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would have to agree. Are there any more zones in the &quot;level ASAP&quot; chain that are dungeons, or that REQUIRE you to handle 2+ mobs on a single pull? Or is it basically all single mob kills, and outdoor horses and such?<br />
<br />
And yes, Stoi rocks when you first get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Man i wish i had Stoicism when I was doing those hard-won 44-60 levels.  Those levels used to REALLY suck back before you could just go to PoP and level them all up in a few weeks of casual play.  Back in the day, shamans hoarded regen equipment as the best money could buy for them, simply because the best shamans were the ones with fastest mana regen, and this was accomplished by being able to canni more often.  <br />
Stoicism just takes all the work right out of that endevour, allowing a shaman to sit a horse and canni up mana with impunity to health or regeneration concerns.  My my, shamans today should be powerhouses at those levels.  Sadly, of the few I see these days, even fewer use cannibalize, let alone use it well.  Many haven't even bothered to quest Stoicism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, I'm sure all of you &quot;old-timers&quot; had to walk barefoot in the snow, up hill both ways, carrying your groupmates on your back on the way to the dungeon.  lol.<br />
<br />
Seriously, since I've been playing well over a year and just dinged 61 this past weekend, I can vouch for the fact that there are some folks that still play the game and level the old-fashioned way.  No PL, no twinking, except for a few leftovers my buddies gave me.  I did do the stoicism quest, just dumb not to, with my 62 druid buddy helping me out (he single pulled the pirates out of the houses and backed me up on the turn-in).  I didn't try it until I was level 49, didn't think I could handle the mobs in Dulak, and then kicked myself for not getting it at 44.  What a Godsend.  However, I did canni dance, still do on occasion in LDoN where I can't use my mount, and I heal and slow like a champ.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I guess you can consider me one of the new generation, but I can assure you that some of us do play the game to enjoy the journey, and try to learn all of the tricks of the trade along the way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Update from the peanut gallery. <br />
<br />
I am currently trying some of GoD. <br />
<br />
So far I have spent a few hours in Riwwi The colosium of Games.  Duoing And trioing. me My Hot box SK and sometimes a warrior. <br />
<br />
The monsters hit anywhere from 250ish to 600 ish. With the named hitting upwards of 900ish. Actually in the colosium is doable with what I have described. My SK is in Ornate and such with a Velium Gemmed two hander And has about 6700 hps buffed up with Virtue and Shaman buffs. (80ish AA) The warrior is slightly less geared. With a combo of Skyshrine and Umbral plains Armour and a Fabled Exe Axe.  I myself have Ornate A fungal tunic. and 400ish AA. <br />
<br />
The fights here are fun a little dangerous on named (Ok downright dangerous if I don't get a slow off fast. ) But the loot isnt really an upgrade for myself. The SK sure. And the Warrior hell yeah. But I really can't get a whole lot form here. But it is fun. <br />
<br />
Barindu<br />
<br />
I tried duoing in One of the sewers trials. I wasnt ready for 1014 point hitting Gnats. Deader than a doornail in 4 seconds flat. The SK flopped and zoned. (Speaking of which any Graveyard for that stuff? I left a bag on the body and just ate the Xp loss) <br />
<br />
Overall it seems okay. Honestly doable but why. The zones are pretty depressing. The monsters are brutal. And Moving from place to place invis just adds to the random death factor. It means you HAVE to bring a cleric for a safe night. Or a Paladin. (I have a cleric camped at the Colosium. And have had to use him)<br />
<br />
I am enjoying myself for a bit. but the pall will come rapidly due to the lack of style to the zones. (I guess style. Dunno. Just doesnt seem like it is as fun for some reason. )<br />
<br />
I will try some of the other zones as well if I cna get a better force together. Pulling fromt he fringes and skirting danger is well and good for a few days. but familiarity breeds contempt. <br />
<br />
Have a good one folks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Leveling today is a shadow of difficulty of what it was in the earlier expansions, and I think it has caused quite a few problems that some people do not realize.  The common voice of knowledge of all classes is to level to 65 then work on gear/aa's- we see it in our threads and I am sure it would not be difficult to find it in similar threads on other class boards. <br />
<br />
Problems that I see that are related to the &quot;easy&quot; leveling:<br />
<br />
- Players not knowing how to play there class.<br />
<br />
A lot of people that I have played with have a common viewpoint: the 30's begin to define what the class will become.  In the past, these were the training levels where you learned the basic skills on how to play your class: healing, tanking, mana efficiency, mez control, etc.  We are seeing players today use the 50's-60's to learn about their class which is horrible.  You should know how to play your class by then.<br />
<br />
- Players not bothering to equip themselves for harder content.<br />
<br />
I think there are 2 factors to this: one, that players, in the endless zerg to 65, do not take the time to upgrade their equipment because it slows down their grind.  The other issue I see is that the developers speed up the leveling process, but the equipment drop rate is the same as it was before.  Basically, people bypass the equipping process by trivializing the content faster [xp grind].<br />
<br />
- Flagging, Keys, and Instancing<br />
<br />
There are a lot of players out there that complain about the semi-new zone restrictions created by the above 3.  People point out that, in the beginning, EQ did not use these strategies to block content, so why are they using them now?<br />
<br />
The kicker here is that EQ was using another way to block content- levels.  Hell levels and low xp rates made sure that the gaming populous was spread out in content- it took literally two weeks of active xp grinding back in the day to hit level 60 from 59.  We don't see this in the game today because leveling was made easier.  So why are we seeing the use of keys, flags, and instancing now?<br />
<br />
When I log on during the bulk of EQ traffic [8-10pm CST], I will see 30-45 players in BoT, 15-30 players in Tactics, 5-20 players in HoH, 6-12 players in CoD, 20-40 players in Sol Ro, 15-36 players in PoE, and 6-18 players in PoFire.  The majority of these players are here for xp, and are individually blocked by flags.  If the flags were removed the majority of them would attempt to move to PoFire simply because it has the best xp modifier.  The total number of players in the zone would be.....<br />
<br />
97-201<br />
<br />
You would be lagged out to the point of possible zone collapse.  To maintain server stability you have to split up the gaming populous.<br />
<br />
Would post some more, but I need to head out and take care of some other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree with the lack of knowledge among most lower lvl players now.  I can remember on Bertox when the first character (a wizard) made it to lvl 50 !   It was a HUGE achievement, thought to be nearly unattainable, and for most of us, it took a long, long time.  Now, you can get a twink to lvl 50 in a day or two of playing.  Even a true noob can get to 50 in a relatively short time.<br />
<br />
The value of the lower levels is diminished by the brevity of time spent on each level.  As a result, the subtlies of the class are lost to most players.  Hell, I SOLOED a warrior twink to 50 and got bored with him..there is no sense of achievement in lvling anymore, not even for the true newbie...all they wanna do is get to 65 asap without taking the TIME to learn their class.<br />
<br />
How do you fix it?  You don't.  It is not fixable for EQ.  The genie is out of the bottle, and you can't put it back.  If they make lvling harder again, it would cause a riot.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Truth is, the entire &quot;lack of skilled players&quot; thing started with Kunark. Players could easily go from 1-55ish and NEVER have to enter a dungeon. This just wasnt feasible pre-Kunark. You basically went to Sol B or LG to level. True, toward end of the pre-Kunark era even these places became a joke because of overcrowding, but in the &quot;older&quot; days, if you were lvl 50, for the most part, people figured you did your work in dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The problem is that the majority of players are 65 . . . the rest are strung out between 1-64 . . . with so few close enough in level that it makes it difficult to form a circle of friends to climb with.  This doesnt even take into account that some of those you might group with are simply alts for 65.<br />
<br />
While it would be painful for me to let go of Sudedor, I am almost to the point where I think there should be a &quot;life expectancy&quot; for characters.  When your life expectancy is exceeded, your character is gone.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't be popular now, but had it gone in at the start, a lot of problems today wouldn't be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's definitely easy to get through many levels without even knowing the names of most of your spells.  <br />
<br />
There's a nice kind of hard-won knowledge that rounds out a character when he takes a while to level.  It makes him more fun to talk to and a more reliable group mate.  It tends to make him more flexible because he's tried more ways of doing things, with more varied group compositions, against many different types of mobs.  Nowadays, who skips Paludal?  We mostly have very limited experiences, and the same experiences, before we hit our 50's or even 65.  It means our skills tend to be not a well-rounded sphere or an interesting labyrinthe with many different paths to an end, but just a flat dull dead-end.<br />
<br />
Kind of like those brittle people who've had everything so easy that the least little bit of opposition that comes into their lives shatters them completely.  They're usually deadly dull to talk to and borderline incompetent in nearly every arena.  One thing falls out of place, and it's catastrophic to them.<br />
<br />
Those guys don't make good group mates or guildmates.  Oh well.  <br />
<br />
Does seem a shame that the game has 65 levels, and these days there doesn't seem to be any point to 64 of them.  And there are so many zones but there's hardly anyone in most of them.  The game has become so narrow!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Biggest thing - it isn't just 'new' shaman. All the classes have clueless representatives. Battle clerics, wiz-wannabe-druids, single-shot wizards, necros who won't lich.<br />
<br />
While I agree that some of them are able to make levels so fast they never learn the utility/functionality of the class ... I think even more likely the cause to be that now morons can level much easier than before. Early game level took some effort. You had to know what you were doing to some extent.<br />
<br />
Now you can just show up, get some buffs, buy some gear and compensate through most difficult periods. Back when you couldn't do that the tendency was to get frustrated and move to another character or another game. Not needed now.<br />
<br />
The game is easier now. Too much so for some players. Not easy enough for others, I am sure. But overall, for the majority it is 'balanced' to give them some sense of acheivement, but not enough to make them have to really work for it.<br />
<br />
I am amazed at the number of 60+ I run into who haven't clue one what their class roles are/can be in a group. How to solo. How to react to more than the expected single pull/kill, rinse/repeat tempo of gameplay. The requirement AT EVERY RAID to go over the basics ('Make a hotkey: /target &lt;mt name&gt;' ... 'Do not move forward unless directed to do so by the raid leader' ... yada, yada.) And this is not a newbie quild.<br />
<br />
Getting to 65 is easy - knowing something once you are there, apparently takes more effort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or here's another solution.  This will sound just wacky crazy if you haven't played in the excellent Kunark dungeons (OS/HS/CD/N/D) so get ready:<br />
<br />
Make More Than One Zone Rewarding For All Players <br />
<br />
For the LDoN crowd, here's solution #2, equally insane:<br />
<br />
Instance the Popular Zones <br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah, this technology and design is way ahead of the curve.  There's no way this could be implemented since nowhere else in the game is this done.  But maybe, just maybe, a designer or developer could work on something like this in between releasing expansions every four months.  It's crazy talk, but one can dream, no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Biggest thing is this: since after kunark i can recall people starting to complain about certain aspects of our class, mostly where is 'our' better this better that, and can recall people being told basically to shut the hell up you will piss off the developers, with with each additional expansion the voices grew a littl till now with GoD we were so completely left behind everyone felt it. Now anyone who plays the class can clearly see some impact on their gameplay regardless style (solo, group, raider) yes only really completely effects gameplay post elementals but will it be fixed by the time all players reach that point? should they even bother to continue knowing where the end game lies? Frankly reason i liked the game was there was no winners, everyone had a chance to get there, now we as a class for the first time have a point where we really aren't wanted, needed or welcome for the most part. Sure some said ah well who cares im past that point i have my blank, or ive done blank and dont care its harder now. It sad that more wasn't taken to heart back in the day when our silent nerf started, yeah we weren't that bad off back then but Rome wasn't built in a day and Hitler was considered a hero even by lots of Americans till he started ravaging Europe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Seremont</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, I must start by saying that shammy isn't my first, nor main toon... yet I came to want one because they seemed so useful, so desired, so fun to play, if you learned to solo, group etc. just like all classes.<br />
<br />
That being said, just tonight, at 45, I was invited (without LFG up) to join an LDoN group. I haven't done many LDoNs with Seremont (1 to be precise, hehe I'm 100%, beat that!), so I said sure. It took me about 3 min in the group to find out I was expected to buff, haste, slow AND main heal.  Yes, I have stoicism, but no tank wants that cast on them in battle, hehe.  They tried to tell me that Greater Heal was sufficient to main heal for an LDoN. I'm sorry, but Gheal sucks, period. And stoicism isn't desired amongst melees.  So I refused to be everything for the group because I didn't want to fail miserably and have them blame me or shammies.  <br />
<br />
Now I know I am not a great shammy.  I do my best and have been reading here, so hopefully I'll get better, but I don't feel bad for wanting to do just about everything for the group. IMHO, shammies at 45 make GREAT backup healers, or healers of casters or even the non-MAs, but I just don't have the manapool to be everything for a group. Then again, I'm not particularly twinked.<br />
<br />
Ok, it's late and I'm rambling, but you get the drift.  I hope I'm missing something, and that you have some great words of wisdom for me. Alas, I don't see it.<br />
<br />
Does that make me a horrible shammy?<br />
<br />
Seremont</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">No, Seremont, it doesn't. One of the main points about knowing your class is knowing what it cannot do.<br />
<br />
BTW, did you realise that shaman are better MHers than druids between level 44 and 57, assuming similar gear and AAs? In addition to stoicism, we have canni to give us better mana regen. Druids get pack regen and pack chloro but neither really cuts it for the MT.<br />
<br />
I agree with you that GHeal sucks in an LDoN. Things get better at 51 with SHeal and at 55 with Chloroblast (better ratio and faster casting). When I MHed in LDoNs at your level, I'd start with GHeal but, as the mob's hps dropped, I'd eventually use Stoicism. If he or she complains a lot, throw Alacrity on him or her (and him or her only - you don't have enough mana to keep everyone hasted and MH). So saying, if the MT cannot hold agro with a Stoicism on them after tanking the mob for 10 secs or so, get a new MT! The only person in the group who I would not Stoicism is the puller, since they need to move around to do their pulling. If the puller constantly has agro, tell him or her to back off a bit and let the MT do his or her job. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, what you need for Shammy or Druid MHing in an LDoN is good CC. I found I could keep the group healed with single pulls and alive with two or three with a lengthy med break afterwards but, with more than that, I'd really struggle. Mezzers are perfect. Otherwise, get snarers to kite or casters to root-park adds. If a Shaman or Druid is forced in to chain healing a tank fending off lots of mobs, you'll have a dead MH very quickly. <br />
<br />
Indeed, the one thing that really annoyed me about lower level LDoNs was that non-healers never realised that the people who died from bad pulls weren't the tanks or pullers or even DPS. It was always the MH desparately trying to keep people standing. They'd stand their yelling &quot;Heal me!&quot; and I'd be yelling back &quot;I can't because I'm dead!&quot; <br />
<br />
If I have one word of advice, I know lots of people say when you are MH to take group deaths personally but, if you have morons in your group who do stupid things, let them die! It is the only way they will learn. If they pull too many or pull when you are &quot;Oom&quot; or anything like that, blame the puller for the deaths. The MH didn't do anything wrong!<br />
<br />
Sorry to derail the thread a bit. I felt like a bit of a rant.<br />

Depending on the makeup of the group and the level of gear they had, you probably would have been fine as the main healer and doing all the rest of the stuff.  The trick is to not give everyone every buff and don't use your best slow.  You might be surprised at how little healing is needed considering the level of gear some people twink with.<br />
<br />
I remember the painful days of buffing/healing/slowing and having ONLY single target buffs.  It *does* get better :)<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
As far as the subject of incompetent players goes, I've seen lots of incompetent players at every stage of the game (1-65).  You notice bad players even moreso if you also have extensively played their class and know the ins and outs of it.  For example, if your main character is a shaman, you are much more likely to notice the bad shaman that doesn't canni rather than the bad bard that only plays a haste song and melees.</div></div><hr />

The bodies should pop outside the trial entrance areas a short while after the party has left the exp. Just grab a passing cleric and get a rez ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
About buffs and hastes, it isn't that much to do. ( I mean, you can ask the group to stop a minute while you canni back the mana you used )<br />
<br />
Now, it could depend on tanks / stuff. But i remember the good old DreadLand time, and I couldn't be main slower and healer at the same time at 45. ( not a so great stuff in bazaar too at  this time ;) )</div></div><hr />

Also you get these 1 track mind shamans who think their only role in life is to slow. Tell them to do something else and their heads spin.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Or here's another solution.  This will sound just wacky crazy if you haven't played in the excellent Kunark dungeons (OS/HS/CD/N/D) so get ready:<br />
<br />
Make More Than One Zone Rewarding For All Players <br />
<br />
For the LDoN crowd, here's solution #2, equally insane:<br />
<br />
Instance the Popular Zones <br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah, this technology and design is way ahead of the curve.  There's no way this could be implemented since nowhere else in the game is this done.  But maybe, just maybe, a designer or developer could work on something like this in between releasing expansions every four months.  It's crazy talk, but one can dream, no?<br />
<br />
Zones are all about the drop rate Iz, xp plays a role- but its all about the drops.<br />
<br />
When GoD came out the named in Natimbi had a life span of about 2 mins.  Now you can watch a named wander around for hours before someone kills it.  Why?  Because the named in Natimbi have been overfarmed.  You can make more xp in PoValor over time than you can in BoT, but why do people go there? Ornate.  Once the ornate has been farmed to triviality- people will stop going there.  I have watched players pick Sol Ro over PoEarth because they would rather line their pockets with plat than go after more xp and some nice one-groupable upgrades.<br />
<br />
LDoN came out with 5 adventure camps each providing equal experience, loot, and difficulty.  So why do I have 50+ wins in EF and Nro, but I have still have yet to break 30 in Guk?  Is it because Guk is more challenging? Nope.  Nro high end gear is plate shared by your 3 tanks, 1 puller, and 1 healer.  EF high end gear is shared by one slower and 2 major dps.  <br />
<br />
Why was GoD unsuccessful?<br />
 <br />
Was it due to lack of imagination? no<br />
Was it lack of decent xp? no<br />
Was it lack of potential upgrades? no<br />
Was it lack of droppable loot that you could sell for plat? YES<br />
<br />
I guarantee you that if half the GoD zones dropped ornate they would be flooded with people looking to make some plat- lousy content/xp aside.<br />
<br />
BoT is damn boring, but people STILL go because there is the possibility that they can make a sizable amount of plat.<br />
<br />
Developer's can not design equal zones because there will always be something that will make the players create a rank system.<br />
<br />
Are they equal xp/difficulty?<br />
Is the loot droppable?<br />
What is the drop rate like?<br />
What classes will benefit from the drops?<br />
Where is the zone located?<br />
Which classes will not benefit?<br />
<br />
GoD instanced most of its trials and, in the beginning, Vxed was the trial of choice.  Hybrids were walking away from the trial with 2-3 drops at a time.  Once they got their loot, they didn't want to go back.  SOE saw that Vxed was being farmed too fast, so they nerfed the named spawn time.  Now people no longer want to do Vxed- they rather do Tipt due to there being 2 named always up.  You can instance all the zones you want, if the drop rates are good people will go there- until they have the drops they want.</div></div><hr />

Under 50 i can understand but once you hit 50 if you havent grasped the basics of a class then forget it.<br />
The amount of times ive seen Shamans who wont even back up heal is beyond a joke.<br />
As for trying to get a 50 plus shaman  as main healer for a group even ldons you can just forget it.The amount of times ive seen shaman not canni then say oom.<br />
The list could go on and on.<br />
Dont know if this is me and i just notice it more because of my shaman or whether it is just a general decline in playing standards.<br />
Yes i may do a lot of things wrong with my shaman but i know for damn sure im doing the basics right.<br />
<br />
Ok the usual thing.<br />
Got a neg rep bump for this post saying ive been twinked to long and there is no way an UNDER 50 shaman can heal in an ldon.Unsigned bump of course.<br />
Now for whoever this was ive underlined and bolded what i actually said and in case you still cant read it i said<br />
As for trying to get a 50 PLUS shaman.....<br />

I heal normal LDoN's very easily.  I don't think I've said OOM in several months.<br />
<br />
As I see it, the class as a whole (and those in it) doesn't have itself to blame for being behind others in balance.  They seem like two separate issues.  <br />
<br />
Every class has lazy people, in my opinion, it's just that some classes can AFFORD to be lazy and ride their core abilities through to victory in all but the toughest situations.</div></div><hr />

&quot;oh no .. now everyone is levelling up through Oasis &gt; LoIo &gt; Frontier &gt; OT &gt; Dreadlands &gt; Karnors &gt; Seb&quot;<br />
<br />
nowadays i'd gladly take someone who went though grouping in overthere and karnors. It's probably someone who understand how classes are supposed to work together I myself went though that progression-ish .. except i took a few detours along the way, like Kedge, befallen, Najena, sol a/b.<br />
<br />
Now noone in their right mind would to go najena over paladul .. even though i think najena is a more interesting zone. How many people nowadays have been in the Gorge of King Xorbb .. or ran from Qeynos to HHK to buy a spell<br />
<br />
running across the karanas was why i made a bard alt .. so i can run around west karana with bard speed on which is one of the simple pleasures of eq i think .. running fast :)<br />
<br />
Anyways .. i digress .. that's quite a bit of a tangent .. but i think new players (the few there are) are being cheated of some of the best parts of the game because the most fun zones for their level are seriously underpopulated.<br />
<br />
It might be a good idea if sony started a new server that only had original EQ available to it .. and then after 4-5 months introduced an expansion at a time in availability .. .. so after 4 months .. you have kunark available .. after 8 .. velious .. wait another 4 months and then SoL .. If i was starting eq .. that's the server i'd want to play on knowing what i know now.</div></div><hr />

 I agree Aaellyn, even when i make twinks now, just to level up for the hell of it, i still go back to zones like nagafens lair, the east commons orc camps, and the Loio sarnak fort, it feels good and fun to go back to those eras of the game.</div></div><hr />

Some of my friends call it evercrack and I can see why. I started with a Barbarian Rogue and then saw some interesting stuff about shamans and decided to give it a try. Im hooked. I have most of the expansions and am reading everything I can find. Came here to try and learn all the nitty gritty about playing a Shaman.<br />
<br />
The problems I am runing into is that there is SO much to learn. I can see why most people want to zoom through the levels and then learn the inner workings. Its a pain when soloing way out in BFE and get nuked by a mob (why mob by the way Im still lost on most of the acronyms) and have to trudge all the way back to collect ur bod. If you zoom to 65 then go back and kick the crap out of the lower level stuff its far less discouraging.<br />
<br />
Mind you I on the other hand am stubborn. Id rather work my way up. Ive tried to group with highher level people so that I could learn but they all say your too low. I understand that Id get nothing out of it but the training experience would be worth more than all the xp, plat and loot any mob could drop.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the way is to take &quot;young&quot; shamans under your wing and teach them some of the tricks of the trade. It seems to me that if there were more Savy shamans running around that we would be a more appreciated class.<br />

<br />
I don't approve of the subject line you've chosen, and here's why:<br />
<br />
It's not just the shaman class.  It's any class.  Mabye you've just had a bad run of luck and got stuck with afew bad players.  Usually, regardless of what the player is doing wrong in the group, I usually just try suggesting things in a positive manner.  You can tell at that point what type of person is behind the keyboard, if they will listen, shrug it off or get insulted.  <br />
<br />
Some actually just don't know better, it's not their fault.  Be it a cleric that won't heal, a shaman that won't slow, heal or canni -- whatever, sooner or later, they'll learn, there's no choice really.  It's just a matter of time.  <br />
<br />
Not everyone knows everything about the game.  You have your veteran players who've been around for years, but you also have new players (surprisingly alot of them I've noticed, around my level range anyways).  Think back on your first toon (if you have had no help from someone, and no one to teach you).   I don't know about you, but if a good player saw me playing my first character, he would have thought me retarded.<br />
<br />
Also this isn't towards you but just a general statement - gear is absolutely no way to determine how good someone should be.  Forget that now.  People twink, people buy plat, get used to it.  It's been going on for a long time, and will keep happening till the end.<br />
<br />
