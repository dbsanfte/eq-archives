<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya! I know Hill Giants are old news but i just came from a great solo hunt at 44th level.<br />
<br />
Since the resist changes I spent 2 days hunting these guys and did not encounter a single resist. Not one. Zero. And I didn't even use Malisement!<br />
<br />
I would simply pull with slow to pet. Root and sic pet. Apply the DoTs and re-root if need be and then med/cannidance. Once poison DoT drops you can re-apply or melee. With my Iksar BP I usually came out of the fight with 80% hp and 60-70% mana.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i'm currently 41, i've been in Rathe hunting HGs. <br />
<br />
I was soloing, fully buffed and hasted, with fido fully buffed and hasted also had 3 HGs rooted, slowed, Vos, and scourged.  killed 2 of them almost simutaniously. Both of them had Tainted's appear right there. <br />
<br />
managed to root and VoS both tained's then the last of the original 3 broke root and started pounding on me, he had some weapon in his hand. by the time i got him re-rooted and dotted, both tainted broke root and were after me. Fido just couldn't hold their agro. finally killed the last of the original 3, had both tainted down to about 30% hp, fido less than a bubble of health.<br />
<br />
healed fido, had 20% mana. Nuke both tainted till they were dead, and guess what? Yep, 2 corrupt HGs. rooted them both, and cannidanced my butt off, to cast VOS on them. I was one cannidancing fool, a regualr barbarian Michael Jackson. (kei didn't hurt either)<br />
<br />
I focused my attack on 1 of them and killed him, now i'm at 35% health, oom, fido at about 20% health, and yep, you guessed it, root broke on the last one. (did i mention my sow faded also).<br />
<br />
The last corrupt was about 60% health. i stood there meleeing him long enough to cannidance enough mana to cast root. got stunned a few times. finally got root to stick, backed up and had a whopping 38hp. <br />
<br />
ran far enough away to give me good response time and sat and medded with fido by my side, less than 20% hp for fido.<br />
<br />
thank god for kei and iksar BP, i managed to get sow and chloro up on me before the root broke, by the time the corrupt was close enought i was about 50% health and 20%mana. so i rooted him and vos'ed him. sent fido in (who died bravely in the battle) and popped off a few winters roar while cannidancing and finally dropped him.<br />
<br />
<br />
20 minutes later, 30% health, OOm, fido dead, only buff left was KEI, i had killed 3 HGs, 2 Tainted's, and 2 Corrupts. <br />
<br />
overall, about 120 plat, 3 fine steal weapons and a few toes to use in alchemy, and a heart rate that would have sent a hummingbird into a stroke.<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
Oh, and having my wife fussing at me about something the whole time didn't help much either. I just ignored her. then of course she started fussing at me about ignoring her.<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When in RM I like to get 3 or so HGs and slow them all and just take it &quot;in teh face&quot; while dogdog kills em.  Just save mana for heals or a dot or 2. Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
Pretty sweet when peole send you tells asking if your ok and you just say 'yep, Im just chillin'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I guess it's a little easier with level 44 Dogdog...I'm still having difficulty in Rathe...I usually have Skelly adds and while they dont' kill me outright, when they add to the 3 HG's I've got, it takes a bit to run a little ways away, instill them, head back then keep my level 39dogdog safe...I think level 44 dog will own them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The lvl 49 dog owns them. The lvl 44 dog still melts :). I even used the HGs to level from 49 to 50. The exp was slow since 1/2 of the giants were light blue. But with making 800-1000pp a night, I didn't mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since the skeletons are green to me now, i usually lead them to the tower on top of the hill, the guards there will kill them. The guards wont touch a HG or cyclops, they will whip out anything else that get close enough.<br />
<br />
So next time that skelly starts pounding on ya, train it to the tower.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I LOVE HG's. Been soloing them since lvl35..all you need is KEI and your laughing.<br />
<br />
Pull with slow, root, dot, dot, med, root, dot, nuke nuke and maybe another nuke....sometimes i use dogdog but he tends to get over excited and runs off....silly mutt :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heya Huth,<br />
<br />
Seen you there!!<br />
<br />
Been doing these since 34th, slow, disempower, scourge, tank with dogdog. Heal when needed. 37th Now, pp is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh lorks alive you are so much more twinked than i am Mingh :D<br />
<br />
Huths Stuff (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148754)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would suggest ignoring HG's until 49. There are better places to gain exp, and while the money is great, it can be earned MUCH faster at 49. At 49 1 Ebolt + 20 seconds of 49 dog-dog (alpha'd of course) = a really dead Giant. The only reason to kill the giants, especially considering how crowded Rathe is, is to get money as fast as possible. Trying to get exp and money there is pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Huth, i am rather twinked lol - but i guess thats what happens when you sell your clerics gear and manastone :D <br />
<br />
I have been doing HG's since 34 for a few reasons.<br />
<br />
As time passes, they get easier.<br />
<br />
You get cash (Pretty Obvious).<br />
<br />
I decided to do these until i get to 40 and defense to 200, then i can root/dot or do as i please wherever.<br />
<br />
Im not really interested in quick exp, just passing the time. The exp aint that bad really, just need the cash to save up for horse and long term Malo/Torp etc.</div></div><hr />
