<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Noticing that many AEs that one used to be able to hide from are permeating walls and barriers.<br />
<br />
Mobs that I've noticed this on lately: Vyzh`Dra the Cursed, Arch Lich Rhag Zadune. The &quot;Curse of Rhag Zadune&quot; trap is also going through walls and hitting people who are not in the room with rogues who are disarming traps.<br />
<br />
I bet it's a similar story in NTOV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This has been a change as of yesterday's patch by the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm.  Did Aaryonar just become the most difficult mob in all of EQ to kill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's not a change, it's the infinite monkeys trying to be clever, and failing at it.<br />
<br />
I think that in an attempt to lessen the bandwidth EQ uses, SoE decided to use packet compression... and the EQ client is doing a piss poor job at uncompessing them.<br />
<br />
This resulted in people thinking they are losing health, yet healing spells are ineffective, and their group members are seeing them at full health. When you are hit by a &quot;fake&quot; AE, the server thinks you've avoided it, the client think you've been hit by it. Unfortunately for you, if the client thinks you are at -11 hp, you die.<br />
<br />
Insta-clicks will get your mana back if you've been hit by a &quot;fake&quot; AE.<br />
<br />
Taking off a piece of hp gear, and replacing it, will refresh the client and show your true hps if you've been hit by a &quot;fake&quot; AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Took out about 8 named in NToV tonite and didn't notice any trouble hiding from AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;if the client thinks you are at -11 hp, you die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even with Verant/SOE its hard for me to believe that HPs on the client are determining wether or not you die. Not that I know how but it seems like it would make it VERY easy to make hack that continiously manipulated your HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">NToV dragons use a direct damage AE with no lasting effect.  This bug (hopefully its not a feature) only seems to effect DoT AE's.  Hopefully this is fixed soon because it is really annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Took out Roy last night and was the same as normal, thankfully!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think what he means is that both the client and the server are in the know when you go below 0 hp.  So for example, if you are lagged and the client thinks you went under 0, it will kill you.  But the server also keeps that info, and it prefers to tell the client that you are now under 0.  So you can't hack it to make your health stay up, because the server will keep updating it until you are indeed dead, but the client check is a &quot;safety check&quot;, which also means that it may kill you, then the server will send a message saying you're at 20% health, and the client will say &quot;sorry, I already killed him&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Goodo, we had a confusing as hell cursed run last night and most of our clerics died from the aoe despite being on the other side of a wall, most annoying =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hope this is fixed soon. I could not bear to fight Aary with this mess going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Teaches those clerics bots and melees to go afk :D<br />
<br />
Even after we figured out how to refresh the client side, people STILL died from fake AEs. Busted!</div></div><hr />

Goodo, we had a confusing as hell cursed run last night and most of our clerics died from the aoe despite being on the other side of a wall, most annoying =) <br />
<br />
We had that problem as well :(<br />
<br />
Kinda disconcerting to go hide from Cursed's AE and see a big pile of DEAD clerics lying there...<br />
<br />
A few &quot;/gu W.T.F.???&quot; later we managed to battle rez and carry on.<br />
<br />
Towards the end I got hit by the AE from behind the wall and Torpor wasn't healing me for some weird reason and I was too LoM to cast a normal heal = dead shaman.<br />
<br />
I hope they fix this sh1t sometime.<br />
<br />
Made for a DAMN fun fight though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Have done aary recently. Basically even &quot;safe&quot; around the corner your client thinks you are being hit by the ae and constantly shows you as having no mana till it fades or you cast a spell. Irritating, but not that big a deal. Kinda fun watching mana bar go up to 90 then down to 0 then up to 90 again as you cast heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Karelan the Mana drain part of Aary has always been like that you just needed a clicky.<br />
<br />
with last patches they screwed it up wiht Hp drains, aka DoTs.  our guild wiped to cursed last night because we where unaware of the screw up and our clerics all fellover dead.  Even if they tried to heal themselves it didnt work.<br />
<br />
If you canni your HP goes back.  I was at 500hp and needed mana fo a heal so i canni4ed and poped from 500 hp to 5k because my HP got refreshed.  Hitting a clicky, such as 8th ring seemed to update the HP.  as Boinshar said i would assume deequiping and reequiping an HP item would have the same effect.<br />
<br />
I spoke to a GM after our cursed encounter and he wanted to watch it however we did not get a chance o try cursed again, i even tried to get him to spawn cursed for us.  to bad he didnt :p<br />
<br />
but yeah if you are doing any fight with an AE dot need all your people to have clickys ready to refresh the HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmm, assumed hps ones were like that too. could swear I saw the same behavior from acid jet in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We did Arch Lich last night and had no problems at all with the ae.  All our clerics were full health and everyone survived except an overambitious Wizzie towards the end, the MT and a ranger to enrage (was kinda laggy).  My Q's were healing my group just fine although every 3 minutes I RC'd to give them a brief respite from the curse.  No changes I noticed.</div></div><hr />
