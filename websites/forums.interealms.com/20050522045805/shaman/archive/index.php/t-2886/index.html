<br />
If you haven't already, I would strongly suggest checking it out on Test.<br />
<br />
You have to add the line &quot;NewUI=TRUE&quot; somewhere in your eqclient.ini after downloading the Test patch or you won't see the new interface (NOTE:  You must remove that line before going back to a production server).<br />
<br />
Anyway, words cannot even begin to describe how cool the new interface is.  It is versatile yet remains extremely user-friendly, which, IMO, is the key to a successful GUI.<br />
<br />
Can't wait till this goes live! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the GUI looks really really nice, but you need a high end pc to run it or alot of ram, of which i have neither anymore since my pc blew up. i get about 1frame per minute with inv. or spellbook open with a 450 k62 and 164mb ram. so i wont be runnin the new GUI, hell, i can barely run EQ as it is :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well cheer Verant for doing something useful again but please dont force it on the people that cant afford to upgrade all their comps to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, its nice cept you dont have to delete the file after you leave test, i played test/quell last night on and off and just kept the line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There will be computer upgrades needed because of the new UI. I'm rather certain of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmmm, can't imagine the new GUI being any more demanding on your system than Luclin.  I was able to run it just fine (then again, I have an AMD 1600+ with 700 MB RAM), but we shall see :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tried it, and it look/feel very good. Smart thing to do, as the interface was making eq look like an old game - especially when you create new characters etc.<br />
<br />
My pc did not seem any slower, but I did not try in any raidlike conditions (1gig athlon, 512mb ram, gforce2).</div></div><hr />

The glass is half empty?<br />
<br />
I took a look around on test, and noticed no worse performance than on a live server. In fact, I had to switch the resolution up 1 step to fit all the windows, and still ran smooth. this is a non-uber 1ghz athlon with 384 or so megs ram and a crappy 64meg ati card which blows chunks compared to other 64meg cards.<br />
<br />
I don't think you'll need computer upgrades if it's fitting the luclin minimum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok so can some one tell me were to put &quot;NewUI=TRUE&quot;  thnx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">snt_asher,<br />
You can put it anywhere in the eqclient.ini file.  I put mine in as the very first line, just in case, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy when you have a 1ghz machine. I cant play in Luclin most of the time, because MY &quot;non-uber&quot; P2 350, 320ram, 16mb TNT plays up.<br />
<br />
However, i can play fine in old world/kunark/velious. But if the new UI is geared with the Luclin minimum in mind, that will make the REST of the game a lot less playable.<br />
<br />
And i dont believe its been officially mentioned whether the NewUI switch will stay when it goes live. Only details ive heard at all is that the old UI *will* be replaced, completely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, we will hold off progress on all games until you get your machine into this decade. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As the owner of a flava explosion 1.5 ghz with a gig of ram and the latest in video cards, I certainly never mind seeing someone update their product requirements. Unfortunately, I've yet to see VI really program to take advantage of their bulky requirements. When I upgraded from a gForce MX to a gForce 4 and from 512 ram to a gig, I saw zero improvement except in zoning times. On the other hand, I can now have seven Lukes taking on two Desanns and five Tavions in Jedi Knight 2 with no hiccups. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Something I should have added to the original post:<br />
<br />
After you go back to a production server from Test (and back to the original GUI), you will have to reset all your user-defined settings (like text colors, window positions, AutoRun setting, etc.)<br />
<br />
Sorry this is a bit late, but I just found out about it yesterday myself.<br />
So for those that have yet to try this, you might want to save your original eqclient.ini file as something else and then revert back to it after you are done checking out the changes on Test.</div></div><hr />
