<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Georgina Ofthejungle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok. I have been reading post after post of things that we do NOT like about the Shaman class we so all love dearly. I have yet to peruse over a post about what people LIKE about their Shaman. <br />
<br />
I have seen that people have said that the Dev's think that we're all whiners, but lets show them WHY They should listen to us! And what loosing our beloved class means to us! NO flames please, no negative comments. I just want to see what people Like/Love about the class that we think is the best Class on the servers!<br />
<br />
I will go first.<br />
<br />
1. I like the fact that when I can't find a group, or just when I want to be alone with a friend or two, and we do not have a healer class.. I can take over a few heals.<br />
<br />
2. Canni is my friend! I have tried playing another class that doesn't have a mana regen (Cleric, Enchanter) at a low level and I found myself sitting on my hands trying not to chew my nails off waiting :D &lt;3 to Canni!<br />
<br />
3. Shrinking my group to get in small places that nobody else can go is a great thing! <br />
<br />
4. It makes me feel good to know that I can make SoW potions and help the races who can't cast it on themselves. <br />
<br />
5. I can make people drink funny looking drinks and turn them into crazy looking races. I'm the one laughing, because I know that the smell of Froglok blood and Wormwood smells awful.. and it probably tastes like Ogre Socks! ROTFL!<br />
<br />
Alright everyone! Lets show everyone how much Shammy love really means to us!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now thats what i call to enjoy the SMALL  things in life.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Seriously, i love my class, atleast when i play in older expansions. I can still do a lot of stuff just because im a shaman. My paladin friend says im really handy to have around (neither of us play in god though).<br />
<br />
So i REALLY hope SOE stops segregating us for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mojarda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Edit: *** happened to my post?  LOL.  I wrote up a long one only to see it quoting some other random post. &lt;boggle&gt;. I'll try this again.<br />
<br />
Second attempt:<br />
<br />
I like the fact that I can dungeon crawl to most Pre-PoP content and solo it better than any class I know.<br />
<br />
For example, I went to Seb a few weeks ago.  Got into the crypt via the VP technique and camped the names in the crypt for a few days.  I walked out with 3 JBB's, a journeyman's stick, the iksar club (forget the name ATM), a box of nil space, a hierophant cloak, several spells, and a few other drops.  I actually had the cloak drop 4 times and had to have some rogue friends come down to loot them as well as some of the other lore items.  They were very appreciative of the gifts. <br />
<br />
Now, I'm a casual raider and not elemental yet.  Most of my friends are in the same boat.  None of them could even contemplate doing that.  Either they can't get in there or if they could (the rogues), they couldn't kill the names as they would run and aggro the royal guardians.  Thier admiration for those types of solo crawls make me proud to be a shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bet thats only because you confuse the mobs silly by wearing a Scaled Avatar's Hauberk on your legs! (wierd authentic Magelo).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am weary of saying the things that I like about playing a shaman due to the fact that any minor thing could be used by Brenlo or Rytan to hold up as an example of why we are fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hell, the entire reason we're all rattling the cage and ranting about what's wrong is BECAUSE we like the class we're playing, and don't want to see it in the state it's in. Seriously, if any of us didn't like our Shaman, we'd shrug and roll up a cleric and say nothing, wouldn't we?<br />
<br />
And I like to charm Skunks and buff the hell out of them in Butcherblock. Hand 'em Mage belt and fists, too, we call them Twinky Stinky.</div></div><hr />

2. Epic. Top three vis-a-vis cool factor.<br />
<br />
3. Chicks. Barbarian Shaman get all the chicks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hyena Shaman - you're deliciously mean.<br />
<br />
I love that my shaman can take a disaster and turn it into a victory AND that this usually requires quick wits and my taking a significant beating.<br />
<br />
I love how happy my shaman can make her melee (and pet) friends.  &quot;I'm a crit machine!&quot;  &quot;I've never had all my physical stats maxed before...&quot;<br />
<br />
I wish the first hadn't been removed with recent content, and that all my friends maxed their stats with gear.  *pttttbth*  At least Jebeker still wants Diaku.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like picking up any random 5 LFGs 58-65 and pulling them through an easy65 / hard60 LDoN, with me FAing, slowing, healing, pulling, and often hasting. I love having them ask &quot;who's gonna heal/pull/slow/haste&quot; when we start, and I love it even more when they ask &quot;c'mon, can't you stay for another&quot; when we finish. I love taking 58-62 guildies on a hard 60 and watching them /cheer when they win a +6 Dex or +6 MR aug.<br />
<br />
Elementals? GoD? Maybe, after I milk LDoN for all it's worth... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I just like being a troll wit da pointy stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i love:<br />
Q.<br />
Canni.<br />
Slow (just needs to be not so resistable....)<br />
FA (only cause i can max out how long it lasts so i dont have to cast it every 6.5 mins ish...and rogs &lt;3 me for it :p )<br />
The fact that I can keep a whole group alive in a reg LDoN with only Q and slow...then add a lil DPS for good measure.<br />
I love it when i try to start an LDoN group and i get asked 'is there a shaman, cause if not then no' :)<br />
I love my shaman....just wish SOE did too :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Georgina Ofthejungle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Woot! This thread is doing great! So...<br />
<br />
/bump!!<br />
<br />
Keep it comin' guys! This is awesome!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sumdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I love being the eye of the storm when situations turn bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I love...<br />
*Q. Simply awesome.<br />
*FA makes my boxed melee characters happy.<br />
*As many have said, taking a seemingly impossible situation and turning it into a win. I can think of how many LDoN pulls of 9 or more mobs that we lived through.<br />
*Even though our heals aren't the best, I can play so many roles in a group. Hell I've even Tanked for a few Ldons. I've played main healer, cc, dd, puller, just about anything you could ask for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It became very less plausable later on, but I do remember at level 51, when I was in a normal LDoN, when there was an add, and I slowed the both the main and add, and the add ran and started hitting me, and the druid was like<br />
<br />
&quot;Look out, MOB on yoU!!!! %T Rooted, back up, BACK UP, QUICK!!!&quot;  And my health was still bobbing between 99 and 100 percent and i was like um.... chill out... it's turgur'd....<br />
<br />
Silly druid :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">-I like that I am the last one running OOM.<br />
-I can keep the group going when the cleric dies.<br />
-That my little heals still can save the MT when the CH hit him too late.<br />
-That I can offtank (possibly slowed) adds if necessary.<br />
-That I can solo many mobs that summon and that other classes wont try.<br />
-That I can be the MT for groups of youngsters in Tier1 (or PoV) until they find a real tank.<br />
-That I can duo with every other class...  rogues too.<br />
and<br />
-That if I dont feel like logging on and the guild dont have any shaman online they can still raid and I dont feel bad for them.(sorry I had to add this)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I like that I walk through 4-year old content like it's nothing.<br />
I like that in grouping in lower-tier PoP content, I can heal if there's no cleric around.<br />
I like that my friends call me a one-man contingency plan. (I may not add a whole lot of dps, but when the fit hits the shan, as long as I don't die, we live, as long as it's not too many mobs at once...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i like that i'm *always* between 40% and 80% mana--i have been oom one time in about a month not counting after rez.<br />
<br />
right there with druids in terms of PL'ing. awesome.<br />
<br />
yesterday i was in an ldon with four people from the uber guild on my server, and after the first couple rooms, the monk got smart and rather than bothering to split pulls, ran into rooms and pulled the entire room. why's that? because they had a slick 65 sham with that neat-o shammy only targetted AOE slow--Tigir's. normal difficulty, done in under 30 mins every time while maintaining rapid fire banter all along. cake.<br />
<br />
i love being main heal and only using Q...PoV, BoT, crawls, etc.<br />
<br />
raiding Grummus. can't be slowed, so shammy useless, right? psh. load disinfecting aura, keep quiesence, tnarg's, and M o' Kragg loaded--heal the healers, keep everyone clean, jump into heal chain as necessary if casters go down somehow. got aa? hit grummus with spirit call as soon as assist called, send in the pet you've had sitting with /hold, if that one goes down, drop the one you had suspended (with full buffs and gear!) and send it in...call of the ancients...radiant cure...oh..and who did the initial Malos to help the nukers out? :) and then there are the buffs you threw on everyone at the beginning...not to mention FA for main tank. so much to do...<br />
<br />
the other day i'm messing around solo in the Deep...have broken my way around a couple corners, and i'm piddling around for aa and half-assing camps there. i start seeing combat scroll while i'm on canni and between pulls...group comes around the corner--four people. one says &quot;group wipe?&quot; i say &quot;see any corpses?&quot; /smile breaking knots of five mobs at a time is a kick in the butt.<br />
<br />
could go on and on, but i'm gonna go log on and get some more aa :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I like VP. I think it might just be the COOLEST AA in the game.<br />
<br />
I like being able to solo in places a Necro can only drool about.<br />
<br />
I like being able to do an LDoN normal with 5 other shaman and actually do it faster than many other groups I have been in. <br />
<br />
I like running around slowing and parking and Qing and DOTing like crazy when you get a 7 pull in LDoN and no chanter, then, after the fight, everyone is AMAZED that we won, and I just smile. <br />
<br />
I like my mace. I like the fact that a Troll weilding a spiked mace riding a Lizard is so &quot;in character&quot;. High Elfs and other pastys (including barbs, heh) should not be allowed to buy Drogmas. <br />
<br />
I like being a troll. I like being a shaman.</div></div><hr />
