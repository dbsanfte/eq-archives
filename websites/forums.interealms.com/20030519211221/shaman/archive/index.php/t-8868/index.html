<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Working on just wrapping up ally. Question is regarding the undead dragon sinew...we have had a lot of these drop back when we did Trak quite a bit. I understand this also drops off of Juggs. <br />
<br />
Is it extremely rare or can you expect to see one after a few hours of farming them?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We picked up two on a Trak run off Juggs, so I would guess you would see at least one in an evening of camping. More people are willing to go down there now too since the crown for the wood elf quest drops off reets.<br />

But can anyone give some tips how to get druzzila? I heard shes perma camped so the less people i need the better, that i can get her after a patch or so, like the angry goblin. :)<br />
