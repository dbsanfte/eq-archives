<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shadow-wolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was fighting in PoD against the spiders last night and chanter got agro and was getting thumped.  I root the mob, allowing the chanter to move away, and forcing the mob to switch to nearest target.  Someone else in the group suggested this is a bad way to control agro since it messes up taunt a bit, making agro bounce around depending on who is closest.  Also was saying that monks and rogues need to get in reasonably close to do their damage and thus it stuffs them up too.  So should I use root to pull a mob off a caster or not?  I'm aware that tangling weeds/flame lick is a good agro generator, but root just seems the fastest way to switch agro away from someone.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tis a situation for everything.  As for aggro control the tank should be as close to the mob as possible while others are at extreme melee range.  The only bad thing about our root is the damage component, since it will break mez if it landed a tick before.<br />
<br />
But aye, both paladins/rangers I have been grouping with in PoD have been using root as crowd control, but then we werent blessed with an enchanter.  If the enchanter is having a difficult time mez adds, then root can be everyone's friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">root works great on having the mob switch attention to someone else.  I use it alot while tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nift Trailhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well there is no reason the tank can not move in closer than the monk and rouge.  I have found making a hotkey with root that says<br />
&quot;Hey Tank the Mob is rooted hug it please so it likes only you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I try to only use it when I notice the mob bouncing due to the warrior trying to stay at max distance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shadow-wolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a hotkey that says &quot;%T rooted (proximity agro)&quot; so people know when i've done it, and I never root when chanter is mezzing, i just throw a snare on the mezzed mobs and switch back to main mob.  just wanted to check if the practice of rooting mobs was frowned on, due to changes in agro rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Silvanoshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Root is a great friend, especially in PoP where the new mobs hit harder and love killing the chanters.  Ive saved my groups more than once with root.  Ive even been the ghetto chanter in a few groups.  %t is GHETTO MEZZED!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Firion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the point here that several people are trying to make is, root for aggro control is great in the right time and place, as long as everyone else in the group knows when the root is on and when it comes off.  Communication, as usual, is key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so the question is why didn't the MA get closest? <br />
<br />
Also remember a rooted mob will fight to the end so many folks don't like this.</div></div><hr />

true, but i was using my lowest lvl root, which lasts 30s? at most, usually breaks sooner, being lvl 54 and all, the mobs are often even or higher.  Seems to give enough time for MT to regain agro but not so long that mob is rooted at low health, although on this occasion, from memory the spiders in PoD C-healed themselves repeatedly, and fought to the end anyway i think, the unstunnable ones, particularly annoying.   On a side note, a mob fighting to the end is probably preferable to a dead chanter. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As long as you tell people what yer doing, it's fine.  &quot;%t rooted&quot; is plenty of info.  <br />
<br />
If people get up in your face about it, let the adds tear around a few turns.  Once the chanter gets shredded and the rogue is taking hits, they'll be begging you to use root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In POV I ALWAYS root the mobs the chanter tries to control. (thx thx Earthen roots for no damage component )<br />
That way, even in case of a resist, the chanter has a good chance to survive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Otogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had never grouped much until recently and have a few questions about using root for crowd control.  I've been hanging out in Karnor's lately - grouping makes EQ much more fun - especially after X levels of looking at X animal's a**. :-)<br />
<br />
I know root breaks mez, but is a mob unmezzable after it is rooted?<br />
<br />
When the puller brings 3+ mobs into camp what tactics do you employ to root the adds?  I imagine you dont want to root the mob that the puller/MT has targeted, since root might break immediately due to melee damage.  Also, sometimes its a pain to click target the adds when they are all piled up on the puller/MT...  any tips for making this easier?  Currently I /assist the puller on the way in to check his target and if there are other mobs in tow I try to click target an add to root it before he gets back to camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pleides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not sure about the Planes but in KC I always use snare to pull. Any adds I root then snare... The adds get attacked (melee) when root has broken.For some reason they are meaner if you toe to toe with root on and wont turn when at low hp.I always explain this to any groups..Would be interested if anyone else has found this in any other zone/s. <br />

our roots do damage, hence the reason they break mez, so i primarily use root for crowd control when there is no enchanter, or the enchanter needs the mob off him/her NOW.  Root does not make a mob unmezzable since it does not do damage over time.  I don't believe melee damage can break root, but i tend to avoid rooting the main mob if at all possible, since it makes agro ping around (if the warrior isn't right on the ball) and can be somewhat annoying.  My technique for crowd control without a chanter is to ensnare an add as it comes in, this generates enough agro usually, for me to kite it away into a corner or something and root it there.  If there's a chanter, i'll simply ensnare each mezzed mob, this will give the chanter a little more time to remez if mez is broken for some reason, and sometimes (depending on what else the chanter has cast on it) the mob will agro on me instead of the chanter when mez breaks, which is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Maian62</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It sounded to me like the original question was something like - if the main tank can't keep the main mob off the chanter, should I root it even though the proximity aggro  will override the hate list ordering?<br />
<br />
In my opinion, quickly grabbing aggro from the chanter and then restoring it to the main tank is one of the things we do best.  Personally I almost never use roots on the main mob, usually only when peeling adds.  If the main tank can't do their job with aggro and the chanter is taking hits, I will start mashing taunt/disarm while hitting and throw in a snare and/or DoT if I haven't landed one already, until it turns on me, then back off and revert to normal melee while the main tank gets aggro back.  I figure I can take a few more hits than the chanter.  In fact I figure its my job to die if necessary to save the chanter anyway.  If there is room I will kite it around and let them all backstab it, easy way to kill stuff.<br />
With adds, the difference is that  once I get aggro I lead them out of melee range if poss then root, whether the chanter is mezzing or not.  My chanters usually don't mind remezzing a rooted mob if  necessary.  And yes always good to snare the mezzed ones if poss.  If you do end up rooting the main mob just a message letting the others know should be enough to enable them to adjust .  Or else nuke it until it breaks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BelzarQuickfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the 63 root has no damage.  In fact, I root any adds i get (if i ever do get any from harmo pull).  Even with enchanters in the group normally they ask that i root in pov, hoh.  Just got into CoD so not sure how well mez works there yet but not much room to root stuff.  <br />
<br />
The 63 root owns all.  If you dont have it, get it.  On my server (povar) you can now buy them for about 10-15k.  It has no damage on it and is FAR superior to our 60 root.<br />
<br />
Chanters are nuke fiends in my groups hehe<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.  In PoN, PoD I'd say let the chanter mez cause your root will break his mez and your root isn't all that great.</div></div><hr />

tell me about it, my crapola root breaks after about 1s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">root is your best friend when no chanter in group, and it happens a lot.<br />
<br />
i often do ranger (me) + druid (my alt) + shaman + random damage class<br />
in PoN for example, yesterday, i had a pull with 2 adds.<br />
snare, root, snare root, 2 adds parked.<br />
snare + flame lick on the 3rd and killing it, while refreshing roots on the parked ones (which get slowed by the shammy just in case roots break too early).<br />
<br />
who need clerics and encs ? :p :p :p<br />
they are sure very confortable to group with, but i prefer risky groups where all classes do damage... faster kills, better xp ;)</div></div><hr />
