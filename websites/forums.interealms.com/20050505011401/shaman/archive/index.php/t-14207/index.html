On the plus side, EQ has probably prepared you well for parenthood, at least in the sleepless nights department.</div></div><hr />

It's a tremendous thing.  I have loved every minute of it, even when she got very sick for a very long time.  She's doing great now, and it's awesome watching her horizons expand so fast.  <br />

I have 2 boys, ages 4 and 7.  The oldest just started playing EQ with Mom, Dad, and assorted adopted aunts and uncles, while the youngest has taken over big brother's place at helping Mommy with fishing and various tradeskills. :)<br />

Hehe, yeah...  My 5 year old saw me bash soooo many Gnolls in BB that he walks around contantly going &quot;whooowaah... whooowaah&quot;.  He's even got the casting movements down as well.  My wife gets a little annoyed when he's out on the field during T-ball games casting....</div></div><hr />

Remember to cherish those first couple months.  Once they get vocal and mobile, it's a whole new ballgame :)</div></div><hr />

My 16 year old boy... tries to steal my playtime... for his ogre... my 13 year old steals it for his Iksar... my 13 year old girls steals me for WaterPolo and my one year old Named Conan... loves to watch his dad play....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Congrats!!!!<br />
<br />
My daughter is three, and she has grown up watching Mommy and Daddy play EQ.  My guildmates often kill time casting spells or changing forms in front of me to entertain her.  My wife and I are very casual players...4 years and still level 53.<br />
<br />
  At three EQ is way over her head, but she is an avid Toon Town player.  She can't read, but she understands how to defeat cogs(Mobs in Toon Town).  For those of you whose children are interested in EQ Toon Town is a lot of fun for them.  My wife and I occasionally play that rather than EQ....You can log in and IMMEDIATELY start to get something accomplished.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enough Ranting.....Congrats once again.</div></div><hr />
