<br />
The augments will be tagged class 1 to 18 (so far anyway). Class 1, the lowest end augs, will cost 1 pp. Class 18, the highest end will cost the 4k. The prices are affected by charisma, so mine were a bit lower than the ones in your logs.<br />
<br />
The highest type of aug I had to test was a 70 hp LDoN raid aug which was class 15 (1500pp for me at 250 cha), The solid and radiant coals of prowess were class 13, and 1k (at 250 cha) to re-use.<br />

&quot;please.. consider NOT using meldstones as a component..&quot;<br />
<br />
Where did this come from? Why would we use an armor quest component from Gates on augments from LDoN? This is as left-field as I've ever seen! <br />
<br />
A</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That is actually lower than I thought it would be for higher level augments.<br />
<br />
Still, good to see it is platinum based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">to give us a scale, anyone know what class the generic +6 stat augs are? I know they arent lowest end, but they arent exactly time loot either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm no Alchemy master, but insofar as throwing the Shaman a bone, they could introduce 18 Augment removers, ranging in scale from 5-200 or so (5-250), to help flesh out the holes in the range.<br />
<br />
Or does that make too much sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I heard a good guesstimate would be about 1 pp per adventure point cost. Do some simple math to get the values of higher dropped augs. 40 pp LDON merchant = 1150 pp to remove, 70 hp = 1600, 30/30 = 1500, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">4k to remove an augment seems expensive.<br />

Where did this info come from? Linky please!</div></div><hr />

<br />

Which augment? Is 1200 too expensive for most of the current 1150 adventure point augs? <br />
<br />
I think this is MORE than reasonable, in fact, I think this is DIRT CHEAP. I was expecting to pay over 5K to move a 40 hp type 7. I am STILL hopeful they will implement some form of refund system for both armor and augs. Eventually, I will be in all Type 8 gear, since 90% of Gates is Type 8 and I expect most of OoW to be type 8 as well (not to mention Time, which is already type 8, will be much more accessible once players reach level 70).<br />
<br />
I am encouraged by this. There wont be any real need to &quot;grind pp&quot; out just to move an aug. Heck, win a couple drops from LDoN normals and sell em off, you will have enough to move half a dozen augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd gladly spend 2pp per 1ap aug cost to safely remove a purchased aug for reuse. <br />
<br />
In this scenario, I would have no reservations about putting a purchased 40 hp aug7 on my Skyshrine pants, and later, when I get Ornate pants (ha), I can reuse it. Certainly easier to part with 2300pp than grind another 1150ap, no?<br />
<br />
I'd be willing to go 5pp per 1ap, even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Seems a bit expensive to me, but then again, i'm generally broke like a bad joke.  Betcha they put this guy out in the middle of the boonies just to buy augment distillers... at several Kpp, some folks are gunna be moving rather... Slow.  And I Imagine that that 100hp aug from GoD.. i wanna say in txevu or tacvi.. will be a class 18.. or higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seremont</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So,  you can reuse them after removal! That's great! Well worth it for many augs!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the great info!<br />
<br />
Seremont</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Really glad they've put this in. But does anyone know of non-ldon gear that has type 3 slots? If there isnt an option for reusing type 3 augs i might end up skipping my cycle of blackmire/aug to buy type 7 augs that i can reuse when better items become available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can you sell back the augment for points?  Like convert a type 7 40hp augment to a type 8? I know you can sell back unused augments to some NPC.  Will the &quot;dissolved&quot; augments be the exact same as the one you originally purchased?  I have two more pieces of EP armor I'm replacing with Qvic armor and I don't feel like doing 23 more adventures to augment two new pieces.  Otherwise I'll get lazy and steal some 90/100hp augments away from tank classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If it seems expensive to you, you probably won't have any augs that high in class anyway.   4k to reuse an aug like this: <br />
<br />
Kelekdrix's Sandstone of Fortitude <br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP AUGMENTATION<br />
Augmentation type: 8<br />
Slot: HEAD FACE EAR NECK SHOULDERS ARMS BACK WRIST RANGE HANDS PRIMARY SECONDARY FINGER CHEST LEGS FEET WAIST<br />
HP: +100<br />
Required level of 65.<br />
WT: 0.0 Size: TINY<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL <br />
<br />
is worth it easily.  And thats assuming that is a class 18 aug (probably will be)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sounds reasonable to me.<br />
<br />
The 4k seems to be only for the absolute high-end, so Joe_average_shaman will probably end up with 1k for his best augments - that's OK.<br />
<br />
As a second thought with a bit of planning you should be able to avoid juggling around augments on a daily basis  ;) . With the speed i update my gear (rather slow) i guess, i will have to use this max. once per month if even so often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can only see one problem with this, how do we know which distiller is for which augment? <br />
It seems there are far too many choices, and unless they sell back for the same price, any mistakes will be very costly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Cheaper than I thought.  I heard originally it was going to be 1pp for the ones kids get and 10k for the Time level augs.  I would definitely be willing to fork over a few thousand to move +6 or +7 WIS and STA stat augs and any AC/HP/mana ones.  Luckily I put focus augs on stuff that I will keep for little bit.<br />
<br />
Sort of confused as to the various types but hopefully there will be an easy way for us figure it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think this is a very &quot;cheap&quot; solution.  Every 65 can easily farm 500 pp / h in pure cash loot, so it's less then 3 h to reuse your augment that cost you 12 h min (more likely over 20) to get.<br />
What realy gripes is that they are removing the augment trade in guy.  I have some aug 7 left that I would realy like to move to 8, doesn't look like that's happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last I heard was they are &quot;temporarily&quot; removing him until they can determine how to handle the turn ins.  Something like getting back 50% of the points you spent on an aug.  So if you want to give back that Type 7 40 HP aug you've used for 6 months, you'll only get half of what you paid for it.   That sounds fair to me, so I can turn in 2 of my Type 7 40 HP augs and get back 1 Type 8 40 HP aug.<br />
<br />
Not sure how they would handle the difference between &quot;used&quot; and &quot;new but oops, wrong item I didn't want this&quot;, I guess they could have used augs be returned as a different item number but it would look the same in name, stats, etc.</div></div><hr />

Never been able to sell back LDoN armor :(<br />

Less that 75% return on Augs is bs!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">last I heard about this, there was going to be some sort of menu to bring up, kinda like the Tribute Guys in your hometown, that you click on and then click on a piece of your armor and it will give you the choice of what augment on any piece of armor you want to remove and how much it will cost you overall.  Don't quote me on this, it may have been just a rumor, but I think this is what they have done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Personally this seems crazy that we should be expected to pay to remove an Aug from 1 piece of equipment to put it into another 1.We've already payed for the aug with pts so why should we then pay again in pp.<br />
Now if we could remove Augs then trade them in for AP then i would have no problem with this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">oh.. also.. they are reported to be offering a sellback for all LDoN items purchased that let's you give the item for a partial refund of the adventure point cost.  It's currently set at around 50%.. but that could also change before it's been released.  This should help answer some of your questions you may have had.. especially you glori :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">even if it is expensive... this is and will be a very useful tool for people who augmented things then later regret it, it will be much more worth spending the plat than doing a bunch of adventures over.</div></div><hr />

Its not just that Gum. I am POSITIVE that OoW will introduce a higher armor line, but that Foci 4 will work up to lvl 70 spells. Now people wont have to re-buy the same exact augs when they choose to go for the new top-end armor. Also, I am betting we see a 1450 or 1950 line of augs with 60 hps, or 30/30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">So as it stands can you get a refund for returning a type 7 40hp aug and if you can is it 50% or full?<br />
<br />
I have heard so many different answers from so many different people...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">better not be 50% ill be mad  :(  i did so many damm ez's for a 40 aug  when the gnome let you turn them in for full points ... bull****</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I have heard varying stories too, but the most believable is:<br />
<br />
Turn in for point refund = 50% (augs and armor)<br />
Aug removal = 1pp per 1ap cost<br />
Exchange Type 7 for same 8 = no charge, staught swapable, you get an &quot;option&quot; to convert the 7 to an 8.</div></div><hr />
