<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Justice is solo capable, just need to work on your pulling strategies (found a lovely area where if you can single the zone in to CT without zoning, you can exp all night long).   Mobs are hitting high for  max, but the average is surprisingly low.  So if you do solo, make sure you stay over half health or you may get backsided by a lucky tripple (2 hits and kick....  still haven't tried to solo any quaders in PoP, learned my lesson in Seru)<br />
<br />
<br />
  Guild raid in PoJ took us to Mauvin, a flag giver for the trials, and we aggro'd the guardian there, whit con, hit up to 450.  I tanked him solo with no DoTs up, only torpor and Kragg (chloro was down so I could cast a buff) and no haste or weapon on pet.   Guild killed 3 mobs while I held him off and all the healers camped while the melee wondered if they should jump in or not.  I was doing wonderfully (had him down to 80 percent and still hadn't noticed much mana loss) when that lucky tripple hit, followed by an interrupt of Torpor and long story short, I was blending in 10 minutes later at the graveyard.  With Chloro, more buffs and a properly geared pet, I could have probably worked him down to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Huksh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Soloed a bit in the Plane of Nightmare today. There is a really nice spot to the right of the graveyard along the wall. Two trees spawn there pretty quickly with a blood raven close by as well. <br />
It should be right by the plateu where Dreyil(sp) the Wicked is.<br />
<br />
Thing is PON mobs hit very hard but I am only 56 so not sure if you could straight up tank them with torpor and better gear. I just rooted them, bane, JBB until dead. Anyway you have quite a bit of room to use to root/rot or fight without worry of adds and it is very close to the port out if you need to run. <br />
<br />
I was getting 1/3 of a blue per kill at 56 and it took me about 3-4 minutes each. I have a horse, JBB, iksar regen bp, no epic, no KEI on at the time so I imagine you could kill them a lot faster. Once you clear those 3 spots there are a bunch of mobs in the general vicinity that you can get and pull to there. Nothing I have seen has summoned yet and none of the trees or ravens cast spells.<br />
<br />
I would stay clear of the hobgoblins further down the wall. They hit hard, run fast and some are casters.<br />
<br />
Loot wise no plat, but I have seen a necro focus 4 item drop there and also nightmare wood staves for the new bows. Plus various unknown quest items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i like plane of disease for soloing...rats hit for 250 ish....skeeter thins hit for a lil over 300....and those spiders cast ebolt...ingite blood and a few other things aswell as hit for 285 :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Had suprisingly good luck soloing PoD at 53.. Root/rot, all the way. Unfortunately, they just hit too hard for me to go IN TEH FACE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So far have found solo ability in all planes.   Justice is the easiest, just watch the rats.   Disease ranks second in line since things seem to die so easy (I typically don't DoT much anyway so not sure on resist rates) and there are so many.   Nightmare rocks because we can go places most people won't be at (Way past the river are nice spots on wall, go down the river and over the water to a wooden platform and you can pull a ton of mobs with rarely anyone passing in view, stick to the waterfall side and you can fight some druid froggie-thingies) and I would rank Innovation as the hardest of them amazingly due to the fact you have 2 choices of direction, everyone loves to train to the zoneout/in all the time, and so far I haven't been able to actually REACH somewhere with mobs spawning far enough apart you don't have to work at splitting them and breaking camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If you don't mind double pulls, or keeping one rooted while you beat another, Innovation rocks (barring trains).   Just if you see an ancient, turn around and head back to zone-on.<br />
<br />
   If you are patient enough to clear a million damn rats, or invis between fights and skip use of pet, Justice is the plane of choice.   When a tank friend shows up head to the Flag hall and do enforcers/punishers for a while (don't advise them solo since enforces rampage a ton (had to stop and heal dogdog once, annoying) and the punishers Flurry like mad at times (didn't even try them solo, still remember when I tried a quadder in Seru).  With monk sham duo, was a piece of cake doing hallway.<br />
<br />
  If you like to have millions of pulls to chose from, and sit in 3rd person views all the time watching for adds, Disease is the way to go, move onto a hill and let the pulls come to you.   Quite hectic and enjoyable to have a couple mobs rooted around you rotting on epic while pet sweeps around killing them off.   Gate when you have too many to feel safe though, don't train the zone please.<br />
<br />
  And if you want to see some wierd creature models and have some hellacious fights, go beyond the waterfall in Nightmare.   If you want to impress the socks off me, take on the Hobgoblins (really don't think we can solo them).   If you want a real easy job of soloing, do the trees and ravens near wall/zonein of Nightmare (Malosini only really useful on Ravens, Malo not needed at all)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Failbhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The fungus beasts in the Cave in PoV are excellent for solo'ing. They are easily rootable, do not run fast, and are easily slowable. At 61, it takes me 6-8 minutes to kill one but I am getting just a bit over 2 full blue AA's per kill so it is nice fast xp, if you can get a group to let you pull some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lvler Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Innovation is a zone i havent seen mentioned here i can solo easliy in innovation and get 1% exp per kill taking about 3 bubs of maan whic i can canni dance back pretty fast seems to take me about 30min per blue in 61 there.I dont know exactly how other shamans solo but i tank solo and it would probably be alot easier if i had torpor but i dont so i make due with kraggs mending.simple process Pull with slow cast pox + epic +bane then let pet eat while stand toe to toe with mob bracer bracer bracer bracer bracer bracer bracer bracer spirit call root simple. I also regen 55 hps a tick standing so i usually dont have to heal during one of these fights and i can med while pox and pet finish kill. Lvler Donar 61st lvl barbarian shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can you describe the solo spots in PoN better? Or rather, how to get to them without dying?<br />
<br />
My problem is the spider traps that I always seem to hit when I run along the wall towards the river. How do you avoid these when going to the areas beyond the river? 2 or 3 of those spiders are the death of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cudes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">so far anything that hits up to 620 has been soloable for me so far....  bugs in PoStorms have been the hardest as they hit for 619 and summon.  great exp.... great loot too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm a 56 shammy with JBB &amp; horsey , no epic, and was thinking of trying to solo the treants and blood ravens in PoN.  Does anybody with exp think that setting up on the wall before the waterfall is a good place to fight?  Are there a decent number of mobs to choose from or are there too many wanderers close by?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The wall right next to the waterfall is train central.  If you want to solo (and it wont be worth it but still your choice) as you zone in and are facing the wall turn right and follow the fall.  There is a tree that looks like one of the treetrents (camp is called spooky tree on the tribunal).  There are a few pops there and no wander into that camp.  Plus people running through there havent managed to get agro yet so trains are less frequent.<br />
<br />
Much better solo under 60 will be mobs near zone out in PoJ.  2 rats, 2 sentries and a bunch of prisoners.  All should be single pullable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've posted in the hunting forums about PoI grouped in mid50's.<br />
<br />
The zone is also a gold mine at 60, though there are a few dangers you have to be aware of.<br />
<br />
Avoid Archaics.  They are immune to slow.  Do not pull them.  If you get one by mistake, sic dogdog on it, do NO damage, and hopefully you can stay up long enough for pet to aggro so you can escape without training.  If you can't escape, die with pride instead of bringing it to the graveyard zoneout.<br />
<br />
Other than archaics and rapid respawns, there is little danger to an Oracle here that is game created.<br />
<br />
The REAL danger of course are the other players.  Trains to zone are common.  If you can get an idea beforehand which direction the train is coming from, you can usually move to the other side (outside GY) and avoid it entirely as long as the entrance mobs are clear, which they usually are.<br />
<br />
If you see 2 or more groups (of whatever makeup) pulling to the graveyard, you should leave in my opinion.  Most full groups don't stay long before moving along the paths, but if you get a group hugging the graveyard, it is generally because they know they have few skills &amp; will usually end up training you.<br />
<br />
My solo strategy in PoI is broken down into 3 methods:<br />
<br />
1.  Pull to East corner of Graveyard area.  Nothing should add on you there (except for mobs from trains), dogdog can push the robot into the corner while you are tanking.  <br />
<br />
Remember to root the tiny obsolete models at 20%, because they will run away towards the right path &amp; other mobs.  I keep dogdog with me at all times instead of parking him at my pull spot.  This method works extremely well during low zone population times.  As soon as it gets crowded, it is time to move to another method or another zone entirely.  <br />
<br />
This is generally very low risk if you don't persist in staying during busy periods.  I can pull and clear the left path past the factory ramp easily before respawns occur.  If there is another group pulling to graveyard (or about to move out), I ask to split the Tin Soldiers at the factory entrance.  Once these two spawns are broken (can't single pull at 60), you can include them for better exp and possible parchment drops.<br />
<br />
2.  Pull to the factory ramp at the top.  This requires a moment's assistance to get these spawns broken a few minutes apart for respawns, then you can pull to the factory door.  This works extremely well, as you avoid MOST of the trains (people leaving factory may train you, but they usually have more of a clue, and at least give warning, unlike the graveyard trains).  This method has greater risk as you must keep the Tin Soldiers timed well for repops, but the reduced aggravation from GY groups (rangers/druids trying to kite or root/rot) and the /tell focus for my group please is worth it to me.<br />
<br />
3.  This requires the PoI factory flag, which I only recently acquired.  (Thank you again Gloriana!)  Pull to East corner of GY until path to ramp is clear.  Clear the Tin Soldiers at ramp door entrance.  I can take both at once if at full mana/health with raid buffs, but a single slow resist usually means death.  Once inside, you can single pull the 2 tin soldiers on your right into the entrance room (with the gnome).  Proceed down that path and you can single pull 3 more Tin Soldiers.  If you broke the door spawns (outside factory), you can pull them if you have time.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, the 5 Tin Soldier spawns are plenty for me.  By the time I'm done getting mana back from the last Tin Soldier, the first one pops within a minute.  Rinse and repeat for safe, steady exp.  If there is another group at factory entrance, once you clear the first two Tin Soldiers on the right, you can pull to a spot in the hallway to leave the entrance room for the group pulling Clockwork Golems.   The Golems are much better exp, but I can't single them at 60, and haven't tried soloing one yet.  This is the easiest of the 3 methods in my opinion, but it does require the factory flag.<br />
<br />
If you add a single person (ANY class, I duoed w/ an enchanter) here, you can pull clockwork devices or whatever while you wait for Tin Soldier respawns.<br />
<br />
One final note.  Bring lots of room to carry loot.  Archaic circuitry (can drop off any robots) isn't stackable but sells for ~32pp.  Disassembled Servos sell for 80pp.  Multiple other weird broken robot pieces sell for 1-12pp.  Innovative Clockwork Bolts and Gears are valuable to tradeskillers, as are much of the other items used by Tinkers.  You also have the opportunity to get exp items as loot.  Hail the gnome outside zone in the windmill to get a listing of what he wants.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Charms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Can solo the crystaline golem thingos in PoV desert with out too much trouble, using root / rot method. I just stack BoN and EB after malo / slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes PoV Golems are good value.<br />
<br />
Takes maybe 6 or 7 mins to kill one root-rot style and gives 8 percent AA at level 65.<br />
<br />
Pull with Greater Immobalise<br />
Malo, Malosini, Slow, Insidious Decay + maybe Cripple (hate their procs).<br />
Breath of Ulthor + Pox + Plague + Epic<br />
Then Blood of Saryn + Bane of Nife a bunch of times<br />
Re apply Ulthor + Epic<br />
Some more Saryn's and Maybe Nife's.<br />
<br />
Cana 5/Torpor as needed. Whip out Horsie if required.<br />
<br />
Doable with no Aego but OMG if you cana 5 just as root breaks it can get REAL exciting only self-buffed....<br />
<br />
Duo-ing Planarian Larvae in PoV is so-so.<br />
Using those atm to PL my rogue alt a bit.<br />
<br />
Larvae can be tanked by shaman self-buffed.</div></div><hr />
