<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Biizz Buuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw a post saying that crystal caverns was a good spot to go to at 29, but I was wondering if you could kill there at 28?I'm not very twinked, I have 145 wis and 571 ac unbuffed at 27. I don't have many +mana items as well.<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Orc Miners might be good at 28, grouping there is probably better for you. Oracles are much tougher, as they are shaman (not good ones but casters none the less). Orcs all help each other so watch for trains. But the dorfs will act as guards so stay close to the city as SoW will be of no use being its indoors.<br />
You also can't bind there. <br />
Very nice zone though, I was hunting Stalag Terrors/Spiders in broken bridge room at 39. <br />
<br />
Exp bonus there is nice...you can bank there in the coldain city. You just can't buy/sell there, they are dubious to Lizards. I think they are to everybody though. (take it from a fellow lizard) <br />
<br />
Give it try, have gate up. <br />
<br />
Good Luck,  young padawan !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Biizz Buuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, I'll give it a try.<br />
As for coldains, they con apprhensive to me I think,went to velious once to bank real quick.Although it was a long time ago so I might be mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The coldain in Crystal Caverns (Froststone Keep) are on their own faction. They're dubious, period, and I don't know of any way to raise faction with them.<br />
<br />
If you have an enchanter/bard, they can faction song, and anyone with sneak can likewise get past this. As long as someone in your group can sell, you can unload all the (nice) cash items you'll get consistently. If not, fill up a bunch of bags, gate back to Thurg, sell, and repeat. But being able to bank in CC means you can go a lot longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Me and my friend SK recently found this place at lvl 31 and 32..I love this place..the amount of xp you get is good once you learn where to hunt..we were just killing orcs...and the money you can make here is awesome...we sell all the velium to players for much better price than vendors and everything else gets sold to vendors. Which I have my parked monk camped here to sneak and sell for us...I can see this place taking me to low 40's and make decent money here...much better than no loot overthere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well if your not too conserned with loot you can kill the lower level walruses in Eastern Wastes.  The ones over by the Prison are alot lower then the ones over by Keal entrance.  Also I was killing the lower level hunters at 28 pretty easy.   Though if you can I'ld say go for killing the orc miners and saving all the velium you can for any High Level Tailors you might know or for one that is working on skilling up passed Grand Master(200+).  Velium peices are VERY hard to come by and will sale for good money or at the least would get you some free tries at some wyvern armour that would do very nicly for a poor shaman.  If your going to try to solo them I'ld pull them right to the zone in as thats going be the best place with safe get away for hunting orcs.  Besides if you hunt there you can always just zone out to reapply your sow.  Also not knowing your equipment I found that the Neck, face, bracers, cloak, and leggings were the better of the items.  The cobalt belt is pretty nice too.  This is taking in consideration the AC/Wis of the items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here's how I'd do it...<br />
Bind out front of the fort, gate out when sow wears off and reapply.  Know that if you jump down the middle and run for dwarf town (assuming you survive it, which should work, with sow), you'll need to camp/gate aggro, as there'll be at least a half dozen orcs who got stuck pathing into a wall, and will come to kill you if you get halfway down the tunnel from the dwarves back toward orcs.<br />
<br />
My shaman didn't get to play here, but my monk did.  Since she can carry exactly zero loot, it was easy to work out nice PL'ing deals with people farming ore.  They were more than happy to help me exp on the orcs, and I had no ability to take any of the loot.  ;)<br />
<br />
It's a great little place.  People farming ore pretty regularly /ooc rotting herbalist packs and crystalline belts (gotta love lore).  The exp bonus is fantastic, and the cash is darn good.  Especially if you're selling off the ore to the farmers, and even more so now that you can break down the larger bricks into small, useful stuff.</div></div><hr />
