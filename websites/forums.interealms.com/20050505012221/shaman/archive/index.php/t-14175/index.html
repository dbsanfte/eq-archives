<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well this should be obvious to everybody except the absolute new player.  Sony is now making this game so easy for the new player and for new characters to reach 60 that its forcing a bottleneck on already difficult epic quests.  The only bottle neck for Shaman is Fear and the Tear of course.  Look at Rangers though.  How many rangers have you seen running around with only half of their epic because too many people are now ready and competing for the final half of their epics and the drop rate of the piece they need from Hate was already insane but a revamp of the zone did nothing to change that.  It just doesnt seem right that now its so much easier for people to level but the insane drop rates on certain epic pieces remain the same as they always have.  I believe this is some sort of inside joke at Sony.  I have also heard nothing but complaints on the new hate, drop wise, yet Sony says they have gotten nothing but praise on the new zone.  Am I missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">VI had to make changes to stay competitive and make the game appealing to new players. They have removed a lot of the time sinks and have sped the game up in many areas. The old days are gone my friend, just be happy that we had an opportunity to “Earn” all that we have. <br />
<br />
Perhaps EQII will bring back some of that luster and tradition, who knows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only epics really worth the time of getting imo are the bard and cleric.    Epics are 3 yrs old now btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">An almost unresistable magic based dot that is free (mana wise) is NOT bad at all. Not all of us can get better weapons than the epic and if you are thinking of the cudgels not all of us have the time or patience to becoem friends with the iksars. Plus the spear looks cooler.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the feeling of earning things is still alive in EQ, just our perspective (&quot;our&quot; as in the veteran player) is a bit skewed due to our prior experience.<br />
Also, there are fewer true &quot;noobies,&quot; so the general feeling of exploration and freshness is diminished somewhat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have been playing this game full time since Sep of 2000.  I started playing in 1999 but quit because of all the necromancer nerfs to pets at the time.  I just got my Epic 9 days ago.  I sell a lot of items in the bazaar from the low end to the mid high end and am noticing that a lot of items can't even be given away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have a friend who just started to play the game.  We decided it would be best if he fought out the early part of his career completely on his own.  I was thinking that there is no better time to be a newb player than now.  I was thinking of how tradeskill drops are now a goldmine and how items are so much cheaper.  Since my friend has started his first character, I have come to realize that it's not a garden of roses for new players these days.  <br />
<br />
First, he doesn't know that tradeskill drops (such as HQ cat pelts) go for crazy amounts of money, and there is no EC /auction spam telling him so.  Sure, they can go to the bazaar now, but I wonder what level my friend would be before he even considered that an HQ cat pelt was anything other than vendor trash if I hadn't told him so.  Hell, I had to tell him the bazaar existed.  And that's not his fault, he's never played an MMORPG.  Who would have thought that you spend as much time reading about the game as you do playing it just to keep up on how to play the damn thing?  It ain't Diablo.  And that's all a lot of our new players know.<br />
<br />
Second, on Zeb anyways, there are hardly any new players.  Thus, it is very difficult to get a group anywhere but EC and at times even that is impossible.  Very tough for a newbie warrior.<br />
<br />
Third, it's much more daunting now than ever before.  Just imagine being level 10 with more empty equipment slots than occupied ones and seeing a level 5 frog hopping along in better gear than I have at level 56.  Not only that, but some of the attitudes of these twink alts are just horrible.  Many of those who are wearing 50k worth of gear at level 5 are downright impatient and snobbish toward those who just started the game.<br />
<br />
While I don't dissagree that certain epic drops now have &quot;take a number&quot; machines and turnstyles, it's mostly only the twink alts who are finding it so easy to level.  Personally, I think the game would benefit from most all gear having level restrictions.  Fact of the matter is that there aren't many true newbs left.  And when a new player actually does start, he mainly sees a bunch of alts racing for levels and constantly reminding him of how &quot;uber&quot; their other character is.  <br />
<br />
When I catch a real newb, I usually take him on a tour of PoK, Nexus, Bazaar, SH, etc...  I tell him about how to make some money and how to blow off the arrogant twinks who somehow think they are better than he is just because they have more pixelated virtual money in a world that doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
I would like to see a revamp of the epic system.  It should be truly &quot;epic&quot; again and include things like the Planes and Luclin.  And maybe alternate ways to finish it for those who are not in guilds who can handle the big fights.  I don't have my epic and probably will not for some time.  I don't think it should be easy for me to get and I am not a casual player.  I play 30 - 40 hours a week.  However, I'm not guilded and have no real practical way to field a raid for the Hole, Fear, and CoM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Epic is nice and pretty if you solo.<br />
There's much better equipment around though.<br />
You can quite easily skip on getting the epic.<br />
The shaman epic was always too easy compared to other epics.<br />
If you really want to get it, what you need is a group of people that can help you jump on the mob you have to kill in Fear as soon as you can.<br />
You could always buy the MQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is an inside joke at Sony.  They are sitting there laughing their asses off at people that are still getting bent out of shape over a three year old quest because it got dubbed the &quot;epic&quot; quest somewhere.<br />
<br />
I hear a lot on various boards about the &quot;sense of accommplishment&quot; and the &quot;hard work&quot; in getting the epic.  Bull.  The only hard work I've seen people do for epics is to whine until they got the raid force together to take down the stuff they needed.  I guess throwing fits until people spend endless hours at retarded camps waiting for some rare spawn just to shut you up is an accomplishment, but not one I'd really look back on with a sense of pride.<br />
<br />
No epics here, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The shaman epic was always too easy compared to other epics.<br />
<br />
I did the Rogue Epic (solo) with some terrific luck up to the General in under an hour the weekend, now thats an easy quest :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since the original poster mentioned the ranger epic, I'll have to say this:<br />
<br />
A lot of the time, rangers only use Swiftwind because you can get better main handers than Earthcaller, but it's hard to find a better offhander than Swiftwind. With 40% haste and +30atk, even with a better haste item, many high end rangers still equip it for the atk when using archery.<br />
<br />
Also, if you don't count Earthcaller, Swiftwind itself is about as difficult as the Shaman epic, so it's one of the easiest epics. Much of it is easy to MQ or go to &quot;tag along&quot; raids with another guild, so many rangers will have Swiftwind whose guild isn't capable of Hate minis.<br />
<br />
My ranger alt (was my main) has both epics, but Earthcaller is bagged, only used when solo or when we have no slower in the group, because the Toxiferous Axe I have is better. Tox Axe currently sells at around 9-10kpp, has a better ratio and is faster, and doesn't have an agro proc.<br />
<br />
In other words, many of the half-epic rangers you see running around either have the second one and have bagged it, or never bothered to get it in the first place, because you can buy better for under 10kpp. Part of that is because of the difficulty of getting the Hate drop (or getting people to go to Hate at all), of course, but much of it is because it's not worth getting except for completeness/accomplishment, or if you solo a lot. <br />
<br />
On epics in general: for a guild like mine, a small family guild that raids a little, epics are around the best weapons we'd be able to obtain for some of our classes, so although they're nearly 3 years old and there are much better gear out there, it's still worth persuing for us, and still gives a sense of accomplishment for our guild when we do them.<br />
<br />
Edit: Spelling, gah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Epic bottle necks you say? The greatest bottle neck I've seen is guilds that are incapable of getting enougth people to break into the old Planes. Now with the revamped Hate its even harder for Rangers in small guilds to get their second half of their epic.<br />
<br />
If you can get 11 other lvl 65 buddies to do all your epic kills for you, Epics are easy. But if you are part of a smaller guild that has no 60+s your **** out of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As warador said there are only 2 classes where epics are of any real value.  And in the high end game a lot of bards are starting to bag their epic as well.  Shaman epic is nice if you are soloing and that is about it.<br />
<br />
In an era where exp kills in a group last 30-45 secs shaman epic is a complete waste.  The only people that really need epics are the ones that are in small guilds where most of the guild population is under 60.  Those type of guilds will have trouble doing quests like the epic as more and more of old zones are revamped.  Guess it is time to move to the higher end game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sort of an hijack.<br />
<br />
People claim that epics are worthless (probably quite true for melee) but I have yet to find an item to put in that slot with better stats. I couldn't care less about the DoT, but please show me a primary that has better stats and that is obtainable by a small guild. I'm fairly sure that that goes for all of the casters in my guild.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think I've seen 2 SK epics in my whole career.  Poor bastards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How small is small?<br />
<br />
36 People can clear NToV (minus Vulak and you probably wanna skip Vyemn too) and get Sprinkler of Spirits.  I'd rather wield a sprinkler than epic.<br />
<br />
The stats on the bane weapon vs Emperor is actually very good.  I don't recall the exact name/numbers, but it's comparable to epic, though your melees might hate you for wanting to roll on the ore.  It's obtainable with a single group in a few hours of clearing the Ssra Mines.<br />
<br />
Some comparable items to epic you could think about trying to acquire depending on your guild size:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">And then there is always the rare Kunark spell issues.<br />
<br />
Torpor and Malo anyone?<br />
<br />
Farm Radir and Tao in UP for a couple weeks to outfit guild with some good weapons of near epic quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sorry to hijack this thread but please explain how even a lvl 65 pimped rogue could do the epic quest solo.<br />
<br />
You killed Renux how?<br />
You killed Phini how?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">One other thing--while there might not be hell levels, all they did was smooth the progression.  They didn't reduce the amount of exp needed to get to 60 or 65.  It's just a reasonable progression now, not 1.1x, 1.2x, 1.3x, 1.4x, 4.2x, 1.6x etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Soulstorm..cudgels are range slot items...and damn those jackoffs for making them usable by other races.<br />
<br />
The shammy epic is just as worthwhile as most of the others...and alot more worthwhile than some. Even the cleric epic gets bagged most of the time eventually, only to be taken out long enough to be clicked as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Dont think the person meant they soloed (the rogue epic) it by killing all. Phinny drops the kedge robe (as do the darkelves in kith) pretty easily mq'able.<br />
   For the life of i cant remember what renux dropped even though ive done this kill before never paid much attention. But even phinny doesnt take much more than the rogue to kill and the dark elves in kith are two person killable. <br />
<br />
   Also arent the cudgels primary and range? I gotten up to 6 but its been bagged as ive yet to get back to the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Epic bottle necks you say?

Armor/mini side of new hate is alot easier then the old hate heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think the only thing needed changed about epics are epics requiring dragon drops.<br />
<br />
Make wuss version of them all spawnable after boring ass camps like clerics and ragefire.<br />
<br />
on my server I've never seen Sev (been looking for him too) he is usually dead within 10min of pop.. same with gore.. naggy/vox our guild can take, but we have to have about 20 show for it.. waiting for 20 52 and under usually means a pickup raid has formed.<br />
<br />
Talendor also dies almost as soon as he pops.. gore is the same...<br />
<br />
i say just make some stupid ass camp.. for all those.. to make it easier on people competing for epic drops... instead of mobolizing half your guild, in hopes to beat the 5 people that port in and gank the dragons.. you just turn in some gorilla butt hairs or somethin' and he pops with the epic drop.</div></div><hr />
