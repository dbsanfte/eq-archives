<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bagfra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A  new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak.<br />
<br />
After  mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor<br />
replied,<br />
&quot;When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of<br />
vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get  nervous, I take a<br />
sip.&quot;<br />
<br />
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's  advice. At the beginning of the<br />
sermon, he got nervous and took  a drink. He proceeded to talk up a<br />
storm.<br />
<br />
Upon his return to  his office after mass, he found the following note<br />
on the door:<br />
1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.<br />
2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.<br />
3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.<br />
4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated. Jacob wagered his donkey, he<br />
did not bet his ass.<br />
6. We do  not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C.<br />
7. The Father, Son, and Holy  Ghost are not referred to as daddy, junior<br />
and the spook.<br />
8. David  slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.<br />
9. When David was hit  by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say<br />
he was stoned off his ass. We do not refer to the cross as the &quot;Big T&quot;.<br />
11. When Jesus broke the  bread at the Last Supper he said,&quot;Take this<br />
and eat it for it is my body.&quot; He did not say &quot;Eat me&quot;<br />
12. The Virgin Mary is not called &quot;Mary with the  Cherry.&quot;<br />
13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for<br />
the grub, yeah God.<br />
14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St.Peter's, not<br />
a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.<br />
