<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">-You can get this earring http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=5596 from the trials in PoJ in PoP.<br />
-There's also a shoulder that comes from there with 35hp 35mana 7? wis and some AC, and some resists.<br />
-I just removed it from my magelo profile so I don't remember the name of it, but there's a tradable neck that drops in the 8th shawl quest.  It's 10ac 40hp 40mana and has a dodge? bonus to it, and maybe some wis and resists.<br />
-this bracer/arms drops off Rhag1 http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=30560<br />
-you want a shadel bandit ring for one finger<br />
-you want to complete your emperor key in ssra for your other ring<br />
-bag the heiro for enduring breath for the few times you need it, and get a heiro cloak instead.  more hp &gt; more ac and resists.  you might still use lodi in ToV for resists too.<br />
-you want to be raiding Tormax and Dain to get the belt that drops off Tormax, http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=25199, or you want the dain head to turn into Tormax for the dain belt.<br />
<br />
There might be some items from WToV dragons you could use too, like the boots of superiority.<br />
<br />
Those are about the only immediate changes you could expect to see unless you happen to be in a guild capable of raiding NToV, Velious Royals, or Luclin Targets.</div></div><hr />
