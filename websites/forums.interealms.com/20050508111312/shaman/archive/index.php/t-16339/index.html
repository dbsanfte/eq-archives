<br />
Just wanted to note that I decided to pick an Amulet of Necropotence just for fun, and although it is fun, it does in fact negate natural Troll/Iksar regen. It also negate my Infravision.<br />
<br />
With the illusion on I regen the same level as a 65 Human/Barb/Etc, not the 18 standing / 24 sitting natural regen from being a Troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bummer to hear that.  I wish skeleton form gave you some kind of bonus, like an uber bash that always interrupts things, like NPC skeletons get :D<br />
<br />
Just curious, did you buy your AoN today after new models went in?  If so, how much did you pay?  I am hoping that maybe prices on them skyrocketed and I could sell mine for a whole bundle :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe, I bought mine a week ago, not knowing that they were going to change the skeleton models, and waddahya know.  I like them, they finally added 2hb/spell effects for them.  I think I look mighty find swinging my corpsegrinder =D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At first I didn't like the new skeleton models, but they I turned on particle effect and realized I have glowing green eyes, which matches the glowing green ball in my offhand, and my glowing green snake stick from codb.  I give them a thumbs up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AoN does not affect natural regen.  There was already a post similar to this, and after reading it I decided to verify.  Without AoN I get 24 per tick sitting.  With AoN illusion active I still get 24 per tick.  I verified this before and after reading your post I double checked and am still getting 24 per tick.  Having a custom player window that shows your actual hp numbers helps in testing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sorry but it does. <br />
<br />
I have checked this at least 10 times, trying to validate the money I spent on AoN.<br />
<br />
Cann'd down to 1503 HP, no skelly illusion:<br />
<br />
1503<br />
1524<br />
1545<br />
1566<br />
1587<br />
1608<br />
1629<br />
1650<br />
1671<br />
1692<br />
<br />
Cann'd down to 1708 HP, only chage was clicked AoN:<br />
<br />
1708<br />
1718<br />
1729<br />
1739<br />
1750<br />
1760<br />
1771<br />
1781<br />
1792<br />
<br />
Clearly shows that with the skeleton illusion my regen went from 21 per tick to 10 per tick. Only change was clicking the AoN.<br />
<br />
This was before the change to skeleton illusion yesterday, mine was done about a week ago, so maybe the new change did alter that.</div></div><hr />

Actually, if you notice, you are regening 10, then 11, then 10, then 11 after the illusion.  On my system, this is how I normally regen, as an Iksar.  What you probably didnt notice is that the health was updating more often than every 6 seconds.  My health ticks up by 9 and then 11 every 6 seconds or so.  So instead of getting 21 a tick at once, you are getting 21 a tick in two increments.  Try timing how long it takes to regen say, 2500HP with a stopwatch.  I am willing to bet it takes within 6 seconds as long with the illusion as without.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly the same on my machine. Your hp regen seems to be split, or rather it will go up a number and then bounce, but it happens twice per tick. It takes exactly the same amount of time with illusion to go from 1hp to full hps as without.</div></div><hr />
