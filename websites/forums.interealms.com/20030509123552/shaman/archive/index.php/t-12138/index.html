<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Groakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thats right everyone, 3 days. Real life play time about 6 hours per day. Now that I am 51 I can post my secret, or maybe not so secret spot.  I fell into the CoM trap like everyone else for a bit of 47. I quickly realised the folly of my ways. Exp cannot be beat in DL at the skele ruins from 45-49. I kow you are saying to yourself - yea we already knew that, tell us something we don't know. <br />
<br />
Well here it is. Crypt of Nadox. Some of you like myself have never heard of this zone. I didn't know it existed until I went exploring a bit and heard about Dulak's Harbor. Well, Dulak's Harbor has some decent places to level at low to mid 40's as well. But thats not what this is about. This is about getting anywhere from 1/2 to 3/4 blue per kill at level 50.<br />
<br />
 Find your way through the cavern area and get yourself to Crypt of Nadox. Now, 1/2 a blue is what I was getting at level 50 on average, but that doesn't mean you can't go there earlier. I had average gear, no JBB and no Epic and I was able to keep the down time to a minimum. I got a KEI and headed down there. As soon as you zone in stop right there. Get your pet out and look at the area. there are 4 static mobs in front of you. 3 of which should be elementals of some kind the other being a random mob. From what I could tell at level 49 I could single pull the mobs there. I am not sure if they are social or not. I never had more than one come when I pulled but I can't say 100% for sure. <br />
<br />
Anyway, make a long story short, Pull with Slow-Root-Mailaise-Ebolt-send in Pet, rinse repeat. Obviously below 49 you will need many more dots but on average it took about 3 Ebolts and maybe 1 Blizzard blast to kill the tougher of the elementals. <br />
<br />
Well, there also is a named mob that insta spawns from the elementals that drops a decent neck item and a very nice ear item. He is non agro when he pops so you have plenty of time to med and get your game face on.<br />
Anyway, I hope all this helps and enjoy the quick levels because I have yet to find a good spot at 51.<br />
Happy hunting, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kynson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I checked this place out this morning at 48.<br />
<br />
I pulled the first of the three elementals, and after a long fight, was delighted to find that I was awarded with 3% experience.  The fight wasn't terribly tough (granted, I'm well twinked) with slow, I lost maybe 30% with regen and bear form up.  JBB nukes did roughly 5% damage per nuke, and they seemed to have a fairly decent resist rate.<br />
<br />
However, after the first pull, I couldn't get either of the other 2.  There were a pair of bugged red conn mobs stuck on a rock there (a waterlogged and sodden crewman, I believe) that would aggro any time I tried to pull either of the two elementals, and would hit for roughly 140.  Are these a recurring problem that are going to put a damper on my exp there, or is it just a one time thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kynson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Follow up and further observations:<br />
The bugged reds disappeared, so I'm hoping it was just a one-time thing.  The scorned elements seem considerably tougher than the abhorrent ones.  The only problem I had was the spawn timer, which is something ridiculous like 30 minutes :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have never run into a problem with the 2 spawns sticking. I pull with slow and after them bouncing around a bit they always seem to warp to me. <br />
About the spawn timer. Yes it is a little slow, but if you swim up the lava a bit further there is a spawn under the lava before you get to the bridge. This mob is also an elemental. If you find that you are still needing more mobs, just past that mob up and to the right where you can run up on shore there is another static spawn. But beware he will be one of the trolls which are pretty tough or even worse than that, it could be one of the boars - a level 58ish animal. Very nasty.<br />
        I recommend if you intend to hunt all the way to that area that you zone in, invis yourself and run up there and see what the static spawn is then run back and prep for your session. <br />
<br />
And yes the Abborent's are much easier than the Scorned but  they give slightly better exp. I found that even given the long spawn time I still made more exp there than I would have in any other zone I have tried. If you are looking for something to do between spawns, you may want to stock up on alchemy items and work on that.<br />
<br />
Best of luck,<br />

<br />
I and a friend duo this spot.  Yes, they come from the trains that come through.  Rather, they come from the people that train and then sit at the zoneline waiting for the enemys to come all the way.  If people just ran for the zonline they wouldn't make it probably.  Anyhow, I've seen up to 4 or 5 enemies get stuck there at a time and if an undead one gets in there, it can be very hard to split them all out.</div></div><hr />
