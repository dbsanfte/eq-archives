<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pronigious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question about is the efficiency of a shaman as a healer<br />
<br />
A Shaman, First has to Malo (depending on the Mob) Then Slow, then start healing - and usually on harder mobs ect, Chain healing.  Meaning for the first 22 secs, the mob better not kill the tank, where as a Druid or Cleric has 10 secs with which it be casting their heal.  a Cleric and druid, because of the size of their heal, can also wait longer to cast it, to increase its effiecency, where we have to cast it more frequently to keep the same amount of damage healed (mitigated by slow obviously (unless the mob mitigates slow ;-) ))  So, we loose 12 seconds of time in the beginning of the fight in which we cannot aid in DPS or CC or what have you, and then we can be typically casting heals more frequently, which lessens how much time we help the group.  Add to that the fact that we have to spend 700mana+ in addition to the 12 secs to even be able to keep up with the heals as a druid or cleric would.  if only 2 heals are necessary (approx 32 secs) for an xp mob, then we have contributed nothing to DPS and heals (if using Cheal) 4thousand damage approx, for 1600+ mana.  Where a cleric would heal the same in 1/2 Cheal, meaning probably only 1 cheal is needed (depending on Tanks hps) allowing the Cleric ~1200 mana and 22 secs to aid in DPS to keep up with the shaman.  And a druid might need to fire off 2 (costing a mere 900 mana for the 8K hps healed).  A group with a cleric or a druid in it would also kill the mob faster, as they have more time to aid in DPS (in the druids case, to spend the same as a shaman, they can spend 700 mana on nukes)  Beyond even that a druid or cleric would have more room for error being able to increase the Tanks hitpoints and AC to a greater Degree than we are.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that shaman should be as effective healers as a druid or a cleric... but for the first time, which thinking about our healing in that way, I've begun to think, what's the point of being penalized for all my versitility, if I can't use any of it?  not because I don't have it, not even because I don't have the mana for it, but merely because there isn't enough seconds per mob to USE it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cast Q either on the tank before he pulls, or before the puller gets in range with mob, that way you get 2+ ticks of Q while you debuff ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What he said.<br />
<br />
I use quiescence supplemented by the occasional blast heal, and it can heal everywhere up to tier3 zones in PoP and any normal adventure.  Last night, on a hard mission, the cleric went LD for about 15 minutes and I did a decent job of healing while they were gone (although the tank was a very uber paladin - wouldnt have worked as well with a lesser tank).  <br />
<br />
I just throw a Q on before the fight, malos the mob as it is inc, slow it, then throw a blast heal if it is necessary (usually it isn't).  After that I have 30 seconds or so to dot/nuke/whatever until my quiescence wears off.<br />
<br />
So, basically, use quiescence as your main heal, not tnargs (and never use kraggs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Always, always keep regen on the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hears people screaming. 25 Hps a tick when mobs hit for 1000!&quot;<br />
<br />
That is 25 more hit points every tick that you dont ahve to heal later. And mobs dont hit a good tank for 1000 every time tehy swing.<br />
<br />
Or look at it this way. Group Replenishment is an 8% increase to Queasance. That lasts for like 30 minutes. <br />
<br />
Use it. You will like the effect.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I 4box a lot (pal/shm/enc/mag) and I find that putting Q on the healer as the pull is incoming makes it much easier for us to keep up with mob's damage.  I do use the chanter to tash but I also usually Malos as well so the mag is virtually unresisted.  <br />
<br />
PAL rarely self heals, just the occasional group heal to gain aggro.</div></div><hr />
