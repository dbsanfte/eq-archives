<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After I thought about it a while, it occured to me that Nixx took an awfully long time about soloing Yeldema . . 12-14 minutes wasn't it?  Sure with only epic and JBB it's gonna take some time.  So what if I used Bane and Poxx in addition?<br />
<br />
I gave it a shot last night, I had three guildies there to watch but not help . . unless I died.  I engaged, slowed, and stacked epic, poxx, and bane on her.  I kept all three dots on her most of the time and JBBed when I could.  <br />
<br />
6:45 was my time.  Can you beat me?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeldema = 8 to 10 for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bonestorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Considering the AAXP skills and most have alot better armour by miles compared when Nixx first did nailed Yeldema, this post is nothing more than a comparison of dick sizes. <br />
<br />
Nixx was the first, move on and live with it.<br />
<br />
Now if you soloed a Guardian Wurm that would be something to be telling us about. Otherwise telling us how quick you you soloed a gimp dragon (if it can be really called a dragon), you might as well be telling us how many AAXP skills you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I offered it more as a fun challenge for those bored oracles out there than a &quot;nyah nyah&quot; post.  Sure Nixx did it first, but he did it without all those neat AA skills we have today.  I was just kinda sayin that we oughta be able to breeze thru these type of feats these days.  <br />
<br />
I dunno bout doing stuff fast without canni5 tho.   You need the extra mana to be able to keep the dots on and not have to spend so much time canning.  <br />
<br />
FYI warder lizards at CT entrance are a much harder solo than Yeldema . . . if you want a good challenge try those, but I admit it's not quite as cool sounding.  <br />
<br />
BTW, to all you whiny leezards out there.  I think I clicked my JBB twice during that little romp session with Yeld.  woopee.  So consider yourselves gimps who will never be able to solo large targets cause you dont have my uber JBB.<br />

Sebilite Protector is very killable solo.<br />
<br />
Pretty much anything that hits for less then 350 (non flurry...) is soloable by a shaman.  Once you have canni5/torpor, mana never becomes an issue, it's all about if you can keep torpor on yourself...if you can...and keep tossing dots on a mob, you can kill a very long list of 'hard monsters' solo.</div></div><hr />

Go fight him and come back and talk about something you know.<br />
He DOES hit for more then 350, and fast at that. Want me to dig the log's out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once he is slowed he becomes nothing...seriously.<br />
<br />
I know myself and 2 other shamans on Zeb have soloed him, with the small amount of hps he has the fight never went over 4-5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Seriously show me your logs then.  Noway you can do it.<br />
I have the AA skills, I know how to solo, torpor is not enough to keep up with his damage output. In his current status, you can't do it. <br />
He hits for 436, slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">BTW I'm talking about this guy: HTTP://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4571<br />
<br />
Not some imitation in other zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">when we cast canni(5) we are easier to hit(well for me at least)<br />
whit my 1024 ac self buff.<br />
<br />
that mob can hit 400+ and double attck,if you have a cleric buff you can maybe do it.<br />
<br />
but for myself,when you solo a tough mob,it SHOULD be self buff only.<br />
<br />
sure whit cleric buffs and clarity 3  it's help a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Many  people soloed Yeldema before Nixx did.  He was just the first to brag about it here, as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Hard to use can 5 mid-fight against a hard-hitting mob with self-buffs only, but shamans with great gear could do it I would think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Drekkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Seriously show me your logs then. Noway you can do <br />
<br />
This might be a moot point since I didn't solo him, but we went with a six man team down to Protector/Tolapumj for spells and for fun. We had somewhat of a mispull and got something like three or four juggernauts plus Protector, after I slowed Protector he stuck like bees to honey to me, and I had no problems whatsoever tanking him for a few minutes while the other juggernauts were killed.<br />
<br />
Initially we figured we'd kill him first since the others could be mezzed, but I said I wanted to try tank him with my Druid RL friend keeping a close eye on me, and it turned out to be np. Slowed he really he is a poosae.<br />
<br />
So I definately think he's doable, although I haven't tried personally. (Just judging that based on our group attempt).<br />
<br />
I'm a Barb btw, had fungi tunic, regrowth, and about 1050 AC no more. So no super equipped char for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rykar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hehehe, are all these Yeldema fights done without benefit of anyone else's buffs or potions? (i.e. no Aegolism, KEI, etc?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Things I have soloed:<br />
<br />
- Yeldema<br />
Time 8mins 35 secs.<br />
Buffs: Focus, RH, Agi<br />
<br />
- Stomples (After the retuning in PoM)<br />
Time 14mins ? secs<br />
Same buffs.  (A GOOD challenge)<br />
<br />
- A Seballite Protector (yes it can be done)<br />
Time - Don't know, I was goofing and he popped.  My group let me try him solo.  It took ahwile though.<br />
Buffs - Focus, RH, Agil, Aego, KEI (I still could have got him with no Aego).  Once he's slowed and if you have Torpor, I had no problems.  A bad resist could mean bad things though.<br />
<br />
- The level 60 Royal Guard Bugs in FG<br />
Time - about 10 mins or so.<br />
Buffs: Focus, RH, Agil<br />
<br />
There some more hard ones too.. but shaman can do amazing things.</div></div><hr />

Even with over 1250ac and 2500hps, it is still a pounding.<br />
Someone show me a screenshot and log, otherwise I am a non-believer.<br />
Btw, you have to stay alive AND do 20,000pts of damage.<br />
Possibly an ogre that can resist stuns alot better has a better shot at it, but even with torpor running full time, it doesn't offset his 67.25DPS. Torpor doesn't heal that fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I killed an orc pawn once, want to see?<br />

<br />
<br />
Keeps coming up in visual studios for me but who cares, took me 5 times longer to find the damn crap in my monstrous log file than it did to kill the stupid thing.  Hopefully if visual studios isnt installed it will just consider it text, if not, open it in a random text editor.<br />
<br />
See more fun stuff here below.  1 meg file though, still in bmp.  Modem users beware.  Will be removed or changed soon.<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://darkhorizon.angrybunni.org/Database/BinaryData.asp?ID=2514&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
I used 9 charges of stinging wort and 1 charge of kilvas skin of flame.  Another attempt the stinging wort would not be needed but being as it was my first attempt and I hate to lose it had to be done.  No magician focus crap or anything like that.  Hopefully no one said anything horrible in guild as I only skimmed it.<br />
<br />
Focus, regrowth, ultravision (or acumen, hell if I remember),  Shroud of Spirits, Inner fire, Kilva's, Riotous Health, Primal Essence, Stinging Wort are the buffs in the screenshot.<br />
<br />
You may be able to infer it but if not, those 3 people in my group are off with friends killing jumpalot and juggernauts.<br />
<br />
If this isnt good enough I'll get a log killing him with no damage shield or stinging wort next time people decide to go down there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sebilite Protector hits for 473 or 479 max. Not using potions i'd like to see somebody solo him. Never tried myelf, but i doubt it would be possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Seriously, if you are going to claim you soloed him then show some logs.  You might as well say you soloed the sleeper if you are not going to back it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I don't live with my logs on, and yes I did have a Aego and KEI.  I have close to 1300 ac (It doesn't matter over 1200 or so anyway) and close to 4k or so hps with Aego.<br />
<br />
I don't know the differance in our gear, or whether I got a good roll on missess and you got a bad roll.<br />
<br />
Does it bother me no one believes I did it?  Not in the slightest.  Because I know I did, and thats what matters.  You asked if it could done.  I answered with how I did it.<br />
<br />
I think I could do it without Aego and KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I know I can tank the seb protector just fine, had to do it a long time ago on a Trak raid (back then I had maybe 3300 hps 1020 ac raid buffed. Now I've got 3100 hps and 1200 ac self buffed), while everyone else killed Trak. I'll go see if I can drag some people away from Luclin to clear down to Prot and try soloing.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, it has a few thousand less hps than Yeld, but hits twice as hard. It's on the edge of possiblity, which makes it something interesting to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If people don't think potions are soloing I'll make sure to make a log without potions the very next chance I'm in trakanon's lair.  I apologize for using potions on my first attempt at him.<br />
<br />
For all those who don't think it's possible, go down and try before you say there's no way it can be done.  I was halfway in before the thought that he was sort of easy crossed my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'd say as long as you made the potions it should count as soloing. Why not use all the skills your class has? :)<br />
<br />
But I'd say if you've never worked on alchemy and had a guild shaman make you some potions, it would be the same as say a paladin using shaman made potions. <br />
<br />
I use poisons on my rogue to solo stuff, I see that the same as potions for shamen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">imo, soloing is defined by NOT having any buffs cast by other people on you whatsoever. potions however are fine, even if you didn't make them - they're like items, click items if you will. many shammies use the JB BP buff - that's a druid buff for example.<br />
<br />
soloing with aego and KEI makes things a ton easier, no offense, but i don't credit that as a solo kill. you have 1100 more hp and like 450(?) more mana plus regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If you count insta-heal potions as soloing, you have a totally different understanding of it than me. DS potions would be fine as the number of potions you can use is limited to 1.</div></div><hr />
