<br />
Regardless I went in and had a nose about last night, stumbled down to the basement and spent 10 minutes nosing about while dodging the Taskmasters and Warden.<br />
<br />
Anywho, I am sure someone said they got 1 blue a kill down here solo, where and how?<br />
<br />
I never got the chance to try it last night as I made a wee mistake.<br />
<br />
I am sure, well 'was' sure I had bound outside in The Grey, I found the archway to the mines and was waiting for the Warden to move so I could get down there, when he eventualy did I ran for it. But silly me had timed it wrong and a wandering Taskmaster had sneaked up behind me, he cast on me a couple of times and I hit gate quick smart (these are the only occasions when I mem gate thankfully)<br />
I got out alive but it turns out I was still bound in Feerot.....sigh....time for bed me thought:P<br />
<br />
So what are people pulling solo and killing down there? I read something about casters with sunstrike but a search on the word sunstrike yeilds nothing for me either.<br />

<br />
You should be able to bind just outside The Grey which shouldn't be too much of a problem getting back to Ssra.</div></div><hr />
