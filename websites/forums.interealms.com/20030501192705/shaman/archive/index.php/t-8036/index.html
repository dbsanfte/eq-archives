New the the forum just wanted to spew about the prices.  I am on vallon zek and have been trying to make some cash through sow pots.  With the bazaar prices for these are low, 85 is the norm and every now and then i even find an 80plater.  This just is not good, however i still see some ppl selling for 100 or 100+.  The problem with selling higher is, why would anyone buy the higher priced ones when they could dave money.  I know there are ppl who would just to help someone out but no many ppl are like that.  I have currently gotten my skill up to where I only have the 5% failure rate (I did this by making the null pots b/c I am on a pvp server and MR cannot hurt =P, kept them for myself mostly or passed them to friends).  Anyway, I just think that if we all get together we can raise the prices, at least slowly like gas.  Maybe go to 90 plat or 95 and then up now and then.  I would do 90 myself but i know there is another shm who sells while they sleep also and sells for 85.  I am going to get with her and talk to her about setting a higher price and see how that goes, as well as any other shm who I see sell at those lower prices.  I think this was already talked about b4 but I just woke up and needed to spew.  Any ideas of how i can help get the prices up?  I was thinking of buying all the other shms pots last night and trying to sell them for 90-95 or even 100.  Has anyone else tried either of these ideas?  Get back to me, tks guys =)<br />
