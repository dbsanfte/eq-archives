Goody!  Another insanely asinine bitch post about the bitching that goes on from shamans on this board!  Like we didn't have enough of that already, sheesh.<br />

As for class balance, I am declaring it officially dead.  From now on I shall choose to ignore it entirely.  My class sux, I realize this, and grudgingly accept it.  Oh, well, at least my chat channels haven't been nerfed.  I think chatting in game is probably 90% of why I play these days.</div></div><hr />

If a raidleader says that, he should be tossed into the hallway in Tactics as the train comes by.<br />

So what if other classes are getting some of our spells.  Its been happening for a couple years now if go back and look at some of the other classes spells.  If some of you are so concerned that you will not be wanted in groups or guilds because of trivial stuff like this, learn how to play your class instead of whining about it.</div></div><hr />

Maybe that's the point: people know their class, maybe too well, and are tired of seeing the same ole sh*t.</div></div><hr />

I know for sure I have never once been taken into a group because I had disinfecting aura.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Not to mention its a redundant ability for shaman, meaning we get essentially nothing,  but a brand new shiny spell for the other 2 priests. Now do you see what's wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Although I think Sony is blurring the class lines a bit here by giving this spell to all three priest classes, I don't see it as overpowering.<br />
<br />
After all, i think this is a single target spell...it's not likely that it will be used to cure an entire raid (unless you got a lot of druids sitting around)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Helios I see your problem.  I guess that's yet another issue of playing on a minority server in the grand scheme of things.   Unfortunately the PvP servers are pretty much never considered when changes are made.  Or at least it would appear that way.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the argument is that this now makes the servers more difficult, which I assume is part of the appeal to playing on one.  So you will become a better shaman because of it.  You should in some freak sense be almost happy.  <br />
<br />
Now unfortunately the pvp servers and players are in the huge minority.  The old argument of the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few is what appears to be happening in this and many other situations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">this sucks for the pvp servers, but i play on a blue server so i don't really care..<br />
i see the point that if &quot;we dont complain about small things they will do it to big things too&quot; but i dont think thats what sony had in mind with this change really.<br />
<br />
to me it's just one less spell i have to cast, let the druids do it i say</div></div><hr />

The apologists say &quot;I'm glad other classes are getting our spells / skills / abilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fair enough. <br />
<br />
Can someone enlighten me as to what class abilities the Shaman have received from other classes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Have to agree. We got hosed...again.<br />
<br />
Everyone gets two new spells. Execpt us, we effectively get one.  No its not exactly overpowering (expect where the PvP'ers pointed out), but its again another example where we get shortchanged. We get a useless spell; or have one rendered usless depending on which one you prefer. I would lean to the latter.<br />
<br />
*sigh*, well I mailed my impressions to eqfeedback, but I'm not exactly holding my breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If I remember correctly, Grummus' dot can still only be cured in one cast by abolish disease due to the huge number or disease counters it adds.</div></div><hr />

http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2526&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Looks like it's going to be an upgrade to abolish now, removing 48 counters total. (from up to 4 spells). Not bad I guess, but I don't know of any spells that actually add more than 36. (i.e. grummus's DoT is 36)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">That's the real problem, that we are effectively getting one spell, while everyone else gets 2 spells.  No, they aren't particularly great spells, but getting something slightly new would be nice.  Putting a targetable group shrink in the game would be nice.  Or a group bear form even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Pure blood fixes 18 counters. That's 2 casts to fix Grummus' dot. Abolish (and this upgrade to disinfecting aura) do it in one.<br />
<br />
Really...how many things do poison/disease counters? Very few. Anyway, anyone who expected groundbreaking spells in an expansion not even designed for high level characters is deluding themselves.</div></div><hr />

Revenge? What revenge? LoY is a revenge?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Andisoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">In all reality, yes, we did kinda get the shaft with that spell. However, i did not expect ANY of the spells comming out in LOY to effect our end game effectiveness at all. <br />
<br />
What they should have put in is either an upgrade to Spirit Quickening or Donlo's (Group Shrink)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Well in my case, I'm 52nd. So I'm not an end game player, and these spells affect me very much.<br />
<br />
Stoicism I'm quite happy with, so there's no complaints there. Now Grizlor points out there may be a Disinfecting Aura upgrade, If so, that takes some of the sting out. <br />
<br />
It still feels to me like we're only getting 1 spell. But maybe getting the upgrade to Aura is a better deal in the long run. However, I only see reference to Grummus; an encouter I won't claim to know anything about; but is it really an upgrade if it affects only 1 encounter? <br />
<br />
I guess its something but I still think the under 60th crowd got hosed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The new Disinfecting Aura isnt much more useful. Most spells goes from 9 to 18 to 36 to 72 counters. This change doesnt benefit us in any way seeing as its wont cure anymore spells than abolish disease in 1 or even 2 casts, well except when you have multiple disease spells on you, which doesnt happen too often.<br />

Being that this is specifically in reference to spells in the expansion, kindly explain to me how the over-60 crowd did not get hosed. 2 spells &gt; 0 spells, last I checked. Especially when one of them is stoicism, which is stupidly overpowered.</div></div><hr />
