<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>evilwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
The reason why i ask is, I made ogre shaman whos 51 now but at char creation screen i put all points into wis and stam forgetting about his agi, so his agi started at 70 which means ac pen. Should i re-roll is it that bad ? please let me know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thxs Busha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, your in now way &quot;screwed&quot;<br />
<br />
As long as your Agi is above 75 (Which im sure it is with your epuipment) you AC won't get a &quot;penelty&quot;<br />
<br />
Basicly the 75 agi rule of thumb goes something like this. 75 is the magic number of when agi dosent effect AC.<br />
<br />
So if you have 70 agi your AC is multiplied by .95 <br />
If your agi is 75 your AC  is multiplied by 1<br />
If your agi is 80 your agi is multiplied by 1.05<br />
<br />
I just pulled those numbers out of my ass but you get the idea.<br />
<br />
But know your in no way screwed, don't worry about it at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ummm... is your Agi still 70 now?<br />
<br />
As long as your current agi is above 74, it's not a a major issue issue. I assume you have agi stat based equip. All this means was that at low levels before you managed to get past 75 Agi, you were at a disadvantage in terms in AC.<br />
<br />
Assuming you had the exact equipment as another lvl 51 Orge shaman who had 75 agi on creation, you would only be 5agi lower than him. I think 5agi at 51 doesn't even equate to 1  AC :)<br />
<br />
Personally I wouldn't re roll after gaining 51 levels lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nah, it's not worth rerolling in my opinion.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, you have the best agi buffs in the game, if you need them.<br />
<br />
As you get better gear, even if you're not looking for agi, you'll find that some of it will incidentally have +agi on it - it won't be too hard to push up your agi by 5 to get over the 75.<br />
<br />
Rerolling really won't make that much difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Am I Screwed?.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nah  =)<br />
No need to reroll for that hehe. <br />
Starting points are not that important.<br />
I know a druid 65 that put points in STR and a monk 63 that put points in Wisdom  :D  At least you chose the right stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>evilwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">HI all,<br />
<br />
Thxs alot :) feel better now!.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BUSHA- 51 SHAMAN!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AGI buff + Rage = @+100 AGI<br />
<br />
AGI is the least of your worries, with nimble, VoB, and SoS on I max my agi at 61</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You could spend 3 AA points to get your naked AGI over 74, but it's not even worth doing that as long as you have one piece of AGI gear.<br />
<br />
Or stock up on Halas 10 lb meat pies! +5 AGI right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually you probably did like most of us and put too many points in wisdom and not enough in stamina.  AGI is for all intents and purposes worthless.  Its pretty hard to put on a full set of gear and not break the 75 cap that removes all ac penalties.<br />
<br />
There is no combination of starting point distribution that would warrant rerolling at such a late date.  Even if you put 30 pts into charisma.  All of those mistakes are easily corrected with gear and matter a heck of a lot less than you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On the plus side, you get the maximum effect out of our agility buffs...<br />
<br />
Seriously, no need to reroll as long as you're able to keep it 75+ when needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LOL Shandy<br />
<br />
The &quot;only&quot; effect might also be another way of saying that.  As the other posters said, though, AGI is worthless.  I would actually take CHA over AGI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think you need to re-roll.<br />
<br />
 :D  :D  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Stats in general are only minimally worthwhile at char creation.  STA and WIS don't have much effect until you get to higher levels and by that time you're generally geared up to the extent that the little bit of mana/hp added are minor.<br />
<br />
I didn't think anyone even cared about their starting stats anymore, heh.  Kinda takes ya back seeing one of those old questions resurface. ;)</div></div><hr />
