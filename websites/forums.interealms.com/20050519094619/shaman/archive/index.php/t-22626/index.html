<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Don't you think Vxed and zones like that would be better if you eliminated respawn totally?  <br />
<br />
Folks zone in, work the bridge or some spot in Vxed and sit there pulling respawn until they hit their 50 mobs and then split.  <br />
<br />
Wouldn't Vxed be a bit more fun if groups had to move at least somewhat by eliminating respawn?  <br />
<br />
This is probably true in several GoD instanced zones, but I don't have a good sense of that. <br />
<br />
Is this a terrible idea?  What exactly does the respawn do to make this zone better? harder? more fun?  <br />
<br />
Seems to work ok in ldon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The ikkinz trials for both the single group and raid ones don't have respawn on the static mobs. Only the wanderers respawn. So the vast majority of the zone stays dead.<br />
<br />
I definitely think vxed and tipt could benifit from this. Tipt already has some of it since none of the &quot;rooms&quot; respawn but still pleanty of statics that do respawn. The best part of just wanderers respawning would be that it would actually be conceivable to recover in tipt with out a corpse summon and would actually save most of your hard work. So bad luck on one pull or the named wouldn't kill the whole thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BurgBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tipt barely has respawns, Vxed needs to keep them.  Vxed has been nerfed down enough as is, no sense in making it easier imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't really see that it makes it much easier, but it will make you move about at least.  Instead of staying rooted in one spot.  <br />
<br />
That makes it a bit more of a snoozer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Vxed would be a frigging JOKE it would be so easy with no respawn.  The majority of the challenge in that trial is doing enough dps and moving fast enough while maintaining control so as not to have backspawn catch up to you.  I'm not saying that it doesn't get tedious, because it does, but didn't they already lower the required mob kill count?  No respawn would equal no challenge imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And how would we farm GoD spells stones so quickly and easily without respawn !!!!<br />
<br />
They drop twice as quick in Vxxed trials by the named respawns as what they do in places like KT, etc.<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah, you would kill one of my solo spots! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The majority of the challenge in that trial is doing enough dps and moving fast enough while maintaining control so as not to have backspawn catch up to you.<br />
<br />
Eh?  All people do in this trial is PULL the backspawn.  <br />
<br />
They sit in one spot and pull respawn around them.  This is harder in your opinion?  <br />
<br />
I just don't see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It would elliminate part of the channenge of it.  Vxed would become a matter of just pulling everything to the spawn area, then bringing singles in till the mob hailed.  There is no challenge in that, it would become even more mindless than in it's current state.  Not to mention that it would basically wipe out the ability to farm vxed for spells or loots.  <br />
<br />
And it would also make tipt quite a bit easier.  If mobs don't respawn, you don't need to worry as much about pulling, as long as you can kill 1 mob before the group wipes, you've gotten 1 step closer to victory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gart I'm not talking about *initially* because yes, you are correct, the way people are handling this at first IS terribly easy by just pulling mobs down toward zone in and maintaining camp there.  But what I am talking about is once you are at or near the kill count for flagging where you have to clear up to the hail NPC's camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">But what I am talking about is once you are at or near the kill count for flagging where you have to clear up to the hail NPC's camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree that's the most fun part and more challenging than sitting in a spot pulling respawn.  It's because I like it better I thought removing respawn would help, because then the group is moving and clearing, and not sitting and pulling.<br />
<br />
I see what you are saying that the moving and clearing wouldn't really occur because people would just snip off the lead mobs and run them back to totally cleared areas.<br />
<br />
This is true to some extent, and it's largely a consequence of mob placement in Vxed.  I'm no fan of ldon, but the no respawn principle works pretty decent there in terms of moving people along.</div></div><hr />
