<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that the day has finally slowed down a bit, I have a few other non shaman specific things I found out at Fan Faire:<br />
<br />
1. SOE Guild Tools  <br />
I don't know if you guys have had a chance to check out the really cool Guild Management tool that comes with EQ 2. During one of the panels, a developer stated they were going to share that functionality with EQ 1 within the next 6 - 8 months. It is TOTALLY COOL. <br />
<br />
Guilds will have website space, forums and a roster. All info will be automatically fed (4 hour feeds or daily feeds, depending) from SOE. Individuals can automatically update their character info (including a very cool Magelo like interface) and choose to share the info with anyone or just with their guildmates.<br />
<br />
As items are discovered on servers, item info will be available (kinda like Allakhazam's). Also, to help improve the size of uber e-penises, the first person to discover the item will be listed.<br />
<br />
I asked if there was any sort of limit on space and the guy said no, but he did say hosting movies would be too big. He also said that SOE would not be policing the forums (of course, any real life threats/harassment would not be tolerated) and anti - SOE posts were fine.<br />
<br />
It was VERY cool.<br />
<br />
2. GoD AA point reimbursement <br />
Rashere said that there would be an AA reimbursement for some of the pricier GoD AAs. He said the person would still have the AA, they would just receive the AA difference in their AA bank (between the former price and the new price). This change is expected to go in by the big patch in early December. Rashere also said he is going to tune some of the AA abilities. I mentioned Rabid Bear and he said it was on his list to be looked at.<br />
<br />
3. Fun Event in Dranik's Scar  <br />
Rashere told a bunch of us about a super cool event in Dranik's Scar. There is a named murkglider that spawns as a tiny little guy and he wanders around the zone. If he isn't killed, he gets hungry and eats things and gets bigger. The bigger he gets, his level and loot table changes until he ends up a raid group (3 groups, suitable for DS). Rashere says he turns GINORMOUS which I think is totally hilarious.<br />
<br />
4. EQ 2 stuff  <br />
Saw a flying carpet, which was really fun looking.  Argued with the EQ 2 guy that barb females are hideous with ugly upper lips and man hands, he liked em, go figure.<br />
<br />
EQ 2 server names will not be released until launch date. EQ 2 server names will not use EQ 1 server names in order to facilitate cross game tells. The intention is that you will be able to send tells back and forth between the two games. They wanted to use the existing inter-server tells, for example ;tell erollisi.gloriana will work between all servers in EQ 1 and EQ 2.<br />
<br />
5. Backflagging  <br />
Backflagging was a huge issue during the Guild Summit and came up at the Fan Faire. The plan is to extend the 85% rule to Time and some GoD zones. It may also be possible for &quot;piggy backed&quot; individuals in the zone to loot a quest item that will flag them for the zone.<br />
<br />
6. Next Expansion  <br />
Everyone was totally hush hush about the next expansion, even Rashere after several amaretto sours wouldn't spill any info. I did hear someone whisper the word &quot;dragons.&quot;<br />
<br />
7. New models  <br />
Okay, this one is kinda hazy because I'd been drinking margaritas during this conversation, but basically they are planning to change character models to make them more efficient. Once they are changed, they will be able to stuff more things in the global file (like new armor sets). Also, I remember the guy saying that they really wanted to put the new rat models into Freeport but that the Freeport zone is hard coded to only use the old rats, fun fact, eh?<br />
<br />
8. Fan Faire in General  <br />
This was my second Fan Faire and I had a GREAT time. About 15 people from my guild were in town (although only 3 of us were registered for the Fan Faire). New Orleans is a great place to visit, but it was way too hot for me. The hotel was in a perfect location, easy walking distance to great restaurants and fun things to do (lots of shopping!)<br />
<br />
After living in Seattle for 5 years, I was really surprised by all the smoking everywhere. It was pretty miserable for those of us who were sensitive to smoke. There were people smoking at the dinners, in the panels, you just couldn't get away from it. <br />
<br />
I thought the turn out was pretty good, but I heard it was about half of the last Vegas Fan Faire. I went to a bunch of the panels and enjoyed asking questions and hearing what other people had to say about the game. I had an awesome time at the server BoTB championship, Brenlo did an amazing job MCing the contest, he was really really funny.<br />
<br />
The final dinner was great, but the sound system was a little messed up, hard to hear what was going on. They passed out some great prizes, Vierge from my server won a spiffy keyboard.  I got right in front for the costume contest so I could hear everything. I was really impressed by the costumes (I wish my pictures had turned out better).<br />
<br />
I had a great time, can't wait for Vegas. My write up isn't that great, but Loral from Mobhunter wrote a really good one you can read here:<br />

Been kind of a crazy 2 days at work recovering from my 2 days not at work. I'll add to this list if I think of anything else!<br />

Last night I did notice a &quot;Newborn Murkglider Devourer&quot; in the southern part of the zone.  I was on a CR so no chance to kill it and see what happened.  &lt;--  Hey isn't that how we treat everything in EQ?  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dosn't the motto go: &quot;If you see a mob, kill it.  If it doesn't drop loots you were supposed to hail it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Worked for me so far in EQ :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this mob has been popping since omens went live, but in its early form a drunk rogue could solo it and I think it drops some decent lowbie gear so if its the one I'm thinking of it won't see old age much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its truly amazing that in a game as old as EQ the developers still dont know how people play their game. It would be obvious to a 5-year old that this kind of mob will ALWAYS be killed by the lowest common denominator (not meant as an insult in any way). It could even be killed by people that dont need it at all just to annoy others.<br />
<br />
They have sooooo many other things they could spend their time on yet they use it on something like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/agreed.  Nice idea, but probably won't work very well.  I was in DS showing a druid buddy where the camps were for the named ukuns (first time in zone, he wanted the augs).  He saw the little fella pop up on track and went over to take a look.  As soon as he dropped snare on it, a ranger ganked it from the other side and KS'd it.  He must have also seen it pop up on track and did not bother to determine if someone else was camping the mob, he just killed for himself.  I'm afraid this will happen more often then not and the little guy will never even see his 2nd birthday.  Now, if he spawned at different stages of maturity in a random fashion, that could be fun.  Imagine the thrill of being a level 50+ camping what you think is a green mob and a level 70 pops up instead.  :)  OK, I'm demented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The devouer needs to stay up for a long time to grow, i think it's around an hour between each jump in 5 levels after it pops.  The problem is it's a named that is low level at first so a lot of people kill it while it's new and no one sees it grow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Good write up Gloriana!  Thanks for all the info.<br />
<br />
Wasn't the mind worm in Ahkeva something like the murkglider?  and, if memory serves me, for the eci server, it never survived past the 3rd phase...  (people are hogs, they would rather have their shot at any gear - even if crappier than higher loot tables - rather than risk not getting the mob at all.)<br />
<br />
...but still interesting idea.  We'll see how it pans out.<br />
<br />
<br />
(I wish they would have that idea with instanced zones... every hour you are in it, the end boss gets better....)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No Excuse Gloriana but Fan Faire was right off the French Quarter and Bourbon Street.  With everything that goes on there I wasn't suprised with the smoke.   People aren't at the same standards in LA than East or West coasts.   Though I can say that many cities in Texas are limiting or pushing smoke outside or special clubs.  <br />
<br />
As to Fan Faire, it was nice to see all the EQ shirts wandering about places.   Nice turn out and fun time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The smoke is the one thing that I really hate about the anual vegas fan fair as well. The entire city smells like an ash try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hope those new GoD % flag zones include Qvic and not just KT.  Killing Barxt again with waning numbers is just not in the cards atm and dragging corpses all over creation is a bit tired as well. :p</div></div><hr />

The intention is that you will be able to send tells back and forth between the two games. They wanted to use the existing inter-server tells, for example ;tell erollisi.gloriana will work between all servers in EQ 1 and EQ 2.<br />
<br />
The carpet is the fastest mount in EQ2, so they'll be semi common as the cadillac to run around in.<br />
<br />
Player models have always been a hot item. I can't stand some of them, but hey to each their own.<br />
<br />
http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2?category.id=servers has a decent list of servers on it. I've also heard of a German and French localized server (Valor and Storms if memory serves).</div></div><hr />
