<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonemance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw that the formule was lvl x 5. So could it go up to 300? OR has it a cap of 200, 250? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">caps at 200</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zerglin Rush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they SO need to raise this cap, or maybe give us parry or even a mighty ripose! (im talking like some super AA point thing here, not free) hehehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd love to see dodge raised a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nothing seems wrong with raiding dodge a bit :| I tank so much, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xulak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tank a decent amount as well when warriors run OOM.  Who else is going to step in? *flex*<br />
<br />
I feel our defensive skills are fairly well balanced, have average gear for my level and tank well enough after the slow.<br />
<br />
Best tanking I ever did was when they broke our epic and turned it into a Heal over time spell instead of a dot.  Now that was insane fun for about 2 weeks.  Nothing like a 54 Shm (at the time) split tanking in Kael Arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm 46, and my defense is maxed at 200.<br />
<br />
Last night I finally got enough gear to raise my AC to 900 fully self buffed.  Since my defense is maxed, will I see a raise in AC as I get the next 14 lvls?   ie is there an AC bonus for each level not including Defense?</div></div><hr />

<br />
God I hate in when Warriors go OOM ;)<br />
<br />
They have raised the power of the mobs significantly over the past two expansions. We are long due for a raise in our dodge cap and or defensive skill cap.</div></div><hr />
