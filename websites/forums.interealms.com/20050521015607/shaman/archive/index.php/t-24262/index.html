<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has any crazy shaman Added Cleave and Ferocity to thier gear yet with the new augments.?<br />
<br />
Does it work for us?<br />
<br />
Could I become a 9% crit hitting 9% Double attacking Shaman o Doom with a couple pure augments?<br />
<br />
And with Rabid bear too... Wheee!<br />
<br />
Okay if it does work. Is the Drathor greathammer the biggest damn hammer I can find as a Non raiding. Non Uber shaman?<br />
<br />
And if any of you fine shaman have all three. What is the biggest rabid bear hit yall done and critted on? Hmm... I just might have to start leaning on some friends and barrow a drathor greathammer tonight.. I got a ferocity aug already but only a minor one. And I have not wanted to equip it till I get it fully specced to pure power. <br />
<br />
Anyways. I know it is a silly topic But for years I have had emote hot keys with crit hits on it. Big ones. And If I can actually do some of em... (Drools)<br />

<br />
9% of 0 is still 0 <br />
or rather 0 x 1.09 = 0<br />
<br />
but still worth a try, sometimes math is not everything :)</div></div><hr />

I miss the days of being a &quot;true&quot; Battle Priest. In those old days, I got right in there and tanked with ease. A double-attack or other combat ability would rock.<br />
<br />
P.S. One reason I might feel this way is I recently picked up Padded Tigerskin Gloves (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27000) DIRT cheap, heh.</div></div><hr />

I think that some overcapped stats are thought to increase crit rate. AAid comes with some overcap. I dont know if this has been proven by parses or not though, I dont keep up with the stuff on Steel Warrior. I am sure someone is parsing the efffects of Wunshi and AAid and Might and Sense, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes, it works just as the Bracer of Exploration would have:<br />

I always thought that melee crits simply doubled the base damage, but that isn't the case as shown above. And critical bashes are 10 instead of 2 for some reason....<br />
<br />
In theory, as cleave is &quot;Chance to critical hit (20)&quot;, IIRC it should be a 2% chance.<br />
<br />
As for Ferocity, that's &quot;increase double attack by x%&quot; and as we don't have double attack innately I suspect it would do nothing for us (except for rabid bear). On Beta there was a double attack tribute option, and despite having that up I didn't once see a double attack happen.<br />
<br />
(Edit: Dathor great hammer hits for 310 tops. I sold mine a long time ago, as someone dangling huge amounts of platinum under my nose was hard to ignore - I'd have said it should hit for 620 with a cleave effect, but as I've yet to see a crit exactly double the normal max of a weapon I'm not so sure now. Add Spirit of Might into the equation, or Champion, and those numbers would rise even further).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There is some formula for crits (before the Veteran's Wraith aa's in OoW) and I seem to think it was (max hit X 1.7) or something close to that. Now with veterans wraith it screwed that all up since your melee crits do more (I know we don't get the aa, I'm just stating for reasons of people using that formula on melee that do.)</div></div><hr />
