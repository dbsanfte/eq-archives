<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which is a better partner for a shaman? A paladin or a bard, this is not a 2 box situation and either would be pretty well twinked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say Pally.  We don't stack well with another primary buffer, which is what a Bard is, kind of.  Neither of these are the best for us, which I consider to be a Monk, a Ranger or a Mage</div></div><hr />

<br />
So would you say one of the best trios, would be Ranger, Mage and shammy?</div></div><hr />

You begin to cast Torpor...<br />
Your spell did not take hold!<br />
<br />
Bard tells the group, Haste please.<br />
You begin casting haste...<br />
Your spell did not take hold..<br />
<br />
Bards will regularly kill your pet with invis. If you are going to duo with a bard they pretty  much have to know how your spells inter act with thire song. Its very annoying to group with a bard that dosent know that thire self haste will only stack with ours if ours is the top buff we cant cast over thires. So the bard just sits there asking for haste that you cant stack on them. Same with Torp if they are playing speed song. Bards are ok but they have to know how to play. If it someone that just randonly twists songs be ready to get annoyed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calliopeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have to fully disagree.  My husband is a 62 shaman and I am a 60 bard, and we are an incredible team.  We regularly duo in places that are supposed to require a full group. At lower levels, bards don't have as many options as I do at 60, but a good bard who pays attention will work just fine with a shaman at any level.<br />
<br />
Since both shaman and bards are very powerful soloing classes, you can use those techniques but increase your efficiency by having a partner.  You'll have to find out which duoing techniques work best for each situation.  To give you a place to start, I'll give some examples.  <br />
<br />
Have the bard gather a pack of mobs and chant kite.  Once the bard has built up sufficient aggro on the target, the shaman can add in dots and nukes each time the swarm comes around to a set spot in the kite circle. (You can also have the bard swarm kite and the shaman speed it up, but this takes significant coordination and a shaman who really understands aggro in swarm kiting, so I don't recommend trying this until (1) the bard is excellent at swarm kiting, and (2) the shaman fully understands where the aggro is at any given time.)  Using chant or swarm kiting is best when you have a mass of mobs to handle at once.  We use this to do the shroom camp in Sebilis.<br />
<br />
You can use typical shaman soloing tactics when you have single mobs that hit too hard for the bard to efficiently tank. For example, in Crypt of Decay, we find it's best to use the shaman root/dot method.  To increase efficiency, I add my dots and sing mana regen.  I choose my dots so I am debuffing the same resists that are being checked with the shaman dots and nukes.  With this method, we don't ever have downtime where my husband has to sit and med. <br />
<br />
In all non-PoP zones and many areas within PoP Tier 1, I tank and my shaman husband slows and heals if necessary.  I know the general EQ community feels like bards can't hold aggro to tank because bards are excellent at shrugging off aggro in groups.  However, I can pull aggro off my husband after he slows using nothing but dots and SoS, and there are many other methods for bards to pull aggro.  With a regen at the start of the fight, I generally just require a torpor once the fight is over.  I have CA3/CS2 and decent HP and AC, so your mileage may vary, but there are always mobs that a bard can tank efficiently at every level.<br />
<br />
We can also duo and have our own little AoE group.  Shrooms in FG are awesome for this.  Bards have good AoE damage, along with AoE slow &amp; snare.  Shaman heals, bard does all the rest.  Great for you lazy shaman.  :)<br />
<br />
Now to address some of the others concerns that were listed.<br />
My girlfriend plays a bard and I have but one thing to say about them... <br />
You begin to cast Torpor...<br />
Your spell did not take hold!This is a bug.  Sony repeatedly breaks bard stacking in major patches, and then bards /bugreport until they get around to fixing it.  As far as I know, as of today, you should not get that 'your spell did not take hold' message ever.  If you do, help the community by asking the person who you were casting the spell on to list which bard songs are up in their bard song window, and list all of the spells in their main buff window.  See if you can repeat the bug by casting on yourself with the same bard songs up.  If you can, /bugreport and post your findings on The Concert Hall (http://pub147.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall)  or EQDiva (http://pub142.ezboard.com/beqdivabardsofeverquest).<br />
<br />
Bards will regularly kill your pet with invis. This takes an absolute minimum of coordination to solve.  If it's travel song that's killing your pets, sow yourself and that won't happen.  If your bard is using regular group invis to break charm and that's killing your pet, have her use hide instead.  It's not as reliable but very workable.  Even better, the courier cycle in LOIO is very easy and results in the goblin gazhugi ring.  This ring has a clickable invis to animals that works at any level and will break charm even if the charmed mob is not an animal.  At higher levels, get her the Tiny Cloak of Darkest night from the caller cycle in FG.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to address the issues with haste stacking.  Bards have 4 kinds of haste:  Self Haste, Regular haste, Overhaste, and Useless Haste.  :)<br />
<br />
Self Haste<br />
These haste songs only affect the bard.  The haste component of these songs won't stack with your hastes, but the other components will.  However, these songs have higher haste than shamans at that level, so save your mana.  This category includes:<br />
Jonathan's Whistling Warsong - Level 7 - 25% Haste<br />
Jonathan's Provocation - Level 45 - 50% Haste<br />
Jonathan's Inspiration - Level 58 - 63% Haste<br />
<br />
Regular Haste<br />
These are group haste songs and they do not stack with shaman haste.  The bard may choose to sing them anyway for the other stats they offers, and in that case, the group will get the other stats but whichever haste is greater will take effect.  If you can't cast while these songs are up, /bugreport.  Absor has clearly indicated that these are stacking bugs and will be addressed.  This includes:<br />
Anthem de Arms - Level 10 - 10% Haste<br />
Vila's Verses of Celerity - Level 36 - 20% Haste<br />
McVaxius' Berserker Crescendo - Level 42 - 23% Haste<br />
Verses of Victory - Level 50 - 30% Haste<br />
Villa's Verses of Celerity - Level 54 - 45% Haste<br />
McVaxius' Rousing Rondo - 20% Haste<br />
Warsong of Zek - Level 61 - 60% Haste (there is a known bug where VoG cannot be cast while this song is on)<br />
<br />
Overhaste<br />
These are the songs bards should be singing if you are hasting.  These songs stack with ALL shaman and enchanter haste spells, and WILL exceed the haste cap.<br />
Battlecry of the Vah Shir - Level 52 - 15% Overhaste<br />
Warsong of the Vah Shir - Level 60 - 25% Overhaste<br />
Rizlona's Call of Flame - Level 64 - 30% Overhaste<br />
 <br />
The Ervaj line is the Useless Haste.  Whoever came up with a 5% haste song that doesn't stack with other crucial bard songs and requires a brass instrument should be shot.<br />
<br />
Well, there's my 1pp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mafdet de Leone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have to fully disagree.  My husband is a 62 shaman and I am a 60 bard, and we are an incredible team.  We regularly duo in places that are supposed to require a full group.

<br />
Thanks for the lengthy post Calliopeia. I've never duo-ed with a bard before, and this will prove useful.<br />
<br />
However, I find that two classes work really well with shamans: Rangers and Necros. I regularly duo with my boyfriend, who is a ranger, and it's a great combination.<br />
<br />
I slow, cripple, and DoT, while he snares and tanks away. The dog is just extra DPS, and I can use him to hold off any adds, until we're finished with the mob we're currently fighting.<br />
<br />
In PoJ, we can take about 3-4 mob add (a 58 shaman and a 56 ranger) without too much of a problem on the first level.<br />
<br />
Necros are also good partners. Both necros and shamans are good solo-classes, and can work really well together. The necro feed the shaman mana, shaman provides extra STA and regen for the necro, as well as whatever necessary heals.<br />
<br />
The necro pulls with Dooming Darkness, and the shaman slows it. Both pets go into fight, and the necro fears it. Both shaman and necro land DOTs -- mob is dead in a few seconds. In the case of adds, fear or root works.<br />
<br />
When duo-ing with a necro, the two of us can go for hours without needing a med break, raking in a lot of XP and pp.</div></div><hr />
