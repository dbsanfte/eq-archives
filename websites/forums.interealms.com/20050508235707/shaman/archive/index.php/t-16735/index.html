<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On my server, we have a channel setup where 3 or 4 of the &quot;Big 6&quot; guilds hang out when looking for LDoN groups.This has led to a HUGE bonus. Guilds cooperating with each other for other things. <br />
<br />
Recently I have noticed a trend. We are getting more and more invites from other guilds to back-flag. We are also seeing a lot of other guilds' members joining our flag mob raids. This has allowed everyone involved to progress much faster, take a break from the big PITA PoP guys (*cough* MM, Bert *cough) and spend more time on the &quot;funner, quick hit&quot; stuff like Minis, the Zeks, etc. Heck, I am even getting tells from rival guild members to join XP groups, or help a run for a piece of loot or a quest item. <br />
<br />
There was always some back-flagging cooperation, even before LDoN. But nothing on the scale I have noticed since its release. I have always been a &quot;Less Guild vs Guild crap, more Co-Op&quot; kind of guy (note, my original Main, a Paladin, was kind of a big shot in the old old days, so I know TONS of people in ALL the guilds), but the stuff I have seen lately goes beyond anything I have seen. Just the other night, I was at a raid with my guild, and I got 3 tells, from 2 different guilds, asking if anyone in my guild needed a certain flag (they were co-opping). Before I could even relay the info to my officers, someone else was already announcing it in GC. Makes me feel pretty good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, I'm too cynical.  If that's working on your server, it sounds great.</div></div><hr />
