<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so I really don't care about the FP faction, being iksar and all, and was just wondering if anyone had hunted in freeport during these levels.  I did a search and didn't come up with anything so either I need to hit a necro board or ... just go and see *gasp*<br />
<br />
=)<br />
<br />
Any iksars out there that have tried this and found relatively good spots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've seen others post on the FP guards, they were hunting the ones near the arena. Haven't tried it myself, tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This information only pertains to wfp as I haven't hunted extensively in efp.<br />
<br />
There are 3 guards near the nfp and efp zones that should still be blue at 44. 1 wanderer should be blue. 1 wanderer should be green and yet another light blue.<br />
<br />
2 (kroon and inofus) wander around and are much tougher than the others.<br />
<br />
Your main problem will be with their high resists. Don't know about pr or dr, but their mr is incredibly high. Money is good though, especially once you get good faction with Knights of Truth. Turn the helms into the paladin guild leader for a few platinum. They always carry at least a Short Sword, sometimes a Kite Shield, sometimes a fs short sword along with the other two.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: This info was gathered from hunting here sporadically as a 43-49 paladin. With malx you may have better luck.</div></div><hr />
