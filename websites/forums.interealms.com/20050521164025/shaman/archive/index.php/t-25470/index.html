<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>djrhoads</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there any way to tell by looking at Lucy's raw data how many counters spells have that can be removed with  Pure Spirt ?<br />
<br />
Spells with traditional cures say how many  counters they have  such as 32 Curse counters or  12 poison Counters.<br />
<br />
Im considering attemting to use Pure Spirit for the RZ event to remove for example Tallon's Balance from the MA  a spell which lowers all resist by 300 .  <br />
<br />
The question is ; how many cast of Pure Spirit would it take ?.<br />
<br />
Where in the raw data of a spell would it say how many counters it has or could the number of counters be determined based on the Duration of the spell being looked at ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pure spirit doesn't have counters. It removes spells with out any counters. It has 6 chances to cure from lucy which is the same as RC3. Which in my experience is pretty good chance. Not always but pretty good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ok understood.   So is there a better way to figure out the chances of it actually dispelling the detrimental spell.   Vallons Precision is different then Planeshift  but is Pure Spirit more likely to remove one then the other ?  Or is the chance the same for all non Counter spells.  <br />
<br />
Is it for example a 20% chance to remove a detremental spell each time in 6 tries ?<br />
<br />
There has to be a percentage chance.</div></div><hr />
