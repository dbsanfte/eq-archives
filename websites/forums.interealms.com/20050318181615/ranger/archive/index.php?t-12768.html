<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velondra</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen some things mentioned in other threads but perhaps we could collect it all in one place so that it is easy to look up which mobs in which zone have been confirmed dropping parchements. <br />
<br />
 With 20+ hours hunting the planes (nightmare, disease, innovation and justice) I have yet to see one parchement drop, so I think it must be a specific few mobs who drop them. This is what I have *heard* can drop them so far:<br />
<br />
 PoJ: Punishers/enforcers<br />
 PoD: ratmen or rats, person was not specific<br />
 PoN: spiders, *Infernal Consort, spectral parchment<br />
 PoI: *tin soldiers- etherial parchment<br />
<br />
 If possible note exactly what kind of mob dropped the parchement so we can be as accurate as possible. (For instance there are 3 or 4 sub species of arachnids in PoN, maybe we will find only one or two drop the parchments.) :)<br />
<br />
* before a mob name means a poster confirmed the drop.</div></div><hr />

I turned my spectral parchment into Pathfinder Vikilen (sp?) in PoK.  I hear that you can turn the Ethereal parchment into another pathfinder for L62 spells (the Pathfinder who sells WP iirc).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reandn</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay here are my PoD ethereal parchment drop secrets:<br />
<br />
I have gotten 5 parchments out of PoD, 4 of them when I was soloing:<br />
<br />
Rankle (named ooze): drop rate 2 out of 4 for kills I was involved in.  Spawns anywhere you can find ooze-mobs (middle of the zone).  Data from friends I have talked to place the drop rate lower than 50% though (i.e. they claim he always drops nothing), so maybe I have been lucky.<br />
<br />
Carrion Larva (might have last part of name wrong, it is carrion-something, and is a wurm thing): drop rate 2 for 2.  The first one of these I killed enraged (making him 57+?), second one did not enrage.  <br />
<br />
Scaevian larva: drop rate 1 for 1.  This is one of the mobs for the Grimror quest, PH is Tsetsian Pupa (note odd spelling: other similar mobs are called Tsetsian Pupae).<br />
<br />
All of these were easily soloable with EQ/AM3 using root and shoot.  The only tricky part is safely pulling them single to a good fighting spot.  None are casters.<br />
<br />
I also was involved in a failed Grummus raid, and we saw perhaps 4 ethereal and 1 spectral parchment drop off the mobs on the way to Grummus (spectral was off of Aramin I think).  Ethereals were off named and the hockey stick and mage guys.<br />
<br />
I have also seen and heard of ethereal parchment dropping off of Diseased Underbulks and Diseased Malarians.  I think the drop rate on these is quite low, and these are among the highest level &quot;normal&quot; mobs in the zone, which is why they do drop, just rarely.<br />
<br />
My advice on hunting in POD: Kill the things with the weird names.  I have been doing a lot of soloing here, both looking for quest items and because I can solo and get XP while LFG.  I love this zone because very few things see invis, and I have Innate Camo (Innate Camo rocks!).<br />

Sorry I do not remember which mob it was but it was one of the non-named bugs (some kind of beetle or another). Rare drop as we have combed the caves several times before and that was the first time I have seen a parchment drop there.</div></div><hr />
