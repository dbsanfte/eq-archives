Really?  This will help out a LOT for Vox raids and such!  Wonder what level the port is...</div></div><hr />

It's amazing what a little competition will do to people when they have issues that people have been bitching about for over 2 years.  Not having a port spot closer than NK was a complete screwup on their part.  Glad to see that some of these age old issues are finally being addressed.  <br />
<br />
Anything to keep rolling in the almighty buck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well.. I might just have to swing by home and get these spells.. :)<br />
<br />
I would not be so quick to judge that many of the changes are because VI finally got some competition.. I would also put some stock into the fact that Brad and a lot of the stagnation he fostered has been shown the door by VI. <br />
<br />
Who would of thought of players as monsters to have some fun?</div></div><hr />

As of the Patch on 11/7/2001 a new Druid Port is now available. Ring and Circle of Surefall Glade can be purchased in Surefall Glade from Raken in the Hut in the center of the lake. the self only Ring is lvl 19 and the group Circle is lvl 29. They cost around 16 pp and 27 pp respectively.</div></div><hr />
