<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the increase of ornate stuff for sale ive notice an increase of people trying to make an easy buck. They will put some cheap Ornate Chain bracelet up for sale. The difference is it isnt &quot;Ornate Chain Bracelet PATTERN&quot;. The patter turns into an armor piece after you combine it the non pattern is just cheap armor. They will either sell it cheap or put it in right with the other items for sale but little less so to get mixed in. IF the item says ornate and looks like an armor piece you dont want it. All the ornate stuff is patterns or molds which get no failed combined. Sorry if this has been posted already i havent seen it and wanted to be safe. Been seeing alot of bracelets and gloves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah I noticed that, and the idiots are the ones who price them up. You have to pay particular attention if and when you do buy ornate as Shilzah says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same idiots that buy Kragg's Mending from the vendor for 25p and put it on sale in the bazaar for 500p.</div></div><hr />

First, ornate chain is a skill up route for smithing, and some people try to recoup cost on this really terrible armor. There was ornate chain armor for sale before ornate patterns became more widely available.<br />
<br />
Second, the names ARE rather different, but the inventory icons are not even *CLOSE*. Ornate chain looks like armor, patterns look like scrolls or research components.<br />
<br />
Anyone who gets suckered by this deserves it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ornate patterns look like ethereal or spectral parchments.<br />
<br />
Yep, I've seen the people selling vendor spells for stupid prices too. Saw one guy selling the level 19 Malaise for 500 plats. I guess they think we're real stupid. I also chewed out some chucklehead shaman who was selling Avatar for 45K. There were two copies of Ferine Avatar for 17K, and the research components for Primal Avatar were even less at the time.</div></div><hr />

If I see summon companion for 500pp in the bazaar, I will buy it. I am just that lazy.. some people twink their shammy and want the convenience of not going to the library or whatever to get their stuff.. who want to go to FV? (if you still need to go there for turgurs)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes Gus this is obvious. However you always have to be aware of the deceitful people that try to make a quick profit by similar names or for example of one case, the druids spell natures infusion I think it was, was added one patch. Not every druid knew about it, so this one druid took advantage of that sold it in the bazaar for about 2k. I think he made a fair bit of profit. Needless to say he got flamed, and rightfully so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think it's ok for people to ask what they want in an auction - and it's equally ok to holler at ones for whatever reason you want.  <br />
<br />
If I see a someone with a silly auction, I'll probably ignore it, but then again I may not.  This idea that it's taboo to comment on other people's auctions is silly to me.  You bet it's fair game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Normally, I do ignore it, Gus. But this guy was /ooc spamming his 'great' prices and something he said tipped me off his main was a shaman. Really pisses me off when shamans jack up prices on our spells - they should know better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fair enough, intentionally trying to scam people in game for plat is pretty nasty.  Aswell finally Torpor and such spells prices are plumeting thanks to Chardok B.  I was just saying buying a vendor sold spell and selling it in the bazaar is a fair way to make a bit of plat off of peeps who have tons of money and would rather just grab it in the bazaar.  Small side point on people flaming others auctions, I burned an old main down from 61 to 45, and sold the essence emeralds, they go for between 350-450 plat on my server.  Nothing like a person shouting zonewide &quot;Who the hell would pay 400p for that?  Blah, blah, blah.&quot; <br />
Was rather annoying.  Small pet peeve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;A fool and his money are soon parted&quot;<br />
<br />
The thing about the bazaar, is that it requires you to do research.  Typically, there's very little contact between buyer and vendor.  If someone wants to put vendor spells and useless items on their trader for 2-20k, that's fine with me.  If you are actively trying to cheat someone, then I think you're out of line.  People that offer MQ's and never fullfill once they're paid, can go to hell.  I'm totally against that.  But if Joe Dingbat isn't smart enough to get on allakhazam for 2 minutes to see if this item is exactly what he needs, then I have no pity for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Noticed a couple traders trying this on my server too. Haven't seen anyone trying to actively hawk it but it's still a scam in my opinion. A much more passive one but still a scam. There's not valid reason to sell any peice of the smithed ornate armor for anywhere near the prices these people listed them at. They are obviously relying on people to miss the fact that it isn't a pattern by pricing it comparable to the patterns. It's also complicated by the fact that the plate armor molds are just ornate bracers or ornate helm or what ever. Should people be able to spot this scam easily, yeah but that true of almost every scam out there.<br />
<br />
Importing things to the bazaar is perfectly valid way to make money. There is some grey in it when new spells are added and people may not know where they can be obtained but for the most part it's perfectly valid.</div></div><hr />

LOL your pretty harsh. I'm just giving a warning from an increase in this ive seen. I think its wrong people try to do this and i'm wasnt planning just sititng buy and letting people make a mistake. Yes the icons looks different before you make it. BUT after you finish it the icon (not the stats) look like a chain bracelet or gloves. Someone can get confused. <br />
<br />
  ANYWAY I'm just looking out for shaman community kinda thought what we did here. I think its wrong people jacking up prices to make that crap look like the real thing but no where in my post did i say anything about stopping them. Buyer beware Its free market and you have to pay attention HENCE the warning. Just consider this a look both ways before crossing sign.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">people with 50k level 50 spells are not dumb, they are hoping you buy the wrong spell from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I didnt say they were stupid, I said their prices were stupid. I know exactly what they're trying to do - betting on somebody else's ignorance or accidental mouse-click.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When you auction, you begin the haggle.<br />
<br />
Its all fair haggleing over the price in /ooc or /auc, specially if the person is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Whenever I purchase anything in the bazaar, I make a point of not having too much money on me.  If the price changes by the time I get to the seller, I'd rather find out by not being able to buy the item.<br />
<br />
Also, LOOK at what you buy.  If you mistake an ornate chain pattern for ornate chain armour, then a) you made a pretty expensive mistake and b) the seller is scum.<br />
<br />
I think a much more likely source of confusion is the plate molds.  The &quot;ornate greaves mold&quot; looks identical to the &quot;greaves mold&quot;, for example, and the names are very similar.  <br />
<br />
I guess the bottom line is buyer bewarre; do your research or you may find yourself wearing some very poor smithed armour you paid a premium price for.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Exactly Deria good post. All i was going for. I already have my wrists but seen alot of orante junk posing as patterns and they seem to sell. People selling (2) or (3) will have less later and at smaller prices. I dont agree it at all but my point wasnt to witchhunt people selling the stuff. Just  take an extra second while your buying. I wont post to this anymore but was just in bazaar and see more of this junk up and that some had sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Personally, I have more disgust for the people trying this scam than for the people who fall for it.<br />
<br />
While I won't verbally attack someone who's doing it in game ( I may send them a tell though), I do make a mental note not to buy from them in the future. I also usually make a note in guild chat about who is trying to pull a fast one in case anyone else feels the same.<br />
<br />
I don't think the unfortunate sod who falls for it 'deserves' it. I'd rather see a community that ousts or ignores scam artists than mocks someone who makes a mistake and buys it. Laughing at the buyer just seems malicious to me.<br />
<br />
This is a game. Anyone who goes out of their way to ruin the enjoyment of that game for someone else should not be accepted. My opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sorry dont hate me but reading back the way i worded my first post and think i caused some confusion. <br />
<br />
Simply put...Ornate Chain bracelet patterns turned into scaled avatar stuff which is our good armor.<br />
<br />
Ornate chain braclets are junk but people will slap a 20k price tag on them to appear &quot;cheap&quot; compared to a normal priced Ornate Chain Bracelet PATTERN. Or 12k for a quick sell. <br />
  <br />
   If anyone thinks i just was having a fit over people trying to recoup some smithing loss sorry for the confusion but not what i meant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I agree 100% with this being a scam and I think that gm's should give warning and ban the next time to sellers who are trying to scam.  But, as of this date guides and gm's won't even give a warning even though they certainly know what's up by now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">buyer beware.  Scams like this are a small price to pay for readily available armor for people 55+ that is superior to any other armor set that doesn't require a raid to get.  <br />
The focus effects are simply uber, and being able to get FT2 on two bracers is simply amazing.  All in all, making this armor set reasonably available to all is probably overpowering, and certainly worth the balance of having a few scams in the works.  <br />
<br />
I do agree tho, such scammers are scum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've seen folks trying to sell batwings for 10k each in the bazaar... you just have to watch what's for sale and know what you're looking at ... all sales are final - and that's been SOE's word from the start.<br />
<br />
Vendors can charge what they want.  Buyers can pay what they want.<br />
<br />
What gets me with the bazaar is when folks are auctioning something that's normally 2k and you ask a price, and invariably they come back and say - well, they're selling for 15k in bazaar, just because someone happens to have one for 15k on his vendor-mule.<br />
<br />
Waaay too many folks don't make a distinction between &quot;sells for&quot; and &quot;someone has one priced at&quot; ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Hexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Keep in mind that not all people that sell batwings or water/food for 1k+ are scammers or idiots.<br />
<br />
It's a system used to transfer money between mules, when the mule owners aren't online at the same time for a few days.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Batwing: 10,000pp<br />
Water: 1,000pp<br />
Food: 100pp<br />
<br />
You want to transfer 12,500pp, you buy 1 batwing, 2 water and 5 food from that player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">So just to recap...<br />
<br />
It's ok to take advantage of someones ignorance.<br />
<br />
But it's NOT ok to take advantage of someones stupidity.<br />
<br />
Got it</div></div><hr />
