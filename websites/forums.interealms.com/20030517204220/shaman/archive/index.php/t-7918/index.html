<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been trying lots of different combos so far just to check the world out... right now I am focusing on a dwarf pally though... have a low level shaman too although halas area crashes alot so far...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We'd like to announce the end of the strict EverQuest Online Adventures NDA period.  Please feel free to discuss the game on fansites and outside forums. <br />
<br />
I'm very impressed with the graphics and controls, no problems so far with little Thantu in and around Halas.  My major gripe would have to be the lack of feedback regarding hits/misses/and damage though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My potential problems I have noticed other than the conectivity issue with sever load would be the low level quests.  I see those causing some major problems at release if they intend to increase the numbers on the server.  Even now I could see people fighting over the 5 and 7 level quest mobs causing the normal mistrust and bickering and such. <br />
<br />
 Last night I was doing the 5 quest with my paladin and I had to kill a red con mob to get the item.  I couldnt find help so I went out to the area where the mob spawns and found a 9 level pali there and so I asked if he could help me in my quest.  He said he already had a group and as soon as his partner came back if they killed the orc shaman then I could loot it.  I gave my thanks and went around the lake killing what I could to gain xp when I get a tell from the pali as they were taking down a shaman.  So I run over and as soon as it falls his buddy loots the mob and tells me to &quot;beat it scavenger.&quot;<br />

Same mentality same rude people.</div></div><hr />

My wife and I are both in the beta.  My initial impression is that it's visually very pleasing, but the interface is a bit clunky if you do NOT have a keyboard.  My wife uses a keyboard, I intentionally did not get one, but I think I may get one because it's a pain to use without it - you just can't talk to anyone except canned, preplanned responses.  Definately plan on getting a keyboard if you are going to play this game.<br />
<br />
The newbie quests seem very well planned out.  They remind me of the newbie quests for the Luclin release - they'll take you to lvl 3-5 no problem before they set you loose.  However, the problem with any of that is that when the floodgates open and people start pouring in, they will indeed be fighting each other over rats and bats and the like, no question.  Give it a few weeks to stabilize, but it's going to be hell the first few weeks.<br />
<br />
I have had persistent connection problems, and have reconfigured my LAN a couple of different ways with no luck.  We always get dropped after 15-45 minutes online.  If we attempt to take two PS2s on line at the same time, the second machine connects, and then usually within 1 minute (but once it took 5 minutes) one or the other connection will drop.<br />
<br />
Our LAN configuration is a LinkSys BEFW11S4 (V2) wireless router, connected to a LinkSys WET11 wireless bridge, connected to a LinkSys 4-port hub.  Wireless connectivity is good in the location we're using it, I've checked it with a laptop in that location.  I can play PC EQ on that laptop no problem over the same connection.<br />
<br />
So with the constant disconnects, it's really tough to get a good reading on how the game is.  I've only played through level 8 or so.<br />
<br />
I like the way death is handled, targeting (cycle through visible targets), the graphics, the quests.  However, if you are a PC EQ player, I'm not sure that there's a whole lot here for you to make you want to switch.  Graphics aren't enough, at least not for me.  I haven't gotten high enough to see what the midgame is like, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got Tannus up to lvl 24 in beta 1. <br />
I have grown used to the controls, the targeting takes a bit to catch on to though. So long as you get out of certain zones you can get by without ever droping. <br />
I have a troll shaman Kamluk for beta 2, up to lvl 15 now....spent most of my time in and around klik`anon...besides the fun of being a troll and killing one of the low level guards over and over while taunting the gnomes...there is rogue clockworks and kera village zones with very little lag.<br />
<br />
Hrothgar...you say a dwarf paladin?  Named Hrothgar by chance?<br />
My dwarf pali is Tannara if you remember me, hehe...but I am focused on Kamluk right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No I didnt get Hrothgar as it became popular after that 13th warrior fiasco :( I have to settle to use Hrothy now.</div></div><hr />
