<br />
Next highest on server that isn't anon/roleplay is a 63 cleric.<br />
<br />
:o<br />
<br />
edit: I don't support calling for nerfs to other classes, I just find it ironic that he's the first 65 on the server :D</div></div><hr />

He must have 'boted a shaman duo I guess.  Since we're so overpowering and all, according to him. :p<br />
<br />
I also don't advocate nerfing other classes until it takes away from others enjoyment of the game, a'la Manaburn groups.<br />
<br />
I will refrain from commenting on what he must have done (and sacrificed IRL) to get so far so fast.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

That's impossible, you know...you're so overpowered you should be nerfed! Stop lying!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Temuchin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">heh thott...<br />
<br />
he wasn't the first 65<br />
<br />
a rogue from my old guild (before they moved to the legends server and became TR) who also 3 or 4 boxed did it<br />
<br />
for exp, multi-boxing is and always has been the way to go in EQ.    it's also a sure way to burn out too (I've quit and come back 3 times)<br />
<br />
but hey, as long as he's exping he isn't riling up trouble for shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So much for &quot;Alternate leveling.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Was he a beta tester? Fvcktard verant gave them insta-65.<br />
<br />
and you obviously have proof of this...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I know how he did it.<br />
<br />
First he plotted a graph simulating the mobs and the exp required to level to 65. Second he plotted another graph simulating the cost to his sanity and progress in the &quot;other reality&quot; sometimes referred to as RL. <br />
<br />
Then by correlating the differential variation of the coefficient of integer refluxuation between the two simulations, he produced another simulation that proved bards can dual wield at twice the speed of light. <br />
<br />
Acting on his simulation, he was able to implement this &quot;leet strat(TM)&quot; allowing him to multi-tank all the dragons in WW at once, while strumming his banjo, whistling on his conch and beating on his ole tin drum. <br />
<br />
In fact it actually only took 3.5 secs to level from 61-65. The delay in getting to 65 was caused when he tried to take himself seriously and self-combusted in a flare of contradicting epistemologies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yah ok we get the point.  There isn't a goddam shaman anywhere (cept maybe Jenamdar) who can stand this guy.<br />
<br />
Nice work Thott.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thott did have a shaman, the graphs says he needed one :) We did a 6 person group for 3 days, long camps, and all hit 65 Thursday. Although I must say all this crap on the boards about it is rather comical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">So you didnt use any of those betatest-&quot;tokens&quot; that Furor and friends were so mad about?<br />
<br />
Then there might be hope for the rest of us too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I believe that to be perfectly possible.  My favorite spot these days is Chardok Kennels.  With a nice group with high dmg and good players you can REALLY rack up the exp!  Let's put it like this: each kill gives several pixels of AA exp in a full group.  And with the mobs having high ZEM and high exp bonuses and group exp bonuses and low hps (so they die fast), exp flys like crazy.<br />
<br />
If you had no real life to worry about and could stand to do something like that, well then, there you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you were in the betatest, the information advantage alone can go a long way towards quicker levelling. No surprises there, no tokens needed.<br />
<br />
You cant do brainwipe on Beta Testers, and you have to test the expansion.<br />
<br />
Id rather have some people at Level 65 rather quick and content tested than an expansion full of bugs!<br />
<br />
Edit: I suspect there are places with better XP gain on PoP than Chardok Kennels.</div></div><hr />

Will it be comical if his fabricated charts get you nerfed?</div></div><hr />

this morning i saw a 62 bard on sol ro no 63's didnt check for higher lvs <br />
<br />
Same bard is 63 now.  He's soloing(not quad boxing).  Should be 64 sometime this morning EST, and 65 tomorrowish.  It's a race!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Theres a 65 monk on povar...last night saw him in chardok he was 4 boxing... <br />

Heh.  Kung is the man =)  I know noone else who can multi-box a bard really at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well ... since everyone is trading storys ;) ... on Veeshan FoH was in and out of PoD while I was soloing around the zonein.   Last check just for grins ... Furor was 62, 15 FoH'ers were 63, and a couple were 64.   None of the FoH'ers were anon ... so it was easy to check.<br />
<br />
Looks like Thott and Afterlife were more into topping out than content searching.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm kind of curious what your take is on all this, Jenamdar? Are you in agreement with his call for nerfage?<br />
<br />
If you don't mind my asking :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Keldain Silvermyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I still say I'd wait until an important mob was at hand and play as a nerfed shaman...cast lowest slow, or not slow at all, use lowest dots, not use right clickies...and after the TPW say &quot;Hey...you said you wanted me nerfed. There ya are! :)&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Thott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I levelled to 65 almost entirely with this group:<br />
<br />
  BRD (me!)<br />
  SHM (Jenamdar)<br />
  ROG (Hobben)<br />
  CLR (Arele)<br />
  MAG (Peorth)<br />
  WAR (Waihung)<br />
<br />
They're all level 65 now.  The mobs we kiilled the most of do about 130 dps...with shaman slow.<br />
<br />
The reason I hit 65 first is when the rest of the group got tired and went to bed, I was still feeling energetic, so I joined another (Afterlife) group.  Naturally I joined one that also had a shaman.<br />
<br />
In fact, now that I think about it, I haven't gained a single point of xp since PoP opened that didn't involve a shaman, either in my group, or on a raid.<br />
<br />
Gimp bards!<br />
<br />
--Thott<br />
Guildleader<br />
&amp;lt;Afterlife&amp;gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The interesting part of the group is that there were 2 priests.  Any cleric  worried about shaman healing taking their place in a pop group needs to lay off the pipe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BRD (me!) <br />

 <br />
<br />
With all due respect, I believe that group you quote is indeed a balanced exp group.<br />
<br />
You have the Slows/Mezzes/Hastes mana-regen of the Shaman/Bard combo.<br />
<br />
You have the Healing/Resses/Buffs of the Shaman/Cleric/Bard.<br />
<br />
You have the tanking of the Warrior/Bard<br />
<br />
You have the Damage of the Rogue, Warrior and the Mage (with his/her pocket pet and nukes) and minor damage contributions from Bard, Shaman and Cleric.<br />
<br />
That shows the interdependant dynamic of the classes perfectly.<br />
<br />
I'm curious tho. You speak about 130 DPS (with Slow). Why didn't you remove the Cleric? Your graphs indicate the Cleric was pointless in that group?<br />
<br />
I suggest :<br />
<br />
1) The Cleric is a good person, a good player, and brings abilities to the group that were significant and/or essential. Enough to warrant and earn a spot in an Uber No-Holds Barred Experience Group From Hell.<br />
<br />
In addition a Druid would have fitted nicely in that group as well.<br />
<br />
I dunno man, your in-game practice doesn't match up with your assertions.<br />
<br />
For the record, I group with Clerics and Druids A LOT. I find that the synergism we all enjoy from grouping allows us a much more rewarding, low risk, high reward gaming experience. In my groups the Bard is usually replaced by an Enchanter, but I have also had great fun and awesomely productive experiences with a Chanter/Bard combo in the group.<br />
<br />
In short, it's the very synergism that your group benefited from that shows that the classes do work together and one class is not Prime in all areas.<br />
<br />
Anyway, grats on 65, and I hope that your Simulations don't result in changes that degrade your gaming experience as well as everyone elses.<br />
