<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know its been done a million times but tonight Yeldema took a dirt nap by my hands. Dog-dog did not accompany me on this fight since last time i think i think his low level caused adds. <br />
Fight went very fast 2 Poxs 2 Banes 5 epics 10,000 jbb blasts little melee in between blasts and she fell to the ground and presented me with boots and bear form spell. ( And i actually wanted the darn tailsman for twink ..figures)<br />
<br />
I dont really think fight lasted much longer than about 7-10 min, i fought her right at her nest and didnt get any adds till a cragwurm started to bite me as i was looting No screenie of corpse ;( hit the old gate button back to bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That freakin rules. Grats, I can't wait till I can do that someday. Way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kohos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">gratz, since theres no SS i think we need to see your artist rendering of the fight )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah dog dog is the way to go...I can kill her in ~5 mins with dog dog (bane but no pox).  Also, a horse helps alot if you arent meleeing or moving, and on a horse thats costa med so nice mana regen (how much mana a tick is 252 med?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sorry, a bit new here, but how does having a horse help with meditation? Just sitting in between rounds of melee while the mob is slowed or letting the dog do the work? Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">don't turn on attack and you regain mana like your medding while sitting on a horse.<br />
<br />
I'm 99% sure you regain mana even while casting or using a JBB too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm, I've never heard of that. I might get a cheap horse just for looks anyhow. Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Woot - congrats :)<br />
<br />
Is it possible for an iksar shaman to do this - given that we can't get the JBB? <br />
<br />
Just wondering if this is something I should shoot for when I'm all grown up :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeldema = Dooable by iksars, the aoers are dooable too imho (Hechaeva down to 20%, I had 40m, but a velium hound decided to play tug a tail with me mid fight).<br />
<br />
The dragons are not the problem once you get the tactics down, the adds are what will kill you.<br />
<br />
Oh, is the horse med bug still definately in?  Its definately worth burning 10k on a donkey just for that =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Really its no longer a bug, they just wanted it so ya couldnt melee and med...so still med while jbbing (or cast any other spell for that matter).</div></div><hr />
