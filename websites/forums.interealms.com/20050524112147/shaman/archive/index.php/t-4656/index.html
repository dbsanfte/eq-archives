<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm going to hit 49 soon and it seems that DL exp is dwindling. KC is possibly the worst zone in the game so I really don't want to go there, but is there anywhere else where I can easily find pick up groups?<br />
<br />
Also looking for places to solo without JBB/epic.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Exp in Kc can kick ass and be alot of fun. Just dont hang out in the front courtyards. Dogtower is alot of fun with no enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry to say it, but you don't want to solo, you're gonna want to stick it out in KC for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you know a few people go make a trip to the hole.  Just take your group down to the drop down area and you should be fine.  You should take a chanter and an evacer of some sort with you, and remember that the golems can't be mezzed so no matter what you are on if you get a golem have everyone jump on it.  I guess you could ghetto mez, if you can't find a chanter.  The great thing about the hole is there is nobody ever there :) They seem to all be afraid to go beyond the train city of KC and the crappyness of velks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I find most of my groups in guildchat.  <br />
<br />
I fail to see how you can call KC worse that DL...they're both awful. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I loved hunting in KC if you could get deep enough where other people didn't bug you.  Hand room, basement, good choices for good fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In my experiences KC didnt get to be fun or good xp until I hit 54. Then it was great. Before 54 xp was crap and I would get pounded into the pavement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree MekuDeku and Glorianna both.  KC is fun at 54/55 if you get away from the entrance - sewers, hand, basement.  Before that, I spent more time CR'ing than XP'ing in there.<br />
<br />
Other possible locations for a lvl 50 - get a partner and do the BW giant fort or Kael entrance mobs; maybe Velks or even Kael arena in a full group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm doing Velks at 51, although they seem to need clerics more than shamans.<br />
<br />
I'm working on my 5th shawl, and I need those no-drop threads, so I really have to grind it out there for awhile... I got 11 threads in an hour last night though. Then the zone crashed and I was down to 7 and my rezz effects came back. Arrrggg. Then we got trained over and over as people popped in when the zone came back online, and ran non-invis up the ramp past the FW camp we were holding.... eight spiders and a statue. Thanks guys!<br />
<br />
Icky icky icky.<br />
<br />
I refuse to do KC though, I went there twice and ended up doing hour long CR's. I'd rather solo than put up with that. Although Velks was great until the zone crash.<br />
<br />
XP not much to write home about though, but ok....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you don't wanna do KC, Velks is okay. The mobs are a bit resistant to slows. Expect that and spend your mana accordingly. The Hole is really fun. As others mentioned, bring your own group and have someone who can evac you out. I've avoided KC myself until now, at 54. I've got a monk friend who's camping Pawduster(?) for the KC pipe (for monk epic). It's been really fun. For me, the key is that I'm playing with guildmates and close friends, so my groups are great. I understand your reluctance to just go into KC and get in a standard pick-up group. My worst group ever was in KC. I was with a warrior who couldn't taunt, two monks who couldn't single pull and a poor cleric who had too much on his plate. The BW fort sounds like a good idea too, but I've never hunted there, so i can't say. I'd suggest finding out where your friends like to hunt and tag along, even if you're a bit low to group there (within reasonable limits of course).</div></div><hr />
