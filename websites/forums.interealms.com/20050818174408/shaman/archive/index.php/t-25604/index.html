<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi, between those 2 augments,wich one's the best for us.<br />
<br />
and what they really do?<br />
<br />
thx for the info...........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd go with Spell Shield myself. Call it personal preference or whatever.<br />
<br />
Spell Shield reduces the amount of damage you take by x% from DD component of the spell, and stacks, up to I think 35% total max. I could be wrong on the max % though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, it's hard to justify one being better than the other.  Each type will reduce the overall dmg taken by each AE/dot.  So, if you had 5% spell shield and got hit by say a 1000hp direct dmg, and it hit you for full (meaning you didn't resist it at all), you would get hit for 950hps.  If you got hit for a dot which takes away 1000hp per tick, and you had 5% dot shielding, then every tick you would lose 950hp.  The max effectiveness on any one of these is 35, so anything over that and you will not gain any additional benefits.<br />
<br />
Personally, I found it easier to get spell shield, and if you are doing stuff say pre-mpg/anguish then I would suggest that you maybe worry about more spell shield than dot shielding.  I think that omens and maybe even the later part of GoD Dot shielding started being real useful as you started getting hit with more and more dots and they started becoming big factors.  In placs like, the Adaption trial when you have the Fire dot on you you can really tell the people who do not have any dot shielding, as opposed to those who do.  <br />
<br />
Also, not sure how your guilds loot system is, but I've managed to acquire a few items that while I won't wear them, they are pretty decent spell shield/dot shielding/shielding gear that I switch out when I think it's best appropriate to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">about our guild....we had some problem since the WOW and other game realeased.we went from about 40 to 45 raiding to about 20 to 25.<br />
i am POfire flagged and KT.<br />
<br />
i just got my highest HP so far lately raid buffed (8120 hp),i got about 830 aa or so tho.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">another question pls.<br />
<br />
wich one the easiest to get from items.<br />
<br />
affliction eff. V  or extendent enhancement V ?<br />
<br />
i could try  one as oow augment..........i am pofire / KT flagged  atm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">neither are very easy to get, but depending on where you guys are raiding will determine it.  Coirnav has a nice item that extends the length of your buffs, and the only two items that I know of that directly give you mp on dots are the earring in time from VZ, and the bracer from the KT single group trials (i think it's the second one.. called Bracer of the Fearsome).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bracelet of the Fearsome is from Diabolic Destroyer in Temple of Singular Might (first trial).<br />
<br />
If you guys ever get to PoTime, there are 2 items from Phase 2 that have Eterninostrum, and also there's that belt from Veeshan's Peak with that focus also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Belts in my magelo, Pulsing Onyx ring as Chronostrum which is better than Eternostrum, drops from CT (Phase 5) in Time, hoping to get it myself soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">affliction eff. V  or extendent enhancement V ?<br />
Tribute, the total answer to total focus coverage. Tribute what you need until you get an item to fill the role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have a small qualifier on those items though.<br />
<br />
If you are using level 70 spells, all those items just listed won't work.  :(  SoE made getting &quot;upgrades&quot; in Time and GoD very.......  what's the word......  useless?.........  of limited value? if you are casting level 70 spells and are going to be doing higher end (read as OoW and I assume DoN) content in the near future.  There are a FEW items that only take a 5% hit from each additional level, but most of them are of the 10% variety and it starts at level 67.  So, even with the best foci in Time, you end up with a net of 0% enhancement from foci.  However, if you are still using pre-level 67 spells, the Time/GoD/EP gear will do you fine.<br />
<br />
Which is why you are looking for fillintheblankfoci_V items, eh?  Smart.  I think the only thing you get those on are the crafted augs though.  All dropped gear of that level that I can recall has foci names.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
True, but if you have a maximum of 5? tribute slots.  Which I personally use for the resists.  Others may decide their resists are fine and can go the foci route.  To each their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Spell haste type focii degrade 5% per level over cap; all the others are 10% per level over cap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Thanks, I hadn't put that together for myself, so didn't realize it was only the spell haste stuff.  Nice to know.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In all the encounters I've done up through Noq in Inuk'ta (or however you spell that alien name) I've found that roughly 70% of the AE's favor Spell Shield.  That's not a firm number, just from my own personal experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Specter, you can't hit 0% effectiveness on ANY focus effect.  That would require losing 25-50% per level rather than 5-10%.  <br />
<br />
The % hit you take from GoD and Time effects on L70 spells is pretty minimal and you still usually end up with a better % than focusV effects.  Discordant effects from GoD also scale from L68 rather than L67.  If you want better than GoD/Time effects, you are looking mainly at effects than come from MPG raids or CoA.<br />
<br />
As for DoT vs Spell shielding, they are both equally important if you plan on doing much post-Time.  Most encounters have some combination of DDs and DoTs you have to suffer through to win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Did King and Queen in RS this weekend for the first time.  That is one encounter where Spell Shield is the win.  Instead of getting hit by a 5k AE, I got hit by 3550.  Big difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There isn't a single focus in PoTime that wouldn't have some effect on level 70 spells and the vast majority of them are better than OoW focus's pre MPG trials or anguish. The key is that they lose 5 or 10% of thier effect not 5% or 10% total.<br />
<br />
AKA a 30% spell extension focus that looses 10% per level working on a spell 1 level above it's cap would loose 30% * 10% or 3%. Which would mean it's 27% extension. 3 levels above the cap would be 30% * 30% or 9% so would be 21% extension. It takes either 10 levels or 20 levels above cap before the focus is totally useless depending on if it's 5 or 10% per level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think the only focus I'll be making with OoW augs is Affliction Haste, since it's the only one not covered on actual gear ever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">btw, Spell Shield is definately the better mod of the two, for all classes.  DoT shielding is likely to save more damage in the long run, but in the long run, damage is healable.

It's the same logic that makes melee Avoidance aa's, mods, and abilities SOOO much better for casters than Mitigation.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to agree. If you have a DoT, you can usually heal yourself fairly easily with a HoT or quick heal, but if you're getting nuked hard you may die before you have the chance to heal.</div></div><hr />
