<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As those of us left can tell from Glorianas post, Ryan is actively opposed to shamans getting the upgrades we need. Hes the guy we will be blaming for stat buffs in Omens, and lack of real effects, because he thinks stats matter. He is the guy who is working to keep us from upgrades in the short fights which make up end game and all future content, because of our superiority in long fights, which have been phased out due to unpopularity. He gave us a pointless HoT upgrade so they could point to it as a shaman improvement, even though he admitted even upgraded HoT's are obsolete. Its designers like this we can blame for the low state to which we have sunk. We wont see upgrades from him because he doesnt perceive there to be an imbalance. <br />
<br />
We need to take action.<br />
<br />
Bitching on the boards isnt doing any good. Brenlo came here and posted how we are considered the biggest whiners in all of EQ (he later edited his post). We have seen from every previous expansion what patience brings us. Kunark and group buff inferiority? Remember pop single target buffs and how long it took to get those changed? Remember yksha and how we got Pureblood, despite HAVING the spell? GoD and our disease DoT anyone? Waiting does NOTHING.<br />
<br />
We need to take action.<br />
<br />
Theres been a lot of talk, and communication on the live boards, with Kytherea. I'll let you guys in on a lil secret. Ky is just a distraction. Shes friendly, and bubbly, and female. That last fact has no doubt shielded her from a lot of flak that would have been tossed at a male PR person, and it just further illustrates her purpose. She reports what we say to Ryan, who immediately shoots it down. Chasing our tails with top 10 issue lists is a waste of time, when the guy doing the changes is firmly convinced that nothing is wrong.<br />
<br />
We need to take action.<br />
<br />
I dont think a massive stand down would do any good at this point. Id like to see some feedback from community leaders on something. Cancelling accounts might work, I'm planning on axing my 3 tonight. A more dramatic option would be to delete your shaman. Then petition to get it remade. This process takes a few days, so youd be out of action for a bit (frankly, I've been out of action for months) but would show SoE the dedication we have. Any thoughts? Any action we take should be unified. 40 pages on a petition, and no real reply to it months later goes to show how useful words are.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake, Ryan is opposed to shamans geting upgrades we need. All this talk of balancing on the live boards will amount to nada because of this fact.</div></div><hr />

although i was neg bumped in the summit thread for saying that ryan talked out his arse and was clueless:) but oh well i dont really care . he is!<br />
<br />
Gilkar on the live thread posted soming similar if it dont get deleted:) on the lucy chnages thread<br />

Ryan has been a major help in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, I think something along the lines of a strike might be in order, maybe 2 or 3 days.  Not a stand-down, not us causing problems or being annoying.  We simply don't show up...and make it public knowledge as to WHY we don't show up.<br />
<br />
We pick our target days, then spead the word that no one should log their their shamans for that period.<br />
<br />
That gets the point across without having to go through the hassle of deleting characters or cancelling accounts.<br />
<br />
We all just go play alts for a couple of days, and make it clear that our absence is a protest at how our class is being destroyed by SoE, destruction through neglect.</div></div><hr />

Sadly I find myself agreeing to this. And you should not need to stop playing the game for your class to get fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The problem is Shammy-bots.<br />

The Shammy-bots will still be there, and mindlessly do the things we would normally do.<br />

It's *way* to easy to reach 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I dont want too see anyone removed or replaced . But ryan does need too look at our obvious problems .<br />
how good we are in long fights is 100% irrelevent ... i dont care if we are superman in a long fight .. BECASE LONG FIGHTS NO LONGER EXIST !<br />
<br />
The Devs have made EQ a fast paced game of 1min or less fights . We are a Class that they made with 3min+ fights in mind . THEY CREATED this imbalance .. we need too demand as coustomers that they FIX it .<br />
<br />
Either put longer fights back in the game &quot;not every fight but a decent portion of them&quot; or FIX the class that you disigned around a certian playstyle only too PHASE that play style OUT !<br />
<br />
I agree with Flabbo 100% ... Gloriana I thank you So much for being my and many outhers represintitive at the summit ... But They still dont even see the problems here ...<br />
I wont re roll .. I shouldnt have too .<br />
I dont want too quit EQ ... becase I dont wanna leave behind my friends . but i may well do so ... becase Id rather leave my friends behind than hold them back by making them take me along too GoD when a chanter would be a much better choice .<br />
<br />
I dont know what we can do ... Honestly i am inclined too belive there is nothing we can do . I am not quiting EQ yet but its future seems bleak ... I hope SoE proves me wrong here .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Trust me, you make them remake a couple hundred characters, and they will take notice. If you dont want to delete your main, make an alt shaman, delete him, then request it be restored. This WILL get their attention, and fast.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For me... EQ is one step closer to the uninstall button after this so called summit. I've watched and played the wait and see game, but this last report on the apathy of the devs to fix Shaman is &gt;&lt; close to being the last straw.<br />
<br />
While fixing the bugs/problems is and should be the priority, I am growing very tired logging on, sitting around for hours on end waiting for something to do outside of guild activities.<br />
<br />
Sure, I get plenty of tells about LDoN/BoT/PoEarth etc.. but literally zero tells for anything in GoD.<br />
<br />
I am seriously tempted to email someone at Sony and ask them to put the Shaman out of their misery post-PoTime. Let them do as someone else suggested: Click to Convert to BL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have no idea what to say other than i totaly agree with all of the posts here.  Im a sad IRL that if shamen are to get a fix, the protest has to start with the 'end billing' button to be truly effective anymore(even then the buff bots ruin that).  I dont want to end billing, i love this game because of the people I know and have come to love as good friends.  I dont want to re-roll because i could never be a newb again, no patience for it.  <br />
<br />
I think that a few day strike of not loggin in AT ALL might be a good idea, not sure if it will help open SoE's eyes, but it could be worth a shot.  Tell me when and where to not log in and im there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">to make anyone notice we would have to make it least a week and make sure that 70% of shaman do it. as said unfortunately tis is unlikely</div></div><hr />

Who says spells are the only way to balance a class also?<br />
<br />
You only drive SoE employees away when you post retarded crap like this.  They come here, read the first two line of the post and move to another board.  If you want them to change things, give them ideas, not threats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Because it is a long proven FACT that spells are tweaked backwards in power as testing progresses.  It was only after *massive* complaints at the release of GoD that our GoD spells were tweaked to their current, albiet too weak, levels.<br />

Seems like this has been tried. <br />
Helped not much. <br />
<br />
To be honest our threats aren't going to amount to crap either. Too many of us have friends that will beg us &quot; Let me take over the billing for your Shammy so I can twobox&quot;. Too many of us will say &quot;/shrug  sure if you want it&quot;. End result, masses of players leaving, but only a trickle of accounts leaving. Add that to the already high number of bear-bots, and SoE don't give a damn what we think we are entitled to.<br />
<br />
I HATE to lose, and I HATE to quit anything, but even I am starting to feel like a program caught in an endless loop. Bad design is the root cause of both.</div></div><hr />

With all due respect threats seem to be the only thing they listen to. You just have to look at what happened with the Warrior class to find this out. As far as upgrades we may get some token upgrades but the very fact that he said stat buffs really do something is just funny. A 10 second midagated slow really meaning something is even more funny.<br />
<br />
I havent been playing much lately am haveing  much more fun with CoH so I guess I will just end billing and get it over with. I hate walking away from a game I have been playing for over 4 years but I guess it is time. See ya SoE</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rytan_EQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I feel like I was somewhat misrepresented in the previous thread on my view of shaman and I'd like to clear it up a bit.<br />
<br />
Mana Regen<br />
Glori mentioned she really liked bear form when Velious came out and was sad that it wasn't nearly as useful as it once was.  I thought that was very reasonable and would be happy to add an upgrade for it in the future.  <br />
As far as Canni goes, I'd like to change all the existing cannibalize spells to something more like the Ancient version with a larger hp/mana hit with a recast time.  Right now I'm waiting for some new spell functionality that will allow me to link spell timers together, as I think being able to memorize multiple cannibalize spells and chain them together would end up with too much mana regen.  I think this set up should allow shaman more time to cast other spells rather then chain cannibalizing.  (plus the chat spam is annoying)<br />
<br />
Stat Buffs<br />
The initial implementation with the Accuracy etc is still on the table, as the Omens spells are still very much in transition.  I know you're all very well aware of the effects stat buffs have on players, so I won't bore you with a recap.  This is something to look at during beta and adjust the spells as needed.  I will, however, say that 75 str does have a noticeable difference on DPS.  The cap increases that are there now will likely filter down to the other stat buffs regardless of whether the Omens spells are changed.  Then again, that might change to the same system as well.<br />
On a related note, we also discussed increasing the buff limit most likely through an AA, which should alleviate many of the concerns over buff slot limitations.  Most likely this will be 5 new slots for a total of 20.<br />
<br />
Slows<br />
Generally I feel that the importance of slows (even in Gates) is being overly discounted.  Yes they have less of an effect on shorter fights then longer ones, but you're still mitigating a tremendous amount of Damage from a given mob.  <br />
Slow has evolved to the point where I'm not comfortable adding any more slows that are at a higher % then existing spells, simply because even the smallest change in % has a dramatic effect on the DPS of an NPC.  In the future we'll be adding debuffs that function in different ways, such as decreased dual wield chance, double attack chance, decreased maximum hits etc.  I think this has the potential to help shaman stackability on raids if you have several debuffs that need to be applied to the mob, each for a noticeable effect.  Again this is something we'll be looking at heavily during beta.<br />
<br />
Heals over Time<br />
Generally I agree that these spells across the board are too weak and need adjustments.  This goes for all classes with Heal over Times.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just thought I'd let you know what I thought directly in hopes that it would quell some of the frustrations that you all have voiced.  We as a team, and I personally, are very committed to EverQuest being the best game it can be, and I think with continued involvement and communication with the community we can keep EverQuest a great game for years to come.<br />

<br />
all i saw was &quot;blah blah blah, don't say bad stuff about me, blah blah trasition, blah blah your fine, blah blah, im not adding anything new, blah blah please don't get me fired&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">thank for the reply ryan. though i still dont agree with what you say about slow and stats it has cooled my temper abit.<br />
<br />
the cani bit is true we have little time to actaully cast our spells due to having to cast other thing and the time is takes to cast them. we need faster casting spells for the faster pace.<br />
<br />
even a large increase in str over 250 will not increase dps that much it has been coded that way do have decreasing returns? unless you are removing that too? and even then i belive skill value is more of a difference than stats. however if a modifier to acurracy or avoidance etc is added to that then it could make a difference. also with stats on amror even with over limit buffing will as the get bigger have less and less impact.<br />
<br />
you admit slow has been decrase, yes it would still be usufel if we could cast it at the begining of fight but even then it is still reduced for short fights , thats not even taking into account mitagation which makes it less? 25% mitagation means we heal 25% less effectively? yet we dont get 25% better heals?#<br />
<br />
what i really want to impress though is , we want to have fun!  fa 6 indivual tanks is not fun! healing someone and seeing no difference in hp as the mobs just hit the tank isnt fun, infact it soetime lowers.<br />
<br />
buffing  stuff is fun when you know the buff mean soming. having to drain you mana pool as you have 8 different buff is not fun. i would perfer focus to have all stats on it , and then get a couple buff for attack increase types and defensive types, maybe a couple types with different flavour for differnet situations.<br />
 having to pay 20 aa for 5 more buff slots which is a fix i dont like, its a way to fill out aa in place of somin that actual should be there.<br />
<br />
debuffing needs to be real , slow is real but cripple isnt. but i hope these new spells will help.<br />
<br />
but most of all all classes like to do damage! even the clerics moan at this! i dont mind how i do it, dots /pet/mellee / dd but i want to be compareable with most other classes, by that i mean not a high dps , but a good dps.<br />
<br />
as yet you havent changed my mind i still believ it is you that is our main problem. no words will convince me as they have been said before and nothing happened. only action and changes will convince me , as with the changes to eq as a whole.<br />
<br />
do you realise the frustration that shaman are feeling? can you not see that shaman mains are playing other classes or left? we have 4 activate shaman in our guild and we want to recruit more as we not all on at same time and often no shaman or only 1 is on? there are none to recruit that say more to me than anyhting. not that it matters in potime, they work just was well without us, this is not just because slow has 2 other  classes that can slow almost as well, but that we dont bring dps or healing either or much with buffs. fo7 a bot can do. infact any buff can be done by bot, but dps and healing cant.<br />
<br />
i will wait and see, many times word have been said and nothing happen action is now what we look for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ok, so our slows are capped % wise. Why are bsts getting an upgrade to 65%? (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=5541&amp;source=Test)  Is there no mystical % difference between slowing classes like we are inflicted with for heals? Will these new debuffs be shaman only or will BST/Enchs get a similar, and probably just as effective, versions?<br />
<br />
Also, you didn't mention anything about our ability to do damage via DoTs or DDs. Why do we still have absurd casting time on DDs when fights are really short? Is there any plans to make DoTs viable in these short fights?</div></div><hr />

In the future we'll be adding debuffs that function in different ways, such as decreased dual wield chance, double attack chance, decreased maximum hits etc. I think this has the potential to help shaman stackability on raids if you have several debuffs that need to be applied to the mob, each for a noticeable effect. Again this is something we'll be looking at heavily during beta. <br />
<br />
I think everyone will agree with this point.  The major bone of contention however is that with beastlord and enchantter slows being so close to our slow, the added benefit of our slow is greatly reduced.<br />
<br />
I had this debate with my guild a few weeks ago, ran some numbers, and found out something suprizing, with mobs that are only slightly slowable the mob actually does less damage than under shaman slow due to the increase in the groups DPS if having a beastlord over a shaman.  I will post numbers on this once i get home and have access to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I appreciate you stopping by to talk, Ryan.  And I know slow is a very powerful tool.  However, we have become one trick ponies.  Slow is the only useful thing we bring to new content.  I'd very much like to hear the reasoning behind making our healing power so far behind druid.  We are simply inadequate as healers when facing mobs that are not fully slowable.  With mitigating/unslowable mobs being so common, our second 'trick' is broken.<br />
So we are faced with the question 'why bring a shaman?'.  This is the question we are asking, groups are asking, and would very much like answered.  We have three main characteristics: slowing, healing, buffing.  Two of these are either inadequate(heal) or unneeded(stat buff).  Slow alone is no longer enough reason to bring any class, and the other 'main' slowing classes bring enough relevant skills to make them preferred.</div></div><hr />

I understand it's a bit late to nerf out the stuff you have already given other classes but to be honest with you my own guildies have told me they would rather have a BST due to &quot;the difference in slow isn't noticable, but the difference in DPS sure is.&quot;<br />

WHat about 75 Agility? Dex? Stamina? Dex/Agi have VERY marginal impact, Stamina offers greatly diminishing returns.<br />
<br />
Stat buffs suck. I dont know how hard we have to scream at you to make you understand they ARENT what we want. Even with an expanded cap. We want stuff that makes a NOTICABLE impact on the game. You know, how you notice when you have virtue on. Or kei. Or BoVie. Stuff like that. <br />
<br />
We have posted again and again useful types of buffs.  And you have proven nothing but the fact that any reasonable and useful suggestion for shaman upgrades will be met with you sticking your fingers in your ears and saying &quot;la la la... no problem here!&quot;<br />
<br />
You're wrong about the usefulness of a slow in battles that last 10 seconds post mitigated slow, direct healing better serves to keep the tank up. 100 stats off a mob with the new cripple isnt going to impact the battle in a big way either I hate to let you know.<br />
<br />
You clearly have no grasp on dots and how they really function in groups, otherwise you wouldnt have nerfed the dots we were going to see. They looked ALMOST useful. <br />
<br />
I want to know what upgrades you have planned for us before level 66 spells/aa's. I appreciate you letting us know about the canni thing. We want to know the state of things NOW, not for omens. Because despite your misguided beliefs, the state of things sucks right now.</div></div><hr />

Please bore us with a recap, because no one has parsed these &quot;noticeable&quot; differences that stat buffs are supposed to be doing.<br />

Are you referring to the small number of hp we get from stamina buffs and tiny amount of ac we get from agility buffs and a tiny percent increase in procs from dexerity buffs and tiny rise in the max hit from str buff?  <br />

That does seem like a very very true statement.  The same would really hold true with a chanter and charmed pet or even with a dire charmed pet.  I can't believe that this hasn't been brought up before.  If it has I'm sorry that I missed it.  I would love to see this one parsed.  It would be no surprise with a charmed pet though.  But it makes me cry to think that a beasts slow and him would be better for a group then a Shaman best slow.  Beasts are like a Shaman that’s been corn feed steroids since birth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I feel like I was somewhat misrepresented in the previous thread on my view of shaman and I'd like to clear it up a bit.<br />
<br />
Mana Regen<br />
Glori mentioned she really liked bear form when Velious came out and was sad that it wasn't nearly as useful as it once was.  I thought that was very reasonable and would be happy to add an upgrade for it in the future.  <br />
As far as Canni goes, I'd like to change all the existing cannibalize spells to something more like the Ancient version with a larger hp/mana hit with a recast time.  Right now I'm waiting for some new spell functionality that will allow me to link spell timers together, as I think being able to memorize multiple cannibalize spells and chain them together would end up with too much mana regen.  I think this set up should allow shaman more time to cast other spells rather then chain cannibalizing.  (plus the chat spam is annoying)<br />
<br />
Stat Buffs<br />
The initial implementation with the Accuracy etc is still on the table, as the Omens spells are still very much in transition.  I know you're all very well aware of the effects stat buffs have on players, so I won't bore you with a recap.  This is something to look at during beta and adjust the spells as needed.  I will, however, say that 75 str does have a noticeable difference on DPS.  The cap increases that are there now will likely filter down to the other stat buffs regardless of whether the Omens spells are changed.  Then again, that might change to the same system as well.<br />
On a related note, we also discussed increasing the buff limit most likely through an AA, which should alleviate many of the concerns over buff slot limitations.  Most likely this will be 5 new slots for a total of 20.<br />
<br />
Slows<br />
Generally I feel that the importance of slows (even in Gates) is being overly discounted.  Yes they have less of an effect on shorter fights then longer ones, but you're still mitigating a tremendous amount of Damage from a given mob.  <br />
Slow has evolved to the point where I'm not comfortable adding any more slows that are at a higher % then existing spells, simply because even the smallest change in % has a dramatic effect on the DPS of an NPC.  In the future we'll be adding debuffs that function in different ways, such as decreased dual wield chance, double attack chance, decreased maximum hits etc.  I think this has the potential to help shaman stackability on raids if you have several debuffs that need to be applied to the mob, each for a noticeable effect.  Again this is something we'll be looking at heavily during beta.<br />
<br />
Heals over Time<br />
Generally I agree that these spells across the board are too weak and need adjustments.  This goes for all classes with Heal over Times.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just thought I'd let you know what I thought directly in hopes that it would quell some of the frustrations that you all have voiced.  We as a team, and I personally, are very committed to EverQuest being the best game it can be, and I think with continued involvement and communication with the community we can keep EverQuest a great game for years to come.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Ryan.. 3 yrs ago I parked my shaman and called it quits. I just recently came back. 3 yrs ago a Shaman was not only a Viable character, but one sought after for raids and groups, thats not so anymore. 3 yrs ago a shaman could solo for a large part of the game, I enjoy hunting in Everfrost, but there are so few mobs anymore that I have to wait sometimes for as much as an hour, running around trying to find a mob thats actually even a shade of blue. What I see is green green green RED green.  If I want to hunt for decent XP I have to go to Luclin, and while the hunting is good there (why so many mobs in those zones and none in everfrost?), I don't like hunting dungeons etc. Further more, while Luclin is a nice place to visit.. I for one also don't like going there because i'm an Old hand, I like the pre-luclin areas to hunt.<br />
<br />
While my toon is not a high level, just a mere 13 now, I have found that even at THAT level, what few groups I can find, have no intrest in me being there if a druid or some other hybrid is available.  This means that other than the very rare person who I happen to see getting pounded and I heal during their battle, I rarely am asked to group.<br />
<br />
While I know a lot of content has been added to the game (I have the first 5 expansions), most of what I am seeing is making me question my return to EQ. I loved the Shaman 3 yrs ago. I still love the Shaman now, but not as much. What I used to be able to do is no more. nerfed or done better by another toon, who also has similiar or better buffs.<br />
<br />
My DoT (tainted Breath at this level) Is resisted approx 1/3 of the time if not more, and when i'm after a hard hitting mob that cons to me as white and hits me for 25 and 30DPS, and i'm hitting with dot, and weapon combined for half that, the fight is obviously one sided and sow doesn't save my ass enough because some of these mobs seem to be able to outrun my sow (now why would an Orc Trooper who cons blue to me be able to run me down with me having sow and running in a straight line on a flat surface, answer that for me please?).<br />
<br />
I created a Druid just for comparison, outfitted him exactly the same as my shammy (just traded clothes for a while) and the Druid does better in every respect than my shammy. I know how to run a Shaman. DoT and kite, Root (at level 14) if your lucky and it takes. The Druid is not only able to do everything better, but a Half-elf is actually HITTING HARDER  and more often than a Barbarian Shaman with exactly the same weapons and outfit! So please explain to me how the Shaman is balanced? How were not under powered? How we are still a Viable class?<br />
<br />
And while I am mentioning Problems, would you be so kind as to explain to me why I have YET to see a GM or GUIDE on Terris Thule? I play sometimes 10+ hours in a row and frequently check and never see anyone.  I have had several toons stuck in walls, and the ticket system gets NOTHING resolved. I had to go to chat to get any action taken. Then 2 days AFTER the fact, I saw action on the ticket... 3 days after I subbmitted it (thats fast action from what I understand, most people wait a week or more before they hear anything at all)<br />
<br />
Is it SoE's intent to drive people away from EQ due to inaction, mismanagement, destroyed classes, and neglect? if so, are the actually stupid enough to think that after all that, someone would actually go to another SoE game? if thats what they are thinking, then ya'll need to pull your heads right straight out of your Hinieys cause it won't happen.<br />
<br />
I for one am growing disgruntled with what I have seen. I came back open minded and eager to play my favorite race and class, and now... i'm starting to think that spending the money was a mistake.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Rytan, first, thanks for the post.<br />
<br />
I'd like to provide some constructive solutions to the repeated problems that you're encountering at places like the shaman boards.<br />
<br />
1) If you have new changes in the works, like what you commented about the Cannibalize line ... then TELL us that you're working on that before the riots start, not after.  Really, that goes for whatever is being worked on.  Over and over, we've been left clueless about what SOE intends for our class, and is designing for our class, until we break out the pitchforks and flaming torches - and then positive comments look like they are only attempts to appease the horde, not actual work-in-progress.<br />
<br />
2) Since you have access to the game's inner workings, look at the breakpoints on stats.  I'll even agree with you that, at low numbers, stats are fairly meaningful (at least STA, and likely STR - my parse is still number crunching atm).  But there are known &quot;soft caps&quot; above which stats provide diminishing returns.  Any chance those could be removed?  They very strongly mitigate any benefit stats would otherwise provide.<br />
<br />
3) You know as well as we do, that spdat.eff parsers like Lucy are the first place that we get information about what you are doing.  If you're currently working on two things - some new stat buffs, and some new debuffs that actually DO something - then pushing *some* form of the more interesting work-in-progress to a public visible area lets us know that you're still innovating, and not just retreading material.  Really, this works hand in hand with point one - if we know that you're working on something good, we'll (well ... some of us) will be more tolerant when the first things we see are awful.<br />
<br />
And, although I have no intentions of making this look like a &quot;wishlist&quot; post ... there are 2 &quot;ratios&quot; I think should be considered - we know, from the direct heal discussions (for better or worse), that SOE would like to have a rubric for determining spell power.<br />
<br />
1) In initial EQ, the DoT vs. DD comparison was Envenomed Bolt (110 + 146*7 = 1132, 320 mana) vs. Ice Comet (1120, 400 mana).  The drawback was that EBolt takes longer to work, and must run to duration to be successful.  The advantage was that it did nearly identical damage, slightly cheaper.  Looking at the current era (I would use Omen spells, since they are still in testing...), the current poison dot versus Big Wizard Nuke is Blood of Saryrn (320*7=2240, 535 mana) vs. White Fire (3015, 704 mana).  Why have dots gone from being the same damage, for 80% of the mana, but over time ... to being 75% of the damag,e for 75% of the mana, over time?<br />
<br />
2) In Kunark, Torpor mattered because the amount it healed was significant compared not only against mob hits, but against total hitpoints of the players involved.  300/tick healing matters to a 3k tank taking hits for 100-200.  450/tick healing matters much less to a 12k tank taking hits for 1000+.  And the actual regen spells themselves?  Whether its the PoP-era 25/tick, or the proposed OoW 33/tick, these spells just don't have an impact anymore.  Not even another 15 buff slots would make them worth casting... =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I know you're all very well aware of the effects stat buffs have on players, so I won't bore you with a recap.  This is something to look at during beta and adjust the spells as needed.  I will, however, say that 75 str does have a noticeable difference on DPS.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Generalities bore us.  If you truly believe we are aware of the effects of a stat buff, then why are you not taking our word for it?<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could share with us your definition of noticeable.  Perhaps some examples of the effects that you feel the stat buffs provide.  A little evidence is a fine dish to serve to a table full of doubters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Generally I feel that the importance of slows (even in Gates) is being overly discounted.  Yes they have less of an effect on shorter fights then longer ones, but you're still mitigating a tremendous amount of Damage from a given mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
Be that as it may, we are *not* mitigating enough damage to heal what is taken away.<br />
<br />
The original version of Shaman healing was that the tank lost a lot of HP in the early portion of the fight while the Shaman got his Slow landed.  The Shaman then had time to catch up on heals because the fight went on for a while and the mob wasn't going to kill the tank immediately.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to now.  The best a Shaman can hope to do is drop a Q on the tank before the mob arrives.  Slow and spam Tnargs.  Even then, its not always enough.<br />
<br />
Even when that does work, when are we to regen mana ?  We have the absolute crappiest mana efficiency ever.  Sure, we can regen it, but when?<br />
<br />
And we haven't even addressed how a BST can use his Slow (without a debuff first) and contribute DPS or how a Chanter can debuff and Slow far faster than we can and contribute DPS + CC.<br />
<br />
Again, perhaps you could share some of your numbers on what a &quot;tremendous&quot; amount of damage you feel we are mitigating.  Solid numbers mean a lot more to us than generalities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heals over Time<br />
Generally I agree that these spells across the board are too weak and need adjustments.  This goes for all classes with Heal over Times.<br />
<br />
Then fix it.  How hard can that be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I feel like I was somewhat misrepresented in the previous thread on my view of shaman and I'd like to clear it up a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey Ryan, I'm sorry you felt misrepresented in the other thread. We really didn't get a chance to talk during the actual summit. I wasn't taking notes during our conversation during the ball game and had to rely on memory for the things we discussed.<br />
<br />
I really did try to present what I remembered as clearly as I could. I was happy about the idea of the chain lightning style spells and I was disappointed when you said that the faster slow helped alleviate our problems in fast fights.<br />
<br />
If you want to cut and paste from my original statement with your views and comments, so we could get a more clear idea of what you meant, that would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Rytan, I think the problem is that we're getting consistently screwed across the board.<br />
<br />
Nukes: 7.8 seconds for Velium Strike.  We've said time and time again it's TOO SLOW for any kind of fast content.  Yet look at our new OoW nuke . . . 7.8 seconds.  Can't use it on raids, can't use it for **** in groups . . . and you feel impelled to inflict it on us again why?<br />
<br />
DoTs: we had one decent one.  As I noted in a previous post, it was only a matter of time before it got nerfed--and it did.  You shaved off 300 a tic.  Let's compare to a wizard for example (so we can be consistant in our comparison--any class would do really).  Why is it that from level 60 to level 70, our DoTs now do LESS damage than a single nuke, have MORE agro than the nuke, and are LESS mana efficient than a nuke.  Wasn't the whole point of a DoT to be EFFICIENT?  It does less damage in a short time, but MORE damage over a long time?  Let's look at:<br />
Corona Flare: 3562 damage, 750 mana over 8 seconds.  4.74 damage per mana<br />
Obkin (now): 429 a TIC, 668 mana, total 3003 damage--over 42 seconds.  4.49 damage per mana<br />
<br />
That's our BEST DoT in OoW.  How fricking happy do you think we are about that?  Why is it necros get TWO spells that are doing 670/tic.  Our best is 546, then 429.<br />
<br />
How about heals?!?  1690?!?  We're begging for 1800 in GoD so we can heal less than 1 max hit off nameds that quad, and you give us 1690 for a level 70 expansion?  How about that l33t 33 hp regen?  compared to mobs that hit for 1200 in the PREVIOUS expansion.  It only takes 3.6 minutes to heal one hit.  Or our new heal over time.  It's 35 more hp per TIC.  So, we should expect OoW mobs to do less than 6 dps more than GoD mobs?<br />
<br />
We've tried to tell you that stat buffs do squat.  Seriously, run parses.  We have.  I'd expect a 80+ buff to stats to increase damage by--perhaps--a couple of percent.  It's not worth the freaking mana to cast them.<br />
<br />
I dunno about everyone else, but it seems every crap decision and the nerf we get every expansion comes back to spells.  Other classes get upgrades.  We get crap.  This is more of the same.  Perhaps you can explain why we are not allowed to heal or do dps.  NOTHING YOU ARE DOING MAKES A SHAMAN WORTH GROUPING.  A GROUP IS CONSISTENTLY BETTER OFF GROUPING ANOTHER CLASS AND GETTING A SHAMAN BUFF BOTT.<br />
<br />
At least there should be plenty to go around.  With all the shaman that are going to quit, at least people can buy a buff-bot.<br />
<br />
I don't know what you have against shaman, Rytan, but why don't you let someone without an axe to grind make our spells?<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
P.S.  Yes, I'm mad.  Yes, I'm probably being rude.  (I'll even feel bad about it later, I'm sure--I usually do)  I'm also incredibly fed up.  It just seems that every initiative we bring up to try to get our class out of the crapper gets stopped at ONE person--Rytan.  Seriously, what the hell are shaman supposed to do?  We can't heal, we can't do dps, our buffs are done just as well by a bot, and enchanters and beastlords slow just as well as we do over a short fight, nearly as well on a long fight, and bring a LOT more to the table than we do.<br />
<br />
You say we consistently understate the power of slow.  Fair enough.  You consistently OVERstate the power of slow.  Shaman are a one trick pony, and you are convinced that our 'trick' is godlike.  Is it any wonder we're upset?  From our perspective, the one guy that gets to decide the fate of our class seems to think we're overpowered for some god-forsaken reason.  I direct you to this thread for a 2nd perspective . . . <br />

I mean even Gikk had a very well done chart where he showed that a 67 point STR buff resulted in a 7% DPS increase.  <br />

My idea of the Shaman class is to be the undisputed slower. If you dont raise the precentage you have to add some other type of effect to the slows to make them the prefered slows above all else.<br />
<br />
Also make class defining spells more available to causal players. Having to either have an uber guild or invest sick amounts of time to camping is worthless. The improved god spells like Daluda and Trushar should be for the dedicated, but class defining things like Balance of the Nihil should be avialable to causal players.<br />

Not really, it's more of an act of stupidity. I'm beggining to believe that SoE is trying very hard to Phase Shaman out of the game. Everything I read is a constant show of Us as a class getting Nerfed time and time again. 3 yrs ago my 36 shaman would have flat KILLED a 36 Shaman of this day, with no effort, and little recieved damage.<br />
<br />
You tell me how that makes us a Viable race? Today, a druid, outfitted the same as a shaman, does more damage, and has nearly equal buffs. That druid, lets put him at level 10, and take a level 10 shaman. Outfit them exactly the same. Place them against the exact same mob, and see which one kills it first? I can tell you it won't be the Shaman.<br />
<br />
So how does that make us Viable? Druids can not only do what we do, but often better and more damage. we won't even get into the other classes. Ryan... Give over the dev of Shaman spells to someone who actually PLAYS a shaman, and not one of your hopped up test bots, either that or your going to be the direct cause of a great deal of people quitting the game.<br />
<br />
Mystic<br />
<br />
P.S. I actually put that out as a challenge! Ryan, your so sure shamans are viable. then lets prove it! on a REGULAR server, with a REGULAR TOON, create two classes, druid and shaman. Just for kicks lets do it this way, an elf type race druid and a barb shaman. OUTFIT them identically. Non magical armour, something that does NOT add + to any stats other than changing the AC  or atk because then you have two neutral toons. Choose what ever level you wish to man them.  give them all their spells for that level! have it set to create two mobs, both EXACTLY identical in all ways but mobs you would normally find in that area, on that server. then turn the toons loose on them. let them each fight it out to the death with the mobs. Watch as the shaman get his/her ass handed to them faster than the druid. Then come back and tell ME! we as a class are equal with other classes. <br />
<br />
And to make it fair, maybe you should let those toons be handled by EXPERIENCED players of that class! PROVE IT! Put up, or shut up.<br />

The thing is, we dont need someone who PLAYS a shaman, just one who UNDERSTANDS shaman issues. I didnt need to be a shadowknight to see how frustrating it would be for a tank class to not be able to tank a single group encounter. I didnt need to be a warrior to see how a casual warrior player would have a hard time holding/getting aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Seriously, what the hell are shaman supposed to do?  We can't heal, we can't do dps, our buffs are done just as well by a bot, and enchanters and beastlords slow just as well as we do over a short fight, nearly as well on a long fight, and bring a LOT more to the table than we do.[/url]<br />
<br />
Amen.  As a Time and GoD raiding shaman, I am a focus caster and occasionally on some mobs they want me to cure.  Thanks for that Blood of Nadox bone you threw us!<br />
<br />
I love the point someone made earlier.  In KUNARK, we had Torpor.  Kunark.  When Jaundiced Bone Armor was good, for crying out loud!  And that was 300 points a tick back in the day when almost nothing was hitting for 300.  Everything my guild fights hits for at least 1-2k a hit, I CANNOT fully slow it like I could a Kunark mob, yet some SoE developer is telling me my class hasn't been nerfed, hard?  Gimme a break!!!  Are you guys incapable of doing math?  Play a shaman for 4-5 years for 20 or more hours a week, and see how much we SUCK compared to what my class once was.  No one even asks me for stat buffs anymore, and believe me, if they helped, people would ask for them;  I get asked for focus and FA.  No one is silly enough to think I'm a healer anymore, though I was one most of my character's existence; I have never heard an SoE employee bother telling me why for years druids and shamans were cool with equivalent heals yet suddenly druids get better heals than we do.  it makes zero sense.  <br />
<br />
So to reiterate the gentleman I'm quoting - we have lousy DPS, we cannot heal, our slows are a joke that a chanter or beastlord can do comparably well, and if you don't improve them you are killing the class yet you misguidedly believe they are overpowered.  No mitigated slow is overpowered!  Shamans should get a base chance to be mitigated far less than other classes.  <br />
<br />
I am in Time and EP gear, have a good reputation, but I can't get groups.  I am once again BEGGING SoE to give me a reason not to quit, to make my character desirable and fun again.  PLEASE don't make me leave this game.  Even if you could care less about game integrity - I literally have talked over a dozen friends into playing EQ and have 4 accounts by myself.  Half of those friends have multiple accounts.  Has Sony gotten tired of collecting our money, that they no longer care about the customer this much?  Call my class whiny - up yours for that, btw, Brenlo, makes me wish I'd heckled you more at FF Vegas, though I did quite a bit as it was! - but we have legitimate concerns and we have effectively been nerfed to oblivion.  There is no other class as useless now.  Between endless collision bugs, &quot;upgrading&quot; the graphics right out of the range of some people's PCs to play, and ignoring your customers - I'm starting to think Sony is trying to kill EQ.  Maybe because they don't want to support both it and EQ2?  I can tell you this, if I finally quit, I won't be back to play another SoE game at all, ever.  I cannot believe how much I pay Sony to be ignored now as it is.  If I ever get the sense to abandon my char, which I've been too much of a wimp to do so far, I will not pay for this again.<br />
<br />
Make this game and my character fun again.  Please.</div></div><hr />

We have 3 different dots, 2 being poison and disease, which, to me atleast, are resisted a hell of a lot of time. Then our debuffs are not even enough to actually cast dots on mobs that resist our dots, leaving us with 1 dot, which is a curse. I mean, we need a variation of stuff.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Hey guys,<br />
Mana Regen<br />
As far as Canni goes, I'd like to change all the existing cannibalize spells to something more like the Ancient version with a larger hp/mana hit with a recast time.  Right now I'm waiting for some new spell functionality that will allow me to link spell timers together, as I think being able to memorize multiple cannibalize spells and chain them together would end up with too much mana regen.  I think this set up should allow shaman more time to cast other spells rather then chain cannibalizing.  (plus the chat spam is annoying)<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't speak for the rest of the Shaman, but I don't use 2 Canni spells. I either have Canni4 or Ancient: Chaotic Pain up... depending on where I am.<br />
<br />
<br />
Slows<br />
Generally I feel that the importance of slows (even in Gates) is being overly discounted.  Yes they have less of an effect on shorter fights then longer ones, but you're still mitigating a tremendous amount of Damage from a given mob.  <br />
Slow has evolved to the point where I'm not comfortable adding any more slows that are at a higher % then existing spells, simply because even the smallest change in % has a dramatic effect on the DPS of an NPC.  In the future we'll be adding debuffs that function in different ways, such as decreased dual wield chance, double attack chance, decreased maximum hits etc.  I think this has the potential to help shaman stackability on raids if you have several debuffs that need to be applied to the mob, each for a noticeable effect.  Again this is something we'll be looking at heavily during beta.<br />
<br />
<br />
This was my pet peeve. The biggest impact on the Shaman was farming out our once prime ability to other classes.<br />
<br />
Bards get a true AE slow (/boggle)<br />
<br />
BST getting a faster casting slow that is nearly identical in effect to our best slow with mitigation... although this was remedied after a large amount of commentary from the Shaman community. /em scratches his head in puzzlement.<br />
<br />
Granted, BST don't get this slow until 65, but it's still a bit annoying.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heals over Time<br />
Generally I agree that these spells across the board are too weak and need adjustments.  This goes for all classes with Heal over Times.<br />
<br />
<br />
I personally think HoT's are fine as they are for all classes, they might need a little tweaking, but they aren't that bad when used as heals after an encounter/fight is over. It's the Shaman direct heal that is the problem. It's just not sufficient for GoD content, not even close.<br />
<br />
I don't blame groups for wanting a BST over a Shaman in GoD content... it's the sensible thing to do.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is between the the addition of Slows to other classes, the meagerness of our direct heal, and our inability to provide any meaningful DPS capability, Shaman have lost desireability in groups for GoD content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You can't feed me that ****, Rytan. No one is asking for a higher % Slow, so don't pretend we are asking for one to have an argument.<br />
<br />
When a Druid and especially Cleric can heal more efficiently AND more effectively without a Slower than a Shaman using Balance, you are making that function obsolete.<br />
When you are making the main function of a class obsolete why don't you enhance their secondary abilities to make up for the loss. <br />
<br />
Why are Shaman heals not being upgraded significantly?<br />
<br />
Do you want me to bust out the percentages for heals from when exp fights lasted around 2 minutes, Malxxx wasn't needed and Slows weren't mitigated and compare them to now?<br />
<br />
Do you want me to compae DPS figures between classes as well and show you how Shamans have been falling off more and more every expansion?<br />
<br />
I could go on and on, but I guess you are doing your best not to implement any meaningful changes, because you are afraid to imbalance classes(guess what, there already is a huge imbalance) and that's why we won't ever see what we need.<br />
<br />
In the future we'll be adding debuffs that function in different ways, such as decreased dual wield chance, double attack chance, decreased maximum hits etc.  I think this has the potential to help shaman stackability on raids if you have several debuffs that need to be applied to the mob, each for a noticeable effect.

<br />
I feel like I was somewhat misrepresented in the previous thread on my view of shaman and I'd like to clear it up a bit.<br />
<br />
Mana Regen<br />
Glori mentioned she really liked bear form when Velious came out and was sad that it wasn't nearly as useful as it once was.  I thought that was very reasonable and would be happy to add an upgrade for it in the future.  <br />
As far as Canni goes, I'd like to change all the existing cannibalize spells to something more like the Ancient version with a larger hp/mana hit with a recast time.  Right now I'm waiting for some new spell functionality that will allow me to link spell timers together, as I think being able to memorize multiple cannibalize spells and chain them together would end up with too much mana regen.  I think this set up should allow shaman more time to cast other spells rather then chain cannibalizing.  (plus the chat spam is annoying)<br />
<br />
What would we spend the mana on? When would we have time? In gates content Our nukes dont land fast enough, out dot's dont have long enough to run, and our heals don't keep people from dieing unless a druid is there to back us up.  That is with a full 75% slow landing. Spending Malo Turgurs, A Tnarqs, A Quesance, a tnarqs, a tnarqs, Trying a dot. resisted. A tnarqs. Ferine Avatar yet another tnarqs. Oh look another mob. Time to malo and slow again and start over.  Against a boss. What do we do? Toss patch heals and pray. And maybe Malo first. Oh yeah and Ferine the meele once every 3 minutes. (Assuming 3 meele in group) Give or take. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stat Buffs<br />
The initial implementation with the Accuracy etc is still on the table, as the Omens spells are still very much in transition.  I know you're all very well aware of the effects stat buffs have on players, so I won't bore you with a recap.  <br />
<br />
Please recap for us. Using a real world shaman and a real world warrior in a real area against a real mob. Hell copy over Glori and a Warrior and head to gates and have at it. Heck I will even reactivate my accounts 65 Shaman and 65 Shadowknight and let you play the shadowknight and we can go to gates and you can prove with your parsing exactly how much the str buffs do to a Stat capped player. Yeah +75 strength is HUGE to someone who is level 10 with a 85 strength. But the rest of us know a little better. <br />
<br />
I do belive somone referanced a test another did and got a difference of 7% for 67 strength to someone not stat capped. 7% wouldnt be too bad. But once again stat caps come into play. and deminishing returns as well. Even if we can go over the stat cap unless the deminishing returns is different for Str dex and agility than it is for Stamina Int and wisdom. Even going 100 points over cap is just like adding 25 points before 200. (I belive it is 6 hps for a shaman to 200 Stamina. Then from 201 to 255 is 3 points per. Then from 256 to 305 is 1.5 per. Before Natural durability.  Is strength the same? If it isnt what is it. Cause despite running parses through the wazoo (With all the problems of methodology and testing in an imperfect world) Pretty much every damn shaman who has played for more than 2 years says. yeah Strength is okay. But I do it more for a placebo than anything else. The real buff is in attack. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is something to look at during beta and adjust the spells as needed.  I will, however, say that 75 str does have a noticeable difference on DPS.  The cap increases that are there now will likely filter down to the other stat buffs regardless of whether the Omens spells are changed.  Then again, that might change to the same system as well.<br />
On a related note, we also discussed increasing the buff limit most likely through an AA, which should alleviate many of the concerns over buff slot limitations.  Most likely this will be 5 new slots for a total of 20.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yay spend AA for a game fix. Smart. People want 2 buffs from me. Ferine and Focus. (Focus soley for the Hps.Avatar soley for the attack) The rest they click off. And I am the so called master of buffs. Yay Now I can tell people no you have to have spent 20 Aa to get any of my useful buffs because they really want the other classes buffs. That will fly well with the meeles. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Slows<br />
Generally I feel that the importance of slows (even in Gates) is being overly discounted.  Yes they have less of an effect on shorter fights then longer ones, but you're still mitigating a tremendous amount of Damage from a given mob.  <br />
Slow has evolved to the point where I'm not comfortable adding any more slows that are at a higher % then existing spells, simply because even the smallest change in % has a dramatic effect on the DPS of an NPC.  In the future we'll be adding debuffs that function in different ways, such as decreased dual wield chance, double attack chance, decreased maximum hits etc.  I think this has the potential to help shaman stackability on raids if you have several debuffs that need to be applied to the mob, each for a noticeable effect.  Again this is something we'll be looking at heavily during beta.<br />
<br />
Will these stack with slow? Who else will have them besides shaman. How long will it take to cast them? Will malos be required for us and for the other classes not required? Will the mana expendature be thought of when the fights are lasting 30 second to 1 minute on avrage and we need to cast heals and slows beforehand? Will they have mitagation factors taken into account? What is to stop this from becomeing the new slow same as the old slow just under a different guise. Because new debuffs will also have a dramatic effect on DPS of a monster. <br />
<br />
If you want to fix shaman. And shut us the heck up. Do this. Give us a Way to negate the first level of mitagation. With Any of our slows. And have it be innate to the charecter. Like an AA. Or a quest.  Second take out the 100% 67% 46% or what ever percentages on heals as a given and start looking at Shamans not as only a secondary healer. We should be a primary healer as good as clerics in our own way. (And druids as well Who should be as good as clerics too) Third give us a no XP res of some sort. So if someone dies we can get them back to thier body. And let them get a res from a proper cleric some other time.  I will cover the HoT in a sec.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Heals over Time<br />
Generally I agree that these spells across the board are too weak and need adjustments.  This goes for all classes with Heal over Times.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics should have the high HP Hot. Like 1200 a tick 4 ticks.  Shaman should have the Medium HP hot with a longer duration and more efficient. Like 800 a tick for 10 ticks. and a regen That will give top up heals over a very long duration. Like 100 hps a tick for 36 minutes.  And All the damn HoT's should be affected by healing AA and Focus effects  <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, just thought I'd let you know what I thought directly in hopes that it would quell some of the frustrations that you all have voiced.  We as a team, and I personally, are very committed to EverQuest being the best game it can be, and I think with continued involvement and communication with the community we can keep EverQuest a great game for years to come.<br />

But unless you actually admit you have a problem with the design of shaman we will yell right up to the point we cancle account and go elsewhere. And I can promise you You might stop hearing the yelling then but for every person who quits in disgust there are probably 6 people they talk out of your next game.

This IS true, and it's an ungodly powerful spell against trivial content - I've used it when clearing to royals in Chardok, for instance - but it has some balancing points.<br />
<br />
1) It lasts 18 seconds, so you need to drop another song in your twist for it.<br />
<br />
2) It has a DOT component, so it can't be used around anything that requires mezzing.<br />
<br />
3) If you're slowing and dotting 10 mobs at once, even low 50s Sarnaks can put quite a dent in a bard.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks alot for the post Ryan.  One issue that I have not seen addressed officially is the fact that beastlords and enchanters have a slow that is almost as good as the shaman's, and overall it is felt that  in the current state of the game, they both have more to offer than a shaman.  This is a case where a hybrid of a class has pretty much outclassed the parent class.<br />
<br />
Any comment?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Thanks again for posting Rytan and I hope you can filter thru the hostility which in my humble opinion is certainly not voiced against you but 5 years of being pretty much ignored.<br />
<br />
To get to the real core of the shaman issues from a general standpoint, we are horrible at stacking on raids and we are having an increasing problem getting experience groups due to slow mitigation.  I would also throw in the repetitive cannying and casting of FA, etc. that really don't effect class balance nor content balancing but make shaman more like a bard than anything. <br />
<br />
I hear in your posts that you acknowledge the canny issue and I applaud it 100%.  I'm fine with whatever stat buff result you come up with because that is to balance the content.  But, I think that you might rethink shaman spot healing and quick damage which balances us versus other classes in experience groups and will allow the 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. shaman on raids to do a bit of damage.<br />
<br />
On other posts I suggest that a druid and the 3rd, 4th, etc. shaman on a raid pretty much have the same duties - spot healing and DD's.  Druids are superior in both regards.  Any arguments about DOT damage in my opinion are mute because they can not be used because of agro.<br />
<br />
In experience groups shaman compete against beastlords and enchanters.  With slow mitigation currently we bring less to the table than previously in the fast and furious world of the new EQ.<br />
<br />
I don't think Shaman are broken.  We are a good and useful class but I truely believe that we are not currently balanced.  I am a minority here at the Crucible in that I feel that just a few fixes will solve most of our problems and I am very sensitive to the developer who has to tune everything to content and to class balance.<br />
<br />
Ok, my list of EASY fixes to the Shaman class (just my opinion).<br />
<br />
#1 Reduce casting time on malos (and related spells) by 25%<br />
#1 Reduce casting time on our DD's by 25%.<br />
#2 Increase duration of FA (and related spells) by 50%<br />
#3 Increase our fast healing spells and our DD spells to be closer to druids (any suggested #'s would be suggestive of me).<br />
<br />
Respectfully yours,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">In the mad dash to get the last word in or to bash Rytan, the point of contention really is a matter of Shaman desirability and utility which is where the real issues lie.  <br />
<br />
The problems with ALL our spell lines right now is that some other class does it better or does it well enough that our presence is no longer requested nor required.  <br />
<br />
From a generalist point of view, we can do a little bit of everything but with the exception of slowing, we do nothing well.  And during a raid or fast paced trial when every group slot MUST be filled with efficiency in mind, the Shaman class falls short every single time.<br />
<br />
<br />
RYTAN  (if you're still with us)....<br />
<br />
Regarding Mana Regen....<br />
The reason why this is so annoying is that because the game has been reduced to extremely fast fights.   Shaman have the ability to regenerate mana very quickly in a short amount of time at the expense of doing anything else.  To compensate, our spells cost sometimes in upwards of 50% more than other similar spells cast by others.  In the long term during rapid fights, we cannot keep up with the demands on our mana reserves because our mana regen is so active.  All other classes do not seem to have this problem since their spells are so much more efficient than ours and our active mana regen is so annoying.<br />
<br />
Regarding Stat Buffs....<br />
Here the problem is, stat buffs do not make Shaman desirable, in a raid where buff slots are at a premium, other classes pick and choose which buffs are of the most value to them.   It's not JUST shaman saying that stat buffs are useless, it's EVERYONE during a raid saying &quot;STOP CASTING STA/STR ON ME!!!!  Just give me focus.&quot;   If and only if a person has extra slots do they request other buffs.   Adding AA slots for extra buff slots does NOT increase shaman desirability either.   People will still get the best buffs available and frankly, it's not agility or dexterity past a certain point... certainly not charisma.  <br />
<br />
Regarding slows....<br />
The fact that at LEAST 2 other classes share our ability to slow makes it so that we are no longer necessary for slowing when these other classes bring so much more to the table than us.   Yes, slowing is desirable but we are not the sole proprietors of such abilities.  Nor is the % at which we slow relevant any longer... Since fights are now designed with debuffs in mind, during a 30 second fight, by the time we slow a target, we may have mitigated an extra 5k damage vs an enchanter or beastlord slow...  One extra heal from a druid or cleric is able to compensate for it.  <br />
<br />
Regarding HOT's....<br />
Well these are your own words regarding this spell line, which does not address our actual concern, our actual healing abilities when compared with other priests...<br />
<br />
&quot;Heals over Time<br />
Generally I agree that these spells across the board are too weak and need adjustments. This goes for all classes with Heal over Times.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rytan, the facts are, the Shaman class in every single area we used to be good at has fallen grossly behind due to the new environment.  Before we fell behind in little ways that were mostly undetectable because the nature of combat hadn't changed.  We were made for endurance.   However, whenever you could use a Shaman now, another class is simply better suited.  This has become glaringly apparent to everyone which is why high level Shaman have either been quitting or rerolling.  Shaman are no longer needed or desirable during raids or groups, they're botted for the one buff we have that is useful, Focus for hit points.  <br />
<br />
Since all casters and priests lost the ability to contribute to a group via melee, we are solely defined by our spell and AA lines.  Nothing we have is either unique or indispensible any longer.  <br />
<br />
The issue at hand is that we are dead weight and a fossil from a time when endurance mattered.  Effectively the Shaman has been metagamed out of Everquest and we, the disenfranchised, are looking to see if we will be given a new class role or left behind as we were in GOD. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">edit:  Forgot to say thanks for reading this Rytan, but there are some serious issues with the shaman atm. <br />
<br />
As promised, here are my interesting numbers regarding slowing. <br />
<br />
First a few disclaimers: I'm not advocation nerfing BL's, they aren't the problem, it's shaman that need upgrading.<br />
<br />
Second: I'm not going to compair an enc. becuase they can charm, and that cuts the duration of the fight by so much it's not even funny what the 'damage mitigation' from a charmed pet is. (If you really want me to run the numbers it won't be hard though)<br />
<br />
Third:  I'm going to use averages for all the numbers, because to parse this would take too many samples, and have too much variation based on members ect.<br />
<br />
Here are my assumptions: <br />
<br />
We have a group of 6 people, a cleric, a tank, a slower and the rest don't matter, because i'm going to average the dps of the group.<br />
<br />
Let's say the group does 600 dps w/o the slower( say 80 for war, 180 for a rog 0 for the cleric, 170 for a wiz, and 130 for a mon, these are just an example and they don't matter).<br />
<br />
Also the mob will live for 60 seconds while getting beat on by these 5 people.  I ignore the slower's dps here, becuase that will vary based on if it's a sham or a BL.<br />
<br />
Therefor the mob will have 36,000 hps (600DPS*60secs=36,000 dmg)<br />
<br />
I will also assume that the mob is getting slowed on inc by the slower, (using new spells this isn't too hard for either class).<br />
<br />
During the fight the BL will do 125 dps (this is about right from some parses i've seen)<br />
<br />
During the fight the sham will cast bane once and SoT once.<br />
<br />
Using these numbers, the mob would live for 52.07143 seconds with a shaman in the group, and the mob would live for 49.65517 seconds w a BL in the group.<br />
<br />
Now if the mob is SLIGHTLY slowable (ie sham slow's for 18.75% and BL for 16.25%)<br />
<br />
I do not want to assume a dps for the mob at this point just to help prove that it is irrelivent at this point.<br />
<br />
Now if you multiply the time the mob lives by the % that it is slowed, you will the number of seconds which the mob could do full damage before it died.<br />
<br />
I will explain this a bit better here:<br />
<br />
MOB LIFE (sec) * SLOW % * DPS = damage dealt.<br />
<br />
If we drop the DPS, you have the time that the mob can do damage.<br />
<br />
With the shaman the mob will have 42.308 seconds to do full damage<br />
With the BL the mob will have 41.586 seconds to do full damage.<br />
<br />
Yes that's right, the mob does less damage with the beastlord slowing, than the shaman slowing.  It does 1.706% less damage with the beastlord slowing than with the shaman slowing!<br />
<br />
If we actually add numbers to the dps, lets say 750 post retune, that turns out to be<br />
31,731 damage with the shaman<br />
31,189 damage with the beastlord<br />
<br />
This might look like a small ammount, BUT it shows that a BL actually mitigates a mobs damage better than a shaman.  <br />
<br />
So tell me again how we are the king of slows please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">As far as Canni goes, I'd like to change all the existing cannibalize spells to something more like the Ancient version with a larger hp/mana hit with a recast time.  Right now I'm waiting for some new spell functionality that will allow me to link spell timers together, as I think being able to memorize multiple cannibalize spells and chain them together would end up with too much mana regen.  I think this set up should allow shaman more time to cast other spells rather then chain cannibalizing.  (plus the chat spam is annoying)<br />
<br />
I would love to see retroactive changes made to the canni line that would bring all versions up to date with the current ancient spell and thank you for considering such changes.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, all that was needed to fix a huge part of this problem would have been to make Chaotic Pain available to any 65 Shaman.  I have specifically not bought Gates of Discord because not doing so was insulting.  I do not understand how you can believe that we would chain two canni's together.  The idea of having a higher hp cost/mana return and longer recast time canni is to *free up time!!* not to *take 2x more time*.  /boggle.<br />
<br />
Here's an idea:  have a quest involving a kunark canni4 scroll.  A 65 Shaman can turn in a canni4 scroll for an upgraded canni4 scroll that would be exactly the same ratio but for 4x the amounts.  The Shaman would only be able to mem one of these spells.  If the Shaman really wants to twist canni4 into every other cast then so be it, but I'm sure there are plenty that are sick of doing so and would choose the alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">way back in 2000 -2001 I had a shaman. I loved playing the class. I got married and decided to concentrate on my family (silly me, should of known it wouldn't work out before I started, religious differences are a relationship killer), recently came back to play again, my new shaman is a sad shadow of what the class used to be. I've been back for just under 2 weeks now and i'm already very unhappy with what I am seeing. Not what i'm reading, i'm not lame enough to believe everything I read, I tested it out myself. Shaman -vs- druid, equipped exactly the same. Fighting in EC against bears. Mobs conned at blue for both. Each toon took on 10 mobs. Hands down the druid kicked the shamans ass in every fight. 3 yrs ago it was the other way around. I am seriously regretting coming back to eq. Ryan isn't listening, and in fact shows every sign of having a grudge against Shaman. The content is generally no longer fun, my class can no longer function like she is supposed to function, CS is worse than terrible.<br />
<br />
My old toon (36 shaman) solo'd Spectres in the oasis of mar at 29. It was a VERY hard fight. I almost died twice. There is no way i'd take a 29 shaman against spectres now. I'd be dead before I could squeek /help. And SoE and Ryan say we are a balanced class? maybe I should just end billing and chalk this one up to old memories being better than new.<br />

im close to 4k hit points unbuffed. i would NEVER twist two canni's.<br />
chances are i would die to low hitpoint aggro, or from an add coming just when im going to hit can 5 and im tapping ancient can.<br />

no shaman would be so stupid. (but there are the rare exceptions)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I feel like I was somewhat misrepresented in the previous thread on my view of shaman and I'd like to clear it up a bit.<br />
<br />
Mana Regen<br />
Glori mentioned she really liked bear form when Velious came out and was sad that it wasn't nearly as useful as it once was.  I thought that was very reasonable and would be happy to add an upgrade for it in the future.  <br />
As far as Canni goes, I'd like to change all the existing cannibalize spells to something more like the Ancient version with a larger hp/mana hit with a recast time.  Right now I'm waiting for some new spell functionality that will allow me to link spell timers together, as I think being able to memorize multiple cannibalize spells and chain them together would end up with too much mana regen.  I think this set up should allow shaman more time to cast other spells rather then chain cannibalizing.  (plus the chat spam is annoying)<br />
<br />
Stat Buffs<br />
The initial implementation with the Accuracy etc is still on the table, as the Omens spells are still very much in transition.  I know you're all very well aware of the effects stat buffs have on players, so I won't bore you with a recap.  This is something to look at during beta and adjust the spells as needed.  I will, however, say that 75 str does have a noticeable difference on DPS.  The cap increases that are there now will likely filter down to the other stat buffs regardless of whether the Omens spells are changed.  Then again, that might change to the same system as well.<br />
On a related note, we also discussed increasing the buff limit most likely through an AA, which should alleviate many of the concerns over buff slot limitations.  Most likely this will be 5 new slots for a total of 20.<br />
<br />
Slows<br />
Generally I feel that the importance of slows (even in Gates) is being overly discounted.  Yes they have less of an effect on shorter fights then longer ones, but you're still mitigating a tremendous amount of Damage from a given mob.  <br />
Slow has evolved to the point where I'm not comfortable adding any more slows that are at a higher % then existing spells, simply because even the smallest change in % has a dramatic effect on the DPS of an NPC.  In the future we'll be adding debuffs that function in different ways, such as decreased dual wield chance, double attack chance, decreased maximum hits etc.  I think this has the potential to help shaman stackability on raids if you have several debuffs that need to be applied to the mob, each for a noticeable effect.  Again this is something we'll be looking at heavily during beta.<br />
<br />
Heals over Time<br />
Generally I agree that these spells across the board are too weak and need adjustments.  This goes for all classes with Heal over Times.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just thought I'd let you know what I thought directly in hopes that it would quell some of the frustrations that you all have voiced.  We as a team, and I personally, are very committed to EverQuest being the best game it can be, and I think with continued involvement and communication with the community we can keep EverQuest a great game for years to come.<br />
<br />
-Ryan<br />
<br />
-Edit: Spelling<br />
Thank you for listening.  With all due respect though, none of this addresses the 2 main issues we have:<br />
1.  The game is now about fast fights, and we bring nothing to fast fights that other classes don't - and those that have similar functions (healing, slow/debuff, buffs) either far outweigh us in that role, far outweigh us in DPS, or both.<br />
2.  Shaman stackability on raids<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
Our buffs hardly matter - perhaps overbuffs will make a small dent, but only to melees we're grouped with, not casters, and nothing will prevent buffbots from continuing to fill this role.  Stackability is unaffected as well.<br />
Suggestion:  short buffs that really affect the DPS of all types of classes<br />
melees:<br />
damage procs, + improved dual wield/double attack, <br />
casters:<br />
 + chance to crit, + chance to save mana, + some % DPS increase (5%, non-critable)<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
Our healing is a joke.  I'm in a VT/Tier 2/3 guild, and already I'm noticing this.  Improved HoT won't impact the shorter, fiercer fights that we're seeing unless they are WAY beefed up<br />
Suggestion: 1k on landing and 1k for the next 2 ticks<br />
2.5k blast healing<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
The debuffs mentioned above will only matter if you don't give other classes similar debuff methods.  This is what started the whole problem - giving 2 DPS classes slows close to what a shaman can do, all the while far outshining the shaman contribution in other areas.  I think the above mentioned debuffs are neat ideas.<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
We need better short term DPS.  Not dominant DPS.  Not the best DPS.  Moderate, group functional DPS.  Better pets, nukes, DOT's that take &lt; 1 minute to take full effect, the method isn't as important.  Bane was a great start, minus a pretty large resist rate combined with a large recast time (either alone isn't too bad, but to have a spell resisted and not able to be cast again isn't too fun).  Only then will we stack well on raids + bring a decent role to groups.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled we are getting attention and feedback from Sony.  Please continue to listen, but make sure you're hearing the right messages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I can. I don't E-bay! Current high twinked shamans are usually that way thanks to e-bay and lots of PP. I have little PP, and what armour I have was actually given to me by some kind soul who was &quot;quitting the game&quot;! my 29 shaman back then was better equiped than my current 13 shaman, but thats to be expected. I had friends back then who played as well and was able to aquire some decent equipment. Nothing twink, not by anyone's standard, but about what you could figure a good shaman at that level, working un-guilded could aquire for themselves.<br />
<br />
Also, unless I am mis-reading what I am seeing on our buffs and DoT's, slows etc for that level, they are no longer as strong as they were pre-luclin. I'll see though. Once I get my shammy up to 29, I'll take the risk and solo me another spectre. if I kill it, I'll eat crow and Say as much here, if it kills me... well, I'll be fair, I'll give em a few chances to see if I just got a stronger than normal Mob, but if I can't solo one again at the same level with similir gear, then I will say as much. I'm a fair person. I could be wrong, and am willing to test the waters on that!<br />

It finally came down to punch and stab. I decided that I was danged if I was gonna run anymore, the dot (envenomed breath if I remember right and I cast it a number of times before IT hit as well) had dropped it to about 73% (if I remeber right) and I was fully buffed and mad. Went in swinging and after dropping it down to 50% or so with my life at 23% or so I had to run and heal. Tried the dot again and if it hit I didn't see it. went back in and meelee'd till it died, my life was 3% when it died, one more good hit by it and it would have won. Was I lucky? very possibly. I didn't try Spectres again after that. Their was of course a lot more to the fight than whats posted here, and it's been a LONG time since then. But even comparably outfitted, i'm somewhat hesitant to try and solo a spectre again.<br />

<br />
<br />
The core issue as I see it is that you do not understand that EQ has fundamentally changed in PoP/GoD.  EQ used to be about efficiency.  Now EQ is about speed.  All that matters in the game you make now 99% of the time is fast healing, fast damage dealing, and tanking.  Shamans are very weak at all 3 of these, therefore we are weak at EQ. <br />
<br />
You just do not seem to appreciate that EQ is radically different today than it was from release through SoL, and that the abilities that made us powerful (sometimes overly so) during that era are largely worthless now.<br />

That sounds like a nice convenience.  The real mana regeneration issue is a relative one, not an absolute one though.  Mana regeneration used to be a huge strength of the shaman class, even though we were penalized for it by mana-intensive spells.  Now it is often almost entirely irrelevant because (a) every class has vastly better mana regeneration than before and (b) you guys have changed EQ fights from long, &quot;how efficiently can you use your mana&quot; fights to fast &quot;how fast can you dump your mana bar&quot; fights.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stat Buffs<br />
 I will, however, say that 75 str does have a noticeable difference on DPS.<br />
<br />
Years ago it was demonstrated that STR has only a marginal effect on DPS.  I believe it was demonstrated that STR only increases damage on max hits, not modal ones.  Unless you have changed the damage calculations since then, that should still be the case.  We can do parses for you yet again on this though.  Then again, we may just be disagreeing on what &quot;noticeable&quot; means.  Yes, you &quot;notice&quot; higher max hits.  DEX/AGI are in even worse shape.<br />
<br />
In any event, it does not really matter since buffs are someting a bot can do, and do not a constitute worthwhile core gameplay mechanic for your players.  Frankly, you could remove every buff from the game and I wouldn't blink :)   As an aside, please God don't give us any more tiny duration, long recast buffs like Avatar, especially when those buffs have only a marginal bonus compared to long lasting, no recast buffs (compare effect/convenience ratio of Avatar line to Haste line).<br />
<br />
<br />
On a related note, we also discussed increasing the buff limit most likely through an AA, which should alleviate many of the concerns over buff slot limitations.  Most likely this will be 5 new slots for a total of 20.<br />
<br />
Minor point, but why would you tie a fix like this to AAs?  It's annoying as all get out, because we know that a couple years ago you would give fixes like this without attaching them to a grind (root and snare stacking, for example).<br />
<br />
<br />
Slows<br />
Generally I feel that the importance of slows (even in Gates) is being overly discounted.<br />
<br />
<br />
(a) The cleric:druid:shaman heal ratio is something like 100:64:47.  The shaman:enchanter:beastlord:bard slow ratio is something like 75:70:65:50.  That is *before* accounting for pervasive mitigation.  What gives?<br />
<br />
(b) You have a stream of mobs that die in 30 seconds.  It won't get slowed for 12 seconds.  You need to have enough healing to keep the tank alive for the unslowed period anyway, and you can't count on the shaman to heal when she is trying to slow.  Why would you bring a shaman to slow over an enchanter, beastlord, or bard in such a situation, each of whom can slow *and* do something worthwhile the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
Slow has evolved to the point where I'm not comfortable adding any more slows that are at a higher % then existing spells<br />
<br />
Of course not, everyone knows that 75% slows were way too powerful, just like CH was, and everyone knows that these abilities are what made Luclin so dull (no offense, you guys have said that yourselves).<br />
<br />
The problem is that you can't take a classes' central ability, give them nothing in return, and expect them to be balanced.  If you decided that evasive/defensive hamstrung your ability to make interesting content and decided to de facto remove it from the game by introducing massive &quot;defensive mitigation&quot; everywhere, I would expect you to compensate the warriors in some way.<br />
<br />
Our central ability was Turgurs.  It made the game boring, so you took it away.  Then you gave us...nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heals over Time<br />
Generally I agree that these spells across the board are too weak and need adjustments.  This goes for all classes with Heal over Times.<br />
<br />
Heals over time are irrelevant.  EQ is all about spamming fast direct heals.<br />
<br />
Damage and Direct Heals<br />
<br />
I notice that you just didn't mention the two most important issues.  As I said at the beginning, the game you guys have made has three important roles in it:<br />
<br />
1-Tanking<br />
2-Fast damage dealing<br />
3-Fast healing.<br />
<br />
To make us viable in this new game you have made, you must make us much better at 2, 3 or both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>zk4r</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">No offense intended, Ryan, but honestly Shaman are well-past any kind of consolation, and no amount of good intentions or lip service can appease us.<br />

You have my sympathy, and respect as a person, but you're in a no-win situation until the rest of SOE takes action on fixing Shamans' issues.<br />
<br />
The Healing Gap is worse than it's ever been, and stuff we've asked for since Kunark has been summarily shot-down with God-like illogic and/or apathy.<br />
<br />
Beyond fixing what exists right now, and the the utter hell that is &quot;DX9 Collision&quot; there isn't much left to hope for...<br />
<br />
Hope...<br />
<br />
Fixing cast times on our single line of nukes and mal_X, C%-heals worth a ****, drastically better HoT's, etc. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Getting Group Resist Magic finally, Group Levitation, Group EB, lowering Acumen to level 44 or 49, getting a Spirit of Eagle equivalent or indoor Spirit of Bih`Li, and &quot;down-combining buffs&quot; so we spend LESS TIME buffing (so that Dev's don't have to keep tweaking the damn Cannibalize line), True PBAE Lure Slow.. short duration, hell ANY kind of PBAE at all...<br />
<br />
The hell with Champion-Avatar and the Drogmor it rides out on.<br />
<br />
It's past time to reinvent Shaman. We've gotten steadily worse since Kunark in healing... and rapidly worse since Velious in utility.<br />

Shaman will continue to be as broken, useless, and gimpy as they have been.  So long as they continue to believe that stat buffs are meaningful, that we should have to continue to pay mana cost penalties that are long since outdated, and that slowing a mob in the last 10 seconds of a fight (after the BL likely already slowed it in under 2 seconds on inc) is important - nothing will come of all of it.  Nothing.<br />
<br />
The meeting in San Diego I'm sure was a lot of fun for the people that went.  I'm sure there was a lot of back-slapping and chummy conversations at the Padres game.  But the fact of the matter is:<br />
<br />
Nothing will change.  I doubt I will renew my accounts (only 3) when they expire.  They obviously don't care.  Taking guild leader's on a tour of the facility certainly did not do anything to make me feel like my shaman will be any more useful in the future.  He won't. <br />
<br />
I'll miss him.  Sad thing, I'd play him if the game was fun anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Mana Regen<br />
Glori mentioned she really liked bear form when Velious came out and was sad that it wasn't nearly as useful as it once was. I thought that was very reasonable and would be happy to add an upgrade for it in the future. <br />
As far as Canni goes, I'd like to change all the existing cannibalize spells to something more like the Ancient version with a larger hp/mana hit with a recast time. Right now I'm waiting for some new spell functionality that will allow me to link spell timers together, as I think being able to memorize multiple cannibalize spells and chain them together would end up with too much mana regen. I think this set up should allow shaman more time to cast other spells rather then chain cannibalizing. (plus the chat spam is annoying)<br />
<br />
What's the big deal about giving us a new canni? The exploit reason is obviously an excuse since I can think of a number of ways so it wouldn't be exploitable. Firstly, changing canni 4 to a buff which pops up for a second (like Donal's BP) and making the new canni pop up a buff that is there for 24 seconds or whatever. When you cast canni 4, the canni 4 buff couldn't overwrite the new canni buff so you couldn't alternate them.<br />
<br />
Also, it could go in the bard song window since buff slots are valuable.</div></div><hr />

All these people are complaining about class issues happening way after level ~30 or so. Shamans up to 65 in Luclin content are fine and dandy. None of the lower level spell have been downgraded nor has SOE made the life of lower levels more difficult by changing some gameplay aspects. If anything lower levels have access to 5x better gear now than 3-4 years before.<br />

If you're going to give up.. just give it up, there's certainly no reason to tell us that the end is near.<br />
<br />
No, in fact you're hoping that if you add your complaint here, SOE will read it and it will be the magic bullet that turns them around and fixes something... Then when they do, you can be pleasantly be surprised... if nothing does come of everything that has happened, you can say, &quot;I told you so.&quot; <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather do something about it rather than moan on and on about how the end is near then be written up as the one who whined incessantly about it. <br />
<br />
One positive thing you've done so far is Cancel your account, that tells SOE something, now if we all can be unified as to a course of action (ie: cancellation or as was suggested before, character deletion), SOE will get their act together and listen.  But that is only if we can get them to understand that the vehicle is still broken.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone should be aware of the fact that since GOD, subscription numbers for EQ have gone down.   I would say that is one really important indicator of why they needed to do SOMETHING.  The player summit was a stop gap measure to increase their PR.  It worked temporarily but didn't address the concerns people had so if we continue to voice our concerns, we will succeed. <br />
<br />
You might say that SOE doesn't care that their subscription numbers are down, they still have over 400,000 accounts... but the fact is, being part of a larger company that is Sony, they MUST be accountable for their most precious product is slipping.... Take Final Fantasy XI, their subscription numbers are over 500,000.... that means there are more gamers out there somewhere, even when you take double accounts out there.   Gates of Discord was the first time subscriber numbers went down after an expansion was released, not up.  <br />
<br />
You better believe that SOE must pay attention, without us, they lose the greatest source of new accounts and ultimately that will dictate the health of their game in the long term... each person that leaves with a bad taste in their mouth is one less person that will buy a future product, and one more person that will give them negative press.   I work in the gaming industry and my words alone have given SOE new business by talking up the game EQ...  and recently my words alone have single handedly turned off at least 10 people that would have otherwise tried it out.  <br />

<br />

<br />
True, groups are few and far between, especially when a zone that 'used' to have 50-70 people in it of all levels at all times of the day now almost always has 7-10 users of level 50+ and maybe the token newbie toon being PL'd. But unless my memory is much worse than I think it is, my dots are resisted more, my DD's get resisted more, my barb shaman gets stunned a LOT more, and the damage returns don't seem to be as high. I'm willing to admit my memory of these stats may be inflated, but I DO KNOW that I was NEVER stunned as often before as I am now, and that the resists ARE greater than before. My memory may be bad, but it's not that bad. <br />
<br />
Also, Everfrost used to be a great place to hunt, plenty of mobs of all levels etc. now, I can literally go for 15 minutes without seeing a single mob, and as much as an hour before seeing one that cons some shade of blue or white, never see yellow except VERY VERY raely, it's all green and red.<br />
<br />
All the old hunting grounds are ghost towns. EC was the only place I saw a decent amount of mobs other than Paludal caverns. the Oasis of marr, traveling from zone wall to zone wall I counted 15 mobs total. only 3 of which conned at a level I could possibly have taken.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that SoE has destroyed these areas for hunting. Also, it seems to me that 95% of the users online are high level toons, wheres all the newbies? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Stat Buffs<br />
The initial implementation with the Accuracy etc is still on the table, as the Omens spells are still very much in transition.  I know you're all very well aware of the effects stat buffs have on players, so I won't bore you with a recap.  This is something to look at during beta and adjust the spells as needed.  I will, however, say that 75 str does have a noticeable difference on DPS.<br />
Then tell us what effect it is supposed to have. By how much % will that 75 Str up a rogue's or warrior's damage?<br />
<br />
Slows<br />
Generally I feel that the importance of slows (even in Gates) is being overly discounted.  Yes they have less of an effect on shorter fights then longer ones, but you're still mitigating a tremendous amount of Damage from a given mob.<br />
Even after the MOB HP increase, in a group with no enchanter and no 6th member I can not get a single Bane to run for full. In those zones were MOBs have low HPs 15 to 20 seconds (without a charmed pet) is how long a single MOB lasts.<br />
Unless I want the cleric to burn mana on inefficient spam heals instead of CHs I will have to wait 5 seconds to slow. Then it gets mitigated. I am lucky to get an overall slow of 40%. And that means I am contributing less then the cleric whose heals do not get resisted, who has fast heals, better buffs and also situationally (Pacify) prevents more damage then I will ever mitigate.<br />
Sure, slow is still powerful. But not powerful enough that shaman + cleric is a better team then cleric + cleric. That is basically what the absolute minimum for shaman debuffs + heals is - make us a better choice for a group then a second cleric.<br />
<br />
Slow has evolved to the point where I'm not comfortable adding any more slows that are at a higher % then existing spells, simply because even the smallest change in % has a dramatic effect on the DPS of an NPC.<br />
Note how no one ever asked for an increase in slow percentage.<br />
<br />
In the future we'll be adding debuffs that function in different ways, such as decreased dual wield chance, double attack chance, decreased maximum hits etc.  I think this has the potential to help shaman stackability on raids if you have several debuffs that need to be applied to the mob, each for a noticeable effect.  Again this is something we'll be looking at heavily during beta.<br />
Which by the way has the exact same impact as upping slow percentage. Except of course, being more of a nuisance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">im close to 4k hit points unbuffed. i would NEVER twist two canni's.<br />
chances are i would die to low hitpoint aggro, or from an add coming just when im going to hit can 5 and im tapping ancient can.<br />
<br />
Your choice to get yourself down so low by chain casting Canni is actually a byproduct of the quick fights and our inability to regen enough mana (relative to other classes) during the fights.<br />
<br />
If I had both ACP and Canni4, at 2300hp, I would not chain cast them because I don't have the spell gem slots and I do not need that much mana regen.  Ryan's fear is that Shaman would chain cast them but doing so would result in more mana than we could spend *and* would take away valuable time spending any mana we had to begin with.  In the downtime between fights, sure maybe some Shaman might be switching Canni4 in and out of his spell lineup, but that sounds like quite a pain to do.<br />
<br />
Notice I said twist into every other cast, as in &quot;Nuke, Canni4, Nuke, Canni4, Heal, Canni4.&quot;  Wouldn't it be wonderful for every 65 Shaman to easily be able to change that into &quot;Nuke, Nuke, Heal, (upgraded) Canni4?&quot;<br />
<br />
no shaman would be so stupid. (but there are the rare exceptions)<br />
<br />
...as to cast say, &quot;canni4, c5?&quot;  Even ACP (~640hp?) then canni5 wouldn't be such a huge chunk of hp that anyone doing so should be considered stupid.  Are that many Shaman stupid?<br />
<br />
this maybe huge mana regen, but it does nothing to help us.  we are subpare i agree in mana regen, but we need heals.<br />
<br />
If canni4 were changed to exactly what I suggested, the difference would be marginal at best.  What it would do is allow us to spend time actually casting spells other than canni4.  I never said we were subpar on mana regen nor do I think so, but it is a pain to regen our mana and can be more difficult to regain if we have to be casting other spells frequently.  Also, I mentioned nothing about heals as it's not related to Canni changes.<br />
<br />

You are right and wrong. Shaman can still do a good job in old content but if your goal is to raid new contant then why in the h*ll would you level one.

Seriously, SoE just blow a crapload of cash to fly people out and have personal interaction witht he community. Ryan is just making sure he is understood on where he stands which is much more reasonable then the mindset to which he was portayed in from the first post in this thread.<br />
<br />
Look man, i been burned just as much as you and as a guildless soloing shaman ( till this week ) believe me when i say i know what its like to be screwed as both and a none raider. But when people are activly making a effort effort and its right there in your face and you ignore it simply cause your used to not being heard, then maybe its time to take a deep breathe, step back and read up on things that are going on around here and re-think to make sure your walking the right path.<br />
<br />
This isnt just a quick post from Ryan. This is what is slowing becoming frequent communication from SoE team to its customer base, which is what we all wanted above all else.<br />
<br />
Call it damage control, call it fear of losing cash, call it whatever you want, but the SoE team is making a noticable change in their attitude and its pretty obvious they know they were walking the wrong path and are trying to correct that. Give them a chance cause anyone coming in and just blasting with unproductive comments only slows the process down.<br />
<br />
There was a time for chicken little, there was a reason for anger and discontentment, but maybe you should ask yourself if its still that time, if things are really not changing at all and you have the same reasons to be as angry as you were 6 months ago. <br />
<br />
If you can honestly say yes without a doubt in your mind and cant think of 1 reasont o be productive and supportive in this new mentality in SoE and communication between everyone, then maybe its time to cancel your account, leave EQ forums and move to a new game. There are other options out there now.<br />
