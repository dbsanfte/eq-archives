<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heading to EQ2 or what.<br />
<br />
<br />
So far i am a level 10 hunter, it took me 3 or 4 days of about 1 hour or less play time i think i played 2 hours if you add up all the playtime one day. So far im loving it. I love the hunter they are really fun how they are a cross between a pet class and a ranger. The regen and downtime is just about right and the grouping is great but mostly not 100% needed so far. I love it and im having fun how it should truly be when it comes to computer games, in mild and quality doses.<br />
<br />
I love more then anything that im able to sit down and play for 45 min and feel like i accomplished something and that i didnt have to sit LFG to do it. It does feel a lil weak on dpeth compared to EQ but not by a large margin. In otherwords by no margin that isnt forgivable when you consider this is a fresh game. If they continue to build on it this game is looking tight.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what you think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You hit on one of the key points that makes WoW a success for me.  You can accomplish useful things in game with shorter play periods than EQ required.<br />
<br />
Hunter is fun and really comes alive when you get your pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Litgruv let me put it this way.<br />
This is the HEROIN of games. It's in my veins and I love it. I am worried about my school and my skin colour. I have been asked by friends already if i am stoned when they saw my bloodshot eyes. They don't get that i was up 6 hours past my bedtime killing some filthy scarlet zealots and getting my voidwalker.<br />
<br />
<br />
This game will get far. They got a very strong base to build on.<br />
One concern is the bonding between players. See parties come and go so quickly that you don't have the time to get to know the other person. For example you get together to finish a quest and then ppl go on to solo. Not exactly BAD. But I do think it will get adressed. I do love to solo but making friends owns too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game is a 9.5 out of 10 for me. I am HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY.<br />
<br />
LALALALAALAL now if I could only connect to the servers....  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
DAMN lag :P<br />

<br />
This leads to my biggest concern for WoW. The levleing is fast. And the replayablility is kinda low imo. Pretty much the hardest part of any quest is finding the objective. Once you know the quests in an area you can breeze a second char though in half the time. Starting a second char on the opsit faction would aliveate some of this but not much. <br />
<br />
The way it looks to me is that Blizz will have to release an exspantion with in 4-6 months to keep the player base. If they dont people will start to get board and move on to other games.<br />
<br />
All in all the game is fun. It dosent have a steep learning curve. Andis a casual gamers delight. I just fear for its longtivity.</div></div><hr />

I feel the same way.  It's new and it's okay so far, but I wonder if I will have the same reaction as I did to Diablo.  I loved Diablo when it came out.  It was so easy, yet addictive, but after 2 weeks I deleted it off my hard drive forever because I was so sick of just clicking on monsters and killing them.  Point and kill.  <br />
<br />
I'm playing a rogue and I like the combo system.  It makes it more interesting that just backstab, backstab, evade, etc.  EQ tried to implement this with their &quot;openings&quot; system that failed to make it live, where instead they turned melees into casters with fewer spells.  And it seems casters and melees have about the same downtime; almost none.<br />
<br />
The quests are simplistic for the most part, which is good and bad.  I really hate long quests without intermediate awards.  WoW seems to pace their quests and give you rewards each step or every other step.  Though I'm not sure how long I can take the &quot;collect X of item Y&quot; and &quot;kill W of monster Z.&quot;<br />
<br />
What do you do once you're level 50+?  Has anyone here raided yet?  Once you hit the level cap, what else is there to do?  I'm just thinking if switch to WoW and hit level 60, get some &quot;unique&quot; armor and do some hard quests I'll just end up stowing it away like Diablo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm still only 23 but I think the game gets better each level.  The first 10-15 levels were were a little too fast almost.  I partner with a mage so we'd just go through mobs in 5-10 seconds but now the mobs are starting to last 30-45 seconds which is a nice change.  Brings in a little strategy and risk.  We tried a deadmines instance too and that was a good time.  As far as reaching 60 and being done there are already a few raid mobs, they will be adding much more raid content and pvp is fairly popular at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I play a 13 hunter on test three and LOVE IT.  I would agree, but its rather interesting how many features DEFINETLY were taken from EQ, but of course for better.  I just noticed how easy it was for me to adapt to the game.<br />
<br />
I really like how every class can solo too, as a hunter with my pet taunt (Howl) and the right balance of DPS and Healing, I can take down level 18 monsters.  This a new thing I really liked - this game takes more skill then EQ.  If your losing a fight but think it can be pulled off the strategy changes, things like that.  This game has definetly pulled me off Everquest I think.<br />
<br />
Oh yea I also like the vast amount of lore they have, but it could be bad cause if you havent played warcraft 3 alot of things wouldnt make sense.  I just hope with the expansions they open new places such as Outland and Northrend or something, damn forgot the name of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That sort of assumes that the game is over once you hit the level cap...<br />
<br />
Not really but in some aspects there is less to do. With each quest you complet or item you obtain. That is one thing less to work at. The point is diffrent for each person but there dose come a point where your sitting infront of your screen going &quot;Uuuuuuuuu.... Ok now what?&quot; If someone is the type of player that loves to play lots of chars. Then they will love WoW to death. But personlly I like to find a class that I like and focus on one char. I like new content and things to do to keep me intertained not beating the same old ground over agine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can say the same things about EQ...  but is *slower* better?<br />
<br />
As well is the game over at max level.  No it's not.  Because just like EQ it will have raiding to keep you going.  On top of raids whether you are on a PVE or PVP server they will be implementing Battlegrounds which are instanced raids for PVP battles.  Add to that Hero is on tap for further character advancement after max level.  I agree that WoW has the potential to have a shorter life than EQ might have had for many, but there are other factors involved in this.<br />
<br />
Also as a note about speed of advancement they just recently changed it so that level progression is slower after 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Don't forget expansions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">WoW has a few things to do at the top levels.<br />
<br />
For starters you have raids (and onyxia is hard atm) but you also have faction work you can do (who knows what the argent dawn path grants) or you can explore the PvP options.<br />
<br />
WoW is fast, WoW has flaws, WoW is not the second coming but WoW sure makes a good and fun game (even after 8 months of beta testing it I still like it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here's my analysis of WoW:<br />
<br />
I've played a Tauren shaman up to level 15.<br />
I've done so by doing nothing but quests.  I haven't gone &quot;grinding&quot; xp or anything once.  Ya, I have to semi-grind when I have a quest to get, say, 5 of this and 5 of that kind of feather from a bunch of harpies in an area.  But it's kind of neat dodging the mobs you don't want so you can hit the ones you do want and hoping your quest item will drop.  That's about the closest I've really done to grinding xp at all.<br />
<br />
WoW features:<br />
-fast levelling.  compared to eq, you rocket up in levels.  Coming from years of EQ playing, I know how to play mmorpgs somewhat well now.  It's taken me fairly little time to level my character up to 15.  I shot up through the level to get to 12, but from that point, it's begun to slow down since I've got access to a whole new area I can hunt in now and I'm looking around for quest givers and for the quest npcs I have to kill.  You don't even notice the levelling at all.  I just hope that everyone doesn't shoot up to 50 or 60 right away and get bored of it with potentially not much to do at high level.<br />
<br />
-loads of worthy quests.  every quest out there is worth doing.  why?  it forces you to see mor parts of the world you might not otherwise see.  I think exploration is fun.  You also get good item rewards for doing quests.  The majority of my gear is stuff I've gotten from killing the mobs I need for my quests, trh8skill stuff i've made, or direct results of quests.  You also get hefty chunks of experience doing quests.  some quests are gimpy in xp reward and give a bit of cash, but they are the easy quests.  The more involved ones like finding people out in the wilderness, dodging mobs all along the way, and then having to do a few tasks for them for the final reward, gives a very handsome type of reward.  I'd say about 1/5 of *all* my earned xp or maybe more is directly the result of doing quests.  A lot of cash is generated too.<br />
<br />
-trh8skill system that doesn't suck.  i don't mind doing trh8skills in this game.  in fact it's kinda fun.  i'm making armor i actually use.  it's not costing me money to skill up my leatherworking.  you can't ever fail a combine.  you just have more/less/zero chance of gaining a skillup on making a particular item based on your skill level.  that's sweet.  no more fear of losing your leet item you found when trying to make a good piece of gear (as opposed to say failing archery combines to make ele plane bows from POP).  I wish I could learn all the trh8skills at the same time, but alas, you can only learn like 2.<br />
<br />
-nice seamless landscape.  the landscape is beautifl.  it's one huge world without zones.  well, there are zones, but you don't &quot;loading..please wait&quot; or anyting.  it just says on your screen what new area you are in.  finding new areas on the map itself gives you xp bonuses to encourage exploration.  you can't see places on the map in any detail until you've been there once.  from the starting town whereever you are, you can start running and keep running and running and running and you pass by changing landscapes until you get to wherever you are wanting to end up.  You see that mountain waaaaaaaay off in the distance?  Well, if you start running straight at it, you'll end up at the base of it in about 3 minutes of running and can see the mobs at the base of it, and you can see the mountain detail slowly coming into focus as it would in real life.  Sweet.  Taking a &quot;public transporation&quot; griffon or whatever lets you see this very very very well.  you take off from one city and head off to another for a small fee.  You fly overtop of the landscape very quickly in real time, and you can see the mobs and players below as they pass by and you fly on to the next city.<br />
<br />
-downtime.  what downtime?  actually, there is some downtime, but not much.  you get into a fight, you kill the mobs.  even if you are at like zero health and mana, you can completely recover on your own in about 30-60 seconds.  If you are impatient you can carry food and water with you to eat/drink your hp/mana back, but I never bother.  It's nice that when combat is done, you can usually recouperate from the fight in the process of running from wherever you are to your next fight.  personally, i actually wish there was a small bit more downtime, so as to make it more important to wisely spend your mana, and make recovering with food and water actually needed or whatever.<br />
<br />
-combat speed.  or should I say combat speed.  I don't like this.  combat is over too fast.  here's a typical fight:  pull mob with nuke.  drop my instant fire totem to nuke the mob for me.  drop my instant totem to increase my strength or reduce my damage taken or to snare the mob.  melee the mob for about 20 seconds.  blast the mob with another nuke to kill it or make it flee.  reapply lightning shield.  loot up and carry on to next fight.  total combat length is about 30 seconds per mob if you are fighting even cons.  I don't like this.  I wish the fights went longer.  The spells you cast in combat should matter.  It shouldn't be all about the nuke as fast as you can to kill the mob before it kills you.  if you thought EQ sucked since GoD came out for fast kills, you have nothing to complain about until you've played WoW.  This is my biggest beef.  I have a big variety of spells I can cast during combats, but I barely use any.  Mobs die so fast when you are solo, that you cast about 4 spells per combat and that's it.  If you are grouping, well it's just rediculous how fast you cruise through mobs.  If you thought that you were going fast through mobs before, just wait until you group with 2 or 3 poeple for example, or possibly more.  When we had 3 poeple in 1 group, we were killing so fast, that if you have 1 person master looting, that person won't be able to keep up with all the corpses while the other 2 do the killing.  That's sad.  The HPs/mana pool of the players and mobs should be doubled, and the xp doubled per kill, so each fight is much more meaningful (with quests modified as such).  The mobs can also kill you way too fast as well.  If you are fighting a mob, and you get jumped, you're screwed a lot of the time.  You might be able to run away at times, but it's rough.  2 even cons you can probably kill.  If you get jumped by 2 mobs that are 1 level higher than you, they'll kill you before you have a chance to react.  This somewhat encourages grouping, but for the most part grouping just slows down your xp.  The only time it's worthy to group is if you are doing a quest and you need help to clear a camp or something of a bunch of mobs since you both get credit for the quest rewards and drops.  If you are familiar with how fast you go through mobs in diablo, you kinda get the same feeling in WoW.  Pull mob, cast a couple spells, hope you didn't die, loot, carry on with no downtime.  It's the main negative thing I've found about the game so far.<br />
<br />
-friends.  I want some people I know that I can regularly play with.  poeple from my EQ guild playing wow are scattered all over different test servers.  I want a core group of people I can group with and trade trh8skill items with them to save money and make money for fun stuff like mounts and whatnot.  I'm becoming a decent leatherworker, skinning my own animals I kill, but I had to pay a lot for my weapon from a vendor cuz i don't see anyone auctioning weapons, and I don't know any blacksmiths.  I've love some emergency use potions because they've saved my life a bunch of times now.  etc etc.  Pool your cash for collective goals.  Unfortunately I don't see very much unison among players.  5 times total in 15 levels has anyone wanted me to group with them.  I've been grouping in total for about 1 level.  You could be playing WoW solo on your own computer, and you'd get pretty much the same experience I've had so far, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
When WoW goes live, I'll be buying a copy for sure.  I know it won't take me away from EQ1.  I'll be playing it on the side, since you can advance so much for so little time invested.  Doing quests is FUN.  If you factor in all the races you can play, and all the terratory you can explore with each race and quests you can do total, there's a LOT you can do that will keep you occupied for a long time, which is what I think Blizzard wants you to do to get the most out of the game.  Plus there's raiding, but I have no experience in that at all yet.<br />
<br />
That's my $0.02 worth.</div></div><hr />

One thing to notice is that once you start killing elite mobs the fights will last longer, but I agree that the fights actually were over too fast in the beginning. I played a Tauren Shaman to 16, but am now playing the alliance counterpart a level 15 Paladin, and I am leaning towards the paladin being the more fun of those two. I am playing on test 2, it's an eastern server, and we're suffering badly from the current lag issues that became apparent when the Beta went open.</div></div><hr />

That's my $0.02 worth.<br />
<br />
First, I am loving this game so far.  The play is very fun, and the way it looks is just...beautiful.  Personnally, I don't like the way EQ2 looks, it's kinda waxxy and plastic feeling.<br />
<br />
Just a little something about the points above.<br />
<br />
With all the server downtime in beta, it is hard to keep playing with the same people because I know that lots of people will go make new characters on other servers, when their normal server goes down, just to be able to keep playing.  I'm guilty of that too =).  I have only been playing a couple of days and already have met 2 or 3 people that we look for each other to group with when Test 19 is up.  So I expect that issue to be solved when the release servers are there more permanently and people make their &quot;homes&quot; on them.<br />
<br />
A lot of people probably won't spend too much of the two week beta to raise tradeskills too much just to have them wiped on release.  I have dabbled a little bit just to see what the interface and overall system is like.  I did make a run to Ironforge today and I checked out the auction house.  There are quite a few items for sale.<br />
<br />
I leveled really fast from 1-14, but I notice it slowing down a bit now.  It's still not nealy as painful as EQ though.<br />
<br />
All of my toons are under 20, so I can't talk about the end game well, but from the talk, people are looking forward to the hero system to keep the game fun and entertaining at the end level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Doing the tradeskill stuff is fun.  I'm doing leatherworking because, well, I need armor.  I have bracer, chest, leg, boot, belt, and cloak equipment slots that I can make armor.  That's a lot of equipment slots to equip as opposed to say, taking blacksmithing, and only being able to make yourself a new weapon, and possibly shield?  Tradeskills aren't something you have to go out of your way to do.  This is how I've been doing leatherworking so far and how it's involved in my hunting:<br />
<br />
-I'm hunting around Crossroads, which has no leatherworker trainer, but there is a griffon there to Thunder Bluff.<br />
-I have my recipes I can do for skillups, and some recipes I can do for my armor I want to wear, and others could potentially wanna buy.<br />
-I have my quests I'm working on, and as I'm travelling around doing the quests, I kill the mobs that jump me, and I'm skinning the corpses I pass by that other people leave and that I make myself.<br />
-after doing some questing, my inventory is full of random loot drops, quest pieces needing turnin, and trh8skill items<br />
-I head back to quest npcs, do some turnins, get cash and xp, and find the trh8skill general merchant.<br />
-I make the armor I want to equip with my new trh8skill supplies, and dump the rest of my resources into doing skillups until I hit the point I can train up my next type of armor I can make.<br />
-I fly back to Thunder Bluff to get new recipes, and try making more new armor, or have a recipe for more skillups<br />
-I run out of trh8skill resources, and gate back to the inn in Crossroads, to get more quests and repeat this whole process.<br />
-I'm not going out of my way to do my trh8skilling much.  It's giving me immediate armor rewards.  I'm not making cash off it, then again I'm just selling my intermediate armor rewards to vendors instead of contributing to a real ecomy yet.  I'm soon going to be finding Orgrimmar so I can find the auction house to sell some of the excess leather armor I'm making for a profit, and other stuff I've found while hunting.  The only part of leatherworking that's been minorly inconvenient is the flight back to Thunder Bluff to buy new recipes, and the extra 5-10 seconds I spend at the corpse after looting to skin it.</div></div><hr />

From what I understand they are intentionally overpopulating servers  for stress testing.  Lag has been painfull at times but I have seen improvement since last week.  My guess the logon issue will be gone once it goes live. <br />

<br />
So far have done a Warrior, Shaman and Warlock...Shaman is highest at lvl 16...Warrior is lvl 11 and Warlock is lvl 8...<br />
<br />
Luv the shaman....luv the quest/progression system...like being able to make suff that I can actually use and loot stuff that is also useable...<br />
<br />
Fights are fast...but they are gradually taking longer...<br />
<br />
In a word though, its great (aside from the lag)...I found myself standing on a cliff just looking around, watching the birds fly by and staring at the scenery for almost 10 or 15 minutes...heh...it really is incredibly detailed and immersive<br />
<br />
Only downside has been lag, which i understand is intentional...but...the lag has revealed what I consider to be a few holes in the AI...<br />
<br />
Seems like when you lag out, you stop attacking the mob...but it dont stop attacking you...<br />
<br />
Its kind of sad-funny when your a lvl 14 shaman and you lag out and a lvl 8 wolf kills you, when you cant do anything...heh<br />
<br />
And like someone else said...I havent ground experience once...all I have been doing is questing...one quest tends to lead to several and they are all pretty much worth doing...<br />

When it goes live, unless something changes, I expect that I will be cancelling my EQ accounts...<br />

Couldn't get it to work, so i bought EQ2 and doubt i will ever set foot in Aeroth.Sadly, your loss. It's really a shame you won't experience Azeroth in person. It's amazing, IMHO.<br />
<br />
The #1 problem people had with the install was mainly related to FP downloaders unzipping the archive into a directory other than the path included in the archive itself. Most of the time it wanted to be installed from a directory specifically called &quot;World of Warcraft Open Beta&quot;. Simply renaming the incorrectly named directory resolved the problem 99.9% of the time. My brother was experiencing serious problems with it as well and sure enough...his directory wasn't named properly. Renamed it, installed correctly the first time. He's been playing a little over a week now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
     I, like many others, am enjoying WoW. For starters, I decided play the class I foung least desirable so that I could review it throughly. For me , that decision was to play a Druid. I am very pleased with how they have represented the class. It is nothing, repeat, nothing like what a Druid would represent in EQ. Heck, even the lore behind Druids in WoW is much much more respectable. I find myself liking the class for it's own merit, I suspect I'll enjoy my retail Shaman just as much.<br />
<br />
As for the game, I really can't say where it lacks or could be better. The game isn't perfect, but it isn't built on the rigid philosophy EQ perpetuated. In fact, for those that don't see a future for the game, think about this: Why do you want to be indefinitely satisfied with one aspect of a game, forever? Wow lends itself to allowing the player to start another character and be happy about it, especially if it's another race/class combination. You can play a character to the endgame and move on to the next fun experience waiting for you in another class. <br />
<br />
What I really love about this game though, is the options avialable to the player. You have a choice of what you wish to tackle, and how you go about tackling it. When I log on at night, I could progress in any of the numerous quest in my log book, for the most part solo if I choose unless I'm trying to finish an elite quest. Or I can get some experience roaming around to new areas, most likely opening up new quests if around my level. I could roam around and grind in an area on the look out for tradeskill supplies, for me I am a Smith and I look for Ore mines to plunder. Because I'm on a PvP server, I can go hunt some of the opposing faction if it tickles my fancy, or maybe I can just straight up grind xp, with a good chance of finding nice loot to sell/upgrade. I don't feel, at any point, that I'm required to do anything. Everything is optional. My choice. In my opinion, that is extremily satisfying and lends itself more to the roleplaying/fantasy elements that EQ lost so long ago.<br />
<br />
So far I've played WoW beta and EQ2 retail, and the decision, for me, is to play WoW because it is all around a more satisfying, complete gaming experience. If you're asking for more then that, then you're looking in the wrong places.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Woot wanted to mention something to those that think some quests are boring. <br />
<br />
While some quests can get a little repetitive in their goals they always take you to see a new place. New mobs = new drops for tradeskills. New skins or meats etc to do cookig and leatherworking with.<br />
Also some quests like the one given by Thrall called &quot;Hidden Enemies&quot; is amazing. You find out about people from within the horde (the shadow council) and how it's trying to break up the horde. You have to go undercover and pretend like you are one of them to find the truth. I am not done the quest since it just became an elite quest and i need a group but some quests are beautiful.<br />
<br />
<br />
And for those of us fortunate enough to have been in Senjin BOM'BAY is amazing and things like that add so much to the game. He is the troll witchdoctor in training lol that after you do his master's quests can cast funny spells on you.<br />
<br />
<br />
This game has a very very solid base to build on. Give it time. Communities will appear and grow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Agree with you Soulstorm.  It's been said, for those complaining of a lack of community, it is a little much to expect during open beta/stress test.  People server hop to whatever happens to be up at the time, starte countless newbies (I know I have) and only group since there are 20 other folks doing the same quest waiting for the same named to spawn.  I fully expect that the community will develop nicely when we play for real, so there's hope.<br />
<br />
As for levelling fast.  I don't know.  I made it only to level 13 this past weekend and I played ALOT.  I was tradeskilling and questing though and my pace was not that great.  I don't see how I could have played more and levelled more unless I disregarded my quests and just ground xp .  So sure, you can do this, and sure, you will probably level fast.  But you will miss everything in my opinion.  Also, how is this so different from EQ?  I could level to 20 easily in one day in Paludal.  I could be 30 in not much more time than that.  Hell, even when I played for real and solo'd a warrior (!), I made it to 30 in about 3 weeks.  How can you complain about fast levelling in WoW when EQ was at least as fast (and much more boring).  Maybe you could only do it in EQ if you were twinked and PL'd, but at least in WoW you can be self sufficient.  I say this is a big improvement.<br />
<br />
Last night I only made one level.  I was doing quests out of Crossroads and taking time to explore the Razormane camps, etc.  I played for about 4 hours and made one level.  But I was solo, and I had to strategically pull mobs out of the camps (and avoid an ELITE lvl 15 mystic at one of them!) to work my way in to mine some tin ore or go loot a battered chest.  It was fun.  I guess I level a lot slower than others, but I am enjoying the ride.<br />
<br />
People have also said that Bliz has held back some high level content and I'm sure that there will be more in the works, so I'm also confident that there will be plenty to do when you do reach max level, whether it's in 3 weeks or 6 months.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts, it's been bothering me that people complain about levelling fast... I dunno, I play different I guess cuz I don't level that fast lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I am loving this game so far.   I'm not afraid for the community at this point since it is just beta and like a few have said people are hopping from server to server just trying to play right now.  Even so I have made a ton of friends on both servers that I have established myself on.  <br />
<br />
Making friends is easy, you can see when they come online and when they go offline if you have added them to your friends list.  When you invite them to your group they can be anywhere in the world (just /invite soandso) and you can then see exactly where they are on the map .. its so helpful!  You can also mark the map by right clicking, which places a temporary marker on the map that your whole group can see.<br />
<br />
Questing with a group of people is also the way to go.  If you're exploring new areas (and lots of quests push you in to new areas once you reach certain levels),  its very helpful to have friends with you so you don't get ganked by random high level wandering mobs :)   Also most quests are simply MADE for groups.<br />
<br />
Another thing I love about this game is the quest system.  So far I have seen many many types of quests, and I am never lost as to which way to go next thanks to the helpful hints in the quest log.  SO MUCH BETTER than eq questing lol.  No longer will you search endlessly on internet sites to find out how to complete quests and what specific order you have to turn items in etc etc.  Questing is easy and painless, as it should be.  <br />
<br />
A few more notes about the quest system: you can get quests as drops!  I was hunting on the shore and this mob dropped a treasure map lol.  I followed the clues and found the treasure in a short time after that and it was absolutely a blast.  I felt like a real explorer for a minute there ..</div></div><hr />

I love that you can check out new places as a ghost without worrying about getting ambushed by baddies. Kind of like recon missions, hehe. The hardest thing for me to decide is what to play when it goes live next week. I tried most of the race/class mixes and am torn atm between troll/warrior and tauran/shaman as my main.

I know it must work because people were bitching that folks were making macros to target shaman totems and attack them, such as /target grounding totem and /attack, etc.<br />
<br />
Potions kick ass, and they are required for many higher end trade skill recipes, made a really nice blue pair of gloves with leatherworking, but needed two potions of defense as regs.<br />

I think the chat and macro system will work, we just need to get familiar with them. There is a UI program called Cosmos alot of people use, sanctioned by Blizzard that adds extra toolbars and alo of functionality, but I have not tried it yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Mostly a hunter, here.  I love World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
I actually got a chance to use my cousin's EQ2 account to get a sneak-peek of that game.  I only got to level 4 (he didn't want to give me any more time).  Already at level 4 I was experiencing downtime as a fighter around 3 minutes when I got really hurt.  Rediculous.  <br />
<br />
But, who knows about later levels.  But, i'm not impressed too much.  <br />
<br />
WoW has faster-leveling (it does slow down at later levels so it isn't like you're ALWAYS blitzing through stuff, especially with elite mobs)<br />
<br />
Quests are VASTLY superior to grinding.  Yes, it amounts to the same in the end, if you look at it objectively, but at least if you are always doing some quest or another, you get the feeling that you're accomplishing something other then mindlessly killing mobs.  Theres almost always a decent quest reward (for the level of the quest) to recieve when you're done, and money is always useful.<br />
<br />
I just mentioned quests were better then grinding, but I have to say it again, even if I dont explain more then I already did.  It's that much better.<br />
<br />
Every class CAN solo, and while experience is kinda hurt (bad) when you are in a full group, you can do things in a group that you can't do solo, such as instanced dungeons and raids.  While you may be able to level far enough to do an instance solo, it wouldn't be really worth it.  <br />
<br />
With the fast leveling and soloability for each class, you dont have to beg for groups for a long time before doing something with your time.  A big plus.<br />
<br />
But, i dont really consider myself a fanboi, so here are the downsides to World of Warcraft:<br />
<br />
Fast leveling isn't always good.  you get new skills (everyone does) every 2 levels, and with the speed of leveling, sometimes you can't always afford them as soon as you can.  <br />
<br />
Some people - more then usual - are anti-social non-groupers because of the ease of completing some quests.  And quests where you have to get items from mobs - who dont always drop said item - are actually HARDER if you're grouped (since not everyone gets the item - one at a time - brutally long if you have to get 30+ eyes or 60 tusks)<br />
<br />
Kill X Mob quests are a ton faster though :)  And elite quests, if you want to do them at a reasonable level, you should group for as well.  <br />
<br />
Graphics are specifically lower then other games (like EQ2) because Warcraft style requires those kinds of graphics.  It LOOKS like warcraft.  It FEELS like warcraft.  But it does have a lower polygon count for people whom that matters to.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard keeps the BitTorrent downloader there will be RIOTS away from the game.  This is the largest, most detrimental thing they could do.  If they keep this patch distribution method (they never said what they would use) people will flock away from the game.  And I probably would be one of them.<br />
<br />
I'm on a dialup connection, but I get access to a T3 when I need to (at the moment) or a Cable Modem.  The BitTorrent mod that Blizzard uses, on a T3, transfers data at TWO FREAKIN' KILOBYTES A SECOND.  This is a T-F'in-3!<br />
<br />
That's sick.  Just plain sick, and theres no other way to call it.  I'm not going to spend half a day downloading a 50 meg patch on dialup.<br />
<br />
BitTorrent, the way Blizzard set it up, will be the bane of WoW.  And it's not even regular bittorrent - the real BT client has a limit to uploads to keep it frrom getting too out of hand uploading files.  The Blizzard mod... I dont even have words to describe it.<br />

= 2621440000 bytes x 500,000<br />

= 1.16 Petabytes of information<br />

= 1220703 Gigabytes of inforamation<br />
If you have a fairly large 200 Gig hard drive, you'd have to do the equivalent of allow over 6100 hard drives full of info to be downloaded.<br />
That's a *massive* amount of bandwith for Blizzard to soak the cost of.  Not to mention the download speeds would be complete and utter crap.  That's why stuff like fileplanet or whoever it was charge you $8.00 to be able to download the software from their servers.  That's why bittorrent style download was being used.  For the patches, when you have to occasionally download a few meg of data, that's nothing in comparison.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard just never said anything about wether they would continue to use their BT mod for distribution.  <br />

I feel your a lil confised about some aspects of BT. There is no upload limit on BT unless your using a client that has that specificly built into it. Infact the idea of limiting the upload is against the idea of bit torrent to begin with. The way the system works is that the more people that are on, the faster it goes. More people is more uploading power and its easier to download and share files this way. This system is far superior to the current server to client system that all MMORPG's have in use due to the number of people that will be downloading patches when they become available. With a server to client design the bandwidth is limited and the increasing number of clients will result in a split of the pipe available and in turn each person suffers when someone new comes on to download. This means that more servers are required and more bandwidth is spent to kepe up with the increasing server loads.<br />
<br />
With Bit Torrent, as i said, the increasing load to the servers are effectivly nullified cause the load is not on the server, but on the network which is self correcting cause the more load and the more people downloading, the more bandwidth there is to support the influx of clients. Everyone shares and helps each other along. Now this system does begin to break down once the clients base depletes and there is less people to share with and at that point i believe blizzard needs ot move it to a server to client setup and eat the bandwidth, but for inital patch download there is not a better design ATM.<br />
<br />
One thing i will enlighten you to about BT is that you have to let it sit for a good 5-10 min for it get full steam as it creates its connection bases and modifies them on the fly to connect to new available connections. But once the connections are established i find that BT is a vastly superior method of file transfer.  Try it next time. Dont give up and say it sucks, let it run for a while and build steam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">The thing I don't like about BT is it's tendency to determine your connection speed based on download speed.  For ADSL folks (such as myself) the upload bandwidth is significantly limited (download: 1 mbps, upload: 128 kps) and directly takes away from download by a factor of 3 or 4.  When I use BT, it sees my high bandwidth (download only), rapidly maxes out my upload, which then chokes off my download, which then looks like a small bandwidth to BT so it slows down my download transfer speed.  The result is an abysmal transfer speed overall.  If they would make BT smarter, I wouldn't dislike it so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I've downloaded .Torrent files using the BT client (not the Blizzard downloader - the particular file was a paladin vs warrior duel) and while downloading, it said specifically:<br />
<br />
Max Uploads: 9<br />
<br />
Or something to that effect.  Might have the wording wrong, but there WAS a limit to uploads.<br />
<br />
I let Blizzard's downloader sit for 4 days and it never got above 6KB/second download speed, and that was on a shared T3 line I connected my computer to specifically for that purpose.  <br />
<br />
I was, however, uploading at several megs per second.  The way I read the numbers from the last patch I downloaded, I must have transferred the entire patch/client to at least 3 dosen people before finishing it for myself even once. :)<br />
<br />
Some people were lucky and got the benefit of all that.  I, however, was not one of them.  It took me nearly a week to get the open beta client through Blizzard's mod of BT.  And on the kind of connection I had, that's unacceptable at *best*.  And I do know enough about firewalls and ports, there were no limiting factors on my connection. (if there were, it would have limited upload and download, but I know there were none.  I had next to admin privledges for that particular section of the T3 that I was leaching off of.  Yes, legally! :) )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">What BT client did you use.  Any as far as downloading from blizz i peged my line out at 300kb a second the whole time. It moved very fast for me.<br />
<br />
You say its a shared T3, whats the &quot; shared&quot;  part of it. Its on a business? Collage? room mates ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I'm honestly not sure.  I deleted it after using it once to download that video a while back. :(  Maybe it was a mod that had limited the number of uploads - it's possible.<br />
<br />
And it's a public school line.  Shared among the immediate school district.   It's a 15 meg pipe that comes into the ISD and theres fiber optics running into each of the school districts, and within each of the districts, each school has their own systems.  The one I was using is a gigabit internal.<br />
<br />
My normal download rates from very congested servers are 300-400Kpbs,  i've hit 900 before (best case scenerio there, though)<br />
<br />
There is no limit on uploads using the blizzard mod.  It's kind of scary how many people i'd have to be sharing with to bog down the kind of connection I have.  <br />
<br />
Yes, it's shared among a fair number of people, but it ISN'T a college and doesn't see the kind of use that the college does (i've been there, too.  It's good to have connections when your home line is 56k :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Well just remember that a t3 is asymmetrical data transfer, meaning you have a finite amount of bandwidth designated to your upstream and your downstream that are not limited by each other as a cable modem is. In other words you can let everyone upload off of you ( most internet traffic is server to client &quot;downloading&quot; ) and max that pipe out but it has nothing to do with your download capability as they work for the most part indepentently of each other which is why a &quot;T&quot; is so much more expsensive then a cable/dsl line. Its possible that too many people were downloading pr0n and music or whatever people download where your at.</div></div><hr />
