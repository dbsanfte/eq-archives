<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm trying to be optimistic.<br />
<br />
I love this site. I've been coming here for a long as I remember. Once a day at the very least, though sometimes I've hung out for hours. I think Sunmoon is doing a hell of a job revamping, and has set up a great community of solid rangers who's communications are easy to access and very helpful.<br />
<br />
I dislike the fact that moderators lock threads. I dislike it a whole lot. Arguments and disagreements on this set of forums have taught me more than any guide or website spoiler has or ever will, and strict moderation is killing that.<br />
<br />
Wanna know how to lock a thread on the Glade?  Use the word &quot;****&quot; a lot. Or maybe call someone a name. Or disagree with someone. Or hold your mouth funny. <br />
<br />
You know, explatives are a valid, clear form of expressing a point. If you want that moderated, then **** you. You don't want your kids to read it? Then keep them the **** off the computer, because **** like this is completely unavoidable in an atmosphere that's this diverse and free.<br />
<br />
You know, namecalling is a part of life, both good and bad. If someone posted a message on these boards that was retarted and badly thought out, then they diserve to be called an idiot. It's the truth: they are an idiot, and that shouldn't be censored. <br />
<br />
You know, arguments are a good way of learning. That's why some schools actually teach a class on debate. If I don't agree with someone, I'd like to be able to let them know that expressly without fear of moderation; something I can't do now, obviously.<br />
<br />
Why do moderators on this board chose to moderate what they do? Is there a guide that you hand to moderators, Sunmoon? Or are they making this **** up as they go? Is it available to the general Glade public?<br />
<br />
It's a bummer when communication of any kind gets cut within a community of peers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cyantune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have alot of respect for you Merrikat, if you are the same one that posted all that great info on the cycle in FM on the Allahkazam site.<br />
<br />
However, One of the reasons that I like the Glade is for the very reasons you seem to dislike it. Not all the peers here find it hard to communicate without the name calling and expletives.<br />
<br />
Its a light hearted collection of decent players who come to this community for information and felowship. Not to get cursed out or flamed. We may not be a Democracy with freedom of speach protected by a Bill of Rights, but there is one freedom we all have here that I encourage you to excercise if you feel this way.<br />
<br />
Merrikat, meet Door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Myrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Expletives are not necessary in order to make your point. Witness the fact that we've been making good, valid points on this board for years with the profanity filter on. You know what, I can also get my point across by just typing four asterisks in a row - I love that I don't even have to put the actual curseword in my post. I can just type **** and let the reader fill in their own favorite four letter word. :)<br />
<br />
I find it ironic that you mention taking a course on debate immediately after defending your right to personally attack a poster rather than their ideas. If you've ever taken debate, you will know that while all ideas are fair game for rebuttal, personal attacks never are.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of boards available to you where cursing and attacks are allowed and unmoderated. We have a different atmosphere here in The Glade.<br />
<br />
Feel free to disagree with anyone you'd like. If you can do it without using **** and **** in every sentence, and without personally attacking another poster, we'd love to read what you have to say.<br />
<br />
If you can't, may I suggest The Safehouse...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only one thread has been locked since the new moderators started. I locked it myself. It was the thread Sean started about the tokens in PoP beta. Everybody called eachother names, cussed back and forth and generally acted real childish. I don't think I was wrong locking that post and I don't regret it. That's the kind of stuff that doesn't belong here. Nothing good comes of it continuing. It only makes people bitter and pollutes the Glade.<br />
<br />
I dislike the fact that moderators lock threads. I dislike it a whole lot. Arguments and disagreements on this set of forums have taught me more than any guide or website spoiler has or ever will, and strict moderation is killing that.<br />
<br />
I assure you, arguments and disagreements will continue to be alive and well on the Glade. If mods locked every thread with an argument or a disagreement in it, the Glade would be extremely quiet.<br />
<br />
Wanna know how to lock a thread on the Glade? Use the word &quot;****&quot; a lot. Or maybe call someone a name. Or disagree with someone. Or hold your mouth funny.<br />
<br />
One person saying **** or whatever a lot won't make me lock a thread. It's when a thread gets completely out of hand and very &quot;un-Glade like&quot; does it get locked.<br />
<br />
You know, explatives are a valid, clear form of expressing a point.<br />
<br />
There's a sign I read in an Irish pub once: &quot;Profanity is ignorance audible&quot;. I cuss from time to time, but I know and remember that it isn't a valid, clear form of expressing a point. That's the difference. By the way, just because there's a bad word filter doesn't give anybody an excuse to take advantage of it (exception being one unique thread here) however, this isn't very strictly moderated and you don't have anything to worry about.<br />
<br />
You know, namecalling is a part of life, both good and bad. If someone posted a message on these boards that was retarted and badly thought out, then they diserve to be called an idiot. It's the truth: they are an idiot, and that shouldn't be censored.<br />
<br />
Correct, namecalling is a part of life. However the Glade, as you know, is a mature and productive environment. Calling eachother idiots and morons and whatever else is neither mature nor productive. Enforcing that environment keeps this place the way everybody likes it. That doesn't mean nuking every thread with namecalling it in, only when it gets entirely out of hand. Namecalling is childish; no good can come of it. I fail to see how moderators are going overboard with this thought.<br />
<br />
You know, arguments are a good way of learning. That's why some schools actually teach a class on debate. If I don't agree with someone, I'd like to be able to let them know that expressly without fear of moderation; something I can't do now, obviously.<br />
<br />
I assume you are afraid that the change in moderation on the Glade will ruin what you're so fond of. That is not the case, Sunmoon still frequents this board and if any moderator does something he does not approve of he will correct it as he sees fit. The burden has only been significantly lightened for him, he still keeps in contact with moderators and oversees the overall atmosphere of the Glade. This place will continue to be a wealth of information and debate. As for disagreement, you're disagreeing with me and I am disagreeing with you and I personally don't see anything wrong with that.<br />
<br />
Why do moderators on this board chose to moderate what they do?<br />
<br />
I moderate for people like you who like this place. I want to keep it the great place it is for all gamers and former gamers who come here. I chose to do this to help Sunmoon out and because I like this place too and didn't want to see it crumble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Whitneysan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm going to take a different tact here.<br />
<br />
I dislike the locking of threads too.  I'd much rather see threads either deleted or left open.  When they're locked, they can still damage the community, because whatever bad behavior prompted the thread to be locked is still up there for all to see.  The only thing locking the thread does is make the offensive comments unassailable, since no one can respond to them.<br />
<br />
If the material is hurtful, offensive, or what have you, locking the thread in which they appear does not satisfactorily resolve that problem.  If you don't want someone coming here and reading those threads to be hurt or offended or otherwise upset, you really need to make it so they can't see them.  As it is, people are still being insulted or belittled, but they simply can't respond to that.  Yes, it's likely that they'll respond with equal insult or belittlement, but it's also possible that they'll respond with quality discourse, which could resolve the dispute a little more amicably.  All locking threads does is leave the insults up, almost like a momument :p .<br />
<br />
So I'd rather see tempestuous threads left open, deleted, or the offending parties banned for a few days.  It just strikes me as a better solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's true, and a good point. However, locked threads are in a way 'left open' - anybody can just make a new thread about the topic and keep it clean, and this has been done before - the quality discourse as you say. Locking as opposed to deleting also makes the thread continually available for viewing again by anybody who cares enough to peruse its contents (such as for the case of making a new thread and continuing on any worthwhile discussion in there), and at the same time rapidly makes it drops down off the page lists so it doesn't dirty up the place anymore. Kind of in a way preserves it, but doesn't, you know? Not quite a monument.. sort of like a buried archive.<br />
<br />
Yes, locking is not entirely perfect. We don't want to censor this place totally, but it still has to be kept clean. Deleting or banning is too much for things like this and is not meant to be used often at all. Locking is the only other option.<br />
<br />
Off topic, only Sunmoon can delete threads and ban people. Moderators move threads into a forum that he can review for deletion. Sunmoon still very much has a strong influence over what goes on here. We only make his job easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KaninZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Moderators help keep the Glade from turning into a Kindergarden. If you REALLY must call someone an icky poo-poo head, feel free to....somewhere else. I'm sure you will have them writhing within the steely grasp of your intellect in no time. Most come here to improve themselves as Rangers...not put up with flame wars and chest pounding. If you've been hanging out here for a long time Merrikat, I must say you've missed a few important nuances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Merrikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You know, I had a whole long six-page post that I had all formatted up debating the merits of profanity, personal attacks, and strict moderation on the boards.<br />
<br />
Someone I respect a lot read the post while I was off fooling around at school, and made me realize that it was purposefully inflammatory, and that I was getting worked up over (basically) nothing. She also forced me to realize that even if I was right, I was wrong because I was prodding the very people whose ideas I wanted to change.<br />
<br />
I’ll respond as well as I can, as politly as possible.<br />
<br />
First: <br />
<br />
 I have alot of respect for you Merrikat, if you are the same one that posted all that great info on the cycle in FM on the Allahkazam site. <br />
<br />
I am, and thanks for reading it. FM was a good zone to me right when Kunark came out… I ran that cycle until my eyes and brains bled. It gave me a lot, and taught me how to be a wee bit more self sufficient than some of the other folks I played with back then.<br />
<br />
Second:<br />
<br />
Elwin, I appreciate you poking your head in my little thread. I agree with your power to moderate, but I don’t agree that you locked Sean’s thread. Scandal entertains and informs, and that one involved the possibility of personal friends of GMs receiving help and consideration above and beyond what standard players get. I got a bit riled up that some posters in that topic totally missed the point. <br />
<br />
If someone would like to continue arguing that point, please start another thread, as per Elwin’s suggestion. I won’t do it, though I’d really like to read it. <br />
<br />
I also don’t agree with your idea that profanity isn’t a viable form of expression. If you believe it’s truly not, then you lose a vast wealth of written emotion. That, used correctly, is a primal power, and I not only don’t mind it, I prefer to see it used properly and in its place than for it to be totally absent. Most posters on this board don’t share that view with me. They prefer to look at posts through a veil of superiority based on syntax and vocabulary.<br />
<br />
Nothing pisses me off more on this board than some poor guy being with a valid point being chased off the boards because of his or her style of communication. My personal favorite catch phrase goes something like, “If you don’t like the way we do things, you should go to the Safehouse.” Saying things like this is becoming a trend. It’s used so much that it’s become a trendy cliché for use by people who want to fit into the whole wholesome image of the Ranger’s Glade. It has, by the way, been said to me personally in almost every single one of my posts.<br />
<br />
I believe that it also constitutes as a personal attack in some cases. If you moderate Sean and the rest of us flamers on the locked thread, why not moderate it here? I count at least two personal attacks against me in the post directly above mine. Where is the line drawn? It really looks like that line is profanity. <br />
<br />
I’d like to two majors changes.<br />
<br />
First, I’d like to have a completely unmoderated R&amp;F thread. Posts that get a bit ugly need to be moved to this thread, and it needs to be known that that thread is unmoderated, and may contain some real juicy parts. I think this would be a much better solution to simply locking threads. It would allow the community to get out some of its pent-up aggression. <br />
<br />
Second, how about a set of rules for posters? I only know of one other forum (for EQ, that is) that doesn’t allow personal attacks, and it’s the absolute bottom of the barrel. Check out Fvie’s Nazi administration sometime. It makes me cringe. I literally quit the server because of the jackass moderators on that board. One of the reasons that I really don’t respect that kind of messageboard is the locking and banning of threads on the whim of the administrators with no kind of information for new (or old) posters. <br />
<br />
You know what’s worse than being attacked personally on a messageboard? Being attacked personally on a messageboard and not being able to respond. I promised I wouldn’t in the third paragraph of this post.<br />

I have no problems with debate and in fact enjoy a debate much more than many people, I welcome a good debate. But if others begin attacking me personally why should I stay? I have no reason to convince you one way or another, I debate because its fun and because I may help people see another side to a story (I dont always believe in what I say, I often play devils advocate). I dont debate to make a person feel bad or to make myself seem bigger than anyone else. If it gets to that level then its not a debate any longer and I personally agree for the post to be locked.<br />
I understand what you are getting at. But I really cannot see any benefit to allowing mudslinging. All it does is get people upset with each other and while im no treehugger, I dont believe in hurting people for fun either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Merrikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Funny the only two to support this silly thread are from Alla's site. Mama would smack me if I said more.<br />
<br />
I tried to be polite. I tried to be topical. I tried to be even tempered.<br />
<br />
Then I see a real ignorant ass at work. Way to go, Mr. Logic! Personally attack me for defending your right to personally attack me. It's this kind of smug, jackass, out of topic post that makes me want to stop reading this forum. Amdee didn't think this post through, or s/he would have realized that it would have been extremly counterproductive, and I'm not allowed to call him/her on that, according to our moderators.<br />
<br />
I guess I just did anyway. I'd love to hear what witicism you come up with to defend your underhanded bash on me and on Allakhazam, though.<br />
<br />
But I really cannot see any benefit to allowing mudslinging. All it does is get people upset with each other and while im no treehugger, I dont believe in hurting people for fun either.<br />
<br />
Then don't support people who do it. People like KaninZ and Amdee in this very ****ing thread. Dig it? Read Amdee's bull**** statement about being from Al's site, then the snotty ass remark about mother's backhand, and tell me that wasn't meant to sting directly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Evenshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">....the locking of Sean's thread.  A lot.  There were some valid points still being made both for and against the alleged &quot;Rewards&quot;.  It would have been an interesting one.  Oops WAS an interesting one - until it got locked.   It certainly gave great insight into the mindset of certain people in the high end game, and for that alone, it had value. <br />
<br />
That said, I don't usually have a problem with most of the other threads that have been locked, that i have perused.   <br />
<br />
Its a fine line to walk, censorship.  My own preference is to have the mods stay out of it, unless there's a clear cut blatant problem, but it isn't my board.  In most cases, the community here seems to reign themselves in before it gets too far out of hand.   Too much tailoring of acceptable topics by mods, and the board loses value, I think.<br />
<br />
The profanity filter is a ****ing good thing, IMHO.  Otherwise there's too much swearing.   It doesn't bother me, but it offends a lot of people, so its probably a wise policy.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lots of things to respond to..<br />

<br />
I guess this is where we have to agree to disagree. I believe the context of emotion can be written without using profanity. Yes, profanity can express it pretty well, but I generally considering it to be crude and unprofessional. As for superiority.. yes there's a lot of propellor heads on the Glade that have a better grasp of vocabulary than I do, and they know it. :)<br />
<br />

It has, by the way, been said to me personally in almost every single one of my posts.<br />
<br />
People here are a bit sensitive and defend the Glade because they like it here and don't agree with any of the criticism. Generally whoever tells you that is a regular here, enjoys coming here and doesn't have much to complain about being here. Consider it stepping into somebody's house for dinner, complaining about the food and having them tell you if you don't like it eat somewhere else. I don't really agree with them saying it so often though, as it's a bit overused. If you're being told that often, I think you need to watch your posts more carefully. Just like it's wrong to go into most public places and spout profanity and act belligerent, it's wrong to do that here. Not saying that you do, just an example. This might be the internet but we try to keep it civil.<br />
<br />
I believe that it also constitutes as a personal attack in some cases. If you moderate Sean and the rest of us flamers on the locked thread, why not moderate it here? I count at least two personal attacks against me in the post directly above mine. Where is the line drawn? It really looks like that line is profanity.<br />
<br />
A couple points:<br />
<br />
This is the rant forum. Generally, this is where people can spout off all they need to. Mostly unmoderated. Second, I don't consider this 'out of hand', moderators aren't supposed to be that strict.<br />
<br />
...two major changes.<br />
<br />
My acronym database must be off tonight. What's R&amp;F?<br />
<br />
As for the rules, we are pretty lenient here. Always have been.<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps I made a mistake. I'm still kind of new to this and I have no false pride to protect. I reopened Sean's thread and asked them to keep it civil. We'll see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The departure from the point of the thread is the main reason why it was locked.  The debate about the rewards was quite stimulating.  But the focus was lost and it degenerated into bickering and name-calling.  IMO that kind of thing does not need to be on the Glade, and DEFINATELY not in General Discussion.<br />
<br />
You want to get into mud-slinging and personal attacks?  Take it to Rants and Flames.  Want to debate an issue?  Then feel free to use General.<br />
<br />
Personally I hope Sean's thread gets archived so the points made are not lost for good.</div></div><hr />

  My previous post wasn't &quot;mudslinging&quot; or intended to be hurtful. I was trying to introduce a little levity.  I rarely break out the big-guns like 'icky poo-poo head' for anything less...I'm an ex Infantry SGT and I'm sure I could go toe to toe with anyone in here in a heated exchange of expletives. There's a time and place for such language...it isn't while in a public forum that  prides itself as a haven from such.<br />
   I went back and re-read my post and while it was addressed personally to you (as I was responding to what you'd posted) it wasn't any form of &quot;attack&quot;. Sarcastic maybe (my weird sense of humor)....intolerant, yep...I come here to avoid the type of conduct you seem to defend.<br />
   While this is a public forum...it is privately owned and maintained and we are all subject to the rules and standards of conduct. The standard here that most of us appreciate and adhere to is to try and be supportive of each other and to help each other strive to build a better Ranger community. As an old NCO buddy of mine once said &quot;If ya ain't part of the solution, then ya must be part of the problem.&quot; You seem to be intelligent enough to understand that critiscism isn't a personal attack. Hope ya don't take this as one.</div></div><hr />

Ahem - if someone violated the board rules by using excessive profanity or a personal attack (in any forum other than R&amp;R) see that little &quot;Report this post to a moderator&quot; button...<br />
<br />
Are you, specifically, forbidden to use that? I didn't realize that function is labled &quot;Reserved for everyone but Merrikat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Accoring to our (very appreciated by most) moderators you aren't allowed to take the situation into your own hands and begin slinging personal insults and profanity back at the person who was being insulting. <br />
<br />
Do you really think that helps anyway? Do you think it makes the poster feel like apologizing to you and taking it all back? I see that your first response to a very mild, veiled insult was jump right in and attack the moderators again. How is that productive? How does that increase our understanding of your point?<br />
<br />
Our moderators are volunteers, even our beloved Glademaster. Without them, we wouldn't have this board at all. One thing which keeps them and the other dedicated people here is the knowledge that The Glade is a civil place to discuss things.<br />
<br />
Yes, sometimes they are strict. Sometimes they lock a thread I was interested in. They don't allow religious discussion in the Real Life forum, which can stifle a lot of valid ideas - but they keep the place civil - and at least that is consistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Merrikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Couple things.<br />
<br />
Elwin <br />
R&amp;F = rants and flames. This forum. I'd rather see ugly **** get moved here rather than totally locked, as per the practice of most message boards I've ever frequented.<br />
<br />
As to this base of rules you keep talking about, I can't seem to find them. I assume it's unspoken (or, in this case, written), and that's a base problem.<br />
<br />
So, on various whims, you decide when threads get out of hand, am I right? There's no code of conduct in place. It's not the user base, it's you, directly, along with the other moderators. That's a tough job: I wouldn't want to be in your shoes. You've got to admit, though, its got a real high risk for abuse.<br />
<br />

I like the way you introduce levity by comparing me to a small child.  Would you be insulted if I said that you were a dumb bitch with an intellect akin to a large pile of elephant ****? No, that's not levity, yet it's on basically the same page: an insult. You decided to use sarcasm, and I would have chosen to be direct.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I don't believe what I said in the above paragraph is true, I'm just trying to make a point.<br />
<br />
Myrea<br />
I'm the one who chose which forum to post in. I'm pretty sure I remembered that this was R&amp;F.<br />
<br />
Here, lemme spell it out for you. Amdee considers this thread &quot;silly.&quot; Now, we can construe that to mean that s/he agrees with the moderators that personal attacks and flames should be censored, and probably with the Glade populace who believe that it's below them to toss out the occasional flame. Then, in the very next sentence, he tries to flame me. This kind of **** makes the word &quot;oxymoron&quot; apply to actions rather than just grammatical inconsistencies. <br />
<br />
I'll admit, I probably should have edited this sentence a bit better:<br />
<br />
...and I'm not allowed to call him/her on that, according to our moderators.<br />
<br />
Had I to do it over, I'd have made it read:<br />
<br />
and I'm not allowed to call him/her on that in the general forum, according to our moderators.<br />
<br />
I figured that'd be self explanatory, since we're in the goddam R&amp;F thread, but I can honestly see how you, Captain Obvious, could take it at face value.<br />
<br />
As to the little button, I like that that's there, kinda like the PnP policy within Everquest. It takes a real jackass, however, to call PnP into effect when you can't solve your own problems. I seriously doubt I'll ever push it here on the Glade, because nothing I've ever seen has been out of hand so much that it needs to be locked. I'd probably push it if someone was spamming the board wanting to buy characters or advertising click-thu tracking websites, because that kind of behavior hurts my eyes.<br />
<br />
I think I've been nothing but civil to Elwin in all my direct communication with him/her in this thread. I've tried to, at least, and if I haven't, I sincerely apologize. I've moderated boards before, and I've dealt with people just like I'm being now. It's tough to stick by your decisions, and I respect that.<br />
<br />
It's only people like you, Myrea, that I dislike, because it's like you're on a blind crusade to uphold a standard that you have no concrete idea what is. You talk about board rules. They're not on the main site. They're not on the forum site. Oh yeah, you're just making them up, or they've been successfully hidden far deeper than they ever should have been. <br />
<br />
Before you say it, the FAQ has no information beyond the strict definition of a moderator. Sunmoon has said nothing recently outside of &quot;don't attack other classes.&quot; The MUST READ sticky up in the general forum was, well, a guide for morons who can't figure out which forum in which to post.<br />
<br />
So, link me, or shut the hell up about board rules and admit that this board is moderated at the whim of the moderators, and not the user base.</div></div><hr />

The Glade is, by all accounts, a great place to read, learn, and browse just about anything you'd ever want to even think about knowing concerning the ranger class.<br />
<br />
It's also the only website I know of that plays with kid gloves on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Merrikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">This is not a democracy, its a family. <br />
<br />
I'm a member of the ranger community, both though my contributions to this and other websites as well as in game. This is not a family, it's a community. I don't love you like a family member, even though you do have a cute signature and a Terry Pratchett quote. If you believe otherwise, then you need to wake up.<br />
<br />
If you violate the rules you get sent to your room.<br />
<br />
Here we go again. Where are these rules? I've looked, I've done searches. Oh yeah, there aren't any. The rules of this forum seem to revolve around the idealisms of every idiot who can post, and morph from member to member. <br />
<br />
Well, since I'm the idiot who started this particular thread, do I get to make the rules? Ok, here's the only rule: don't use the old (bad) argument revolving around &quot;if you don't like the way I do things, then leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you don't like it, leave.<br />
<br />
****, too late. Well, this thread was started by a sect of the community who doesn't agree with you. If you don't like that, get the **** out of my thread if you don't have anything productive to add.<br />
<br />
Do you see the double standard here Taamar? You tell me to get off the Glade because I have don't like your rules. I tell you to get off the Glade because you don't like my rules. There are no official rules set by moderators. We're doing the exact same thing. The only difference is that you're more vocal and I'm more lurk. I'm no less a part of the community than you are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe family was a bad metaphor... this is Sunmoon's House. Follow his rules (which he can change when he likes) or build your own damn house. <br />

<br />
Lastly Merrikat, you mentioned earlier that I was supporting people in this thread and suggested hypocrisy on my part. Now while I admit I am a hypocrit I have not supported anyone here.

Elwin is a pretty level headed person, and has been good at keeping things on a mature ground.<br />
<br />
Sean's post got ugly, beyond some Safehouse things I have seen in the past. If there was any viable info in that thread, it was lost in the mudslinging, name calling, and bickering.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think Sean should have been reprimanded for some of the things he said, as maybe a few others in that thread. Crap like that should not be tolerated here imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Sunmoon has made several references over the Glade's years about the general level of social dignity we must afford each other on these boards. I'm not sure if a comprehensive set of rules was ever spelled out, but I suppose if you want to know his attitude on your topics here you could do a search on posts made by him as most of the times I've seen him post has been to call us on our childish behavior. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I fail to see where personal attacks have a place on any board where the main goal is to collect and distribute information. Opinions can differ on matters but there is no need to insult one another just because you do not agree. <br />
<br />
And in exercising that right, I happen to disagree with your premise that profanity is a constructive &quot;primal&quot; force to the written language. Primal sure, constructive no. A point can be made with no uncertain terms without resorting to a curse word. I view the use of a curse word as the lack of the ability to substitute a &quot;normal&quot; word in its place that would convey the meaning in a more clear and robust manner.<br />
<br />
However, I am not against profanities being used in situationally appropriate manners in which one's mental capacity is not expected to be functioning like a well oiled machine.  Like if a car flips over in front of you on the freeway &quot;Oh ****&quot; is a perfectly acceptable reaction.  However, in explaining the situation after the fact, I do not find it acceptable to say &quot;Holy ****ing ****, you won't believe the **** that happened to me on the ****ing way home!  A car ****ing fliped and I just missed getting hit by the ****er.  The driver must have been drunk off his ****sucking ***.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I find it very difficult to get this upset over posting mechanics or ingame issues.  Take a step back and look at the various responses to the various &quot;provocations&quot; and think a minute about what sort of effect anything someone can say here can have on you as a person.  Its not much at all, so why get bothered about it?  Even the folks I disagree with I strive to have a bit of respect for, and that's really the sum-total of rules that I have used in how I posted.  Don't attack folks, but feel free to criticize their actions or assertions.  Don't swear (excessively).  That's really about it :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Amdee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">As Taamar pointed out, this is Sunmoon's house. The &quot;rules&quot; of conduct would be no different than when visiting anyone's house. You don't go visit a friend and then curse out their family and kick their dog because they didn't post a list of rules on their wall. Of course not. And if you brought a bottle of wine or a plant or a plate of cookies, that would not give you the right to call people names or behave like an ass. Gladers are mature, and understand this. Anyone who doesn't will inevitably be frustrated here.<br />

Simas: You forgot to do a search ;) /bonk :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Merrikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Malevant is completely correct. It's very difficult to understand how someone can get upset over posting mechanics. It's very abstract concept. I was upset because a thread was locked, and I was missing a thread that was important to me. That’s why, nothing more.<br />
<br />
To me, it's more difficult to explain how so many folks in this thread are upset about the language some of us use to express ourselves. I guess I define &quot;maturity&quot; in a different way.<br />
<br />
I will completely ignore Caytune's most recent post because it has nothing to do with what s/he quoted. It's like two separate trains of thought got caught up, mingled, decided they wanted nothing to do with each other, but were stuck here anyway. I would, however, like to ask the difference between my being referred to as a &quot;turd,&quot; and my calling that Caytune &quot;a piece of ****.&quot; Is one more acceptable than the other? Is this a double standard? Probably yes, on both accounts.<br />
<br />
As far as Amdee's post:<br />
I don't know about you, but I sure know about me. I don't let 40,000 people with some incredibly diverse backgrounds and methods of expression have a sit-down in my house. I wouldn't let them turn on Monday Night Football, much less have a discussion about something all of them care about in dramatically different ways. Sunmoon does. This is how his house is different from yours.<br />
<br />
As to your idea of maturity, you're generalizing in a pretty big way. Your ideas of maturity don’t match up with mine. I think yours are closer to another abstract concept: conformity. For instance, I don't think it's mature or necessary to give a private little nod to another poster in every post you make. It makes you look juvenile; like you can't focus on the topic at hand. Do you have difficulty concentrating or thinking of one thing at the time? ADD is pretty common in our society. You may need a physical, and maybe some counseling.<br />
<br />
Or, maybe you're right. I'd probably be frustrated in your house. Then again, ten bucks says my home is a helluva lot more comfortable, open, and tolerant. Or, if you prefer, more mature.</div></div><hr />

No, you didn't get it. Sean's thread was unlocked, and that was my goal, even though I didn't think it was possible. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, if your idea of &quot;interesting&quot; isn't personal attacks, you would have never read this thread. The second someone invited me to leave, compared me to a small child, told me I was being immature... basically the second post on this thread... it became a flame thread, but not before. I didn't start the flaming. In fact, I tried to be polite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hmm..  re-reading this thread it seem that you Merrikat are lashing out a bit more than others.  For someone who espouses the right to speak your mind regardless of the type of language used you seem to have a problem differentiating between a personal attack and levity.<br />
<br />
When kazinZ referred to keeping the glade from turning into kindergarten, he wasn't saying you are a child (as you interpreted it) but rather calling us Gladers in general capable of de-evolving to the Kindergarten level, i.e. name calling and personal attacks.  When he said icky poo-poo head i would image he was trying not to be as deathly serious as you make this issue out to be in trying to say if you want to flame the living crap outta someone, do it somewhere else.<br />
<br />
As for Amdee your feathers are ruffled for no particular reason.  Without using so many words she was pointing out that threads at alla's get out of hand fast and that's exactly what we don't want to see here.  Her added comment about the backhand wasn't directed at you either, she was simply stating that she was censoring HERSELF to fall within her guidelines of proper posting.<br />
<br />
Furthermore you further mis interpret Cyan.  He's not calling YOU a turd, he's calling curse words turds.  That doesn't mean just because you use them you are by association a turd, but rather that curse words are vulgar, no way, shape or form about it.  Can't make it pretty and presentable in any way.<br />
<br />
But instead you take it all as a personal attack.  Then when Myrea steps up and points out that there are rules in place.  You did a search for &quot;official rules.&quot;  There are obviously none.  That should be addressed I suppose.  However, as a long time glade resident I'm sure you've seen Sunmoon come in and layth the smack down on various threads that got out of hand.  Going by his actions a general guideline was established and that is the protocol we follow.  Maybe something a new poster has to get used to, but is usually schooled relatively quickly.<br />
<br />
And of course, my original polite message to you was glossed over in your need to lash out at others.<br />
<br />
Take a step back Mer.  Try re-reading the posts as people have stated they are intended and don't imagine everything as a personal attack upon yourself.<br />
<br />
Also, re-read your first post.  It did indeed did start out polite.  However, it quickly became aggressive and inflamitory, almost like a pre-emptive strike on the people you knew would come to disagree.  In all honesty, given your sensitivity to the relatively innocuous posts that you took personally, would your original post not get your feathers a mite ruffled if it was directed at you with the reverse of your argument being pursued?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">i dont come here for a flame fest, if you want that goto some other board and chill the **** out there man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Fraen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">**WARNING**  Long post ahead...<br />
<br />
I believe, myself, that Rounlin has come closer to the true problem than anyone else thus far to reply...<br />
<br />
I submit to you this:  When I (and for that matter *most* of the others) come to The Ranger's Glade, it is for information. The inherant problem with putting any sort of flame or rant as a reply to a message in any other forum other than this one specifically set aside for it is completely counterproductive. Please note that flame and rants are very different from a debate style conversation.<br />
<br />
It is completely counterproductive for many reasons. I shall give at least a few.<br />
<br />
First of all, I know of very few people who randomly click on a thread to see what is inside. Instead, we are lulled inside by an informative (and sometimes quite ingenious) thread title. (I won't even start on the people who put threads inside the wrong forums considering that they are plainly labeled.) We seek the information that this thread may contain. So far, this is easy said and done.<br />
<br />
Then we get into a thread and we (who are on dialup) wait a few moments... sometimes minutes... for the thread to load its first page. The first post is found to be intellectually stimulating so the reader decides to peruse the thread further. (If, instead, the first post is found to be a dud, most people will leave directly.) So far, so good (except for the wait, but then, I ought to find a way to talk them into running cable to this area).<br />
<br />
Indeed, the first few posts contain great information with which I immediatly enter into a tabbed notebook for future reference and cross-referencing. Then it happens, the first flame...<br />
<br />
The next post stays on topic just fine and I glean a little more useful information from the thread. Then I find out that the next seventeen posts are counter-flames to the first, with a few rants thrown in for good measure. Not only did I have to read each and every one to determine that, but I also now find out why it take so long for it to be transferred to my computer.<br />
<br />
To shorten this story up, I wind up having to sort through twenty pages of slow loading crap just to get to the few posts that happen to contain useful information.<br />
<br />
That in and of itself is counterproductive to what The Ranger's Glade is for. No one should have to wait and wade through an hours worth of stuff that could have been accomplished in the first five minutes if everyone would have kept to themselves and stayed on topic. Rants and flames both have their place in this forum and this forum only...<br />
<br />
<br />
I submit to you the second problem (and truly the most important one):  Having all of these rants and flame posts creates server stress...<br />
<br />
As many user as the glade has, everytime that someone has to load a page with nineteen out of twenty non-useful posts, it puts stress upon the server. Sooner or later it gets filled up with this useless junk and begins to slow down (as those who have been here for even a short while should remember caused a server reset not too long back.) Even with one-hundred gigabytes of space upon my hard drive here at home, it is a very good guess that if I filled all available space up with nothing that I will ever use, the things that I like to use would begin to move at a snails pace.<br />
<br />
A number of message boards take care of this problem by deleting the older messages with impunity, but The Glade, being prided upon being a very reliable information source keeps all this useful information for as long as is possible. This is a wonderful thing for not only the ranger community, but also the entire EQ community. Almost like a library. It should be respected and treated as such.<br />
<br />
I haven't even, nor will I get into the fact that this makes the search engine infinately slower, which is also counter-productive. (This is especially due to the fact that in days long past, everyones favorite phrase was to &quot;use the search engine&quot;)...<br />
<br />
<br />
My third and final point (as I am getting tired from having worked all night):  Most of the long time viewers do think of this site more as a home away from work and Everquest...<br />
<br />
And like any home, it has its rules. Certain things are to be expected. These things do not necessarily &lt;I&gt;have&lt;/I&gt; to be written down (though, at one time, I do remember them being). If you were to walk into my home, invited or not, and were to put you feet upon and muddy my couch, you would be out the door faster than you could stand. This is whether I had explicitly mentioned the fact that no guest of my home is able to place his feet upon the furniture or not. (This is not to mention that in &lt;I&gt;my&lt;/I&gt; home, shoes are to be removed at the front door, but I digress, this is off topic and making this post longer.)<br />
<br />
Certain things are to be expected and a good portion of The Glade holds their &quot;home&quot; to high standards. Quite frankly, I applaud Elwin for standing up and being the House Constable that he was elected to be. You will always have roudy kids, but the intentions behind it all is to make sure that it doesn't get too far out of line... You have been here for quite some time and you know what the house rules are. Sunmoon was right in choosing you for your part and indeed he had very good reasoning behind it... You did good... And you did right, no matter how few may have disagreed with you...<br />

I formally apologize for the lengthyness and for any grammatical or spelling errors that may exist. I know that this post is not up to my normal standards, but sixteen hours worked mostly at night will make the brain not function as properly as it should...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Salty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I agree, sir, that cursing is a viable form of expression. I would note, however, that it is generally a way of conveying emotion rather than information. I have been led to believe that this site is a forum for discussing or garnering ideas, strategies, game mechanics, etc. While it is appropriate that emotion filled posts and diatribes populate the R&amp;R section, they really don’t convey much useful information, and therefore do not really belong in the informational forums. Additionally, while I can and do “cuss like a sailor” (literally), I exercise restraint in the when and where of it. I try not to come into a group of people and expose them to coarse language if they prefer more civil means of communication.<br />
<br />
As to the actual point of your post, I admit that I found Elwin’s reasoning valid in the context of this particular community (wanting to stop the inane name calling, while preserving whatever information was actually contained in the thread). A reasoned arguing of facts (or even opinions) is usually not mistaken for a flame war. Having a vulgarity before or after a fact or opinion makes it no more or less valid. It will, however, probably spur the respondent to reply in kind (or at least think in kind, if he/she practices restraint).  He did mention that a new thread could be started addressing the original intent (hopefully without the bandwidth wasting drivel of flame/counter flame).   <br />
<br />
<br />
In the final analysis, this is a private board. While I too have found no “official rules of conduct”, they were actually pretty easy to deduce just in the time that I lurked. I gather that you are no less intelligent than I, so it seems a bit disingenuous that you did not “know” what they were too.<br />
<br />
Finally, I invite you to NOT leave the Glade, but to respect the wishes of the majority (while not in the R&amp;R forum), and continue to learn from and indeed teach us.</div></div><hr />

I've been purposefully inflammatory to prove a couple of points. I thought that was rather obvious. I know that you could infer almost each and every post that looks and sounds like a personal attack on me to be something else: this isn't big news. I think I got those points across though. <br />
<br />
Here are my points:<br />
<br />
 I don't like the locking of threads.<br />
 Some regular posters who post here have a double standard regarding personal attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I don't think my first or second post was harsh at all. The first post used profane language as a method of showing direct emotion. My second post was heavily edited to actually remove any personal flames. I gave examples of what I was talking about, thanked two specific posters, and suggested changes to make things, in my eyes, a bit more open and refreshing here on the Glade. Not saying that I deserve a cookie, but it's not like I was singling people out and calling them vile and horrific names.<br />
<br />
My third post is a direct flame. I was pissed, and I don't agree with your reasoning behind Amdee's post. I'll leave that here, that we disagree, but if you'd like me to pick apart the tone, verbiage, and implications of what s/he said, I'd be happy too.<br />
<br />
As far as directing my original post back at myself, I don't think I would have been upset at all. This probably stems from the fact that I agree with myself, but trying to look at it objectively, I'm not offended by it either. The last line is the most hurtful, pointed directly at Elwin, and it's not true anymore.<br />
<br />
Rounlin:<br />
If you don't like rants of flames, get off the R&amp;R board, you pompous ass.<br />
<br />
Fraen<br />
First off: It's ok, bud. We don't mind long posts, it happens. You don't need to blame work on the fact that you try very hard to make your posts sound good.<br />
<br />
On information exchange: flames provide information. They honestly do. Well, most do. If I'm going to flame someone, I'm going to tell them exactly why I did it and give examples of why they were wrong. This is the reason I read most flames. Now, I'll skip the argument where everyone's just posting one-liners calling each other names, but that doesn't happen often here. Generally, when a flame happens on the Glade, it's an informative flame, if you dig.<br />
<br />
As to random clicking and reading, I do. I read everything, weather it's got to do with me or not. Granted, I only read a coupla forums here on the glade, but generally I read them completely and thoroughly. As far as sever stress, that's a pretty weak argument. You're asking the populace to let obvious stupidity fly because you're on dial up? Am I reading this right?<br />
<br />
I posted here because this is a rant. This didn't belong on the general board. Any thread in the general board that turns into a rant or flame session, in my opinion, should be moved here rather than locked.<br />
<br />
You and I have very different ideas of what a home is. Home, to me, is not just a place where I sit my ass down and watch ice hockey with my girlfriend. Home's a place where I can relax, be myself, and, above all, feel comfortable, and I like my visitors to be the same way. I'm not saying that another person's home is to be used as my own private pig pen when I'm visiting, but you know what? Carpet is meant to be walked on, and if you want to put your feet up in my house, go right the hell ahead. <br />
<br />
This isn't the case in your home, and I'd be willing to bet that your visitors leave feeling like they were in more of an occupational environment rather than a home. Oppressed is too strong a word. Maybe oppressed-light. <br />
<br />
Was Elwin elected? Damn, I missed that. I thought Sunmoon picked him out. And he did, after all, unlock the thread, do don't clap too hard. The prisoners are running free, they're just doing it a bit cleaner this time.<br />
<br />
Salty:<br />
As to cursing, you're almost ****ing-A right. <br />
<br />
I'm a reader. I read a whole lot. Everything I can get my hands on, in fact. Good fiction, to me, generally includes a fair amount of profanity, and this is where I get any profane stylism that I may have. <br />
<br />
When you read a Neil Gaimen book, it's painfully obvious (and I do mean painfully) that he's an amazing writer with the talent to write things that are so profane they almost leak into erotic or even pornographic fiction. On the other hand, he can write a fairy tale with suitable language for children, but have it plot-lined for adults. On the other hand, he can legitimately write a damn fine book made especially for children. His scope is broad enough to do that, and I certainly don't look down on some of his more profane work. In fact, I generally enjoy it just as much or more than any of his other work. <br />
<br />
This isn't the case with some members of this board. They think profanity is for the unintelligent, and that it has no value in conversation or in the written word, and that's something that I don't agree with. Sure, you can make your point without being profane, but you can make your point a whole lot stronger and emotional if you are.<br />
<br />
Now, being that I'm in a community of peers, and most folks don't like to hear the occasional swear word, I'm glad the filter is in place. It let's me type and think the way that I feel without (hopefully) offending anyone on the grammatical level, which most people in this thread have complained about. Subject matter is a whole different ball of wax, and that's what I'm complaining about.<br />
<br />
I don’t like threads being locked, because I miss subject matter that may be important to me.<br />
<br />
I'm off to school.</div></div><hr />

This is not a place for rampant swearing on posts. This has never been such a place.  Sunmoon has himself called out people for getting around the curse filter. While I don't find profanity particularly offensive in my house, I know that other people expect different behavior in their own houses and I respect that. <br />
<br />
This is such a house.<br />
<br />
Also in this house, debating is great. Many of us, including myself, love debate. Where the line is drawn is civility. When the topic at hand is no longer being debated in favor of debating peoples personality flaws, those posts are locked. I know many other forums simply move those posts to rants and let people scream their hearts out at each other, but that is generaly not the case here. <br />
<br />

<br />
Thank you. I do try very hard to make everything that I say not come off like I am some illiterate fool. I just know that I was very tired when I wrote my last post and really might have screwed up something that I was trying to convey. (And, in passing, I would like to also say that I found your posts on Alla's to be most informative.)<br />
<br />
On information exchange: flames provide information. They honestly do. Well, most do. If I'm going to flame someone, I'm going to tell them exactly why I did it and give examples of why they were wrong. This is the reason I read most flames.

Generally, when a flame happens on the Glade, it's an informative flame, if you dig. <br />
<br />
I agree completely with you. The problem is that it is never that way, on this board or many others. The flames and rants are always reduced down to one liiners or paragraphs that have absolutely being in the thread.<br />
<br />
As to random clicking and reading, I do. I read everything, weather it's got to do with me or not. Granted, I only read a coupla forums here on the glade, but generally I read them completely and thoroughly. &lt;B&gt;As far as sever stress, that's a pretty weak argument. You're asking the populace to let obvious stupidity fly because you're on dial up? Am I reading this right?&lt;/B&gt; <br />
<br />
Weak argument indeed? I happen to work for a company that keeps &lt;I&gt;everyones&lt;/I&gt; internet running and online, so I would have to say that I am in the top ten percent of individuals in this country that know how bad a problem server stress is. And this community has grown quite a bit in such a short time recently.<br />
<br />
I posted here because this is a rant. This didn't belong on the general board. Any thread in the general board that turns into a rant or flame session, in my opinion, should be moved here rather than locked. <br />
<br />
If every single post that had a rant in it were moved this this forum instead of locked, how would anyone ever know how to find anything. Starting a new thread is just the better way to go. The thread was never &lt;I&gt;intended&lt;/I&gt; to be a rant or a flame, it just, by lack of respect mostly, and should not be treated as such.<br />
<br />
I also have to say that it was very appropriate of you to post the follow up here in this forum.<br />
<br />
You and I have very different ideas of what a home is. Home, to me, is not just a place where I sit my ass down and watch ice hockey with my girlfriend. Home's a place where I can relax, be myself, and, above all, feel comfortable, and I like my visitors to be the same way. I'm not saying that another person's home is to be used as my own private pig pen when I'm visiting, but you know what? Carpet is meant to be walked on, and if you want to put your feet up in my house, go right the hell ahead. <br />
<br />
I never said that &lt;I&gt;I&lt;/I&gt; could not put my feet up inside my own house, just that guests are expected not too. Indeed, I would feel welcome in your home, in a football/hockey-buddy kind of way. And you obviously haven't walked around bare-footed on an elegant piece of thick Saxony carpet. It truly is a delight to be held...<br />
<br />
This isn't the case in your home, and I'd be willing to bet that your visitors leave feeling like they were in more of an occupational environment rather than a home. Oppressed is too strong a word. Maybe oppressed-light. <br />
<br />
Oddly enough, I entertain many many people throughout the course of the week. Everyone always returns and not only that, but they always express their appreciation from giving them an escape from the duldrums of work. I may be eccentric, but that just makes things interesting... I reserve sundays for my &quot;football-buddy&quot; friends to come over and I have footstools for that purpose.<br />
<br />
Was Elwin elected? Damn, I missed that. I thought Sunmoon picked him out. And he did, after all, unlock the thread, do don't clap too hard. The prisoners are running free, they're just doing it a bit cleaner this time. <br />
<br />
To elect means to choose, either by one or by many people. (As a matter of fact, most things that the populace &lt;I&gt;believe&lt;/I&gt; that they are electing was, in fact, propagated by only one (or a few) person(s)).<br />
<br />
As far as the prisoners running free... It's all good, my friend, just so long as it stay kept a little bit cleaner...<br />
<br />
Farewell...<br />

My third post is a direct flame. I was pissed, and I don't agree with your reasoning behind Amdee's post. I'll leave that here, that we disagree, but if you'd like me to pick apart the tone, verbiage, and implications of what s/he said, I'd be happy too.<br />
<br />
As far as directing my original post back at myself, I don't think I would have been upset at all. This probably stems from the fact that I agree with myself, but trying to look at it objectively, I'm not offended by it either. The last line is the most hurtful, pointed directly at Elwin, and it's not true anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, put Amdee's reply to the side.  I don't think the tone warranted your reply as if anything her's (in my eye's) was kidding around while yours was belittling and confrontational.  I can dissect it to and put spin on it just as well as you.  However you disagree and I can accept that.  However to know exactly how she meant it she'll have to post herself, until then I can be content with us having separate opinions.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise, your reply’s to other's comments were very inflammatory whereas the responses you were replying to with said flame were dubious in malicious intent at best-- you could choose to interpret them if you wished to where as yours there was no mistake at what you were trying to say.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for your first post, are you SURE you wouldn't be offended if I told you (ignore the fact that it's hypocritical for the sake of argument =P) <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, expletives are an invalid, lowbrow form of expressing a point. If you want that unmoderated, then **** you...  ...Why do you post the way you do? Is there a guide that you can hand to us so we can interpret what you are trying to say? Or are they making this **** up as you go?&quot;<br />
<br />
And finally, for your two points.  You don't like the closing of threads.  Understood.  However, you are not a mod, you don't get the power to say if things should be locked or not.  Reading Sean's thread I can see why it was locked after it got out of hand.  The useful info is still accessible even though it was locked, you just have to search for it.  However, the locking and removing of a thread (as I spoke up against in another thread) is another matter entirely.  In that case I would have to agree with you.  As this is primarily an information site, threads should never be removed from viewability.<br />
<br />
Point 2:  posters being hypocritical about personal attacks.  Fair enough.  However, most personal attacks here are indirect.  I think you have rubbed us the wrong way in your very direct forms of attack and that is what is causing the issue.  And purposefully misinterpreting other's posts to give yourself cause to launch such attacks to make a point is bad form, IMHO.</div></div><hr />

It would be hypocritical of me to say that I liked the call your moderators made, hand picked or not. I didn't like that the thread got locked.<br />
<br />
Would you rather me express my opinion, or keep it to myself?<br />
<br />
I also wouldn't call my defending that opinion a &quot;tirade&quot; or a &quot;crusade,&quot; but that's just semantics.<br />
<br />
This is your board. I think your mods have a lot of integrity. Ask Elwin, I think I've made my feelings on that pretty clear, unless he doesn't check his private messages. Those two things being said, I will no longer express any opinion on the way this board is run, and I will not use any language that you can't say on network television. My opinions aren't read, heeded, or appreciated, and my language is too harsh for some of the posters here.<br />
<br />
If my opinions paint me in a bad light, so be it. I can't change my opinions, but I'm sure not ashamed of them. I will express them more passively in the future. I feel like I owe you at the very least that for the forums. <br />
<br />
On that note: how do you feel about Rounlin's suggestion that I insert some unnamed thing into one of two intimate bodily orifices and &quot;rotate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fraen<br />
I don't know much about server stress. I'm in school at this very moment (library, as a matter of fact) doing the beginnings of a network admin degree. It would seem, just out of sheer statistics and ratio, that if you took all the flames off the Glade, the difference it'd make would be minor, if not totally indistinguishable. Ranting just isn't done that often in this setting.<br />
<br />
As to knowing how to find everything, I think that'd fall together. My server's messageboard and the boards I've moderated for my first college stint did just that, and we never had a problem. Posters just knew that if a thread got too rowdy, it got moved. It's always worked in the past. <br />
<br />
Believe it or not, I hate ice hockey... I tossed that out for effect. If you like to run your home like a museum, that's fine, and I'm sure it's comfortable for you. I wouldn't feel comfortable there, though. I prefer an atmosphere that's a bit more relaxed in etiquette, to a point. Now, you better damn well use the coasters, but you see what I mean. =)<br />
<br />
Elections, by their very nature, are democratic. Election by representative democracy is also, in a slightly lesser degree, democratic. Sunmoon &quot;hand-picked&quot; his moderators, from what I've seen. That's appointment, and has nothing to do with election. When did you vote? I didn't.<br />
<br />
(Note: there's nothing wrong with that, and I think Sunmoon made a damn fine choice.)<br />
<br />
Dedolito:<br />
To be honest, I'd like to think that I wouldn't be offended. Profanity is a regular part of my life as a gay female, a student, a professional musician, and an Everquest player. I can see your point, though. It was not meant to sting the way I wrote it: it was meant to point out that sometimes profanity can be used to express a valid point, and I apologize if it came off any other way.<br />
<br />
I was more exasperated than anything else. Also, I didn't try and get around the filter. I let it do its job, thinking that would be enough.<br />

I was a singer in a band, once upon a time. I played lots of shows around the East Coast. Well, the one singular time I got kicked off the stage for my language was at a Baptist institution in South Georgia. The show was a part of a frat party or something, and the band was set up in front of a huge swimming pool. I knew that the audience was a bit sensitive, but I didn't think I'd be asked to leave if I said, &quot;Oops! That guy just urinated in the pool!&quot; <br />
<br />
That's right, some college-aged kids couldn't handle the word &quot;urinated.&quot; <br />
<br />
Same situation to a degree: I didn't think the Glade was that sensitive. Obviously it is.<br />
<br />
Rounlin:<br />
I'm glad you publicly asked for some help understanding things that are above you. If you ask nicely, I'm sure someone will teach you the fundamentals of grammar, syntax, and composition, as well as the art of insulting someone. <br />

Gonna form a roving band of homicidal flamers to come down and flame me over a post that Sunmoon himself, owner of this board, asked me to behave in? Gonna report me to Sunmoon again? What exactly would you do?<br />
<br />
Basically, you can ask for me to be banned. I invite you too. If I can be banned for what I’ve said, I’d be willing to bet that you can for making some kind of pitiful threat.<br />
<br />
Cut me some slack. You're not the Mafia, you're a ranger with bad punctuation and grammar, just like me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Malevant Faeshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Actually Merri, my comment on post mechanics was more in reference to whatever inspired you to post this thread.  For me to post something with that much vulgarity and vitriole in it, you would have to have stuck my cat in a blender while giving me a root canal with no topical.  I am sort of boggled that anything that has really ever been posted on this board could get you that fired up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Merrikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Malevant, you play on Emarr, right?

Actually, if I were a troll, I'd probably post something like, &quot;Sit on it and spin, your rascally rangers! You're just druids in disguise!&quot; or maybe side-mouth threaten another poster. If I wanted responce like this, I'd post something topical on rangers, not on the merits of profanity, the mechanics of moderaration, or the fine points of personal attacks.<br />
<br />
But, since you've had your say, I'll read it. You know what part I like the best? This part:<br />
<br />
Thats [sic] it for me.<br />
<br />
Your post is bottom level, and is always at the base of a losing argument. Try not to trip on it on the way out.<br />
<br />
Or maybe, this was what you wanted. A responce from me. That'd make you .... nevermind.</div></div><hr />

“When you read a Neil Gaimen book, it's painfully obvious (and I do mean painfully) that he's an amazing writer with the talent to write things that are so profane they almost leak into erotic or even pornographic fiction. On the other hand, he can write a fairy tale with suitable language for children, but have it plot-lined for adults. On the other hand, he can legitimately write a damn fine book made especially for children. His scope is broad enough to do that, and I certainly don't look down on some of his more profane work. In fact, I generally enjoy it just as much or more than any of his other work.”<br />
<br />
I will have to read some of his work, but his fiction is not really germane to the topic at hand. I do not doubt that skillful writers can and do write well with and without profanity. More to the point, though, is the fact that the Glade community (a private club if you will) would prefer to do without profanity. I derive no extra information from a post that is profane, besides perhaps the author’s state of mind (which in all the forums except this one is really beside the point). <br />

Pardon my ignorance on this one, but how does locking the thread deprive you of its salient content? It is my understanding that the thread can still be read, merely not added to. Further, were one to have an insightful reply to said thread, one could start a new thread where, hopefully, more ideas could be exchanged before the flamers sidetracked it.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for flames, are not flames by definition tirades attacking the poster rather than intelligent replies pointing out perceived flaws? To disagree with someone’s post is not a flame, unless one were to call him an idiot for having posted and wasted everyone’s time.</div></div><hr />

On that note: how do you feel about Rounlin's suggestion that I insert some unnamed thing into one of two intimate bodily orifices and &quot;rotate?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Rounlin:<br />
I'm glad you publicly asked for some help understanding things that are above you. If you ask nicely, I'm sure someone will teach you the fundamentals of grammar, syntax, and composition, as well as the art of insulting someone. <br />
<br />
You're bad at this tiger, go back to thinking you're better than me because I use four-letter words more often. If you have any doubt that you're basically illiterate, reread this:<br />
<br />
<br />
We have two intimate orifices that something can be inserted up into?  damn...<br />
<br />
And yeah ya know what, mister I speak in big complete words and sentances.  I dont post like that to make myself look cool in front of people.  I post how I feel at whatever particular moment in time.  Do I care that I dont use the correct fundamentals of grammer, syntax, and composition?  No...  Does anyone else Mr. English Teacher?  No...  And If I dont know the art of insulting someone then maybe you should re-read my insult to you:D</div></div><hr />

Just because this is in rants, don't get the idea that you can say and do as you please, Merrikat. I hope I didn't give you that impression.<br />
<br />
This also goes for other people posting here, but they seem to be keeping themselves behaved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I've already commented on the thread and from the looks of it, Merr has decided to tone it down a bit, which is all I needed.<br />
<br />
That said, yes, this is the Rants and Raving section, but there are STILL limits to what can be said. I have said before, there will still be no racism or personal attacks allowed here.<br />
<br />
Rounlin, you are just as much to blame here... all of you knock it off please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In any event, I am outta here too, methinks.  Seeing vulgarity etc doesn't personally tick me off at all, nor does seeing posts that are somewhat inflammatory (intentional or not), but I do sometimes boggle at what motivates folks to feel the urge to post that way.</div></div><hr />

Merrikat is MS. English Teacher, and when did we start vilifying the proper use of the English language? Sure makes all those ****s and ****s a lot easier to read!</div></div><hr />
