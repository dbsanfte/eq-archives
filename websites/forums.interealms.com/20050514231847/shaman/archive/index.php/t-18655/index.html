<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Who is playing this game?  I just got it and its pretty nice, but im having troulbe locating rescources for jobs and such. Got links?  Plus any tips while your at it would be greatfuly appreciated. Right now im playing a elvel 7 monk and he is pretty fun, but im wondering if i should have played a red mage or somethign else cause it seems like i cant find a group.<br />
<br />
Well i did find 2 groups, but i think they were people as lost as i was cause they didnt talk and afte ra while disbanded lol.<br />
<br />
Anyway, anything you can share would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i play on the sylph server, am currently a 27 rdm/12whm rdm's are very shamanistic.  as far as heals/debuffs/enhancing magics,  we dont' really get anything unique to our class till 15ish, when we start getting weapon enchanting spells, at lv 21 we get the unique spell gravity which equates into snare.  at lv 34 we get a spell called phallanx which is a huge self only def boost,  at 40/1 we get convert which lets us switch hps and mps, but 10 min reuse still good, also at lv 41 we get refresh which is the only from of cast clarity except for bard songs. (other forms of clarity are juices which are tradeskilled /bough)  as for other random information try <br />
<br />
http://www.ffxionline.com/<br />
<br />
alla's has some information but i belive its base of ppl who use it for info are mainly na (north american) players which are alot newer to the game than those who imported it<br />
<br />
edit:you won't really need to grp as anyclass until lv 11-13ish, also the strat guide has alot of usefull information so far as charts/numbers etc, some of the players tips are a little.....offbase we'll say but still alot of good information</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yea, im wondering if a monk is the right role for me. I love my shaman dearly so having somethign close to him mgiht be the way for me.<br />
<br />
Can you solo well with your combo ? You get groups petty easy?  As i sit iw as thinking MNK/RDM but im starting to doubt that combo as i read more and more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well soloing become inefficent due to the amount of downtime that goes with being a mage.  so far yeah easy getting groups, finding good groups is not so easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Finaly got some groups, yay, thought i was grouping wrong or something cause people wouldnt talk and would DB.Is there a  /who all command ?<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW thnx for replies, that site is much better then allahk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One of the big flaws in FFXI that I've seen is that most of the melee characters are just variants of one another. The exceptions are Pal/Wars and Thief/Whatevers. Pal/War are by *far* the best tanks, so they are always prefered, Thief/Whatever (Usually warrior, but often ninja) are great for renkei chains and for controlling aggro. All the other melee classes in all their combinations just exist to do damage to stuff. Since there are so many of those, and since any of them can fit into the slot pretty much, the individual demand for those classes is extremely small.<br />
<br />
If you want group desirability, go red/white/blackmage, or bard. Chronic shortages, and little to no overlap in function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've got a WHM/subBLM on Midgardsormr, its a nice change of pace from EQ (EQ is still better imho however).  Its good cause its different, renki is interesting, casting has its ups and downs, ect.  But, for the love of god that UI sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm a Whm/Bard, also on Midgardsormr.  A nice site for spell/skill listings and the like is http://ffo.warcry.com.  Also check the FFxi PS2 magic FAQ on http://www.gamefaqs.com.<br />
<br />
Actually the melees tend to be a lot more diverse as you level up, and yeah, Pal/Wars tend to have the best taunt and tanking ability, as long as you don't mind the fact they pretty much do 0 dps doing so =)<br />
<br />
Redmages are a little underated and hence seem to suffer at getting groups around at the 30s/40s, but whm and blm are always in demand, and leveling up my bard sub never gives me trouble with finding a group either aye.<br />
<br />
Monk is a nice beginner class and you'll have no problems soloing up to the grouping levels for valk (The first real grouping hotspot, start grouping here about 11/12ish), but monks are not hugely popular, lacking in dps compared to some of the advanced damage dealers like Dark Knights and Rangers.  If you want your shamanesque spellbook, I'd say go for Whm with blm sub, or just red mage then sub whatever takes your fancy.<br />
<br />
Just remember that grouping is generally bad until 10ish, duoing doesnt hurt, but anything more before double figures and your just wasting time =/<br />
<br />
As for /who, /sea is FF's equivilent and its pretty powerful once you learn how to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ugh sebazy, now you got me wondering if i got the right class again lol.<br />
<br />
I was in a group last night with me ( level 8 monk ) a warrior that was a 9 and another 9 monk. Was a blast, we went north through a mountain pass beyond the outpost area of San Oreos ( cant remember ). It was the first time i decided i can like this game. The UI and control of everything is so asinine compared to EQ though, its my one gripe. Trying to move around to target something with people in the way can take as long as it takes to kill the beast. Very annoying.  <br />
<br />
As far as classes though, even though im a monk right now i can sub as many classes as i want right ?  So even though im a monk now, i can say become a redmage later and make that my main with monk sub right ? Or even Be a Ranger main with Red MAge sub and monk sub ?  Im still a lil confused about that bit. I dont wanna be stuck in something then realize at 30 no one wants me and start from scratch.<br />
<br />
Thnx for the links sebazy, that atlas is a big help on warcry. BTW when you say valk you mean valkurm ? I plan on hitting 10 tonite so i wanna be ready to run to the good grouping area =)<br />
<br />
BTW, what servers you all on ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Use Tab to target stuff Litgruv. It's the only way that's even halfway reasonable.  Sure you may have to flip thru all your group members before you get the mob on target, but it's usually quicker just the same. <br />
<br />
I've got a 15 WHM on Titan, rather shamanistic/cleric spellbook so far.  I guess that class gets port and rez as well as slow, paralyze, the best heals, and &quot;smite&quot; forms of nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">it sounded like you were having some issues moving around, you can use first person and the keypad to get you very eq style movment, it made the game so much more enjoyable to me.  the subjob quests are out of selbinia or mahura(sp)  i personally recommend doing it out of selbinia as its alot easier imo.    two of my favorite things i like is the part list button who is basically /who party, being able to cast any spell by typing /ma Spell, altho the case sensitive portion of that feature really irritates me. <br />
<br />
however ff11 needs more chatfilters, they need a way to just straight out ignore everything that isn't party based, when another group moves in next to you it gets quite spam tastic. its really annoying to change targets as well i still enjoy it when i'm not saddled with a craptacular group which unfortunally i'm stuck with because i don't have the airship pass. so i can't get to the expansion areas. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, if theres one thing EQ still does unrivaled to this day, its the UI, FF's is massively limited in comparrision, the filters are fairly ok once you've fiddled with them a fair bit, I've managed to get it to successfully filter out pretty much any spam thats outside of my group now.<br />
<br />
My biggest gripe is the inability to change the color of certain text, especially debuffs fading and renkei chain effects.<br />
<br />
Oh and yeah Litgruv, short of dieing loads, you'll never loose any job advancement you make, so you could quite happily switch to redmage right now, level that to 18 and do the subjob quest and use the monk as that.  <br />
<br />
Once you hit 30 and start unlocking advanced jobs you'll find it useful to level up a few of them for utility purposes (Thief for treasure hunting, Ranger for named hunting or farming specific items and components for example).  The flexibility of the job system really is amazing if you think beyond what the masses like to scream on the forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">so basicly , no matter what class your doing, have a whithe mage as a sub job is probably pretty good idea right?<br />
<br />
I mean if i understand this right, when i level my monk to say 18, then switch to a theif, ill have some monk abilities right ? Like hundred fist and Boost in my ability window when im fighting. So if i have a white mage level to some extent i can have the DPS of a monk and the sub of a theif while having the healing of a white mage ( of lower level ofcourse ).  If i understand right, then its pretty intresting. On one hand it kinda blurs the class lines, but on the other hand it makes you so flexible that the only way you cant be happy with your toon is if you screwed it up in which case you can fix it by swtiching jobs.<br />
<br />
Is kinda intresting approach. Too bad you guys arent on Odin, id dig playing with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not quite, 2 limitations.<br />
<br />
You can only combine the abilities of 2 classes.<br />
<br />
And your sub job is temporarily lowered to half the level of your main job.<br />
<br />
For example.<br />
<br />
You level a warrior to 20, do the subjob unlocking quest then decide to try playing a thief.<br />
<br />
So you effectively restart as a level 1 thf, but this time you'll also have the abilities of a lvl1 warrior as well as bonus stats and hps to boo.<br />
<br />
Now as you level, the cap on your subjobbed warrior will raise too, forexample when you hit 10 as the thf, your subjob cap will be 5, so you'll provoke.  When you hit 30, your subjob cap will be 15 and you'll get Berzerk.  For the main part the only limitation is that you won't be able to use your subjobs 2 hour special.<br />
<br />
Its also worth remembering that your subjob effectively gives you roughly half of what a character of that levels hp/mana is as a bonus on top.  So for example if you go warrior, then sub white mage, unless your a taru you'll find your mana pool is utterly tiny.<br />
<br />
So its generally wise to pick a subclass that compliments your main well.<br />
<br />
And I wouldn't say it blurs the class lines at all really.  Subjob abilities are capped enough to simply not make that viable.  I'll certainly never replace a main bard or turn one down even though its my subjob.  However it does add a nice bit of flexibility to your class and allow for you tweak a job down the route you'd prefer.<br />
<br />
Just take what the forum trolls are ranting about with a pinch of salt.  So far the only class that really does seem pointless as a sub with no redeeming features = Dragoon, simply because the Wyvern is summoned via a 2hour ability.</div></div><hr />
