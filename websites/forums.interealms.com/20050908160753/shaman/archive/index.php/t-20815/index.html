<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Evicar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,  I just dinged level 60.  All those new spells are too expensive =p  and I needed a good solo place to get some money to get my new spells.  Only 60 spells I have are focus of spirit and khuras focusing.  Thank you for your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try nurga if all ya want is cash, at least until you can afford torpor. After ya get torpor theres a few excellent guides here about droga and acrylia caverns. Also still some decent drops from howling stones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have a mule or open character slot (to make a mule) use it in the bazaar. Drop everything there you don't want that someone else might and spend a couple hours a day in trader mode.<br />
<br />
Watch the bazaar for spells and prices. There is great fluctuation. A guild shaman used this advice and picked up both Q and Malos for a total of 20k. It took him a couple of weeks watching the bazaar when he could while he spent his playing time collecting cash and sellable drops to build up his bank. His goal was to get 40K to buy just Q as that is what he saw it generally selling for.<br />
<br />
Take your time, work your levels and keep your eyes open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frostheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey Evicar! At least I'm assuming this is the Evicar from A-Ro. If you ever catch me and Maggi on and we aren't raiding, send a tell. We could go hit Inner Acrylia or Droga maybe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At 60 without full spellbook you might find Droga kinda hard to solo. You could try Veksar, although you will need to take plenty of IVU potions with you. Veksar is ok exp, and there are loads of 1 - 6k value drops that are easy to solo...well, easy from 61 onwards when you get your level 61 pet they become v easy.</div></div><hr />
