<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The DVD edition of the UK magazine has got three video clips of EQ2 that I've not seen anywhere else.<br />
<br />
The first one is a general trailer. The second is a clip of battle scenes, and the third one is a clip of the talking NPCs.<br />
<br />
The more of EQ2 that I see the more I think that I will give it a try. The graphics look very good and more like the original theme of EQ than the alien-esq thing we have now with EQ in SoL/GoD/OoW.<br />
<br />
The battle scenes look pretty good with the blade trails giving a real impression of speed when a sword or a staff is used. But It seem weird that you hack at a person for 5 mins and there's not a scratch on him and then he drops dead. =/<br />
<br />
The amour looks very nice there appear to be more joints now so that pieces move independently. It's hard to explain, but I saw an NPC laugh and it looks like his shoulders and chest have joints/muscles to give the impression that the amour is external to the body and not part of it.<br />
<br />
The other things that stood out were the shadows and the long grass. the grass looks more realistic than the similar stuff you see in places like hollow shademoor.<br />
<br />
I've not had chance to read the article yet but I'll add another post if there is anything worth noting in it.</div></div><hr />

go on join up!   <br />
<br />
for me tho, i find soe so called rpg probucts to be far to stupid and lacking in real roleplay content.....il quote veeshan peek for an example.<br />
<br />
its so dull.  thers a few nice quests, but no added content to kunark storyline.......it stinks!  Is the highest lvl zone in kunark and has virtually no lore atached to it.  it looks nice, esp good for kunark erea graphics. but its so one dimensional in content. There should be some depth of personality to the dragons; they are after all some of the oldest most elite beings on norrath.<br />
<br />
blody awful.....the monkeys were on top that day at soe headquarters.<br />
<br />
/grumble<br />
<br />
i wont waste  money on eq2.  4 years of mindless hack and slash in eq is enough for me.......ok possibly they have developed the questing thing in oow into eq2.  That could create more depth, but can they develop decent plots is a bigger question.<br />
<br />
any programmers wannahelp me make a online world based on glorantha??  send me a PM  )</div></div><hr />

Lol Eq2 is more like the original EQ than the bollocks they are dishing up now. With the moon gone, and no mention of all the alien mobs, it's back to good old fashioned Dragons and what not.<br />
<br />
SOE did a good job with the story line of Everquest right upto Luclin, then it went off the rails. So I hope they will do the same with EQ 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My understanding is that EQ2 will continue SoE's preference for raiders over all other playing styles.  If thats the case its a game for the minority - any information on that?</div></div><hr />

From  Gemdiver's review (http://eq2.graffe.com/library.php?id=36)<br />
<br />
Soloing - The EQ II dev team wants to make sure that solo'ing is a viable way to progress your character. One of the main problems for casual players in Everquest Live was lack of solo'able content that someone with only an hour or two could sit down and use and still feel as if their character was progressing. At the same time those who group will find themselves able to take on the harder encounters which are likely to reward them with higher experience and better loot.<br />
<br />
It doesn't exactly say what it will be but it does say that they want to address the issue. Reading that though it does indeed suggest that grouping is the prefered method of getting uber equipment.<br />
<br />
I personally want more quests like the coldain shawl. They are good and you get rewards along the way, Whist being open to everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maximum raid size in EQ2 is 24 players.<br />
<br />
EQ2 will be *far* more friendly to the single group, small group, small guild type players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I imagine that having instances from the get go will give them more control over how many people are present at an encounter. Which should curb the tendancy to make raid targets that require bigger and bigger numbers of players to kill. Imagine Ldon and instances had come out before Pop. Chances are that guild and raid dynamics would would be quite different today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IT's not only the raids that they have instanced, but the more populated zones.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when you zone you are given the option of going to &quot;the zone&quot; or &quot;the zone 2&quot;<br />
<br />
Also the training zone, has a lot of instances. When you log in you get sent to an instance of Ilse of refuge with a number at the end to determine which instance it is.<br />
<br />
This is a really good idea as the newbie zone doesn't get overrun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Leez-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">really love the idea of having instanced raids like this. It will allow any guild or group of friends to raid on their own terms. My current guild's raid times have grown earlier and earlier, due to more and more members, pushing out the non EST'ers and folks with families and stuff. The large guilds can go run a couple raids simultaneously and the smaller ones can do theirs, absolutely outstanding on SOE's part.<br />
<br />
On more of a technical side..the graphics in EQ2 are very intense, folks who think that they are going to play, seriously need to look at having a decent PC. I have a 1.8gh P4, fx5700ultra(overclocked), 512m rdram with a dsl connection and its pretty choppy in alot of places, especially the cities, and you will spend a fair bit of time there, in lower lvls anyway.<br />
<br />
Really looking forward to eq2 going live, beta is a blast.</div></div><hr />
