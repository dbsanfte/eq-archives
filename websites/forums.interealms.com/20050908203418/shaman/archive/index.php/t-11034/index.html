<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know of any good, old-school, MUDs? Preferably free, but I'd settle for a pay one. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dragonrealms (www.play.net i think) and Gemstone 3 were great.  I played G3 for about a year and DR for about 3 years before EQ finally took over.  You have to pay to play but the first month is free, so you can try it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I played BatMud for a long time before Everquest came out.<br />
Very detailed, hack'n slash style, big player base. And it's free.<br />
<br />
Check out www.bat.org</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://www.mudconnector.com/<br />

Whatever you do, do NOT play on Medievia. It's main Implementor is a self-admitted code thief who has made tens of thousands of dollars (RL) off the code base he stole, without living up to the very meager requirements for free use of the code (These requirements basically being putting the 5 names of the original development team in the login screen, and not charging for the game...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Setanos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Back in the day, I played on a smallish mud named End of the Line (EotL).  Was a lot of fun, though a bit harsh.  Cant say what its like now, been a few years since I visited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">www.avalon-rpg.com<br />
<br />
By far the best one I ever played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Zmud is what i always used<br />

<br />
Vincent's Hollow - http://www.vhdev.com/<br />
pretty cool back in the day - wizzed and created an area there<br />
<br />
Overdrive - telnet://overdrive.concentric.net:5195/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh, zmud is a telnet client with a mud list :)<br />
<br />
Burning Lands: Amtmud is one I used to play on a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Another one you should try is Bad Trip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">NuclearWar &gt; All :P<br />
I still idle there nowadays as Ebo in a gang called Undergrounders.. Was even a friend from there who made me start playing eq..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Agree that BatMud probably is the best there is out there. Very well balanced and they do take good care of it. <br />
<br />
Else... ZombieMUD (http://zombiemud.org/) is first game ever to get my attention over a longer time... like 3 years or something. Much better game than the website implies ;) It came from BatMud but is more hack'n'slash oriented. Also free.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the question. Was long time now since I thought about MUDs - made me smile :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ANyone know any good PK(pvp) MUDs?  Always been into PK muds more than anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nebmai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Carrion Fields is one of the best PK/RP muds out there.  RP is mandatory, but the IMMS are very involved, and the PKing has a lot of depth.<br />
<br />
http://arkham.carrionfields.com/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I too played Dragon Realms for a couple years there.  Tog Barbarian is the way to go.  Very cool game.  Supple leathers, ivory hilted claymores.  Quality, played that till the sun came up quite often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">if you are into muds that are very in depth, and you won't level like a madman, and actually takes some work, check out www.retromud.org. there are sickly amounts of races and skills and everything is very well developed. its generally a friendly place and player killing is tightly controlled, but i played there since 1995 up until a few months ago. There are quests, a ton of areas (that are actually more than copies of the same room over and over again!). I'd look over the website and give it a try. i'd only suggest not being an alchemist unless they ahve finally put some broken skills back online, its still a fun guild though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Retromud and Genesis (the original LP mud) are both fantastic muds. Geeked out on them before I got hooked by EQ.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, Retromud had INSANE ammounts of content and character customization. The player base is a ton of fun as well.<br />
<br />
Genesis has alot of character customization and content, but is a roleplaying server. Some of the roleplaying is pretty damn good. I had a lot of fun there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I played DragonRealms for awhile and really enjoyed it. Gor'Tog Barbarian is definitely the coolest. :)<br />
<br />
-Tok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zaknaxle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I will second Genesis. I was playing the game from -94 to -00, took a good 220 days of my life. I had a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Anyone remember Ivory Tower?  I used to love that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was (and still am) a big fan of MUME<br />
<br />
http://mume.pvv.org/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Genocide?<br />
<br />
Premise:  Take a regular MUD.  Every half hour to an hour have everyone start over in a big room.  Each player votes what type of war to run - 4 team, 2 team, all against all, etc.  Teams are then selected.  Once the game starts, everyone has nothing and races around the areas gathering equipment.  Upon entering a room with NPC or mobs - the npc or mob explodes leaving behind its equipment for the player to pick up.  After a certain amount of time, the war starts and the last one standing is the winner.  Upon death a player becomes a ghost and can observe the battle or hang out in the waiting room.<br />
<br />
I can see the refuse of EQ becoming something like this as a possible alternative once enough people leave.  The major expense of server cost and client base is taken care of, so all that would be needed is to bolt on the war structure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I played a few muds, BlueMage and HexOnyx originally but i finally settled at StrangeMUD, strangemud.net &lt;port&gt; 9332.<br />
it's a bit quirky, some great offbeat zones and the few people left are definitely friendly.  It's free, too.  Main problem is since the hot **** MMORPG's came out, Strange's player base has taken a hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ebain_Luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I used to play Nirvana, vincents hollow, and dragonheart <br />
not sure what they are like now though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I played Dragonrealms for about 3 years before EQ. Text-based, but definitely ten times better for roleplay environment. Which characters did you guys play, Jinheim, John, and Toktuk? We probably bumped into each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Cerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I used to play Terris for 6 years...I frikkin loved that MUD. It was free, but now it's 15 bucks a month.  Can find it here...<br />
<br />
www.legendsofterris.com<br />
<br />
I also played Dark Mist... I only got to level 13ish, but I thought it was okay.<br />
<br />
www.darkmists.net or org<br />
<br />
I highly recommend Terris if you have the money to spend... they have GMs events almost weekly, and there's a never ending story... plus, it's 90% roleplaying.. so... if you don't like roleplaying, don't play it =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Lithas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">arctic.mud<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shakurae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Where'd you get that info on Medievia? I played that Mud for 2 years before EQ came out. I thought it was the best MUD around.<br />
www.medievia.com<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Medievia *was* a great mud.  Particularly back before med3 (and 100% god damn sure before 4).<br />
<br />
I'm sure some people loved 4 but I hated it, had come back to play for a bit after leaving in the middle of 2 and I hated 4 as soon as I saw it.  A large portion of the game involved wandering around 'trading' or some ****.  It was a pain in the ass to get to the main zones, and all I wanted to do was kill some dumbass in NPK (nuetral player kill, death =no loss if there arent any bugs) or CPK (chaotic, death = loss of experience and items).<br />
<br />
I so wanted everquest to have zones like this (best gear/exp zones are PK) but the system simply doesnt allow it, with the wildly different PK power of classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kharzhoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If anyone ever played the Island of kesmai on compuserve, back in the 80's, they are rebuilding it right now. If ya care about it - PM me and I will send you the links (its still in beta)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I absolutely loved Medievia too. In the begining.... <br />
<br />
My husband played it for 8 years and I was at about 5 or 6 when I finally stopped. Now it has come down to 'he said' 'she said' crap and getting people frozen and denying rooms because you used the word &quot;feel&quot; in a description! Ugh, getting me frustrated just thinking about it again :p<br />
<br />
The whole thing that Luclin's is saying is about Krause not admiting he followed Diku coding. He refuses to this day any similarity between his code and diku. That's about the time Med started become work. Zones renamed? Mobs renamed? All to CYA. <br />
<br />
But in the begining I sure loved Med!! Btw, my husband was Core and I am (was?) Icnan!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I loved me some Sojourn....Brad McQuaid and (as far as I know) the rest of the original EQ design team used to play there.  (Dunno whether yall will think this is good or bad, but at any rate I find it interesting - there's quite a bit of Sojourn in EQ).<br />
<br />
It has been around for ages and ages, sometimes known as Torilmud and sometimes as Sojourn.    They are very strict on rules there.  It is 100% Forgotten Realms based also.<br />
