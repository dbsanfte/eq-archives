<br />
So i was on my necro Alt today in QH (human necro of bertox /flex)<br />
and at the zone-in to black burrow there is a female barb shammy standing there.<br />
<br />
I hailed her but no response she was afk without a tag.<br />
I said &quot;you should not be afk here ppl train stuff that may be kos to you&quot;<br />
/hug<br />
<br />
and zoned into bb<br />
<br />
<br />
Minutes later I got a tell from her. She was a roleplayer. Now I don't have the slightest clue of what she said cause after a few tells all i could understand was the &quot;sir&quot; word that was in it. No clue wether she was thankign me for the hug or the heads up or mad cause of the hug. <br />
 Gah. My reply was &quot;try playign on firiona vie&quot;<br />
<br />
To that even more odd text appeared in chat. She wasn't drunk in game either.<br />
<br />
<br />
U guys ever meet ppl liek this? Or soem that try to do troll/ogre speech but suck so badly takes like a minute to deschipher a sentence.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now i know there are some good roleplayers out there. This thread just adresses the other ones :)<br />

If you have a problem with it, just don't speak or interact with them.  Myself, I rather enjoy it when I bump into someone still bravely roleplaying.  I don't roleplay really, but I do adopt sort of a different character when I am playing my shaman.  I'm not my normal self that I am in RL, that is for sure.</div></div><hr />

That RPG stuff is kinda fun in online games for a while, but it can get old fast, like anything else.  <br />
<br />
Usually, it involves using long drawn out colorful language, sometimes archaic and convoluted, to say the simplest things.  Get to the point, dammit!<br />
<br />
I especially hate it when people fill their raid hotkeys with 40 pounds of crap per keypress.  If something is tashed or slowed or about to be healed, I need to know NOW! just by a quick skim through all the battle spam -- it's no time for poetry, and you can cram your harks and betides and forsooths up alongside where your head got stuck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Guys i am not against roleplaying.<br />
I don't mind ppl roleplaying as long as i can UNDERSTAND what they are trying to say.<br />
If i can then i don't care if they call ppl squire lord m'lady etc.<br />

And yes it was kinda funny how i had a line full of typos. My typing skills may suck and it might have been funny considerign what i was complaining about but at least i got my idea across.<br />

Cant handle roleplaying, go play another game. Cant stand large text messages, go play an ego shooter!<br />

We should have kicked out you powergaming lootwhores the first instant you reared your ugly heads a few years ago, I fear now its too late. Which doesnt mean it isnt a roleplaying game! So we accept you not roleplaying, that doesnt mean you have any say in our game! Cant handle roleplaying? Go to your mom and cry about it! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Nothing wrong with roleplaying, but EQ isnt exactly the right environment for it.  Before I played EQ, I played numerous MUDs where roleplaying was the norm  When I first got started in EQ, my roleplaying habits came with me, but quickly died out due to the anti-roleplay atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Today, I do not view EQ as an RPG.  I view it as chat with pictures and a purpose.<br />
<br />
Some roleplayers are still innocent and having their roleplaying fun, but most &quot;roleplayers&quot; I have come across merely use roleplayed as an excuse for their numerous inexcusable activities.  People that roleplay rogues and SK's are the worst.</div></div><hr />

That might apply to some races and classes, but a high elven wizard is unlikely to go about speaking in the same fashion as a human rogue from the streets of East Freeport.<br />
<br />
If it bothers you (not you Hyena, the anti-RP readers in general) that people try to speak archaically, send them a tell privately and let them know it's a little hard to follow.  The nice thing about roleplayers is that most of them will try to adjust to meet you halfway unless you're just being rude.  :)<br />

Da swamp wuz full up wiff roleplayers, but eber so slooowly they begins to talk with a most proper accent and you suddenly find perfectly gud trollz screamin dey fool headz off bout &quot;The Blessings of Tunare&quot;.  That level 10 high elf pally in the fat green suit is the reason you don't like some aspects of roleplaying.  Inner character conflicts just kill the attempted RP. :p<br />
<br />
I would still rather endure hordes of the worst roleplayers than listen to the usual barrage of &quot;Dude, what strat did you guys use to kill that mob?&quot;, &quot;Can U buff/PL/hold me?&quot;, or &quot;Do you have anything for a warrior?&quot;.</div></div><hr />

And for those about to defend the folks who do not use English as their primary language --- a.) this comment was not aimed at them, and b.) they usually speak better English than most American EQ players  =)</div></div><hr />

You got that right.  I always enjoy seing how many different ways I can die in EQ.  You only get one shot irl.<br />
<br />
I enjoy RPers.  I have an alt on FV for when my home server is down.  <br />
<br />
It could be that this person did not speak english very well.  On my server we have alot of Far Eastern players and late on the weekends I can find myself grouping with them.  Sometimes it is very hard to understand what they are saying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm with you there.  Norrath is medieval, but it's not Earth.  There are no Saxons or Celts or Vikings or Mongols or Byzantines or Romans.  No reason to forsooth anyone to death.  I just don't understand how roleplaying somehow equals attempting to effect a goofy accent in text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Hail,<br />
<br />
I just don't understand how roleplaying somehow equals attempting to effect a goofy accent in text. <br />
Because it makes that person feel more immersed in their character.  No matter that their paltry education of medieval society or language comes from the movie Excalibur and A Knight's Tale or something equally false.  If the goofy accent enhances their enjoyment of the game, good for them. :)<br />
<br />
As long as the incomprehensible comments didn't affect your gameplay (other than as an annoying enigma), there is no harm.  There is no requirement to respond in kind. :)<br />
<br />
You may treat us (roleplayers) however you wish.<br />
<br />
I roleplay (lightly, not a maniac about it), and the few people I WON'T buff freely are dood-speakers.  &quot;Focus/Sta/sow mah plz? thx&quot; will get you a /boggle or /ponder response from me.  I may even roleplay my response that I do not understand the language if I have the time.  Some walk away in disgust, others learn to at least speak modern English with courtesy (which always results in buffs for them), and some even pick up RPing for a moment or two.  &quot;Could you lend me your magicks before I depart for battle M'lady?&quot;  Great example of a bastardized attempt.  But a heckuva lot nicer to hear than the first buff request I quoted. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<br />
Honestly I am, but being a barbarian shaman, it just means that I don't talk much, and when I do, I am very blunt.<br />
<br />
I enjoy the role playing aspect fo the game (I am even *gasp* in a RP guild on a regular server!)<br />
<br />
There are some execellant role players in my guild, and others (like myself) that are new to that aspect of the game.  I began role playing at the ripe old age of 55.  It actually makes the game more interesting for me because there are story-lines interwoven in our game play.  <br />
<br />
And we function very well with others on Xev, and it doesn't interfer with our ability to play well.</div></div><hr />
