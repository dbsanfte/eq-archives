<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My computer will crash then try to reboot, but just before Windows comes up it reboots again and continues to do this until I power off.<br />
<br />
After sitting for an indefinite period of time, I can turn my machine on and get into Windows.<br />
<br />
All the fans appear to be working, but it seems to be a hardware related problem as I have scanned for viruses, done scandisk and checkdisk.<br />
<br />
I have also reloaded drivers for my video card as they seemed to have gotten mucked up somehow. When I first tried to run scandisk I got the message saying that my files were somehow messed up and that I would have to run checkdisk.<br />
<br />
I also ran a vendor diagnostic on my harddrive which did not spot any problems.<br />
<br />
Any help or advice is welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">instead of spending an indefinate time trying to figure out the software that is causing the problem, just run the recovery cd or reinstall windows from scratch.  With all that time you spent researching and trying, you couldnt reinstalled windows, all your programs, and be playing on eq happily.<br />
btw, backup whatever data, documents, important files, and eq configuration files before erasing your hold hdd...</div></div><hr />
