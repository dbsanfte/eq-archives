Sounds like bragging to me too, not that I really care.  I've PL'd a couple of chars myself, though I don't talk about it.</div></div><hr />

Sorry for the lack of life ;)<br />
<br />
For all who dinged in 100days or more, it's more about the journey there, not about the destination. It's about the adventure and all the people you meet and what you do with them. Powergamers will see it in the end, or just make toon_11</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;no PL on scurg mez is quite sure&quot;<br />

Um, 38 days untwinked and no PL'ing?<br />
<br />
That's kinda hard to believe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">38 days untwinked and unpled to 60? Sure thats more than possible if you have played EQ before. I could get a toon on a new server to level 50 in 6-10 days for most classes and shaman tends to be fairly desired for classes plus they can solo fairly easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not that its a competition or anything ;)<br />
<br />
grats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sigh, I ding 60 and I get attacked.<br />
<br />
First of all, I was not bragging, I was just happy with my accomplishment and thought I would share it.<br />
<br />
secondly, I did not Powerlevel, nor would I want too, I have been playing this game since the Luclin server came out (3 1/2 years?) so I just know where the hunt and have experience in the game.  <br />
<br />
Since I have been playing I have never got a character pass level 53 (70 days played )and the rest in 30's so when I created Scurg I told myself I am just leveling and getting to 60 with out goofing around like I did since I have been playing.  If I didnt do so many Epic raids I probaly would of done in 25 days.<br />
<br />
Twinked?  Yes I was alittle twinked but not much, some BA gear, a slime coated harpoon all at level 9 from market trading which is how I got all my gear and my spells that I scribed.<br />
<br />
Next time I just keep my mouth shut if I accomplish anything. /sigh<br />
<br />
Whatever... I had enough.<br />

<br />
As for the &quot;bragging&quot; thing- why the he|| not?  Untwinked to 60 in 38 days with all major spells?  I know I'd be proud if I did that.  I just dinged 52 over the weekend.  42-52 has been just over 5 days played... and I've spent a little time raiding, too... I'm just a bit proud of that!  And to anyone who says it's bragging, he|| yeah!  ;)<br />
<br />
P.S.  Grats !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Scurg -<br />
they weren't talking about you !  they were talking about themselves, and how they see the game.<br />
<br />
don't sweat the discussion here - or look back at it and see haw they are talking about how/if they would do it.<br />
<br />
anyway - EQ is just a game, and this is just a board about a game.  <br />
<br />
however many are in EQ and however many are on these boards - you will get a variety of opinions.  The Crucible has actually done better than many boards at not letting the flamewars take over.<br />
<br />
oh - and Grats to Scurg !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">sweet Scurg, grats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, congrats! Even if you won't see it :( Don't mind humans, they tend to &quot;open mouth, insert foot&quot; a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's not difficult to imagine a 38 day trip to 60 (or even faster) without PLing or megatwinking... Filter out all the &quot;BS&quot; time on most level 60's - silly (and not so silly) quests, exploring, raiding, auctioning, watching the mobs grow, wandering around lost or looking for a group, tracking down that perfect soloing spot - and most of my 87+ days disapear.  I'd wager that actual experience gathering time is close (if not less) than Scurg's.  Don't criticize just because someone took a different path than you and had a faster or better result.<br />
<br />
Besides - so what if he's bragging a little?  He deserves it, so let him celebrate a little without whining about it - sheesh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Congrats there sir!<br />
<br />
I am more impressed that you had those spells banked at 38 days played than the leveling.  Leveling rate is mostly about your tolerance for the whack-a-mole grind - and yours must be huge :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">GRats Scurg :)<br />
<br />
<br />
And they are right, if you just XP to 60, 38 days is not unbelievable.  Very tenable.  I've blown at LEAST 7 days on raids, raid CR's, guild politics etc... but enuff, his position doesn't NEED defending :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">P.S.: flamey part:  You commie.. getting all those spells and having em..;)  Grats again man</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">good greif people.  38 days isn't a big deal for someone who's played before.<br />
<br />
i know a guy that got his warrior twink from 1-60 in less than 7 days played.  *THAT* is powerleveling and twinking.<br />
<br />
congratulations scurg on your accomplishment.  glad you got the two vital spells, too (malo/torpor).</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmmm here is a good question tho.<br />
<br />
what wwas everybody's days played when they got all their spells?<br />
<br />
i dinged 60 with 76 days played.  now at 100 or so i still lack malo..pox etc ROFL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Heh good job scurg <br />
<br />
It personally took me 60 days and 14 hours to get 60th, would be faster with what I know now...(Grab a monk and don't let go hehe) <br />
<br />
What impressed me most is the Malo/Torpor waiting to scribe at 60, VERY impressed if you have camped these yourself in that 38 day timeframe ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zorarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I did 55 lvls in 40days soloing. I'm sure if I made an effort to group I might've reached 60 in that time- but who likes groups anyways?<br />

Thanks everyone of the congradulation, I did work damn freaking hard getting to 60 regardless on what some think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Way to go!   Heh, I'm scared to look at my time played because all the time I've &quot;wasted&quot; being &quot;non-productive&quot;.<br />
<br />
I like to solo occasionally by finding the toughest thing I can handle, going and attacking it, using all sorts of mana in the process, killing it, retreating to a relatively safe spot then going mostly afk to do housework.   Yesterday I went from half way thru 21 to half way thru 23 with my wizzy (taking nearly all day) but while he was getting mana back I did the dishes, did several loads of laundry, swept the upstairs, changed sheets on all the beds in the house, mopped the kitchen floor, etc.<br />
<br />
My shaman also has spent many hours doing quests that I just wanted to say I had done and baby-sitting some friends (I wasn't high enough to truely PL them at the time but I was there to refresh buffs &amp; heal them.  Again, I did the housework/playing thing &amp; every 10 mintues refreshed buffs for them.<br />
<br />
I'm certain with my experience with the game I could probably get someone upwards of 60 in that kind of time but I don't particularily want to.<br />
<br />
CONGRATS!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Ok, history of Scurg. :)<br />
<br />
1. I soloed 90percent of my Shamans career and duo some, and yes I know how to play my class very well in group, raid or solo, I get compliments all the time and am often sort after. &lt;---Time saver.<br />
<br />
2.  I got a JBB at 47. &lt;----BIG time saver.<br />
<br />
3. I didnt jerk around, as said above I had one thing in mind with Scurg before I stop playing this game and my goal was to hit 60.  I did Epic raids but that is all but yet I still goofed around some because as we all know leveling can be tiresome, I could of been 60 in 25 days probaly. &lt;---Time saver.<br />
<br />
4. I have a Mule and I mean I have a MULE.  I created him alittle bit after Scurg and when I felt like I didnt want to level I logged on my mule.  With this mule I had 40 days played on or about, hes level 12, do the math.  With him I did trading in the market, which is the reason why I have nice equipement and most of my spells today (missing Pox and Avatar still).  I always have market on as well and because of these facts I got my spells.&lt;----Time saver.<br />
<br />
5. I bought Malo at 54ish and Torpor at 58, these 2 spells Malo/Torpor are not that rare on my server (Gerka could vouch for me here).  In fact Torpor is for sale right now with no one showing interest.  I am guessing the reason for this is because we only have 15-20 Oracles at most on my server, I see Malo more often for sale then BoN. <br />
<br />
Another thing is I bought all my spells ahead of time and I mean ahead of time by a few levels if possible.  I didnt wait to the said level to buy the spell like most do, ie. ding 60 WTB torpor and malo now. &lt;----Time saver.<br />
<br />
6. I bought ALL my stuff, I probaly got a handful of items from camping/grouping.  I started out with a few hundred PP and worked up from their, all this with my mule and leveling from Gornit and Seafuries. &lt;---Not a time saver :)<br />
<br />
7.  As mentioned above I didnt camp anything. &lt;----Time saver.<br />
<br />
8. Because I have been playing this game so freaking long I new where, what and how to level from experience.   I new what to hunt until I got to level 53 (thanks EQ necros) and then level 56(thanks Soupypoopy), like I said I played this game for a long time an already experienced the camping, questing game with other characters but when I created Scurg he would be my exception.  <br />
<br />
So if you want to add my mule time then about 80 days played. :)<br />
<br />
Hmm did I miss anything? Gerka, how come you didnt get the crap when you did 60 in 28 days? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">5.

Hehe, don't tempt me. My Shaman on Xev is gathering dust because I don't like the server. My Rogue on Vazaelle is having a grand old time...how much was that character move again :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Grats Scurg!  Quite the accomplishment to stay on the treadmill for 38 straight days.  Couldn't have been much fun, but more powa to ya or something.  :p <br />
<br />
Yer char history shows that you made wise choices in respect to gear and spell acquirement.  That's good, but 40 days on the mule haha, well I just gotta say that the treadmill really sux sometimes eh? <br />
<br />
Do yerself a favor and go do something fun with yer shaman.  Maybe only fun things, fun camps, etc.  You'll be more wanted than ever for groups.  A 60 is an INCREDIBLE asset to any exp group, having all the tools to play a one-man support game, contribute damage, pull (pulling is big, learn how to do it good), and generally keep the group together.  I find that the groaning gets loudest when I say i have to go.  <br />
<br />
There is more treadmill to go, but I suggest that you spend that time enjoying your char and learning more about the Norrathian world.  No doubt there are places you'd still like to visit and see and maybe kill the indiginous fauna.  <br />
<br />
Check out CT, get in a good group there and treadmill away for four hours.  With a high dmg group, that's like an AA level right there.  Sides I'm sure you would like to have FT3 bootzors for yer mule to sell off.  <br />
<br />
Oh and one last thing dood, chill out and don't let every little thing bother you ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I can't believe someone would think that a character with 38 days /played who just hit 60 was Powerleveld.<br />
<br />
If you were twinked then getting to 60 in 38 days is pretty dang slow.  It's pretty good untwinked on a new server, but certainly not all that fast.<br />
<br />
I don't see how people manage to take 60+ days /played to hit lvl 60.  I think it's only those who sit around and do trades and try to camp midlvl items to improve themselves instead of just getting XP.<br />
<br />
Everytime I say that somebody who took 100 days to get to 60 tells me that he enjoyed the ride and wasn't powerlvling up.  I still want to know *** you were doing other than gaining XP.  There isn't much else in EQ unless you're into the trading aspect ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Um, ever gone on a raid, Mil?  I've been doing a lot of that lately, and I tend to go backwards in exp most times.  Staying even is about the best I hope for.  Since I don't have unlimited time to play, I often have to choose between raiding, and sitting alone exp grinding, and the raiding is just more fun to me.<br />
<br />
Or maybe you're just lucky and always in the KS group on your raids. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Everytime I say that somebody who took 100 days to get to 60 tells me that he enjoyed the ride and wasn't powerlvling up. I still want to know *** you were doing other than gaining XP. There isn't much else in EQ unless you're into the trading aspect .<br />
I was at 68 days and some change played on my level 56 Shaman. Very little of that time was spent trading.<br />
<br />
I would say a good chunk of that time was spent on raids. For a non-raiding Shaman I sure did get sucked into a lot of 'em :p I also ate a lot of deaths, took the boat a ton before Luclin (Kunark to Velious? There's a good half hour at least if you're not lucky), factioned up with Giants to ally only to have to faction to ally with Dragons a bit later, did quests that were too tedious or hard to do earlier when things were blue and generally checked out new areas, chatted or did tradeskills.<br />
<br />
There's a ton of stuff to do in EQ to waste time and not gain XP, particularly if it's your first character and it was started a long time ago, when banded was godly and having a weapon that hit wisps was incredibly uber. <br />
<br />
I think it's a lot easier to level up quickly now with the gear available for the newer player but that's just my opinion. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it or that anyone who gets to 60 fast is bad, just saying what I've noticed. I'm actually happy with how much easier it is the 2nd (3rd or 4th etc.) time around and I won't be surprised if I not only get my new, untwinked Rogue to 60 but do it before 40 days /played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hay broder Scurg ;)<br />
<br />
I got some gabage also but mez just ignored it....  mostly it degenerated into who had leveld faster then my 28 days or so.<br />
<br />
Also mez not tell them that withing 3 mins of dinging 60 I had scribed Focus, Malo, and Torpor.  (still looking for group focus, avatar and pox /sigh).<br />
<br />
I was in da same zone wid Scurg when he become an Oracle...  he was so wasted he did not even bother scribing his spells.<br />
<br />
The big grind is not a lot of fun, but playing the same game over and over again with different characters is not much fun either.  For me this was not a race but just a personal goal to make sure that I got to 60 for the first time ever.<br />
<br />
38 days is very nice and demonstrats a lot of determination.  Scurg also has a great reputation both within RE and out.  He is respected for both his substaintail class knowledge, quality play, and general kindness.<br />
<br />
Don't swet da detractors Scurg......  Dem that talk bad bout joo are just demonstaiting dar own personal problems.<br />
<br />
Congrats again.<br />
<br />
NOTE:  Last night me get a new Hammer that will just make joo sick. *giggle*<br />
