<br />
It was mentioned that the mana regen was unintentional though.<br />
<br />
Downtime in the game is bad enough as it is. The nerf would be a great way to ensure that many more people flock to WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the discussion was about interrupting spells on mounts.<br />
and the answer was (at least the last one i read..) that they would have to remove the meditation while sitting on a horse if they would implement interrupting spells on horses/drogmors, but they dont want to do that -&gt; its a bug, but as long as they dont implement interrupting spells on mounts it stays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Regarding charisma question - provided you have enough faction 105 cha normally does.<br />

Sometimes 140-145 is needed, after that I think there is little difference</div></div><hr />

To clear this up a little, mounts were never intended to allow the effects of sitting, such as mana regen, to happen while mounted. However, the team has decided to leave this be, given that you cannot stop casting a spell from a mount. If we were to introduce the ability to stop casting while mounted, we would most likely remove any sitting benefits from being mounted. <br />
<br />
Bold and underline are mine - to point out that since Brenlo stated SOE policy is &quot;the team has decided to leave this be,&quot; then it is clearly time for the &quot;team&quot; to change their mind and nerf the mounts.<br />
<br />
Seems the whole mount and why scenario gets lost and sidetracked - the key to a mount was the reduction in sitting aggro while being able to med. Go back to SOE comments about the mounts at the time. The speed of travel speil was tossed in &quot;if you purchase the higher-cost mounts.&quot;<br />
<br />
When something is &quot;not intended&quot; you don't ever, ever flag the &quot;unintended result&quot; as the most prominant/dominant PR point ... unless you are EQ/SOE, it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Oh yeah.  I remember feeling angry when I saw Brenlo's reply.  But then again, they never have time to fix anything, so why bother?<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You know now that we are talking about it, there gonna ninja &quot;fix&quot; it so we no longer get sitting mana regen.. AAAAH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh, and in terms of &quot;this mount is too big&quot; type errors:<br />
<br />
Few nights ago I was camping the remains in KC.  I was in that little hidden nich in the wall. I had shrunk twice, and summoned my mount, whereupon, I was shot up one floor and ended up with 12 adds on me:)<br />
<br />
Just be warned.  For some reason, whatever they did, if your summon your drog in small places, be prepared to teleport thru walls and such:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why does brenlo remind me of james carville or william kristol?<br />
<br />
Swarmy, condescending, talks out of the side of his mouth it seems, and never has a definitive answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Mmm, I vaguely recall reading an interview or something with someone (Absor/Alan I think) where they said they weren't going to nerf horses, as the mana regen was why so many people had bought them. <br />
<br />

<br />
I remember this too.  Someone was complaining that you could not duck out of spells on a horse and they basically said that medding and ducking were both unintentional.  If you want us to fix one then we are fixing both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Lots of people should read this because Alan mentioned in a post over on the sony website that horses/lizards are no longer going to allow you to med while sitting on them.

<br />
Untrue.  He merely stated that Horse med was originally unintentional, and he did so in response to someone writing in complaining that the new /stopcast command does not interrupt spells while on a horse.  Sony claimed that if /stopcast WOULD stop horse mounted spells, there'd be absolutely no benefit to not being mounted.<br />
<br />
He made no statement whatsoever claiming he would &quot;fix&quot; something that has been around since Luclin.  It's been INCREDIBLY common knowledge that horses allowed meditate for what, 2 years now?  They've known about it, but it's not the type of thing you can just switch back, and I'm willing to bet it's one of the reason all LDoN's (even outdoorsish ones) are tagged indoor only.<br />
<br />
Just because you read something wasn't intentional doesn't mean that it's going to be &quot;fixed.&quot;  A lot of changes to EQ were made by accident and then kept, like the upper end druid buffs regenerating Mana instead of HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>PanzerCat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Great, and I sold my damn mount back yesterday under the premis they were going to get nerfed in the next patch....Son of a ...................  Oh well, atlest I got my charisma up enough before selling it and got back around 75k..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sorry, I'll post the link to the article in a second.  Sony's website always downloads so very slowly for me and is an enormous hassle.  Downloading Mozilla's firefox now to see if that'll help.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I probably shouldn't have posted without a link to what Alan said, but it's now conveniently disappeared.  It was in the form of a news clip.  A paladin was asking the developers a question about whether buying a horse was worth it now or whether he should wait and just get his AA horse.  Alan responded saying that meditating while on a horse was not intended and will be fixed in the upcoming future.  That was the gist of the post and though I can't find it now, hopefully that might help somebody else nail it down.  Read the post last night, some time around 1 am while I was trying to log on to the Sony website to post on the Shaman boards.  It was either on the main page or off a link from the main page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I can't think of a single reason to have a horse without the benefit of medding.  The fastest horse is too expensive to justify the cost just for the speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ducking to interrupt spells (including items) is definitely intentional, the ability was specifically added in a patch June 27th 2001.<br />
<br />
Faction is indifferent in both lighthouse and bazaar so 105 charisma is enough for best prices there, whether buying a mount or returning one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">So what were the horses for then?<br />
<br />
So we could look cool while having the pain of starting and stopping slowly?<br />
<br />
Oh, I remember.  So we wouldn't take damage while falling...a bone thrown to us big races.  No wait, so we could finally keep the 10000 copper pieces on us, instead of destroying them constantly.<br />
<br />
The purpose of having a horse to SIT on while casting spells was specifically meant for maintaining the benefits of sitting (ie. mana regen) while avoiding sitting agro.<br />
<br />
I wish I'd kept so much of their blather back in the day to prove it.<br />
<br />
What are they trying to say was going to be their selling point of the horse, and not the 100k one, if you couldn't med on them?  They expected people to dismount to med, then get back on the horses again?  Or were they thinking they'd just be show ponies with no real game value.<br />
<br />
I'm flabbergasted that they think anyone would believe that BS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The primary purpose of horses was for travel, Borgax, and partly for show. It was also intended for you to be able to fight while mounted which is why meditate works on them, otherwise a caster would have to mount/dismount all the time. So yes the feature was always intended, it just wasn't meant to be the primary use of horses the way it is now. And it turns out melees never use mounts in combat due to poor acceleration,  targetting interference, and trampling on other melees.</div></div><hr />
