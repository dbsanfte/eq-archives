The fire was started by me naturaly. I handed the tear to him and went outside the locked door onto the bridge. There I met my maker with and Ice Comet then a AE fire tossed onto me.<br />
At this point the mage sent in his pet and the 63 Pally started to play with Rak. All the other melee and casters just bit their tongues and waited only healing the Pally and the Pet.<br />
I was CoH up from my bind at the entrance by the mage to help with heals. By the time I got there the fire pet was a few hits from death and the Pally was at 39% life and casting a heal on himself, Rak was at 53%. The mage cast a new pet and sent him in I healed the Pally. At 51% the melee in call was made. Lost the the lvl 42 war first then a rogue. Healed the 63 Pally until I was at 1 bub mana. <br />
Rak went into a bezerker state and the fight was over in 20 more seconds......... bye bye Rak, hello scale =)<br />
Oh ya no Clerics at all, just Pally, Druid. Shaman healing =)</div></div><hr />
