<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is this worth it? Looks like it summons 3 - 6 wolfes that last a minute.<br />
What's the recycle time on this? Does it cost mana?<br />
<br />
Cute party trick?<br />
Usefull spell/ability?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">12 min and its a cute party trick thats useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont have the thread handy but i think sc3 turned out to be something around a 4k DoT. Mana free and impresses da ladies , you cant go wrong.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend getting it after you have can5 and anyhting you deem more important. Its added damage on raids , helps with soloing, did i mention da ladies love it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Spirit Call aa skill calls forth wolf pets that seem to be the same as your level 61 pet. They attack the mob that you have targeted when you summon them, or any mob that attacks you after they are summoned. They last one minute. The refresh rate is 12 minutes. It does not cost any mana. The first aa level costs 4 aa points and calls forth 3 pets, the second level costs 3 aa points and calls 4 pets, the third level costs 2 aa points and calls 5 pets.<br />
<br />
I have done two levels of this skill and I like it. I use it for big mob kills, when I am soloing or when I am in an xp group and we get an add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just to add to the above post:<br />
The ability does about 750-1000 damage per pet, depending on the level of the mob.<br />
The pets will enrage on low health.<br />
The pets have HUGE push.  If you send the pets at a mob, expect the mob to be pushed by the melee quite far from the original spot the pets engaged.  To counter this, strafe around the mob as your pets are &quot;ejected&quot; from your toon, and they'll surround the mob, and push from all sides, thus countering the push factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would suggest, you buy the first level (4 points aren't that expensive)<br />
and check it out. You can't go wrong with more doggies ...<br />
<br />
I am a bit hesitant(sp?) about the next two levels as 3 points for one more dog (SC2)<br />
seems a bit costly.<br />
<br />
Just think of it as a mana free dot that you can cast 5 times per hour. It's one of the<br />
more useful AAs and it's looks cute ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When you are low on mana/low on hp and just need to crank out that last bit of damage (or need to buy some time), they are perfect as a lifesaver. Also good to use on unrootable adds if your group pulls more than you can handle :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't buy the hype.  It's a very long casting, short range spell, and is simply a bit of fun DPS you can use when things are already under control.<br />
<br />
If you're low on mana, cani.<br />
<br />
If you have adds, root.<br />
<br />
If they're not rootable, I guess you can try to get your melees/pets to back off to split after you call (no way to call before the mob is in camp) - good luck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's another source of free manaless damage every 12 minutes that can also bash/kick/interrupt casting mobs.<br />
<br />
It's definitely worthwhile and represents more bang for the buck than most AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use it in raid to help pin the MOB where the MT want it. The amount of push back they generate is significant. In exp group, they're great to deal with caster... they bash constantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SC1 is next on my AA list.<br />
<br />
I have not spent any AA points for fun and I am so looking forward to having my little pack of dogs.<br />
<br />
After I get this ability I am going to go to MM and take on the DW and his pack.  Clearly I am going to win but all the dogs having a big fur ball fight is just going to be pure entertainment.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm sure it's reason enough to be flogged around here, but I actually got SC1 before MC2,3, and Cann5...  I don't get exp very fast, and I needed something fun to keep me motivated. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A lot of people overlook the fact that there are some mobs that are more or less immune to shaman.  If a mob resists cold and poison, you will not be contributing anything significant in the way of damage (epic and disease based DoTs are useful, but not in short fights).  The spirit call gives you the chance to do 4k-5k of melee-based damage, which can't be resisted.<br />
<br />
I also find spirit call useful for positioning mobs.  Some have said they use it to root-park adds, but I've never really found it too useful for that.  It has a rather longish cast-time.<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, it is a very low-cost AA to get.  4 points, then 3 points, then 2 points.  I have all 3 levels and like the skill quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If they're not rootable, I guess you can try to get your melees/pets to back off to split after you call (no way to call before the mob is in camp) - good luck =) <br />
Actually I use spiritcall quite effectively to pull with. For instance you have 2 mobs that you can't split. Sneak up close, let the pets loose, tag one with turgurs and run. The slow will aggro the 2nd mob to the point that he will follow, while the dogs keep the 1st pinned at his spawn point. <br />
Now your raid/group/solo can deal with 1 slowed mob and have it compeletly under control before the 2nd one shows up in camp. Depending on zone, you might not get the 2nd one at all.<br />
<br />
The pets don't have amazing hps, but they can last long enough against anything to give you a good head start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I, too, paused to get Spirit Call before starting my archetype AA points.<br />
<br />
These things are awesome against casters.  Using it, I have yet to see something get a spell off while beset by the Goner Gang.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Regarding the pulling strategy, make sure not to try that on mobs that summon.  The damage the dogs do will start the summoning process, and I'm pretty sure that you would be on the hatelist.  (Then again, maybe not.  HAVE you tried this on summoning mobs?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aislyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Would love a text message that said, &quot;Your Spirit Call is now available.&quot;  Kinda like when a slow or dot wears off so I know when to refresh it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like SC, but I wouldn't rate it as a must-have like canni V. It is mainly just good fun, but it has also saved me once or twice whilst I've been jumped upon whilst doing a tricky CR - mana free damage and a tank in just a few seconds is very useful.<br />
<br />
The interrupting capability is also very useful when soloing, particularly against casters that gate (Emperor in Seb is a prime example). I love soloing in Seb for some quick cash, and if you get a few wizard adds spirit call can be very handy.<br />
<br />
Lastly, use it when you get unrootable adds, either to help hold off the add from the party, or to kill the first mob that bit faster.<br />
<br />
All in all: AA points are probably better spent in SCR, Quickbuff etc, but SC is far more fun, very versatile, and doesn't take long to get so it gets my vote.<br />
<br />
I also love virulent paralysis and radiant cure :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The most important reason to have Spirit Call is so that you can make this hotkey:<br />

<br />
'nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">10 dps per dog was the number I heard.  Sounds skippy to me.  I got it for a toy and have gotten TONS of use out of it.  Especially on unmezzable adds or adds with no mezzer handy - I love having a manaless way to chew the first mob down faster that doesn't involve getting crazy amounts of aggro.<br />
<br />
It's most useful, I find, if you regularly partner, when that extra dps (and possible tanks) can take a lot of the stress out of that add you just pulled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">they are flea bitten, fur covered barking snarling beautiful little sons of biotches that were worth every min it took to get the 4aa's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've got SC2, about to buy SC3 tonight. Sure, it might not be the wisest investment of AA points at this point in time - SCRM and quickbuff are calling, but I've found spirit call 1 to be a lot of fun and as someone mentioned above, a decent way for us to contribute DPS on boss mobs or plain old xp mobs that are pretty resistant to our DoT's (giants in BoT come to mind).<br />
<br />
I've noticed each pet tends to do around 1k in damage in the 60 seconds it's around, but they can be hasted, boosting DPS considerably - those mobs where I can't DoT / nuke I tend to haste the pets since I've got a ton of mana not being used. They are fantastic for fighting caster mobs, I've yet to see a mob gate since I've started using this skill. On pure melee mobs, I usually use SC right at the beginning of the fight because I don't want them getting ripped apart by enrage. Very useful for hunting guardian wurms btw.<br />
<br />
Overall it hasn't made a huge impact on the power scale of shaman's abilities, but it is a fun and relatively useful skill. It's fun to watch group members expressions when you toss it out, and it's absolutely priceless to watch it scare the crap out of lowbies in zones like oasis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">NUMBER ONE USE of SPiritcall for me:<br />
<br />
   Soloing.<br />
<br />
   Pull a mob that hits fast or quads with spiritcall.   mob stops on puppies and tries to take them out.  DO NOT SLOW.   first dog enrages and does impressive damage during rage.  Second dog enrages and again, does impressive damage.  Third dog enrages, NOW you slow and proceed to fight as normal.   Can usally get a mob down a good 20 percent like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Other than that, I use it in raids to correct positioning, in groups to add damage/save mana (normally Saryn each pull, but if I SC then I don't saryn to regain mana passively)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you look at it from a straight DPS standpoint, 3 puppies doing 1k of damage every 12 minutes isn't much. It averages out to 3dps if my math is right. <br />
<br />
Having said that, I bought SC1 even before Cann5 and never regretted it. I do use them for tank mezzing adds if there isn't a chanter around. Root a mob, send in the puppies and you don't have to worry about root breaking, getting it slowed... for a minute.  It even works on caster mobs, which tend to get owned by the puppies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you look at it from a straight DPS standpoint, 3 puppies doing 1k of damage every 12 minutes isn't much. It averages out to 3dps if my math is right.<br />
<br />
Well sure, but usually mobs dont last the full 12 mins it takes to refresh hehe.  I think someone averaged it and Spirit Call 3 does around 90 DPS total for the entire time they dogs are all alive, not too bad especially while soloing.  When I solo I can usually get all DOTs in, Spiritcall, use Rains and the mob dies soon after the dogs go poof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">With Spirit Call 3, Coldian Ring 7(4 orc + 4 giants) can be cleaned easily with 5 called Spirit and Alpha pet and root.  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did this also, wanted something fun to make the grind worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Hell it has come in handy for me on several occasions, add's that need distracting for 1 min, dump the puppy horde on them, and they are taken care of.<br />
<br />
Is also handy to combat the pushy BST pets. :)</div></div><hr />
