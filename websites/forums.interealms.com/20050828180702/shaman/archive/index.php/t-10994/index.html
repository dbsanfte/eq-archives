<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>schuleta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really think it will be the Dark Elves that take Freeport. They will let the evil humans stay in the sewers. Trolls get Neriak/Nektulos. It makes sense because besides Half-Elves, Humans are the only other race to have more than one starting city (not counting Erudites with Erudin/Paineel). Freeport will be sacked on Feb. 24th (or the official release date). The dynamic sotryline that is happening was a long time in coming, but at least it is happening.<br />

where the HELL am I gonna get Fizzlecutter formula 5000 now?<br />
<br />
Ive trashed my FP faction to the point of no return, so I've had to get my alts to collect fizzlecutter for me for about 10 levels now.  But if I lose my access to that delighfully spicy drink than Im gonna be really really upset at the Inkies.<br />

Trash the town all you want...but SAVE Fizzlecutter!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think one of two things will happen.<br />
<br />
1. The trolls take over about half of freeport, the humans and trolls settle in sory of a stalemate, kinda like HHK.<br />
<br />
2. The trolls take over FP and the humans set up there new town in the now abandoned EC tunnels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">While I find changes in the world of Norrath to be interesting, I must admit to being a bit depressed with the though of losing access to Freeport.  I consider it my hometown, as most of my early days in game were spent there, over the early lives of several characters.  Though with the lifeblood of the tunnel in East Commons cut off by the bazaar, Freeport has become more or less a ghost town.  <br />
<br />
But if the city is taken over, I’m betting it’ll be by the trolls.  With the new pirate troll storyline, I can’t see Sony passing up on the opportunity of another port town for the trolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'm all for it. I mean, if the Dark Elves invade Freeport, I'll be more liked in east/west FP than i'm now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Fp could be taken over.<br />
Then a port is there and in broken skull and in Stonebrunt<br />
/shrug who knows?<br />
<br />
<br />
Soulstorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Head</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I cant see the FP being over run by the Trolls they dont need another City with the new 1 coming with LOY most likely is that the attack will fail leaving the DE and FP week ready for attack from the new lot of trolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I'd bet the change to EFP is simply to update the docks so you can catch a boat from there (as well as from Stonebrunt?) to Broken Skull.<br />
<br />
It seems that with everyone breathing a sigh of relief that PoP/Luclin removed the need to use boats we now ....err have to use boats again.  WTG Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Head</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I think its a good idea to make ppl to use boats again just along they they turn up more than once a week!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Face it, the only reason your towns haven't been invaded by iksar is because we can't figure out how to build boats :/</div></div><hr />

I thought the EQ2 was taking place in the time before the present game?</div></div><hr />

If the fights were in Halas barbs win everytime.  Cold blooded races cant take the chill of the mountain air.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Stories of trolls intelligent enough to sail out of the gulf and enter Grobb through the use of magic earned the royal house's curiosity. The theft of the artifact and the transformation of the frogloks were minor details to the dark elves. Their main priority was to determine the nature of this lost tribe of trolls and their cloaked companions. If the rumors held true, this new brood from the sea might possess something more significant than the troll stone. Perhaps Broken Skull Rock contained secrets that could help the Tier`Dal to increase their power? It was hard for the strategists to keep their minds from drifting towards the nearest harbor town and the tactical advantage they would have in taking it, should they seize control of the ocean to the east. If something within Broken Skull Rock gave trolls the ability to command the seas, what power could it offer a more intelligent race?</div></div><hr />
