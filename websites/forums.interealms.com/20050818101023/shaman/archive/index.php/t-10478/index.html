<br />
When Im loading up EQ, and when zoning, the task bar appears, with EQ bit in, and the disspears when I get into active play.<br />

<br />
Any help with be greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Press alt-enter to switch to windowed mode and then alt-enter to switch back. That should fix it. <br />
<br />
I get the same problem, but I also get my zone alarm display showing through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Feth I have the same issue and I am using win98. unfortunatly I havent found a fix for it yet. it also seems that some days are worse than others. I think it has to do with the new windowed mode that they reciently introduced. i've tried the alt-enter and that doesn't work...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dothimgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have the same problem. I have /bug and /petition it, and finally a GM told me to Alt-Enter twice. Didnt help tho...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You have to switch from full screen to windowed and back to get rid of the cursor.<br />
<br />
I have to use shift-alt-enter on windows 2000.<br />
<br />
I can't do it at all on my XP machine...just have to live with the cursor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have XP as well and Alt-Enter does the trick for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Alt enter to put EQ in a window.  Then alt + shift + R  and that will free your mouse to minimize EQ.  Then open up something else like internet explorer.  Press alt tab to switch back to EQ.  The cursor should be gone.  Alt tab back to internet, close it, this should bring u back to EQ.  Alt Enter again and you're back to normal.  <br />
It's just a work-around.  They should fix that bug imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Alt enter works for me too. Asked a GM, replied with 'Im having the same problem... ive been told its been worked on'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mythix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can also fix this by going into your options pannel in game and click on the display tab. In this screen change what graphics colors you are using (like 16 bit to 32 bit) and it resets the screen. This had always worked for me, though now wince windowed eq came out I can just alt+enter and it works too.<br />
<br />
hope this helps:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I used to have this problem and after asking on the EQ tech support board i was told that the reason you get the cursor in the middle of the screen has something to do with having the same resolution in eq as you have on your desktop.   Try changing the resolution on the option screen before you log in.  Worked for me :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">aye, i changed the esolution, and put EQ into windowed and the full screen, and its working fine now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I really hope SOE fixes the problem, I hate having to ALT out of the screen and back... especially when it was working fine until this last patch :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Breecat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Don't know if it'll work for you but in win98 if you right click &quot;my computer&quot;, select properties, then performance, then graphics and bump hardware acceleration down a notch it might fix the problem. Certainly did on my win98 machine. Only adverse effect I found so far is it messed up the cursor in Neverwinter Nights.</div></div><hr />
