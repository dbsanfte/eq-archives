<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aerina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone this is the first time I ever made a shaman in my EQ life. I'm deciding between an Iskar or a Barb. I like the Barb because it has pos faction with everyone but the barb is blind as bat. The iskar has alot of great qualities but it is hated all across norrath. What race do you guys suggest and no trolls or ogres for me just these two. I hope you can make me resolve this...thanks )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Id go iksar...faction not really issue on the moon or in velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey, if you do a search there is a lot of debate on &quot;the best shaman race.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barb <br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Slam<br />
Decent starting faction<br />
Decent starting wis<br />
Good starting str/sta<br />
Can wear JB armor, including the JBB<br />
Can also wear Jarsath armor from KC but not sebilite scale armor from OS<br />
Good looking (well, I think so!)<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
Nightblind (only a real hassle up to level 9 when shaman get infra)<br />
No innate regen<br />
Right now, our deity specific quest is pretty crappy, you summon a giant magical hammer /yawn<br />
Very common (maybe not a con to some)<br />
<br />
Iksar<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Innate natural regen<br />
Highest starting wisdom<br />
Innate AC bonus<br />
Excellent Hate planar armor<br />
Can wear Jarsath and sebilite scale<br />
Can't wear JB, but can wear all the Velious quested armor<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
Can't wear JB (including the JBB)<br />
Bad faction in the old world <br />
Low starting sta/str<br />
<br />
Neither barbs or iksar can worship Innothule and have access to the deity specific Inny snare necklace (which is very nice).  Both barbs and iksar can wear the fungi tunic (vah shir shaman cannot).  Neither barbs or iksars get the ogre frontal stun immunity.<br />
<br />
While some shaman seem to think the ability to wear a JBB is game-breaking, I really think you should decide on what looks fun to you and what you would enjoy playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After using a JBB for the last 10 levels, I don't think I could live without it.  It makes soloing easier and thus you level so much faster.  I would not be an iksar solely on the basis that they cannot wear it.  Other than that, iksar has every quality I would want in a shaman.<br />
<br />
Troll can use JBB and also has regen.  If you don't mind being ass-ugly, you might consider it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aerina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for all the good info so far ). If I were to start an Iksar or barb what would be good starting stats? Thanks and keep all the good info coming</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmmmm, starting stats.  Are you playing with end game in mind or are you just playing for some fun?<br />
<br />
I think int, str, cha and dex are pretty worthless for starting stats, the only important ones to me are wis, sta and to a lesser extent, agi.<br />
<br />
What I've found at level 60 is that it's pretty easy to get pieces of equipment with great wisdom.  I'm finding it hard to find equipment that also adds sta.<br />
<br />
That being said, as a level 60 barb shaman in a raid guild, I would have put more points into sta and less points into wisdom.  Although conventional wisdom states that you should put as many starting points into wis as possible and the remaining 5 into sta or agi.<br />
<br />
With regen + cannabalize, I still don't think it's as important for shaman to have maxxed wisdom, mana regen was always more important to me than max mana pool (regen items &gt; wis items).  So, I think I could have gotten by with 10 less into wis and 10 more into sta.<br />
<br />
Okay, for a barb, if I were to start over knowing what I know now...I would have put 20 points into sta and 10 into wis.  That's a pretty radical suggestion, so take it with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
For iksars...wow, they have a pretty low str and sta, but a nice high wis...While I would be tempted to put some points into str (since a new character will struggle with encumberance for awhile) I still think I would concentrate the points into 20 sta, 10 wis.<br />
<br />
Don't get too stressed out about starting stats, I completely messed Glory up (let's just say she's um, strong) and I managed just fine.<br />
<br />
Oh, I forgot another barb pro...being a cute polar bear!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">before you make an iksar, i'd advice you to carefully read about how the JBB works, there's a lot of threads about it on the boards. it's one of the single most game enhancing armor pieces because of the effect (263 dmg nuke in 8.0 secs).<br />
<br />
here's a thread:<br />

i chose ogre from these facts:<br />
<br />
* can use JBB<br />
* looks cool and very cute shrunk :P<br />
<br />
i'm glad i chose ogre, the frontal stun immunity is a thing you'll be benefitting from almost every single day you're playing. getting stunned really ticks me off from other chars, so it's swell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually I don't think immunity to frontal stun is a big deal.  I am almost never stunned from the front, and when I am it is just a second or so.  It would be a big boon if you're the main tank and losing a second of taunt time could mean losing aggro, but I dont think it is that big of an advantage for a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just wondering does Stun = interrupt every time? Cause i hardly get interupted at 55 cause im an ogre, just wondering if you barbies ever have trouble getting interupted cause of bash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I get stunned and interrupted from time to time, but it has never caused a catastrophe.  I just take a few extra hits, become unstunned, and keep going.<br />
<br />
Back to the point tho, Gloriana summed it all up pretty nicely, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Medices</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Stun interrupts every time, but I find that I'm interrupted more by knockback, probably 10-20 times more than by just being stunned. <br />
<br />
If I had to restart my shaman, I'd probably still stick with Barby, just put most of my creation points into Sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just wanted to place a plug forthe Vah Shir.  Ya they can't wear a fungi, but if you don't have one, they are IMHO a better choice than a barb.  They can see at night without spells, and I don't believe they have any exp penalty whatsoever.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of times that I look at Trolls, Ogres, and Iksar as superior shaman races.  And I think that the regen alone *Does* make them superior (and ogres because of their amazing hitpoints).  However, I think about that nasty exp penatly, and I'm truly glad I'm playing a cat.<br />
<br />
I wish there were more of us :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">XP penalty sucks, but because my duo partner is an Iksar monk, we level at the same pace which is nice.  (our dwarf rogue friend joins us and levels so much faster its sick)<br />
<br />
I think Regen is a big thing, however some comments from the 60 end seem to lead to the fact that regen isn't so big because of Torpor.  Of course, until you get Torpor I imagine its good to have as much regen as you can get.<br />
<br />
I went with troll shaman of innoruuk for many reasons:<br />
<br />
Regeneration<br />
Good Strength and stamina<br />
They dance the best (old world trolls)<br />
Snare necklace  (This is huge in my duo with a monk, no other snare available)<br />
If I want I can get a halfling illusion mask<br />
JBB<br />
Trolls are dead sexy<br />
<br />
Iksar would have been my second choice, but would have lost a lot of the pluses from above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If I were to start over, I'd probably choose iksar again...  The JBB is damn nice and all, but it's also very expensive to acquire at the levels it'll be the most use to you.  <br />
<br />
Iksar starting stats, I'd put everything to STA.<br />
<br />
If I were to start a barb, I'd be tempted to put them into AGI actually.  Barbs have decent STA naturally so more agi would mean a little better avoidance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I put:<br />
5 Wisdom<br />
10 Dex<br />
10 Agi<br />
5 Cha<br />
<br />
... When I made Shandy, I had recently read a description of shamen as &quot;melee casters.&quot;  So, physical attributes got adjusted accordingly.  Mid 20s - Late 30s, I was going thru a &quot;must have more Wisdom&quot; phase.<br />
<br />
Thank the Tribunal something knocked some sense into me--literally.  I reset my priorities, and found that life is much better without concentrating on Wisdom.  Nor do I concentrate solely on AC/HP now.<br />
<br />
We're the most adaptive folk around.  STA sounds good now, but that extra 5 Cha is just enough to put me up into the price bracket beyond where my buffs put me, and I'm an avid alchemist, so it's worth the savings there.  I'm sure the extra dex and agi have probably saved my neck a time or two.<br />

<br />
I'm sure they haven't.  :D  Agi gives you some minor ac and lets you learn defensive skills faster.  Dex gives you some added chance to proc a weapon and to learn offensive skills faster.  As long as you're not under 75, 10 points or so in either stat aren't going to do much of _anything_ for you.<br />
<br />
As for which race to choose:<br />
<br />
1) Troll (Snare necklace, JBB, Slam, Innate Regen and Infravision)<br />
2) Iksar (Innate Regen, Innate Infravision, AC, 100 swimming, Forage)<br />
3) Ogre (JBB, Slam, Innate Infravision, Immune to frontal stuns, much more Stamina (more hp))<br />
4) Vah Shir (Slam?  (I forget), JBB, Innate Safe Fall and Sneak, good faction, eat/drink much faster (bad), Innate Infravision?)<br />
5) Barbarian (JBB, Slam, Blind, good faction)<br />
<br />
Personally if I were to start over, I'd go Troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Scaleyy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Iksar definately.<br />
<br />
1. Most of your time in eq will be spent in places you are kos anyway. Wherever you hunt things will most likely hate you no matter what you play. Faction doesn't matter. As an Iksar I've been able to accomplish anything anyone else has. Also, if you really wanted to walk around freely in all cities you could easily kill mobs for faction.  Even now I spend 99% of my time on the Moon and in Velious where it also doesn't matter what race you are.<br />
<br />
2. Highest starting wisdom adds more benefits than it may seem. Sure you'll have more mana for the early levels, but it's a Huge benefit all the way to 60. This means you can still have 255 wisdom and use gear that boosts other things like Health, Mana, or AC.<br />
<br />
3. Regen Regen Regen. At level 60 this is like having an extra clarity buff. It all adds up. Also, when you decide to use a BP other than fungi it won't hurt your mana supply as much.<br />
<br />
4. Solo'ing. JBB isn't squat. I have always been able to solo wonderfully. Some shamans become so dependant on a 'free nuke' that they don't see there are better strategies. I've grouped a good amount of my 60 levels, but after level 24 and all the way to 60 I did a tremendous amount of solo. Nearly all of level 55-60 I did solo. When I solo now for AAXP, I can kill mobs back to back without stopping to rest...Indefinately. It takes a good CT group to get more xp than I can solo. <br />
<br />
5. AC bonus. This isn't huge, but on average you're gonna take less damage than the other races. It all adds up.<br />
<br />
6. Some may say, &quot;But OMG they have XP penalty!&quot;. Why do you think the XP penalty is there? Because we have the advantage and they have to balance it out somewhere. Also AAXP is the same for everyone, no penalty. Of course, speaking from experience, the xp penalty isn't that big of a deal. Iksar can solo better than any other race so it makes up for it. I will admit though Halflings will definately out level you by a good margin. Even though a halfling cleric friend of mine beat me to 60, but I was 59 so it wasn't a tragedy. We play about the same amount of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
from level 1 - 60 Iksar is the best. Nothing the other races have make up for it. Only play another race if you just really like it or want to roleplay.<br />
<br />
Max your wisdom then put the rest (5?) into stamina. the more health the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've always found it funny that in these discussions of 'which race is better' iksar will point out that the JBB isn't crap and the other races will all say how great the JBB is.<br />
<br />
Then when iksar start kvetching about how unfair it is that they can't use the JBB, iksar praise it as being almost unbalancingly great, and the other raises dismiss it as not being too terribly important.<br />
<br />
Someone's trying to hide something. :P</div></div><hr />

Riiiiight.  Because at 60, our slight wisdom and ac advantage over a Troll makes us so much better than them.  :rolleyes:  A level 60 Troll can do everything an Iksar can do, and more. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I can't believe we don't have a &quot;FAQ&quot; forum.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ok, I'm an iksar Shaman. They are not the best, there is no &quot;best&quot; race.<br />
Now that's out of way let's get to the heart of things.<br />
<br />
It really depends on the type of player you are, if you are a casual player then the 20% exp penalty that Iksars and Trolls get may not be the most practical choice for you. But, if the exp penalty isn't a factor then Iksar is a good choice. No JBB as an Iksar, remember that ! But if you are a casual player like me, you'd probably never see a JBB anyway. <br />
Trolls are excellent, good str, sta, and regen. Not to mention Innoruuk worshipping Trolls can get snare necklace. And yes a 60 Troll can do everything an 60 Iksar can plus more. With the right gear of course. It's true for both races. Faction really isn't an issue anymore with the Moon and Velious. <br />
<br />
Barbarian is an easy choice, there are alot of them, they are blind, blind, blind ! Yeah you get ultravision, but you have to wait 29 levels to get that spell. No way could I use a night blind race after using both Troll and Iksar. <br />
<br />
Ogres are kinda the forgotten ones they are actually quite good, not sure how viable no frontal stun is later on. As an Iksar I get stunned but I can honestly say I've never been stunned to where it costed me my life. I got interrputed and just recasted my spell, no biggie ! Ogres have alot of str,stamina,  which translates to more HP's to canni. Again faction isn't an issue. Believe me regen is a big deal. Saves alot of downtime and you can canni back more mana faster. Some will argue that regen isn't a factor because of Torpor. Well let's look at that..one, Torpor is a lvl 60 spell and two, its damn expensive if you can ever find someone selling it. And camping for a drop of Torpor all I can is good luck ! <br />
Until you get to 60 or get your hands on a Fungi (if you're a Vah forget about Fungi until 51) regen is a factor.<br />
Ogres can use the JBB. <br />
Wisdom means JACK ! Once you hit 24 you'll realize that ! AC/HP's are kings to the Shaman. <br />
For starting points it depends on race<br />
For Troll I would put 20 into sta and 10 into wis or vice versa.<br />
For Ogre I'd put 10 into wis 20 into agility.<br />
For Barbs...(see Troll)<br />
For Iksar, there physical stats suck other than agility...20 into sta, 10 str. <br />
<br />
Don't know much about Vah'Shir so I won't comment on them.<br />
<br />
JBB is a great situational/soloing tool, but I wouldn't base my choice of Shaman race on gear. I won't say the JBB sucks because it doesn't its awesome and if I could wear one I'd try to get one, but I'm not changing my choice because the JBB really doesn't mean much to me. If you can wear it try to get it otherwise don't worry about it.<br />
Play a race you think is cool, because in the end game, strategy, skill, and gear+spells can make the difference between a good shaman and a bad one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hyllus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Go ogre =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Scaleyy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I wasn't trying to insuate that all other races sucked. If you play any race up to 60 then you'll be able to do just fine.<br />
<br />
My point is that when all things are considered the Iksar come out on top. It's why we have the highest xp penalty to counter the benefits.<br />
<br />
And yes the higher AC and WIS does matter. I can wear stuff that other races can't without losing max wis or giving up hps etc...and still keep ac.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I spent about 30 levels perma encumbered unbuffed even with starting points in str (I am a packrat). You can of course buff your str but it gets very tedious doing so all the time.<br />
<br />
If youre going for end game and Iksar then sta, if you're going to smell the flowers on your way, str.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">One consideration I have never seen mentioned, but is worth considering:<br />
<br />
The majority of shamen are barbarians.  When Verant are designing race-specific content then barbs get a great deal more of it than iksar, ogres, or trolls.<br />
<br />
The new smithing stuff is a good example: barbs get a 2nd list of cultural armour, trolls still haven't any armour to make at all.<br />
<br />
You can expect that to be a persistent trend: it makes commercial sense to spend the most time on stuff that is available for the biggest group of players - minorities are always going to get less.</div></div><hr />
