<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, so the crew finally gave BRD a shot last night. I said I'd post my experiences either way so here goes.  The night started off inauspiciously as we dragged my rogue through UM and then after ganking Archadeus I forgot to click the @#$!! discs, so yep, I get to do that tedious dungeon yet again.  After that fiasco, we headed to BRD with our standard crew:<br />
- 60 rogue<br />
- 53 paladin MT<br />
- 53 paladin healer (me)<br />
- 50 paladin offtank<br />
- 51 shadow priest (pure dps)<br />
<br />
Per Mill's advice we decided to try the left side first through the locked shadow door, which we had the rogue pick.  I decided to see what kind of damage the tank was going to tank on the first 5 pull of 54 elites, so I held off on healing immediately which I normally do. 5 secs later the tank is raped and we wipe.  <br />
<br />
After CR, we tried again and on the next pull we were okay but it required perfect coordination as well as pulling our 50 paladin out of the front lines and putting him on heal duty.  With him spamming flash heals and me landing big heals we could keep our MT up, but it was iffy and in subsequent pulls a mistarget on a heal wiped us again.  It was very reminescent of our first time doing hard LDONs in bazaar gear (not pretty).<br />
<br />
After that CR, we decided to head into the main part of the instance where the mobs are much lower, 51-52 elites with smatterings of 49 nonelites.  That was only slightly more difficult than ST and we managed to roam around quite a bit before running into trouble.  One of our biggest problems was level aggro as we were getting adds from all over the place and 8 mobs in camp was pretty common.  Even with 4k AC I couldn't ignore the damage while healtanking the way I could in ST.  <br />
<br />
We managed to do the ring event in the arena and take out some random named, but we came up pretty empty on loot.  It doesn't help that we're stumbling around completely clueless about where to go- any suggestions would be a godsend.  We also experimented with having the priest heal but that resulted in a dead priest near instantaneously due to paladin aggro issues.<br />
<br />
For the future, our 50 paladin is quitting WoW and we'll be replacing him with a 50 druid from a friend's crew.  Once my rogue gets up we'll replace my paladin as well when circumstances permit.  It was a rough start, but that's pretty common whenever we hit a new dungeon for the first time.  The difficulty level was definitely ratcheted up but I don't think it's anything we won't overcome with practice.  <br />
<br />
If you have any additional advice I'm all ears. I'd really like to know where all the stinking loot is- we've been salivating over this place for months and were supremely disappointed so far. Would a random green have been too much to ask? Sheesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My advice Iz? besides doing it for fun, stay the hell out. BRD is probably the worst dungeon I have ever seen for loot. Need to get the shadowforge key for progress to the higher level sections, and to get to the end need to get through the Lyceum, which prety much reqires aoe.<br />
<br />
here is a link with a map, points of interests and quests, pretty useful. I am only going back there to get somone in the guild the dark iron quest.<br />
<br />
http://www.ultimategamers.com/worldofwarcraft/blackrockdepths.html<br />
<br />
<br />
we got stopped cold at number 16, huge room full of hundreds of non-elite, 30 second respawn critters.<br />
<br />
<br />
note, at number 11 on map is the shadowforge key quest mob, you get the quest from the middle spire you run down to get to brd, the middle with all the chains, there is a tomb, as a ghost will see a quest giver for the key. Kill mob at number 11, and then use his hammer(think it is a hammer) at number 19 to get shadowforge key. This key unlocks the bridge allowing you access to higher areas. The bridge lock cannot be picked either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My opinion of my first time in BRD was that loot was absolutely horrendous (in the parts you can get to without the shadowforge key).  Green items that not even as good as Maraudon.  Even the blue items on the loot tables are horrid.<br />
<br />
Please tell me it gets better....<br />
<br />
[EDIT: Hysterical, sorry Mill, glossed over your very first sentence... glad to see we agree lol :)]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">they did say with new number of players limit in dungeons they can put better loot in, I hope so, BRD is a good example of terrible risk/time vs. reward.<br />
<br />
I hear Dire Maul sucks for loot too, the stuff I have been seeing on thott doesn't exactly blow my skirt up.<br />
<br />
mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Iz,<br />
<br />
Get everyone to at least 55 and hit it again. Then hit it some more. BRD is great xp and coin, but it's also an instance that takes several trips to complete. There's good loot too, but you have to get past the Arena or have the Shadowforge Key (which requires going beyond the Arena to obtain) to get to most of the named. The quests are good xp if I remember right. The missing dwarven princess quest has a choice of two or three very nice rings as a reward.<br />
<br />
I suggest 55 because most of the mobs beyond the Arena are of a level closer to the patrols you encountered on The Dark Iron Highway (that area you found after picking the locked door). Felwood, Burning Steps, Winterspring, and Western Plaguelands all have quests that can get you through the 50-55 stretch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">they did say with new number of players limit in dungeons they can put better loot in, I hope so, BRD is a good example of terrible risk/time vs. reward.<br />

Yeah, we're doind Dire Maul mostly to get to the vendor with the Mooncloth Robe pattern for my wife's enchanting/tailoring priest.  50g min bid in AH for a pattern that costs 4g if you can get to it hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DM drops aren't that bad, the king drops a nice 2hand sword 50ish dps.  I am just looking to pick up a Felcloth Cap from the eastern side of DM.  Also heard theres a rogue specific belt that drops somewhere also?  Also BRD isn't that bad for drops.  Still up to this date, I have not done a full BRD run once but whenever we do Molten Core, we always kill Ambassador Flamelash and the 7 dwarfs on the way.  I don't think we will anymore now with the MC discovery quest, so no ghostshroud for me and Gandling is a bastard with dropping Shadowcraft Cap.  I think the hardest part is the Lyceum where if you don't have AE, chances are you won't succeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My account runs out on April and I won't be renewing. Nor will I be playing any other MMORPG's.  <br />

To all the current and old posters - this board has been a source of inspiration and humour for over four years. (Has it REALLY been that long? Wow!)  <br />
<br />
I may stop by periodically to check up on EQ or WoW, heck, maybe even post, but for the moment and foreseeable future, I'll be spending my recreation dollar and time on other pursuits.<br />
<br />
I was going to post more, but the stripper is stirring and I'm feeling frisky...</div></div><hr />

But you HAVE to keep moving.  and pulling is a bad idea because of the shooters. Much better to move to them and swamp the shooters with the ae as well.<br />

I was just mowing through them with the thief and once the warrior got over his fear of AE things went alot better with him cleaving up a storm.<br />
<br />
BRD is alot of fun, to me at least. The fights are intresting and the loot hasnt been THAT bad. (Just wish the general would drop the thrash blade trinket.. grr.) And the Bartender best drop that barmans shanker soon or I will just have to kill him again.. and again.. And again.. And again.<br />

Pretty much the best warrior weapon out there.  Incredible for rogues, shamans, and paladins too.</div></div><hr />

Ironfoe right up there with Mass of McGowan for wish list.</div></div><hr />

Just make sure you stop by the Grey on occasion to say hello. :)<br />
<br />
As for BRD, it sounds like we need to farm ST/MR/ZF some more to get our average level up.  A few more pieces of gear probably wouldn't hurt either but I think it's mostly a levels thing.  I'll have to study that map of BRD to figure out where anything is.  For those of you that have found good loot, how long does it take to clear back to the mobs that drop it? Please tell me this isn't a 4 hour excursion... bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">with a 5 man group and fairly low dps from what it sounds like, it will take you several hours in my opinion. I havent made it past the lyceum, killed everything else and not squat for decent loot, maybe it is all with the emperor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you know exactly where you're going you can do all of BRD in one 5-6 hour marathon session. When I go in with guildies we try to keep it to one to two hour chunks with specific targets &amp; quests in mind. You can complete the Key quest, the Heart of the Mountain quest, and Lord Incendius in about 90 minutes (all close to each other). You can do General, Golem Lord, and Barroom in just under two hours (assuming you have the key). Emperor takes about three hours. Maybe you could do it in 2 if the entire group is 60 and you haul ass skipping any unnessary encounters. Killing the named giant adds 30-45 minutes to any trip because you almost have to clear through 30 elite dwarves and elementals to get back to him. Clearing down to the quest prisoners adds 15-20 minutes. More if you need to kill the lady for the prison key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I kind of like BRD.  It takes some getting used to, but I find it fun because it's one of the few places where priests can MC effectively.  (That and throwing stinky alliance off the center rock into the lava on the way down.)<br />
<br />
For Iz, I think your level is probably a little low to be hitting BRD.  What I mean by that is, you're high enough to do some parts near the entrance, but you won't access much of the desirable loot till much deeper.<br />
<br />
Have you guys had your fill of Zul'Farrak and Sunken Temple?  I agree with the poster above that you need 55 to hit BRD and go deep in and get some loot.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, pretty sick of MR/ZF even though that's where we're headed next to drag my rogue through.  ST we could probably stand to farm a bit more, but the amount of trash that needs to be cleared there makes it so tedious.  I guess we'll wait until everyone is 55+ and try again.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the great feedback.</div></div><hr />

Maybe when we get to the end of BRD it will be better, but seriously, the loot is horrid.<br />
<br />
The 45 minutes you mention to get to the Golem Lord is NOT worth it.  One blue 1h mace on his loot table that is not that good and the rest are green items.  I don't think anyone in my guild even got an upgrade yet in BRD, it's all &quot;grats disenchant&quot; and such.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, even at 60, I just got an upgrae in ZF of all places.  Blue polearm dropped at the end of the divino-matic rod quest.  And I still wear the Big Bad Pauldrons from ZF as well.  <br />
<br />
So loot progression and instance progression are really messed up I think.<br />
<br />
Someone tried to bribe me to go to Dire Maul with a pickup group saying that good warrior gear drops there... any truth to this?  Only blue item I recall from there so far is was a crossbow, but we didn't get too far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The golem lord drops more than one blue item, maybe you were looking at the wrong mob? He drops some blue leather pants, Druidish I think, and a real nice trinket for the healing classes, +20 to heals and an effect that restores a little mana when activated. I've only really done Dire Maul's first instance so far, I recall at least an item or two going to the warrior in the group. So weapons and/or plate drops. I am unsure about the 2nd 2 instances not having gone there yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Macheras,<br />
<br />
Yeah, we usually skip the Golem Lord unless somebody needs the bit of Windsor's Lost Information that he drops.<br />
<br />
Does the Horde have many quests in BRD? The Alliance has several including the Onyxia key series. Quests are the only reasons I'm ever in there anymore.<br />
<br />
I've only spent about two hours in Dire Maul, so I don't know how good the warrior drops are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There's no dungeon between ST and BRD correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">oh yeah by the way the plans for the repair robot are at the golem lord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Oh, I may be thinking of a different mob.  He is some large mob that is down a path where you have to fight about 10 or so groups of 5 elite dwarves (priest, officer, some others).  I thought this is who you meant.  When I looked him up, his only blue drop was a 1h mace... maybe I typed in the wrong name not sure.  I DO know that the drop he had for us was some lame green item.<br />
<br />
Kolmirg,<br />
Yeah, Horde has a ton of quests in BRD... I have 6 in my quest log right now and I'm not sure I have them all.  Some are for the stuff just outside of the instance too.  This will also probably be the only reason we complete BRD is to get the quests done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Oh! You meant the giant at the end of the Darkiron Highway. Yeah that guy is a pain. He drops some decent plate legs, but the only reason to mess with him is for the Black Dragonflight Molt quest.<br />

No, there is no instance between ST and BRD.</div></div><hr />

Then don't? There are more than enough quests in Felwood, Winterspring, Un'Goro Crater, Western Plaguelands and The Burning Steppes to close the gap. Just avoid any quest that asks you to collect samples of Un'Goro soil. Worst. Series. Ever.</div></div><hr />

I'm not talking about exping, I'm talking about farming for gear with my crew. I do all my solo exping through grinding- if I happen to stumble across a kill/collect quest I take it but I don't go out of my way looking for them.  If there's a faster way to level than using a paladin on a second box as heal/buff/rez bot for a rogue I haven't discovered it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What is MR?  An Alliance instance?<br />
<br />
I dunno, I thinking questing from 50-60, if done at the right times can produce upgrades, at least in terms of weapons.  I'm level 60 and I haven't even stepped foot in ST yet.  Grinding/questing also produces money which produces AH upgrades.<br />
<br />
I guess I know that I've boycotted ZF a million times because I hate that place so much.  Not sure if I'll ever hit ST (heard there is a lot of cloth drops there, not sure) and I'm not looking forward to ever doing BRD again.  I don't need to xp anymore for quests obviously so it's just not worth it :).<br />
<br />
Dont grind through instances if you don't enjoy it!  Sounds like the &quot;must raid to get gear&quot; EQ attitude hehe.  I have my share of blue instance gear, but I also have my share of blue AH gear and green drops that are pretty darn nice.</div></div><hr />

All a matter of perspective.  For hunters, Dire Maul is by far the best of the current instances as far as risk/reward.  There are a TON of excellent 2h weapons and high agi and +crit % mail armor just made for hunters.   Some links below:<br />

Eaglehorn Long Bow - http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?i=36112 Better than a Hurricane<br />
Stoneshatter - http://www.thottbot.com/?i=35912<br />

Yeah, the rogues are belly aching, surprise, because of the lack of high end leather and 1h weps.  Well, they still have plenty of other places to go.  Just leave DM to the hunters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
where exactly? As a mace rogue, I am doomed forever with a level 48 mace, literally I will probably never upgrade. The high end rogue armor is junk, stupid junk, super agility, blah, that is why I beat agility rogues senseless.<br />
<br />
Cannot remember when I had an item upgrade actually, got some rogue shoulders from strath, they sit in my bank.</div></div><hr />

I don't get upgrades very often anymore either, but at least they exist for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">In truth I was trolling a bit when I made my comments, just to get a reaction.  :)  No first hand info on the quality of rogue drops at the high end, so I will take your word for it.  Up until DM, there was little good hunter gear also, mostly Shaman mail items with little agi.  Thanks for the info, and I'm with Macheras, we don't need to buff Millman.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Using the level 37 shoulders from RFD over the high end set shoulders from strath hehe. There is two maces I would consider an upgrade, ironfoe, an extremely rare epic off the boss dude in BRD which no one in their right mind wants to run, and an extremely rare world drop called mass of mcgowan. Never seen either one on a player, but see tons of rogues running around with deathstriker(felstriker now), must be some way of getting that more often.<br />
<br />
Just pisses me off that once again it will be zergling guilds getting the super gear, and then when the pvp system comes out, will be even more at a disadvantage, blah. reward hard work and skill, not numbers.</div></div><hr />
