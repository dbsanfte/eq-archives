<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe I'm completely off my rocker here, but I'm wondering if some of the other trials wouldn't be easier for shamans to complete?  Maybe something that's not quite so time-restricted, and doesn't rely so heavily on massive DPS.  There are six trials ... and I only ever hear about execution.<br />
<br />
Just curious to see if anybody else has started down this path.  I'm also hoping that someone has an idea of a good trial to start on.  I'm thinking about Lashing, since the critters don't appear to hit quite as hard, and I'm not seeing evidence of a time limit...  But I haven't done any trials since a group of friends tried each one once, during the first week of pop when we had no idea what they did.  ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input.  With any luck we can find some way to get thru other than 50 some tries, or the help of folks who I can't convince to leave PoV and PoS...</div></div><hr />

The Trial of Execution is perfectly doable with a shaman in the group.  You just need to break your 'everything must be slowed' mentality.  I've been part of 8 successful trials as a shaman, twice because people actually sent me a tell asking me to come.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, you can contribute excellent DPS to a single target using our cold-based DDs.  You can also contribute excellent multi-target damage using our rain spells.  Since you have good mana regen, you can usually chain cast thru most of the waves and still have mana to slow the end guy.  And our pet, when fully buffed and armed, is a very nice DPS addition.<br />
<br />
My strategy is simple.  I load the following spells:<br />
Fast Heal<br />
Malo<br />
Turgurs<br />
Torrent of Poison<br />
Summon Companion<br />
Disinfecting Aura (for curing slows)<br />
Canni IV<br />
Torpor<br />
<br />
Once I get in, I immediately cast Summon Companion, park him, and mem Ice Strike.<br />
<br />
As soon as the first wave pops, I assist the MT, send in dogdog, cast Torrent of Poison, cast Ice Strike, cast Torrent of Poison.  By this time, I have done roughly 1500 damage to the main target, plus roughly 800 damage to all other targets.  This is assuming some resists, since max potential is 540 + 675 + 540 to primary, and 540 + 540 to all others.  A bad round of resists can drop your damage, of course.<br />
<br />
Once the first mob dies, I usually will hit one or two more Torrents, drop a DD if we are running slow (like a named), do a quick heal/cure as needed, and make mana.  I have Canni V, which is awesome, but even chain casting Canni IV will generate good mana.  Be sure to send in dogdog on each target (and on the RIGHT target).<br />
<br />
I also use a horse to maximize mana regen.<br />
<br />
In the middle of the last wave, I get in position and prepare to slow the bad guy.  Let the tank get agro, malo, hope your chanter is willing to land tash, then get turgurs in.  Focus on helping your healer keep the main tank alive.  Oh, and send in dogdog FROM THE REAR.  =)<br />
<br />
I've done this with many combinations of players.  The core group consists of:<br />
Warrior (defensive helps a ton on final guy)<br />
Cleric (healing against last guy can be tough on druids, really tough on shaman)<br />
Enchanter (chain-stunning PBAE, agro management on last guy, and tash on last guy)<br />
Shaman (see above)<br />
<br />
I've done this with the last two slots being filled by melee, and by dresses, and by combinations.  Best/easiest is two wizards, they have scary damage for the waves.  But literally any other two classes will work.<br />
<br />
Probably the most important thing is for the group to stay focused on one strategy, and retry without a change in strategy if you fail.  Don't change anything, adjust your tactics to implement the strategy.  Many groups fail repeatedly because they are always tweaking the group, or the strat, or the style, or something.  Each person should know their class well enough to adjust their tactics to make this strat work.<br />
<br />
If you can get a mage for the last slot, or at least for the prep, make sure to get pets and dresses loaded up with damage increasers (haste and weapons for pets, +DD for casters) and mod rods.<br />
<br />
The Trial of Execution is easily beatable, WITH a shaman in the group, and has the distinction of being the easiest to survive.  Rarely does anyone die in the Trial of Execution.</div></div><hr />
