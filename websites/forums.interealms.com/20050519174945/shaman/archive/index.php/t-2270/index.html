<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Santai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if a 60 shaman could do this. My friend is a 60 shaman on the Karana server and he owes me a PL =P.<br />
<br />
<br />
He has all his spells like Malo, Torpor, Khura's Focusing e.t.c. I think he has 255 wis. He has no fungi though. I do know he has Elder status.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks just wondering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not really sure those two monks can be slowed at all. Unslowed my guess would be no. Slowed, perhaps.<br />
<br />
Shrack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Santai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is only 1 mob wich drops the robe... Brother Zephyll in Rathe Mtn's. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone actually tried it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Brother Zephyll is not even close to being soloable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1) Leave Brother Qwinn (South Karana) alone. He doesn't drop the robe anyway.<br />
<br />
2) No you can't solo Zephyl, even if you gave him a cracked staff or lantern.<br />
<br />
3) But if you do TRY, please post and I'll make a toon on your server to come watch. I'm betting you'll last 18 seconds at most.<br />
<br />
4) I believe the proper &quot;L337&quot; term would be ' PFWNG'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>XmaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Never can you solo that guy he is HIGHLY HIGHLY MR and triple hits for 300's goodluck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">read this guide how to kill him, you have ZERO chance to solo it, event GM make him 0% MR yous till have ZERO chance<br />
<br />
http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=618.topic<br />
<br />
as the guide say, you need  You will need 2 groups of mid 50s, or one group 60 elite group, that is close to ToV force;<br />
also  that guide recommend warrior use riposete disc instead of defensive, hope you understand why use riposete disc instead of defensive before try</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A monk in my guild looted the robe off of Qwinn after we killed him.<br />
<br />
Both monks are unslowable or damn near.  Disease slow or otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">actually, the robe once used to be a 100% drop off both the guildmaster monks in SK and RM. That got changed early this year though, and it's about 1/8 or 1/10 drop now.<br />
<br />
On the topic at hand: NO CLASS will ever be able to solo one of these, 100% MR, 354-hitting, quadding (unless you hand them a 2hb, but still not sure if they would still equip it), 32kHP bastages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When i first  hit 50  back in fall 99 i tried to join the big guild raids on the server but they were always a close knit guild and my bossy personailty kinda clashed, so i said *f* it and started putting together my own FG raids and other kinds of raids jut to have fun.<br />
<br />
One of the raids i orchestrated was a brother zephyl raid becuase there were actually dozens of people waiting on Hasten bootstrutter to pop.   Brother zephyl is the PH for Hasten but he is supposed to despawn and hasten then pops. Well  for some reason he never was despawning and there was tons of mule corpses strewn all over and with np patch due any time soon lots of people were screwed .<br />
<br />
Anyway i posted on the server board that everyone on Erollisi Marr was welcome to help kill Brother zephyl. from lv 15 to lv 50. the idea was either to kill brother Z or get so many people in Rathe Mountains the zone itself would crash, resettting the spawn (the GM refused to despawn Zephyl)<br />
<br />
That day 156 people showd up in RM to kill brother Z. I thought for sure the zone would crash, but it didnt. we pulled  Zephyl and he basically kicked 156 peoples ass. we did manage to get him to half life but it just wasnt to be.<br />
<br />
Months later during Kunark i read on the BOTS board that they had killed brother zephyl and he dropped a robe of the lost circle. well my guild at the time had a few monks working on the whistling fists robe and we decided to get 15 together and show that turkey who was boss.<br />
we killed him very easily and farmed quite a few robes that day.<br />
<br />
Anyway long story short, its impossible to kill him solo. a fully buffed  60 warrior rogue and 2 clerics could probably take him out now no sweat .<br />
<br />
Brother Zephyl is 100% MR he quads 300s if you dont hand him a 2hander and is fast as sow speed. but he is 32k hp and he can be gimped by handing him a 2hand weapon so he issnt that hard but def not soloable. <br />
<br />
What id like to know is has anyone soloed Lt Dagarok? I tried to solo him a few weeks ago but  he kicked my ass and was unslowable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">52 shaman (me) buffed 60 warrior in Paralax (ex-karana guild), 60 cleric 2x 60wizzies and 60 chanter managed to finally kill him. WArrior was at 47 HP when last CH hit and then the cleric went oom and my mini-heal was making up for the sneeze Bro Z was kicking out. Second time they managed it.<br />
<br />
Too MR to solo, and also summons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can't hand him 2 hander now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Uh, that 2 hander thing hasn't worked for quite a while.</div></div><hr />
