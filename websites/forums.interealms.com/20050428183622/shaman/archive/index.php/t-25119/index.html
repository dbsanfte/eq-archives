<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know how to make polls, but if someone does, I am extremely curious of the following:<br />
<br />
How many people that are still playing EQ are:<br />
a.) raiding in GoD and beyond (Anguish?).<br />
b.) raiding and experiencing content at least as far as PoTime.<br />
c.) raiding in EP's.<br />
d.) in casual raiding guilds (lower tier PoP, Ssra, BoT towers, etc.).<br />
e.) non-raiders, no EP access, no KT access.<br />
<br />
My feelings are, based on most that have posted noisily against WoW, that most folks still playing EQ fall into a and b mostly with some c thrown in.  The rest that are not privy to those zones are the ones that couldn't stand it anymore and have thrown in the towel.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Feel free to turn into a poll if you have the expertise that I do not possess.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I have to admit, it's tough to do even two EQ days because I'm having so much fun in WoW.  (if it wasn't for the guildies in EQ I'd probably have cancelled my account already)</div></div><hr />
