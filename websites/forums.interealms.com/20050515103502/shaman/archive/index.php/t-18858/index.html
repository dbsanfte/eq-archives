Ok I bought the aug yesterday and today I did some parsing.  What I discovered is that like most focus effects, the actual benefit is random.  Instead of being a set 10% extension, it is actually a random 1-10% extension.  This is what happens when used with short duration dots:<br />
<br />
Bane is extended from 6 ticks to 7 ticks every time.<br />
Blood of Saryrn is extended from 8 ticsk to 9 ticks every time.<br />
<br />
I only had the patience to run through two breaths of ultor:<br />
<br />
The first lasted 166 seconds, a 10 second (6.4%) increase.<br />
The second lasted 169 seconds, a 13 second (8.3%) increase.<br />
<br />
This means you can expect 1-3 extra ticks of breath of ultor.<br />
<br />
I had similar results for turgur's.  All my of my tests were extended randomly for up to 30 seconds (small parse size, so you might hit the full 39 second extension with more trials).  This means you can expect an extra 1-6 ticks off of turgur's.<br />
<br />
All-in-all a good aug, but mainly for the extra tick on bane and blood.  If anyone has some results for the higher tier detrimental extenders (timeburn or chronoburn), it would be much appreciated if you did some similar testing for comparison - it only takes an hour or two.<br />
<br />
edit:  added some of my parse data as an attachment</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suspected that it was a random 1-10% like most other focus items, but thank for the confirmation.</div></div><hr />

What do you mean &quot;takes a tick off&quot;?  I have never heard anyone say anything like that about BA4.  All BA4 does is make each tick hit 1-20% harder, and has no effect at all on the duration.  Burning Affliction IV (&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3507&amp;source=Live&quot;)<br />
<br />
Anyways, every test I ran today was done with a BA4 aug in addition to the ET4 aug, so these are the results you will see with both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that the calculation for Extended Torment happens first and determines if there will be an extra tick(s), then once that is determined Burning Affliction will determine the amount of extra damage the tick will do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ya that aug is nice. I used it on my Necro till I got Corn's shoulders (Time burn)..working on it for the shaman at the moment. You won't be disappointed thats for sure with it. An extra tic on Bane and BOS is incredible, mana free, dmg.<br />
