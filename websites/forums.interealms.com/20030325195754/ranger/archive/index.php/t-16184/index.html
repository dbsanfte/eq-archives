<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if my guild gets flags for here from the quest in PoN if we could exp. here.<br />
<br />
We are gonna try the hedge quest soon.  I don't think we'll have any trouble finishing it.  I've just not heard about exp. groups here, like I have about Plane of Storms and the like.<br />
<br />
We are not a powerful guild by any standards.  We have about 100 people active, but we are more of a family guild than a raiding quild.  We can kill Vindi and Klandicar, but that's about as tough as we go.  Average guild lvl is 58, but there are 45, 60+ peeps, just not all on at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>xlurkerx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haven't exped personally, but raided Terris a few times.<br />
<br />
From what I hear, the mobs are unslowable so they take like 2 groups to take down, so probably not good for exp groups. Raid only zone basically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After getting our hedge flags, we went and cleared to Terris Thule with a single group... we were all at least 61 with the highest at 63? maybe.... its been a while, but we had<br />
<br />
61 Ranger<br />
Enchanter<br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Druid<br />
Magican<br />
<br />
All of the mobs except Terris Thule con'd even or yellow to me.  The ones on horseback were snareable, I don't remember any being slowable or mez'able, just the enchanter kiting the adds around since we tended to get 2 at a time.<br />
<br />
I think for clearing from the gates to Terris Thule I earned around 1 yellow of experience in 61, or it might have been 62.  By the time we reached Terris Thule, half the mobs behind us had respawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thicket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did an exp group there once from memory was <br />
65 ranger <br />
65 cleric<br />
63 monk<br />
65 shammie<br />
61 wizzy<br />
65 druid<br />
<br />
We did fine I was the tank.  Most stuff cant be slowed there.  Exp is not to bad and etheral parch can drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Voronwë Nimbrethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i think xp there is not so great personally.  harmony pulling the mobs is extremely easy though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xaem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, the mobs' aggro range is about equal to the harmony range, so oftentimes you will find yourself pulling doubles.  XP is pretty good if you got a good tank, like ~2% per mob, I was in a group there w/ a druid healer awhile back and XP was pretty good.  I wasnt a big fan of training around unsnarable mobs though, because oftentimes they would aggro before harmony finished casting.  They come in pairs of twos, fyi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">as for the pulling, you can either:<br />
1. use &quot;aggro distance pulling&quot; (same trick as for single pull the wurms in ToV HoT). just walk step by step until one mob starts running to you. mobs wont add (you must have zero lag).<br />
2. use a focus extended range and cast harmony, then u can pull with an arrow or a spell.<br />
<br />
sustainer of nightmares are lvl 61-62 unsnarable, unslowable<br />
sentry of nightmare are lvl 63-64, snarable, dunno if slowable (i think not)<br />
they hit for 600ish, have abouth 20k hp i think<br />
can drop ether parch and components for trade skills<br />
<br />
xp isnt great considering risk vs reward, mainly because of their unslowability</div></div><hr />
