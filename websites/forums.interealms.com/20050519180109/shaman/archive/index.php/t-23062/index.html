<br />
Discordant Malaise <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Spell Duration by 30% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Min Duration(24.00 sec) <br />
4:  Limit: Effect(Magic Resist allowed) <br />
5:  Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
<br />
Now if it was truely working like this, we would see increased duration in our bane line as well as our slow, root, malos, and cripple.  However, i thought that this focus only worked on malos type spells.  Does anyone have any first hand experience with this focus effect?? Does it extend dots and debuffs? or just malos.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would also like to know if there is a bane equivalent to discordant venom (increase poison dots by 45%) or do we get stuck with the overpowering might of discordant plague (increase disease dots by 45%).<br />
assuming we can afford to swap slots for all these retarded specialised foci that is.<br />
Breaking everything down by beneficial/detrimental and by single spell type makes life hardest for the non specialist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lafak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">discordant energy is the magic dot focus.  It adds 45% just like kelekdrix shoulders does to disease spells, and noq cloak adds to poison spells.  Anyone with first-hand experience with discordant malaise test it out yet?</div></div><hr />

No you wouldn't.  Its working just like it says.  It works on spells that have the effect of changing Magic Resist, ie Malos and Tash lines.  It does not say that it works on spells that are on the resist of Magic.<br />
<br />
There is a difference between:<br />
Limit: Effect(Magic Resist allowed) <br />
and<br />
Limit: Resist(Magic allowed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks lafak, i was looking at the spell discordant energy instead of the focus in my search</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What Jaradis said:<br />
<br />
Key being: (Magic Resist allowed)<br />
<br />
For us it's Malo line.<br />
<br />
Nothing I really care about myself. Fluff focus just like Discordant Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know.. it's pretty damn gay isn't it Aruman.  Consolidate all of that into a nice discordant detrimental extension and now we are talking.</div></div><hr />
