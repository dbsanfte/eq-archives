<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm heading off on a business trip and will be bringing my laptop with me. It's a high end laptop, p4, 1gig ram, 64mb video card.  I've played around a bit with running 2 eq sessions in window mode, but I've had a little difficulty with toggling and the refresh of one of the windows(it's just one session that seems to have problems refreshing).  I plan on solo'ing, but I have a cleric on the 2nd account I'd like to have available for a buffs/rez if needed.  Does anyone have any tips for running 2 sessions on 1 pc?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've run shm/ench off the same PC, though the ench was pretty much the occasional mez and buffs.  sometimes when I try to alt-tab between the two it takes a minute for the video to catch up so I couldn't do anything on either acct for a few seconds, but that cleared up.  My best advice is focus as much as you can on one account and that should minimize problems with multitasking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you get 2 accounts to run by just starting up EQ x 2 or did you have to install EQ in 2 locations and then start it with two sets of files?<br />
<br />
I did some reading about EQ windows but never tried it because it was a clear violation of the EULA.   I would personaly be interested in a second account that I could use for a cleric rezer and an enchanter trade skill mule.  I don't realy care if I can play them both as a duo...  only that I can get both accounts on at the same time for buffing / tradeing items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I usually do 2 of my 3 accounts on my computer at once. The shaman is the main foreground guy and I have an enchanter as backup. I usually pull with shaman slow, root, sic dogdog on it, start epic, alt-tab to enchanter, have enchanter run up next to it and tash, thereby getting bonked and having enchanter pet get into the fight. Enchanter then plays junior wizard the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
The two pets buffed are actually pretty good, they can tank trash mobs in PoN without much trouble. <br />
<br />
I have a 1ghz computer with 640mb meg of ram and a GeForce2 card. So I'm not super powered by today's standards. I do have a 21&quot; monitor though, that helps a lot.<br />
<br />
I use eqwindows from www.eqwindows so I didn't need 2 installations or anything. I tried doing it using EQs built in alt-tab ability but had no luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you not using eqwindows, use it.  It handles multiple eq sessions much better than the current EQ client does<br />
      www.eqwindows.com<br />
<br />
Turn your EQ resolution down to 800x600 or less (the samllest you can stand), turn off all the fancy graphics...basically tune EQ for its lowest possible settings. <br />
  <br />
For the screen you will be using the least (the cleric I'd guess) set a viewport to scale the graphically intensive portion of the screen even smaller, and always look at the gound.<br />
 <br />
 Doing these things you should be fine to run them both at the same time and alt-tab without any major pause.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What everyone else said (use EQW, turn down all your graphic options) and also I'd recomend installing two copies of EQ if you have the space.  I personally don't do this, but from everything I've read over at EQW on how to best run two characters at once on one computer, this can help with refresh problems since two different instances of EQ won't be fighting to acces the same file at the same time.  Instead, if you install two copies in seperate directories and open one character through each copy, there should be a lot less cases of both screens wanting to access the same file at the same time, and that should equate to better performance.  But since I've never tried this myself, you mileage my vary :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When running 2 EQW's there are two main things you need to be aware of: CPU usage and Memory usage. <br />
Ideally you reduce both as much as possible so that you don't lag horribly or crash.<br />
<br />
There are many, many good ways to run 2 EQW's better on the EQW forums. But here are the main ones.<br />
<br />
Turn off all SoL models (except your model and horses IF you own a horse)<br />
Disable sound PROPERLY. This means making an empty text file in your EQ directory called &quot;nosound.txt&quot;. Turning off sound in the options menu doesn't fully stop EQ from wasting CPU time generating the sounds. Make that file and it will.<br />
Get a memory defragger like Memturbo. This can help once you get lots of memory leaks/fragmentation from zoning lots. Can save you a reboot. Or not!<br />
Yes turn off all particle effects, dynamic lighting, etc etc.<br />
Turn down clip plane on the chars not pulling. Also turn off PC names and NPC names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been using EQW for over a year, and I don't have an uber system. I'm running 2 toons off of a p2 450 with 512 meg ram and a geforce2 with 64 meg of ram. I have all models off besides horses, and wood elves since my druid rides the one horse I have atm. All spell effects are off, particle affects, video is tweaked etc etc. I do use 1024xwhatever for resolution. I don't have 2 copies of eq loaded. I do however have a dsl modem. <br />
Hopefully when I figure out how to get my dsl router working I can use my new computer (p4 2.4gig, 512ddr, 64 meg geforce2) up and running and not have to worry about it. I will however continue to use eqw even if I only have 1 acct per computer just so I can access other programs better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">one thing that REALLY helps ( besides turing everything off ) is installing EQ into a different hard drive. its amazing how much faster it works that way. Also, just turning off sound on one ACC will greatly improve performance.<br />
<br />
here are a few tips<br />
<br />
dont zone at the same time unless you have to<br />
<br />
hotkeys are your friends =)<br />
<br />
try to focus on one acc and run the other off of hotkeys. it just makes things so much easier then alt tabbing all the time.<br />
<br />
put the windows on top of eachother, this REALLY helps with video lag. example. if you're using to say 1024x768 run the 2nd account at 800x600 and place it underneath your first, but running both in the same res works just fine too, just make sure they are directly on top of eachother.<br />
<br />
BTW my PC is far from state of the art. 550 amd geforce 2 with 512 megs of ram.<br />
<br />
I used to do this to PL my many... many... toons with a friends druid. ( then I found my shaman and quit making new chars =D ) I rarely run two accs now unless I need a transfer done and no one I know is on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fajja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">New to the boards..so heya :)<br />
<br />
Ok I have followed your advice and even got everthing to load, BUT I can't get out of EQW. <br />
I tried alt + enter, alt + shift + r, and ctrl + alt + s.<br />
I loaded my first account through normal log on, windowed out, then loaded second account through EQW.  <br />
It loaded fine and got my character loaded. I could not get back to windows from EQW. <br />
Well actually I could see the window but the mouse would not release.<br />
I was stuck until I camped out .<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">mouse release hotkey is ctrl-alt-R ;)<br />
<br />
With a p4 2.6, 512mb ram, and a g4 ti-4600, I can run 2 windows pretty well, with about 2/3 of the new models on for each window.  I run in 1024x768.  I run them from 2 separate locations (just copy and paste) so that I can have sound on in one, have different settings, etc..  My general use now is to have a bazaar mule up 24/7 in one window while playing my shaman in the other - when I get enough cash to outfit my SK in full cultural, I'll start 2boxing again :)  I can run both windows with all new models on, but zone times can get long that way - especially after my computer's been on a while.  Another 512 stick of memory and maybe a copy of MemTurbo should fix that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fajja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Schpleef, that worked thanks!<br />
<br />
New problem  :D <br />
I loaded EQW and had the character up.<br />
Got out of EQW and loaded 2nd account through traditional log in.<br />
Got second character up. Started a trade with my characters.<br />
Use windows to get out of traditional log in character &amp; shrunk screen.<br />
Tried to maximize EQW screen to get back in and finish trade.<br />
EQW expanded but all it showed was my normal back drop, no EQ?!?<br />
After giving it time and trying a couple of times, I windowed back into the traditional log in and that character.  <br />
To my suprise I could see the EQW character sitting there waiting, thought he would be gone or LD.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Thanks............</div></div><hr />

<br />
as far as I konw EQW cannot be switched from windowed mode to full screen. I always used two copies of EQW ( from different diectories ) I never liked SOEs window mode. it was more laggy for me and it REALLY messed up my gamma settings  :p. JSD did a great job with EQW and im glad SOE has undone all the bannings from using EQW. some people just cant afford to get two PCs to dual box =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm curious if anyone else has this issue:<br />

When I swap (eqwindows) from Csin to Csinner (25 SK) I find that the SK has changed targets to himself...even if he was melee'ing at the time.<br />
<br />
Same thing happens to Csin if I swap windows...anyone have any idea what causes this?</div></div><hr />

That's got to be caused by hitting ALT - TAB <br />
<br />
TAB being used to toggle targets from the current MoB you're targetting, to yourself, and back again.  <br />
<br />
No idea how to avoid it though :/<br />
<br />
Maybe just make sure you hold down ALT a bit longer befor doing it? Or hitting the windows key first?<br />

Remap the TAB key in EQ?  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">For the accidental hitting of tab, just use the window switch hotkey instead of alt-tab:  ctrl-shift-S.<br />

now I just used the windowed EQ client X 2. I hated that EQWindows required that you turn off all models, spell effects, sound... let's see, the game already is pretty poor in graphics, lets reduce those and take everything else out while we're at it.... <br />
??????????????????<br />
Sony's windowed version is super-laggy when running two windows, and I constantly lose mouse control when switching between two of Sony's windows.  EQW doesn't force you to lower settings,  it actually runs more efficiently and allows you to run eq with higher settings.  It sounds to me like you need serious upgrades and/or a new computer, and are blaming EQW for this fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I run EQW, dual p3 1 gigs,1 gig of ram, 128 video card. one account all models on other half models on with no sound. I still find I have to turn off names and such every now again again to help out a bit.<br />
<br />
The thing about EQW, their switch window mode and mouse release are all you need.<br />
Cntr + Alt + X<br />
Cntr + Alt + Y<br />
Or whatever they are set at... this is what I did, rather than hitting that every time, get yourself a Intell-mouse with the 2 side buttons and affix EQW's cntr alt etc to them. Then its just a click of 2 seldom used buttons on your mouse. That takes care of the alt tab issue. You do have to change your EQW.ini to a new command for switching windows and releasing the mouse. But thats easy to do. Then open up your mouse manager program and assign the same 2 new commands to the 2 side mouse buttons. Makes 2 boxing on one PC a whole lot easier.<br />
<br />
Also on the issue of running 2 accounts on only one install. From what ive heard this is really bad to do, its putting twice the work on your hard drive partitian and could fry it. Its best to have 2 different installs on 2 different partitians.  Then just set up to desktop icon shortcuts with one labeled Main account and Secondary account.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
