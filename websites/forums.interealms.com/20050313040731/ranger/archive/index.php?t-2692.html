<br />
my friend saw the stream of arrows and almost fainted.<br />
<br />
what a blast!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm... so, three weeks work can apparently be accomplished by a sleepy coder clicking off the wrong tag...<br />
<br />
I know, it was a bit out there, but I noticed I was able to hit stuff significantly above/below me yesterday, in addition to the whole range thing, and I just find it funny that they say this and then scrooge it up three weeks later :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malevant Faeshadow</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And yes, I had a blast with it.  My problem is I have depth perception problems in my Tolan's Helm, so was having trouble figuring out if that timeless golem was 40 feet away, or 400, you see /whistle</div></div><hr />

Sun revs in the Grey took me an average of 17 seconds to drop.   With their ~15k hp, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lasalle Stormreaver</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The interesting thing is that I really enjoyed being able to shoot mobs as a bow + arrow are intended to shoot-- vertically through horizontally.  I hope that this part isn't &quot;fixed&quot;-- and I thought the innoruk machine gun was fookin hilarious!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyrthor</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday, if you shot at something that was out of range, or too far above or below you, you would get the message about being unable to hit......but the arrow would shoot anyway.<br />
<br />
And it *could* hit the target.<br />
<br />
And it *didn't* grey out your range attack button.<br />
<br />
So, if you had a monster targetted that you should NOT have been able to hit with an arrow, you could shoot it as fast as your little finger could bang on your range attack button.  I was averaging 600-800 DPS on sun revenants in the grey.<br />
<br />
Of course, this should now be fixed, so no more laser beam of death.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there was a one-night only bug in the last patch that made bow delay zero if the target was too high/too low, BUT you would still shoot and possibly hit the target.<br />
<br />
I was able to empty my fleeting quivver in, oh, 20 seconds or so, assuming the mob lived that long.  (using a raincaller)<br />
<br />
everyone that discovered it knew it was a bug and an exploit, but it was soo fun to watch that we couldn't help it.  ;o)<br />
<br />
which is why i just hit lowbie green mobs for fun, not exp or profit.<br />
<br />
i must say that i was Sooooo tempted to target the scion from the top of the spires.  i didn't, but i was very tempted.</div></div><hr />

Was insanely fun.  Glad it was fixed nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

But alas, I only lasted 30 seconds meleeing.</div></div><hr />

Was hillarious hehehe reminded me of SCUD missiles and Patriot arrows from Robin Hood Men in Tights heheheh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny thing is, I finally felt at home with archery, doing it from above the mob like that.  Isn't that what archers are supposed to do?  I would love to see us able to hit from these positions with perhaps a slightly higher damage or greater chance of a crit but obviously without the 0 bow delay.  It would only make sense, since that's what fantasy world archers have always done - stand on the castle turrets or at any elevated position in battle, firing off arrows and making use of gravity and distance.<br />
<br />
I suppose it's a matter of &quot;are we archers or are we rangers with a secondary skill of archery?&quot;.  I'm not sure of the answer but it's an interesting question.<br />
