40 overcap resulted in 80hp.<br />
The diminishing returns on buffs even with the overcap makes them not very good.<br />
<br />
They need to remove the diminishing returns (or at least up the point where they diminish) on stats or fix our buffs.<br />
<br />
35sta and 150hp or something would have been better and hardly overpowering.</div></div><hr />

Lasts long and gives however many hp you didn't have before the buff, in your case 80hp you didn't have before?<br />
<br />
At least the buffs are doing something now besides sitting in the back of the spellbook.<br />
<br />
They added Guild Tribute. quite a few items that are of very good quality, who knows what else.<br />
<br />
STA should be useful, not overly powerful in combination with many other factors.</div></div><hr />

Errr, to how many people is 80hps going to be useful - at that level of hp provided it will still probably be one of the first buffs to be clicked off.<br />
<br />
Our guild is mid EP and 80 hps is &lt;1% of our MT's hps. For Time+ guilds probably around .5% soon.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, I can hardly call 1% increase in hps useful considering it takes up a buff slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heh how would you like to get a free 80hp aug?<br />

13k full buffed tanks get their hp a lil chunk at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I won't turn down an extra 80 hps, but I don't feel any great urgency to get the spell either.  I DO feel an urgency to get to 70 and get the rez AA and max out my other AA's though...so I'm grinding exp asap.<br />

If I could only carry 15 bills and someone tried to give me 5$ when I already had 15*20$ bills, I wouldn't take the 5$ bill because I'd be out 15$.  Face it, the only really good thing about this spell is it stacks with all the better HP buffs, helps you hold your breath longer in case you're swimming or grouped with a troll and the caster can cann the mana it cost to cast this back quickly.  Other than that, it's another marginal spell for a marginal class.  Nothing totally flawed with it, but it's underwhelming.</div></div><hr />

The extra hit point are ok but I think the point was this spell and most of our other spells still stink. If you are happy with any crumb sony gives you great, but many are still unhappy and just sick and tired of getting the shaft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realize that each class gets a different amount of hps per point of sta? Warriors will get more than an 80 hp boost, more like 200ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Doesn't matter if its 80hps or 200hps  on a 10,000 HP tank.  <br />
<br />
It's a buff - you have 15 slots (20 soon) to fiddle with.  I'll let our resident Warriors sound off on how much they want this buff.</div></div><hr />

I'm in constant tells from people that clicked it off but now want it again.  Personally I like it.  It's more than we got in terms before of it mattering.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well even if you dont see a problem now....<br />
For those sta capped its diminishing returns.<br />
The higher your sta the less hp you will gain.<br />
So the more you progress the less this buff will do.<br />
<br />
When the next expansion rolls about.<br />
All other classes will get an increase in hp buffs (just like they did this time) but our sta buff will continue to get less and less and less.<br />
<br />
What other class has the problem that the higher folks level the less buffs do for them?<br />
The ability to overcap produces very limited returns.<br />
<br />
Sorry the diminishing returns concept is flawed because it makes Shaman less useful the more the people around them level and gear up.<br />
It doesnt make us useless but it does make us less useful.<br />
This should not happen to any class.<br />
We should not become less powerful as others level and get better gear.<br />
<br />
They need to rethink the buffs and/or stats.</div></div><hr />

Although I agree that the value of this buff is marginal, it does provide a benefit, no matter how small, and will be of more value to some classes, such as casters, than others, such as 10k hp tanks.  HP &gt; all in my book, so more hp is never a bad thing.  <br />
<br />
Sure, in a raid you may have 20 better buffs and would not want this one, but in a lot of exp groups, most folks would take the hp above many other buffs.  So, yes, it could be better, but please, lets keep this in context.  Can you show me another classes spell that overbuffs sta, which results in more hp, that is better than this one?  We have something that is unique to the shaman class and has some value.  Maybe they will increase the overcap amount, maybe not, but as has been said, the folks in the group can decide if they want it or not.<br />
<br />
Hey, you may want to call it a &quot;crumb&quot;, but no class got anything spectacular or game altering.  IMHO the spell upgrades follow a reasonable progression in strength and overall game impact in light of the content they are designed for.  Folks complain about the marginal value of the new spells while also complaining that the new content is too easy?  I'd rather have this situation then have them release another GoD.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I still can't understand some of the attitudes on this board.  If, as you state, you are &quot;unhappy&quot;, and &quot;sick and tired of getting the shaft&quot;, why do you still pay $12.95 a month for this abuse?  And if you say because of your online friends, I'd suggest finding another way to interact with them, there are many that are free.  I certainly don't consider myself a fanboi, I think I'm fairly objective, but I am also mature enough not to pay for a game I don't enjoy.  <br />
<br />
Just my opinion, to each his own.</div></div><hr />

Wow...240 hp sounds great to me (warrior.)  On most encounters I'd rather have this buff then some of the other buffs I typically run with.<br />
<br />
I expect you will see warriors continually asking for this buff.  (second to Focus on my shaman buff list)<br />
<br />
Think of it this way...it will cost me a little under 38 AA's to get this many hp (sturdiness 3, 4, and half of 5).  So, yes, getting this for free just from taking up 1 buff slot is well worth it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I won this spell last night because my guild thought it was a worthwhile spell.  I already got a lot of tells for it, so that tells me that people desire the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Please post magelos so we can see where you are progression wise when you say 240 hps or even 80 hps is bad. First off all, if you are under cap, this is godly, so all those casuals are just drooling. But lets say you're at the cap and you get 240extra hps per tank, and 80 extra hps per caster.<br />
<br />
Do you know how significant that is? Did you spend 1150 ldon points for 40 hps? I did. I spent it 5x. Maybe you are a 12k shaman.. even then I would want it.. cause then you'd be a 12.1k shaman! but I guess I can understand from that perspective. <br />
<br />
People would give everything they had for that poTime mask that gives 180hps that stacks with all.. but those people prolly are ****ty players with extra buff slots to waste..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty true on most spells for casters.   Melee type's did get nice improvements but only because they havene't gotten much on other expansions directly.   <br />
<br />
On the whole, people want 'bang for their buck'.  This expansion is more like 'tweak for your buck'.   The good thing is it's spread across the board instead of selective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually, the very first thing I did when logging on when OoW went live was to buy as many buff slots as I could with banked AAs. There are a number of new must have buffs in OoW, so you need the extra slots. Warriors get 240 hp, thats pretty good. Think of it as a +240 hp aug, or an armor piece with 240 hp more than your current item. People would be going woowoo for stuff like that. Even at +80 hp they would be doing that, so the buff is definitely worth it. I cant speak for the tanks in your guild, but when I'm going into a named fight I get myself set up with every possible advantage I can lay my hands on, and in that world 240 hp is a big deal.<br />
<br />
As Denman says, tanks live by incremental increases in power, and this is just one more of many that come with the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I certainly wouldn't click it off, if I had the slots yet. Maybe I've just seen purple one to many times while playing.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yeah you guys are right. Its ONLY near 300 hp for a tank, so that is useless. And while we are at it, might as well not buff focus because its only 500 or so hp and everyone knows stats are useless. Oh and lets see P9 is only what 618hp or something, might as well click that off too since that means nothing. Oooh! And symbol is only maybe 300 more then that, lets click it off too......<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeez you guys are never happy about anything. I'm freakin thrilled it moves up the stat cap, even if it is only 80 hp for us. 80 hp is a nice upgrade for me at my level and I will welcome it anyway I can. As someone said, if an 80 hp aug dropped you would just say screw it and not roll because 80 hp means nothing to you? There are the new aa that gives you more buff slots, plus a majority of the time you don't need some of the buffs that are on you anyway (like haste or when somoene buffs the wrong resist). Just my opinion. I know that every single tank in my guild will be damn pleased with almost 300 free more hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">What an emberrassing thing to cry about.  We have 5 level 70 shaman in the guild and only one has this spell and you can be damn sure he has a reason to cry, he is now a full time sta bitch.  <br />
<br />
Get over this &quot;woe is me&quot; mindset and just play the dang game.</div></div><hr />
