<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just want to get a feel for where people are at, with all the negativity, positivity, neutrality, how do you feel about playing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I didn't enjoy the game, I would stop playing.  I enjoy playing right now, and have been enjoying the game for two and a half years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I seem to be one of the few people around who<br />
A) Enjoys EQ and has fun logging in to just hang around or exp or raid.<br />
B) Loves his class.<br />
C) Dosen't whine. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depends on what Im trying to do.<br />
<br />
If Im just messing around with friends being stupid, then yes, I really enjoy EQ.<br />
<br />
If Im trying to progress through content then no, I dont have much fun.  I feel like feeding my face into a meat grinder when I have to sit through mindless hours of flagging requirements just to see somewhere new.<br />
<br />
I can have fun when I can make the spells and abilitites I have work in a situation.  It is NOT fun to not be equipped to deal with a situation or have your spells reduced in effectiveness so that you cannot deal with a situation. (IE healing deficincies and mitigation)<br />
<br />
On the whole though, these problems go away when I play a class other than my shaman, like my ranger or wizard twinks.  They have been getting lots of playtime lately.</div></div><hr />

I agree BelegurthValar, I enjoy our class and think our class is balanced and ppl are just whining that they want to be more powerful again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep. Still fun for me.<br />

New server, new guild, raiding twice a week, hitting Ssra and someday VT. I guess I'm still in the 'golden zone' of targets.<br />
<br />
I did decide not to play on weekends or evenings (except our two raid nights) unless my wife has other plans. Been getting a lot more done around the house, and by Monday afternoon I'm very eager to log back in. Sometimes I sneak in an LDoN before work, too.<br />
<br />
Also have a group of guildies who live in north metro Atlanta, and am trying to set up monthly(ish) get-together-in-the-flesh meetings.<br />
<br />
I believe what everyone says about the bleeding edge zones, but I'll worry about that when the time comes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gin_juice68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Better than watchin TV most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm surprised to find myself losing interest in EQ. I've played hard for 4 years. I was a roleplayer and then in an uber guild...I've camped VP keys and VT keys, endured POP flags and a nasty near-guild implosion when some guildmembers thought we were progressing &quot;too slowly&quot; in POP. I joined my guild back in 2000, when we were raiding Hate and Fear, I've killed every boss in the game up to Time. (except Tunare, bint must die).<br />
<br />
My guild recently got to Time. We had nearly 90 members online when we killed the Rathe Council, since that event we've been lucky to field 60 members. I don't know if it's a combination of springtime, springbreak or lucky WoW beta participants or what, but it hurts morale.<br />
<br />
I've played around in GoD a little, I hate it. We had a failed Ferubi raid recently, we had to Corpse Summon. Nothing like running naked through mobs, guiding warriors/clerics and praying invis doesn't fail, it felt so...ToV! The GoD spells bore me, nothing new or exciting. I'd love the new can but the idea of MORE ancient spells I'll never see is so disheartening.<br />
<br />
I log in, we don't have enough people to raid, I have 300 AAs and I'm sick of AAing. The few GoD AAs that look appealing are so hideously expensive that I can't even stand the thought of working on them.<br />
<br />
I tried tradeskilling for a bit, but after getting baking/brewing to 250, smithing/pottery to 200 and fletching/tailoring to 150, I realized I would lose my mind if I killed one more green or clicked one more button.<br />
<br />
No twinks, hate PLing. LDON quickly losing its charm, 300K in the bank, nothing to spend it on...<br />
<br />
Weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still have fun playing eq.  Then again, ive never given a damn for class balance, i just play with some friends and enjoye taking on and beating new encounters... And theres lots of stuff that is very challenging for me in god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm still having fun ,but then I'm not even close to getting the problems that my brothers and sisters are getting.<br />
<br />
I tend to play one full night a week and the odd hour here and there. So I'm not getting burnt out. I enjoy doing quests, and actually reading the stories of the quests.<br />
<br />
When I don't have the time or inclination to play Hal, I play with my new bard alt. Now that's a rush aoe'ing 20+mobs down. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I still get a blast from LDON, pick up raids for BoT towers, random flags, taking buddies to get their spell drops/quest items in LoY, farming Seb for plat with them etc....for me, once I got over the fact that I would never see the Rathe Council fall, or see the elementals, the game got significantly better. I have my RL in shape now, pretty wife, new baby to enjoy (MUCH more fun than any collection of pixels will ever be), and my RL buddies that play EQ we still get together every week for a strategy talk and to play D&amp;D.<br />
The game is different, I have different goals now, and in the frame work of those goals, I am fairly by god uber and I enjoy that...outside those goals, well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Still fun - sort of.<br />
<br />
Sure when i am lucky and get a nice LDoN group going or guild is doing some fun raids (dang timezone differences  :( ) in rather old content or lower PoP tiers mostly - it's still fun.<br />
<br />
But i find it more and more difficult to motivate myself to do some flag or key grinding. Probably it's a bit burning out together with the current direction, the game takes. I myself DON'T want to deal with trash mobs, where i cannot even heal one single round of incoming damage and i feel, my other abilities cannot contribute enough for my group.<br />
<br />
GoD and SOEs current vision (?) of the game can bite me.</div></div><hr />
