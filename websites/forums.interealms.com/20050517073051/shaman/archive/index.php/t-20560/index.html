<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wow.   The /rewind command never seems to have gone live, so with this patch they make it happen automatically.<br />
<br />
This means that if you hit an object you 'bounce' back along your path to the last waypoint the game saved for you. <br />
<br />
What does this do?<br />
<br />
1.  If your last waypoint saved was before an evac, upon zoning back into the zone and hitting somebody in your way at the zone line, you will port to the point you evac'd from.<br />
<br />
2.  If you zone in and do not have a waypoint saved and hit somebody, you can end up under the world.<br />
<br />
3.  If you're fighting a mob and he pushes you into a wall, you'll bounce out of the wall (mostlikely with him behind you).   Can you say &quot;instant free backshot&quot;.<br />
<br />
4.  If you've pulled a mob into a corner so his Directional AoE or Rampage only hits you (cornering the mob) then if you move back just a hair too far and Touch the corner behind you... BAM! you are out of the corner, the mob turns around and WIPEOUT!<br />
<br />
5.  If you're running across a zone and hit a tree, you will Ping*Pong back and forth along your path.<br />
<br />
6.  If you're trying to 'scoot' along a narrow ledge you'll be bounced back and likely fall because your facing stays the same and your rate of movement stays the same.   Try scooting along the ledge that leads into Freeport Sewers over the pool of drownded citizens.   <br />
<br />
7.  If you run into another player or MoB, you will bounce.  Now, think of the places in the game where you're walking along narrow bridges where there is a lot of crowding (hello DEEP!) or paths along lava (hello OS!).<br />
<br />
Man... I get motion sickness now just running thru town every time I hit a door or corner of the building! :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In Plane of Tranquility, the little mountain that is the zone-in to Plane of Storms -- I used to run right over it every time without trouble, on the way to and from BoT. Last night I hit the depressions in the center of that mountain and it bounces me backwards, repeat infininum. Very silly, but I'm sure they'll fix it sometime within the next year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>malden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like the good ol' days in Anarchy Online. Run halfway across the zone and get rubberbanded back. Gooood times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just wait until you die with a DoT on you.  Then you have the pleasure of getting stuck in a death loop sequence because the DoTs no longer go away after you die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least you only lose exp like once or so.<br />
<br />
I had a grand time trying to save my guildmates from it last night in Time.  It can be done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kannath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A couple of days ago my roommate was camping the named mummy in befallen with his 29th level cleric and a gnome necro (who is played by one of his co-workers) told him in the channel that his co-workers use that she was in a death loop in that zone and could he come help.  He got to the location--not sure exactly where, but it was a slope near a door (I was looking over his shoulder after he got there).  She had somehow gotten at the top of the slope and fallen down taking enough damage to go &quot;purple&quot; (you know less than 0 hps, but not dead) so she fell down unconscious.  When she would fall down she would be inside the floor and &quot;rewind&quot; back to the place she fell from with the same hps as before the fall, but unable to not fall again.  Over and over.  My roommate unsuccessfully tried to heal her a couple of times, then memed his first level heal and that cast fast enough and she didn't go fall over from going purple--so ending the loop.  ROFL!  Was funny as hell to see, but I'd of hated to have had it happen to me!  :eek:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Had a fun time in Ssra when my spirit call pets pushed the mob through the wall in a 2nd floor hallway. That never happened before. So the mob ends up in the basement, and so do I after he summons me! It was just great luck that I got no adds and was able to invis back to my original fight spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">happened to my monk last night.  Zoned into PoK from PoT and must have hit something immediately cuz the next thing I saw was clouds and stars.  Under the world . . or over it, or whatever, I didn't recognize the place, couldn't move, and was stuck in exactly the sort of place I would need a GM or guide to remove me from.  This rewind thing seems to be causing waaaay more problems than it is worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In temple of droga last night, tried to jam myself in a corner to reduce interrupts, kept &quot;rewinding&quot;.  Couldn't get in a corner no matter how hard I tried.  Definately sucks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It makes the Coirnav fight interesting. There were a fair number of people who had to be CoTH'd multiple times. They'd get called down, hit a wall or person and *blam* be back at the zone-in area.  Fun stuff. =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you turn &quot;Allow Auto-Duck&quot; on, apparently this rewinding is prevented.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not totally prevented. You still bounce back from items/walls/people. It is just not as often.<br />
<br />
I find it amusing that I can bounce off some other players and run through other (or pets.) Nothing quite as ironic as a troll bouncing off a gnome but running thru another troll or orge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">#1 happened to my friend's wizzy on an adventure the other day.  We had no idea what happened to him at the time, but that explains it.<br />
<br />
Getting into and out of the Dogle bank (halfling bank, south bank, cabbage bank, whatever you want to call it) it PoK has been ugly (even for half-elf).  <br />
<br />
Even something simple like pulling along a wall in a place like Droga with a lot of angles has been ridiculous.  We were camping the supplier area in Droga for a quest drop for a friend yesterday, parked in a room with a bunch of barrels... everyone kept getting stuck on the barrels.  <br />
<br />
Not rewind related but related to the new dx9 dll... If a mob gets pushed into a wall more than say halfway, melee will get &quot;Cannot see target&quot; messages and whiff.  Also I was doing the caller cycle in FG the other day, one of the named tried to follow me and ended getting stuck inside a rock.  We couldn't get him out, he couldn't follow, we couldn't get LOS on him, I tried using PBAE DOTS on my bard to kill him but he was blocked from the PBAEs too.  Eventually he despawned.  Thankfully he was only holding that crappy hammer.<br />

MO' TESTIN, less puttin GARBAGE on live servers kkplzthxl8r.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Was doing an AD raid the other day and after we pulled it, it kept hitting this tiny little hill and rewinding.  Took it maybe 15 tries to finally get over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Trees in Emerald Jungle gave me a hell of a time getting to CoM. I'm also having problems targeting mobs through small branches and such. I also give a warning to those who frequent the eTop camp in BoT. If you are shrunk there are a number of places along the walls in each corner that you will fall through. This will warp you back to the zone in. Bye Bye dogdog from the invis-run back if you're lucky. Say hello to the frequent trains there if you're not.</div></div><hr />

yea means no more droga farming for us until its fixed :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My ogre warrior was bouncing about in upper guk like a pinball, and ended up getting shot out into the middle of innothule.<br />
<br />
I don't like this feature so far.  But I guess it beats getting glued into a wall, which happened to me before.  <br />
<br />
Not a great set of options though...<br />
<br />
But I like the idea of them trying to upgrade the graphics.  They've got to soldier on, I can imagine it's a very big and difficult task.  <br />
<br />
So, I'm patient.  Hopefully they are still tinkering on it because it's not done yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">anyone check the client.ini for a /autorewind = 1 or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I died to this new feature, couldnt backinto a corner to channel gate, gave up trying and stood there casting it but the damn mobs would push me far enough to make me bounce anyway<br />
<br />
<br />
I love it :(<br />
<br />
<br />
oh yeah and the dot death loop of doom is really funny when you see it the first time. but the 5th time you have to /q to get out of it is really really old.</div></div><hr />
