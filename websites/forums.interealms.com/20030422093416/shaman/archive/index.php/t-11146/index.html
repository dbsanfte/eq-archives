<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nice pictures Glori. <br />
<br />
As the picture taker you can conveniently avoid having your picture taken!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I work for Microsoft and we are transitioning a new call center in Delhi to handle some of our programs (Certified Partner, MS CTEC, MCT/MCP and activation).  The new call center is Wipro-Spectramind.  I do all of the CSR training, only three training days left and I leave Wednesday night :)<br />
<br />
I added some more pics and will probably keep adding a few more each day.  I can't be IN the pictures,, since I'm taking the pictures! :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">MS doesn't outsource their call centers?   /boggle<br />
<br />
Let us know when you get home safe &amp; sound, ok?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">??<br />
<br />
Yes, they do outsource their call centers, that's why I work for a company called &quot;Microsoft&quot; and I'm doing training at a company called &quot;Wipro-Spectramind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe I don't understand your comment :)<br />
<br />
I don't work for the product groups at Microsoft (Windows, Office, yadda yadda) I work for a much smaller group called Operations.  This is the group that ensures stuff actually gets in the hands of the customer (packaging, fulfillment, logistics, program management, all that fun stuff)<br />
<br />
I actually support programs, like Microsoft Certified Partner, Microsoft Certified Professional, MSDN/TechNet subscriptions, IT Academy, MSDN Academic Alliance and activation.  Microsoft outsources all these customer support servies to outside companies (Zomax, Arvato, Bertelsmann, WiproSpectramind, Teletech) and I go all over the world and train the reps on the programs.<br />
<br />
Normally I tend to travel to unexotic locales like Buffalo, NY and LA, CA, but I also get to Singapore, Hong Kong and New Delhi often.<br />
<br />
Sorry for typing so much, trying to kill some time on a layover in Amsterdam....12 hours til home <br />

/wave from Amsterdam</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think of plenty of things to do while in Amstredam for 12 hours.  All of which would land me in some sort of trouble.<br />
<br />
Be safe Glori. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Small world Gloriana!  My husband worked for Ops IT in Dublin until 2001 when we decided we wanted to move home to the States from Ireland.<br />
<br />
He tried to convince me to move to Seatle since the area is so beautiful, but that kinda defeated the purpose of moving so we could be closer to family, since we are from the East Coast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A very small world considering I made a trip to Dublin in 2001 to do some MERT training (internal reporting tool)!</div></div><hr />
