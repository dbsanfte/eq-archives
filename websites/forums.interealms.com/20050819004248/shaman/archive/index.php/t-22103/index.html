<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Copy/pasting this from my priest covenant post (&quot;Design Philosphy&quot;) as I can't seem to get a single person to actually debate my post instead of getting hung up on peripherals. Maybe I can get some feedback here.<br />
<br />
I have seen a lot of talking about how to balance the druid's superior nuking to a cleric's superior healing. In my opinion you can not balance straight healing vs straight nuking at all. Let me explain.<br />
<br />
This is going to assume that all classes only have single target heals or nukes - no other spells or abilities at all. Further content is static, that is the encounter never changes.<br />
<br />
We will assume that there is a class with the best heals and a certain amount of nuking power. There is also a class with the best nukes and a certain amount of healing power. These secondary abilities may well amount to zero (wizard healing).<br />
<br />
How to balance a third class to equally desirable for a group through a combination of heals and nukes?<br />
<br />
The EQ approach is to give that class (the druid) a certain amount of healing and nuking - for discussion's sake let us say 80% cleric healing and 80% wizard nuking.<br />
<br />
Now, when a group is formed that group needs damage and healing. If they need healing they will look for a cleric, even if the druid can heal 99% as well as a cleric - as long as he is healing he is inferior to a cleric, thus the cleric is chosen. The same happens when the group is looking for a damage dealer - the wizard is chosen.<br />
<br />
There is only one reason to ever choose this druids: If the group needs half a healer and half of a damage dealer the druid may be chosen. Even then druid healing has to be very close to cleric healing, because clerics can do damage too.<br />
<br />
If a cleric can heal 100% or nuke 60% and a druid can heal 80% or nuke 80% it would seem that the druid is the superior choice for the job of half healer / half nuker. However consider the following situation:<br />
<br />
The group needs 60% worth of healing. A cleric can heal 60% and nuke 24%. A druid can heal 60% and nuke 20%. Thus, despite having weaker nukes this hypothetical cleric is a better nuking / healing hybrid.<br />
<br />
The percentages required for a druid to be preferable to a cleric or wizard by virtue of straight nuking or healing abilities are staggeringly high, approaching the 90% areas.<br />
<br />
My conclusion thus is:<br />
You can not balance straight nuking vs. straight healing in static content. There is always going to be two specialists (best nuker, best healer) and all other classes are left behind.<br />
<br />
The only way to balance druids healing and druid damage is by letting them do half cleric healing and half wizard damage at the same time (or any other ratio that adds up to 100%).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Like I said, SoE thinks they patched our Doublecast skill to let us cast 2 mediocre spells at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phroke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The percentages required for a druid to be preferable to a cleric or wizard by virtue of straight nuking or healing abilities are staggeringly high, approaching the 90% areas. <br />
<br />
By your own admission, it would take a Druid having 90% healing, or 90% nuking to be desired by a group for either of those roles. As you also stated, their current levels are 80% in both, thus admitting why they already have a hard getting a group when a Cleric or Wizard is available.<br />
<br />
The only way to balance druids healing and druid damage is by letting them do half cleric healing and half wizard damage at the same time (or any other ratio that adds up to 100%).<br />
<br />
So, what you're saying is you want the Druid's Healing and Nuking abilities nerfed by 30%, thus making them even less desirable to a group who wants Heals or Nukes from them?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I understand the point of your post? If you follow your logic, it sounds like you're advocating a nerf on Druids. Gee, I just can't figure out why you're being ignored on the Priest Covenent, a board focused on BALANCING the classes with each other and the game, not designed as a NERF crying board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Note the bolded text &quot;at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
So in other words, druids could heal 50% and nuke 50% with one spell cast. At least that's what I think they're saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with this premise.  This has been played out time and time again in the other MMORPG's that claim to be skill-based and not class-based.  <br />
<br />
Despite this claim, there are a large number of min-max'ers out there that follow exactly one path, regardless of the many that are thrown their way.  Why?  It becomes painfully obviously that in probably 90% of the cases, being the absolute best at one thing is better than been mediocre at a lot of things.  Look at Shadowbane... look at Anarchy Online... look at SWG even (you can easily see that there are superior profession combos in this game).  All of these claim to allow the freedom from being tied to one class-type and allow you to dabble in other skill areas, but they almost always devolve into a min-max template that is clearly superior.  <br />
<br />
Actually, that's exactly what SWG players call it... &quot;dabbling&quot;.  Shamans are now the &quot;dabblers&quot; of EQ... the things we were once best at are now shadows of what they once were due to neglect and the doling out of our roles to other classes.  We have no superior role anymore.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I'm off topic, but the title of your post led me down this path.<br />

<br />
I think it's an interesting concept, however I think that cast times need to be looked at somehow as well.  If the druid can squeeze in 2 nukes between heals and the cleric only one (or vice-versa, since the druid will have to cast the heal more frequently), then that changes the dynamics.</div></div><hr />

Yes, that is pretty much it. Not necessarily within the same spell but at the very least within the same fight (pets and damage shields and other such cast-once abilities would work pretty well within EQs current engine).<br />
<br />
veeshanMurtak, you chose the wrong class: you dont wanna be a druid, you wanna be a necromancer (You have described a Lifetap (nuke and heal at the same time))... but that wont make you more desirable.<br />
I am not talking about lifetaps. I am talking about being able to nuke the MOB for 2K and heal the tank for 2K at the same time or at least within the time a wizard takes to nuke for 4K or a cleric takes to heal for 4K.</div></div><hr />

It is important that the druid does not merely get faster casting spells or he will end up being strictly inferior or strictly superior to a cleric.<br />
<br />
If there wasn't the problems of expansions adding new spells recast times would work perfectly. Give a druid a fast, efficient heal and a fast efficient nuke with a recast time of 10 seconds each and you more or less force him to alternate them. Then balance these spells to reach the desired percentages of healing and nuking.<br />
<br />
Two casting bars and two spell gem bars would be the perfect solution. One for heals, one for nukes. But I doubt they will rewrite the entire game engine to allow for this. :p</div></div><hr />

This will work if you actually have to use all of these abilities. This is the way druids are balanced now. But since content varies so little there is no need to be a crappy healer in the first fight and a crappy nuker in the second fight.<br />
<br />
You either need a healer - then get a cleric. Or you need a nuker - then get a wizard. If you actually needed different abilities right after another this system might work. Unfortunately varied content is pretty much reserved for raid encounters (and is rare even there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This is going to assume that ... Further content is static, that is the encounter never changes.I think your argument is correct, Murtak, as long as the encounter never changes.<br />
<br />
And there is a lot of reason for assuming that the encounter will not change.  With rare exceptions, the model is this:  you must kill a mob that produces lots of dps (mostly from melee, sometimes from casting).  To do it, you need solid tanking, large quick heals, and lots of fast dps.  You get one person in front of the mob who takes all the damage and gets all the healing, and everyone else beats on the mob from behind.<br />
<br />
There are lots of interesting ways that mobs could be difficult encounters, apart from this model.  Many of these were implemented in older content:  wicked AoE damage spells, banishings, curse and mana drain traps, mobs that spawn adds, and so on.  <br />
<br />
I think that some of the Ssraeshza fights are really quite interesting.  For example, after you get past the traps on the way to the High Priest, you'll need to deal with 12 adds during the fight itself:  some by mezzing them, some by banishing them, some by off-tanking them.  That's a lot of work for different people to do.  It requires good teamwork and communication.  The High Priest himself is unslowable so you need good tanking and healing:  and you have to sustain that over a period of time, you can do it right for several minutes and then screw up and lose.  <br />
<br />
(One time we had the High Priest down to 3% when one of the lesser priests repopped.  We failed to pick up the add right away.  We had the High Priest to 1% when the lesser priest began healing the High Priest:  20%, 40%.  Lots of screaming about that:  so three offtanks turned to attack the lesser priest, as we missed the repop of another lesser priest and a disciple or two -- soon it was all chaos, High Priest nearly to full health, adds slaughtering randomly and the High Priest summoning and snuffing casters with glee:  sure victory was turned into a full raid wipe in perhaps 30 seconds.  Wooo, were we mad!  But it was a very interesting fight, indicating that even when you have a tough mob at 1%, you haven't won:  it still takes teamwork, communication and coordination right to the very end.)  <br />
<br />
But as everyone has noted over and over again, the trend seems to be more and more to the one basic high-dps-low-hp model, which requires:  solid tanks, quick heals, heavy dps to kill it fast.  <br />
<br />
Suppose many mobs were challenging -- maybe more than half, instead of just a few rare ones -- because they had effects:  charm; a damage shield that the mob keeps renewing even though you keep dispelling it; knockback and stun; AoE snare with an agile mob that bounces around the room; silencing; random turning (I'm TIRED of you poking me in the ass, Mr. Rogue!) instead of pure mathematical aggro; mezzing; blindness; rampage that lands on a random number of melees in range instead of just one; whirl till you hurl; and so on.  <br />
<br />
What if higher level trash mobs might have any of these abilities?  Then your group would have to recognize and deal with the situation right on the spot.  What if higher level named mobs would generally have one or two of these characteristics, not necessarily always the same?  Then your raid would have to recognize and deal with the situation, right on the spot.<br />
<br />
In those kinds of situations, versatility would become immensely valuable.  Versatility within a single character, and within the teamwork of a group or raid.<br />
<br />
(I can hear the objections:  it would take a lot of coding changes to implement characteristics like these.  Ummm, yah.  Creating an interesting game that evolves over time takes a lot of ongoing work.)<br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
This is going to assume that ... Further content is static, that is the encounter never changes. <br />
<br />
Until we get some indication that further content will be creative rather than static, I think your assumption is a good one, Murtak.  And your conclusion is then correct, that jack-of-all-trades (= versatility, being pretty good at several things) really isn't worth much compared to excellence in one of the three specializations that we need.</div></div><hr />

This is why I say you could delete every single class other than cleric, warrior, enchanter and wizard and neither the grouping nor raid game would miss a beat.  Specialization &gt; versatility.  Roles are well defined and you never settle for a &quot;lesser&quot; class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Numbers wear me out. I keep hearing this phrase over and over &quot;Why would someone take an X over a Y&quot;. <br />
<br />
What I want to know is why wouldnt they if it was still adequate to the task itself. I realize in many situations certain abilities are REQUIRED. Yeah, its a lot easier to go through Vxed with a Warrior, 2 clerics, an Enchanter and 2 Wizards, but sheesh, why is it easier? Mobs die faster? So what. The XP comes faster? Who cares. There is less risk of dying? Why are you playing this game. <br />
<br />
Wait wait, let me expand on that further. 2 clerics can heal 27.473% better than a cleric and a druid, and OMG 57.82636498% better than a Cleric and Shaman! Thats it, shaman are worthless. <br />
<br />
A warrior will require 22.76545% less healing overall than a Paladin or SK. OOPS, see ya Knights, you suck, by 22.76545% to be precise!<br />
<br />
A wizards nukes are 18.98465% better than a Mages. ACK, all you mages, your COMPLETELY obsolete, re-roll wizards plz, thx.<br />
<br />
I wish people could stop focusing on the little tiny percentages of this game and get the job done. Yeah the XP in Earth is a bit better than Fire. That doesnt mean you ONLY go to Earth for XP cause its the &quot;best&quot; and anything elses is a waste of time! Yeah, the drops in BoT have slightly better stats than the ones in Veskar, guess NO ONE WILL EVER GO THERE!! Oh, no GY or PoK book either, gotta run, that TOTALLY negates any posibility. <br />
<br />
I understand the whole risk vs reward thing. What I dont understand is WHY everyone is SO focused on 7.7564% less risk for 4.87546% more reward, seriously. Anyone else see what I am talking about?</div></div><hr />

Noone is complaining about minuscule differences in class effectiveness. They are complaining about differences that are bigger then they should be. Whenever you want to argue that you have to list numbers.<br />
<br />
Stating &quot;well, shamans need a kinda bigger heal because we sort of do worse but I can't tell you by how much&quot; is not going to get us upgraded after all.<br />
<br />
And if we are discussing numbers we may as well do it properly. If we are precise now we will not have to go through all this again quite as soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess they need to change that saying &quot;You cant please all of the people all of the time&quot; to &quot;you cant please any of the people any of the time&quot; with regard to EQ. <br />

Everyone takes a back seat. Whats the point of buffing, crippling, casting etc? when your character's main attack does 9999? I don't eq is much different. When The Cleric's are twinked out and the tanks arent gimp anymore, and the wizards can crit the planet. Whats the point of bringing anyone else?<br />

The only reason you'd want to bring a debuffer/buffer into an endgame battle is to hear what character &quot;X&quot; has to say after battle &quot;Y&quot;.<br />

EQ has made it abundantly clear that the specialists are what you design AROUND and design FOR -- and everybody else is just what you hope not to break and hope remains relevant in the process.  If not...oh well.  It's not like you can address that or are likely to be messing with the specialists, who you've got working perfectly.<br />
<br />
The likelihood is that the specialists will always be the best designed and adapt best over time, since they're the touchstone from which you begin all the other adaptations of everybody else.  You can't mess with your foundation or your whole game falls apart; so you do your messing around elsewhere and it's the OTHER guys who fall apart.</div></div><hr />

Designing for and around the specialists are a necessity(sp?) since you would otherwise make the battle against the boss mob too easy. Against lesser mobs it would be ok imho to design for the battle to be tanked by a knight, healed by a shaman, and nuked by a druid.<br />
A part of the design parameters (I am guessing) is also that eventually will people be a lot better geared, thus making the encounter less challenging, going towards easy.<br />
I am rambling I guess, but hopefully my point got across.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You can make encounters challenging by adding spell based damage, curable effects, waves of adds, long fight duration and a ton of other things. That is all stuff that has already been implemented.<br />
<br />
You could also add a running battle where the entire raid needs to keep moving continously, a paratrooper style assault where you have to jump down into a tiny pool of water and immediately begin fighting while clearing the pool for the next player, a battle where you have to use friendly NPC's models to shield you from enemy archers while you battle the boss . . . <br />
<br />
None of that involves tailoring to encounters to single tanks and the best single target heals.<br />
<br />
All you need is a little creativity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because if you do anything else, you are a noob.  Or maybe if everyone is telling you &quot;BoT is the BEST zone in the game&quot; why would you want to go somewhere that's not the best? To have fun playing EQ? To roleplay? To not deal with the cesspool that is BoT?<br />
<br />
Nope, it's all about making the most of your time on line.  Because EQ isn't 'fun' and it's certainly not roleplaying.<br />
<br />
The other question about specialists is this:<br />
<br />
If a advent (raid, group, trial, whatever) requires 90 percent of a cleric's healing to complete, and druids are 80 percent, you can't win (if druids are 90 percent, you'd always take one too, because once the basics are covered, more DPS or utility is more helpful than extra healing). Witness: If you need 90 percent of a shaman's slow to win, there's a few choices at that point, all of whom are preferable.<br />
<br />
So how do you balance that? Give clerics almost as much utility as druids? It doesn't matter really.  For non-trivial content, there will be one &quot;right&quot; choice which everyone will focus on after doing the 'event' a few times.  Everyone else is left out in the cold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I know I'll never play another hybrid or jack of all trades character again, say in WoW or whatever. <br />
While I understand where you are coming from, Blarg, I have to ask, once again, what is more important, the road or the destination? <br />
<br />
I loved playing my Shaman this past 5 years. I tried Warrior. I tried Cleric. I found them tedious and boring. Not my cup of tea at all. But Shaman, WOWOWOWOW, talk about an exciting class to play. Sure, when we hit the wall (and we always seem to, at the end of every expansion, this topic comes up) it sucks for a while. And this time it was MAGNIFIED by Gates 10-fold. In fact, I would say that Gates did the Shaman class a HUGE favor by making it OBVIOUS how trivial some abilities had truly become, and how our class has been left behind in ALL categories since the created the spells &quot;Turgurs Insects&quot; and &quot;Torpor&quot;. <br />
<br />
For myself, I will never pick a vanilla specialist class in any game I am going to put significant time into. No way. I want hours and hours of FUN, not be bored for 4 years THEN discover I am a &quot;must have&quot;. <br />
<br />
As it currently stands, Warriors and Clerics, while very necessary at the top of the food chain, and absolutely required for raiding, are STILL extremely sub-par in the Day-to-Day life of a BIG chunk of people who play EQ. No one needs them in LDoN normal. A top end Knight is a better tank in Hard than an undergeared, under aaed warrior. XP groups would be mostly crazy to take Clerics over Druids, and Warriors over Paladins and SKs, because there is very little utility in the WAR-CLE combo. <br />

Lets face it. The game is just going to be what it is. There is no changing it at this point, they cant. Honestly, I wish the WAR and CLE classes were never invented, or rather, I wish they were more like Hybrids themselves, Warriors being more like WAR-MONKS, and Clerics being more like CLE-PALADINS (ie, able to tank effectively). The points have been made that if content is adjusted so a KNight can tank it efficiently, or a Shaman can heal it efficiently, then that content becoems trivial for the &quot;Holy Duo&quot;. How do you fix this? I have seen lots of ideas, but none of them truly satisfy. About the ONLY way possible would be to bring the 2 sides closer to a middle, and THATS not gonna happen because someone would HAVE to get nerfed. <br />

Personally, I am not displeased with the way EQ has gone or is headed. I am disappointed it took them so long to wake up and listen. I am encouraged by the recent dedication they seem to be showing their user base. However there are 2 sides to every coin. The easier it gets, the less interest I will probably have as a player. My guild just took down The Rathe Council. Last god we needed for Time. Took us 4 tries to get it right. I HAD FUN LOSING! I went 0-7 on Xegoney before we finally figured out the pull schematic. I HAD A BLAST! Now, its just another vanilla encounter we do for loot and flags, blah. <br />

For me, its all about the Road. Always will be.</div></div><hr />
