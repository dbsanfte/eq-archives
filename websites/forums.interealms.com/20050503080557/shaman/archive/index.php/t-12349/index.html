<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been wondering for a while now why it is that SoE did not include spells that have an effect on all members of your raid.<br />
Think about Raid shrink, Raid TL, Raid SoW, etc.<br />
It would make things so much easier and I really can not think of 1 argument why this would not be possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It would be too easy and fast to rebuff after a CR? :p<br />
<br />
Outside of general laziness, there is no reason why Shrink can't end up being a raid buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">or at least make it /tgb able ( shrink i mean )  i h8 it when guild members arent shrunk they need to take the group limit out of the single target shrink too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well this was pretty much the idea behind MGB, it was around before /raid was and was suppose to be mainly just there to buff your raid.  Also, wizards do get AE TL already, think they get AE Succor too (havent had it cast on me but heard they did).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While I understand why shrink can't be cast on people outside of your group under normal circumstances, I agree that it should be able to be cast on other groups as long as the other groups are members of the same raid force as the caster. It seems like it would be fairly easy to implement (a conditional statement in the game code) so I don't understand why it's not implemented that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't understand why shrink can't work outside yer group, as before a TL takes effect, you get a chance to turn it down.....  don't see why shrink can't work the same way</div></div><hr />
