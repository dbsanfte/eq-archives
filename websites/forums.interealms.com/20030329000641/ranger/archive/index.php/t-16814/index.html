<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">in the patch of 1/9/03 they had addressed some of the effects on the PoP armors, however they seemed to have neglected the ornate and only fixed the elemental armors leaving the effects on some of the ornate armors as not so good effects.<br />
<br />
here are the current effects since the patch.&lt;table border=1&gt;<br />
&lt;TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;.&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;ornate&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;elemental&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;/TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;brestplate&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;warders protection&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;Koadic's Heightened Focus (5 mana regen, right click)&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;/TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;leggings&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;earthen roots&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;Aura of Valor (40atk 4regen)&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;/TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;boots&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;vengeance III?&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;Vengeance IV/Mana Preservation 4&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;/TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;vambraces&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;refreshment (3regen worn)&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;Vengeance V/Improved Damage IV&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;/TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;gloves&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;vengeance III&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;???&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;/TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;bracer&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;vengeance II&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;vengeance III&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;/TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TR&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;helmet&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;plainsight&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;TH&gt;???&lt;/TH&gt;<br />
&lt;/TR&gt;<br />
&lt;/TABLE&gt;<br />
<br />
as you can see some of them are apropriate being lesser versions of the elemental armors, boots and bracer are simply lower vengence and no focus.<br />
<br />
gloves and helm I could find elemental stats for so can't coment on those 2.<br />
<br />
now for the ones that are really out of line since the patch.<br />
<br />
elemental arms were regen (5regen, worn) ornate refreshment (3regen, worn), elemental was upgraded to Vengeance V/Improved Damage IV, ornate was left with the same useless effect of 3regen, they should be changed to Vengeance III to be more inline with the armor sets.<br />
<br />
elemental BP was changed from ? to Koadic's Heightened Focus (5 mana regen, right click), while not overly usefull is 10X better than the ornate which is still warders protection which is 100% useless to anyone who can get it, BP should either be at least upped to Protection of the wild or make it inline with the elemental with lunar whispers (2 mana regen, right click), hopefully they will re-evaluate the BP's though as even the new elemental effects suck, Aura of Resolution (50atk, 5regen) for elemental and Vengeance V - VI or Aura of Bravery (30atk, 3regen) for ornate would be more fitting.<br />
<br />
elemental legs were changed from right click Spirit of the predator to Aura of Valor (40atk, 4regen) while ornate remained the right click of earthen root, which while is good as a soloing tool is more or less of little use, the Vengence II effect of the bracers is far better IMO, the ornate legs should be upped to Vengence IV or  Aura of Daring (20atk, 2regen) to be more in line with the set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rhadgast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think Sean posted all this info yesterday (including the effects of the items you don't have) in his thread on elemental armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">he had posted it for some of the pieces though I didn't see him post the info on the helm or gloves.<br />
<br />
also anyone know why it's making that huge space there before the table? i've never seen it do that before, should only be 1 line there between the text and table :\</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">but the important question...does the elemental helm have a graphic?  don't see why you guys are worried about all this feeble stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, helm is Faerune. No, none of the helms so far have graphics (going to assume the Ranger one doesn't either, as none of the others have one).<br />
<br />
Gloves are Aura of Bravery for Elemental Armor for Melee and Hybrids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kerak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just curious, why hasn't anyone suggested Eagle Eye as a focus effect on some of the armors, or is there something out there with Eagle Eye that i don't know about? I would think saving a buff slot and not casting it every 10 mins would be a nice little bonus and nothing too big that Verant would say is too much to ask for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Millikin Erreene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kerak states:  &quot;Just curious, why hasn't anyone suggested Eagle Eye as a focus effect on some of the armors&quot;<br />
<br />
For the relative difficulty of obtaining the patterns for the armors, Eagle Eye would be a very weak effect to place on a piece of armor when compared to the effects that the other classes get, even if was a continuous effect.  I'd rather something that improves my ATK in all areas not just melee or archery, makes spellcasting more efficient, and/or gives me a useful ability/spell effect.  (read:  An appropriate spell I don't have in my repertoire or one that I currently use, not a situational one with an insanely high casting time or an obsolete one that's already been replaced by better spells in my own repertoire.) <br />
<br />
I personally don't agree with whoring out spells on items just to 'simplify the lives' of pure melees or even really giving items with spell effects or abilities way out of sync of their class roles. <br />
Even if the spell effect is 'weak' compared to what a real casting class is capable of by the time it's useable/obtainable, the ability to see invisible creatures/players, right click heal or buff resists, stats etc. has absolutely nothing to do with a monk, warrior, or rogue's primary role of damage dealing or damage absorption.<br />
Casters and hybrids pay the price for their magic use by reduced melee skills, hit points, dependency on mana etc. yet it seems to be forgotten that the price those pure melee were to pay for their specialization was the inability to use magic.  And it kills me to hear complaints from pure melee classes that summed up says they think they're entitled to access to any spells they want without expenditure of mana or drawbacks.  It must be nice to be able to summon infinite bandages or throwing weapons, cast Invisibility, Spirit of the Wolf, Avatar etc. without ever having to go through the expense of acquiring the money to purchase components when you're in a random pick up group where gems are auto-defaulted to the cleric and the rogue is pickpocketing mobs dry or the same person is looting every single corpse before it hits the ground.  Much less endure the frustration of multiple spell casting fizzles to work up spell casting abilities like Channelling, Alteration, Divination or Conjuration etc. <br />
<br />
As far as focus effects/ATK enhancements go, I know this sentiment may not be exactly popular, but I don't think warriors, paladins, and SKs should be getting the same amount of ATK value increases that a monk, rogue, or ranger does on the exact same armor piece.  Damage dealers should be getting the superior ATK values as tanks already get the superior AC and hit point values, which is in line with their established roles.  The reverse should be true. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kerak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nah i meant like keep the Vengeance on the pieces but somehow throw Eagle Eye in. I think i saw somewhere that they are doubling effects on armor by making one a &quot;focus&quot; effect. I could be wrong. If i am, then by no way add EE as an effect. Although I'm pretty sure EE would be a much better effect to have over Warder's on the Ornate BP or Refreshment on the Ornate arms. At least it would be useful instead of somewhat useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">effect on bp is stupid, i have pattern and have HoT BP,  and its a waste, im going to give it to non hot bp ranger in the guild, but if was usable effect i might actually keep it as an upgrade.<br />
<br />
LVL 60 self buff *** is that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taadieri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If they were going to include Eagle Eye on any of the Elemental Armor it would have to be replacing Faerune on the helm.  Both Eagle Eye and Faerune have see invis and ultra/infravision so having both effects would be redundant.<br />
<br />
I would gladly give up the EB effect in Faerune for Eagle Eye.  Although Eagle Eye is only a level 58 spell and doesn't use that much mana, it is one that most rangers will want to have up as often as possible and it has a relatively short duration.  So even if it is right click, it is useful if the cast time is not excessive.  Making it innate would be best, but I don't think they would want it to stack with cast version of spell and not sure they could make it innate and not have it stack.</div></div><hr />
