<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glail Stormcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have tried this quest a couple of dozen times with no success.<br />
<br />
Just looking for an Idea on what kind of group you have used. Ex. AE group with a Wiz and Mage or Melee group with enchanter for stunning/mez adds <br />
<br />
I understand high DPS is the key but my group either gets so close I could scream or we fail in the first 15 secs.<br />
<br />
Have also had the Exe literaly run to the stage a few times as well, which I hear is a bug.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Also all group members were 61 or greater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kalvarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Chanter<br />
Healer (can be any type really)<br />
Mage<br />
Mage (can sub in any good DPS class, rogue, AM3/EQ ranger, wizard)<br />
Tank<br />
any class in the game<br />
<br />
Provided the players involved are of reasonable level that build works for my guild 99% of the time.  Generally best to just stun and AE while the tank and extra occupy the wave.  Mage can banish a rock or two if the executioner gets near the prisoner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ranger - max DPS, mem Exile Summoned and Calefaction<br />
Bard - level 62+ with AoE slow spell, mana song, etc.<br />
Cleric - one that can manage aggro and keep everyone alive<br />
Warrior/SK/Paladin - one that can do good damage, hold aggro, and tank<br />
Mage - nukes and pet, give all casters mod rods also<br />
Wizard - nukes, nukes, nukes<br />
<br />
Get shaman and enchanter buffs from others in the trial room.  You'll have a hard time losing with this group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tariskatt Ore'Ereg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 58 I went through with;<br />
<br />
Enchanter 61+<br />
Warrior 62<br />
Cleric 62<br />
Ranger (me) 58<br />
Wizard 60 or 61<br />
Monk 61+<br />
<br />
My friend got me through (the warrior). He's gotten most of our guild through by settin' up the 'perfect' group. He can get pretty much anyone through if he gets 5 of the right chars.<br />
<br />
Casters should have horses... helps med'ing an' aggro.<br />
Main tank needs to jump on the next mob the second the one you are fightin' dies, doesn't matter that much which one he/she gets... the non-mezzable rocks should be killed first of course... an' don't have them change targets.<br />
Buyin' damage shield potions helps out quite a bit along with gettin' a big mage to DS you, they stack.<br />
Do not ping pong mobs. Have all players stand near the mobs so the tanks don't have to chase it around the arena.<br />
<br />
The first time we went through we had a 59 Pallie instead of the Wiz. I dropped out, let the Wiz join an' they got through easy as pie. 30 mins later I joined, Pallie dropped an' we went through easily again. You have to have the right chars an' levels an' people that can react quick enough an' stay on the ball. <br />
<br />
I think those are all the main points he had. <br />
<br />
G'luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lythe Featherblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lots of combos work.<br />
<br />
When I went through, was monk monk ranger druid cleric shaman, with chanter for buffs in staging area.  Took us 4 tries to get it right, ended up with cleric kiting executioner while I shot arrows and druid used epic DoT, had to do some rezzing after but got all flagged.<br />
<br />
Be careful of named spawns, you will need extra nuking to take them down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Muvandog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Getting a nice big buffy tank for this definitely makes it easier.  65 , well equipped,  lots of AA ideally.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>daktarien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've passed trial of execution 3 times now and my guild has passed a few more times.  <br />
<br />
first time:<br />
61 ranger<br />
61 ranger<br />
62 warrior<br />
61 cleric<br />
62 wizard<br />
65 chanter<br />
<br />
<br />
2nd time:<br />
61 ranger<br />
62 sk<br />
63 shaman<br />
65 chanter<br />
61 necro<br />
62 bst<br />
<br />
3rd time:<br />
61 ranger<br />
62 pally<br />
63 bard<br />
62 wizard<br />
61 necro<br />
60 cleric<br />
<br />
In all cases, we followed the following design rules (this is what worked for us):<br />
1 tank (warrior, paladin, shadow knight)<br />
1 crowd control (bard or chanter)  <br />
1 healer (cleric, druid, shaman)<br />
3 dmg (ranger, necro, monk, rogue, mage, wiz, bst)<br />
<br />
No one class is better than others but there are +'s and -'s to each obviously.  Most important thing seems to be having people that will work together. The big thing for us was getting the casters to stay close enough to the melee so there is no ping pong.  Nothing will kill your trial faster than trying to kill a mob chasing one of the robes.  <br />
<br />
Some suggestions:<br />
-A chanter with DC helps loads with DPS if you can find one. <br />
-Having a necro in group to feed the healer before the executioner also helps (especially if using a druid or shaman for a healer) <br />
-keep the group close together<br />
-don't let people convince you that you one class is more needed than another.  all classes can play a worthwhile role in the trials.<br />
-pickup groups for trials don't work nearly as well as guild/friend groups.  Teamwork is essential. <br />
<br />
<br />
hope my ramblings are somewhat helpful.  :) <br />

<br />
With same group, we once failed, then won. You need one cleric for sure, but any other combo will work.<br />
Everytime, all of us have DS from druid/mage (except rangers ofcourse heh)<br />
Speed of decision on MT's mob picking, luck with mob spawn, parameters vary in every fight.<br />
<br />
Atleast, don't think of saving your mana for Boss. Dump out max DPS on every mobs, and you'll win.<br />
<br />
P.S.: I think Enchanter should cast DD rather than mezzing. They will complain that their DD sucks, but DD+DS &gt; Mez (less being hit = less DS output)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eoghan Blaidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Recently passed with me (61 Ranger am3/eq), 62 pally, 61 Cleric, 65 Wizard, 61 bard, 60 mage. The prime Executioner was a total cluster as first Bard had agro kiting, then Paladin grabbed agro to save Bard, Then Ranger Grabbed agro to save Paladin (all the while kiting around) and then Paladin decided to start fight with Cleric at 60 mana, Mage at 10 mana, wizard at 50 mana. <br />
<br />
Paladin burned LOH and then a charge on his soulfire to stay alive. Then the Ranger stepped in to take control, slowed the boss, stepped back and with my Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt crackling with energy the Prime Executioner didnt stand a chance. YOU have slain Prime Executioner Whatsisname!<br />
<br />
No deaths. One of the funniest fights I have been in for a long time. Was like a scene out of the 3 Stooges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nerple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The group I passed it with was<br />

60 Rogue<br />
61 Ranger<br />

61 Druid<br />
60 Cleric<br />
<br />
We got mostly rocks, and the druid didn't cast banishment, instead healed the bard until everything was mezzed, then nuked.<br />
<br />
Everytime I came close before that a druid was in the group as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the push group for my guild was<br />
<br />
<br />
65 bard<br />
65 ranger (me)<br />
65 rogue<br />
<br />
+<br />
any tank<br />
any cleric<br />
anyone...<br />
<br />
<br />
get your kei... speed... shaman buffs beforehand<br />
<br />
<br />
we passed a lot of people with this group, we even passed shamans as DPS in that 6th slot, they didn't slow, didn't heal, all they did was nuke and many melee that were below 60<br />
<br />
<br />
guardian of the forest seemed to help a lot, on that round where you start off bad, or a slip up on a mob where you know its going to be a split second short, the 48 seconds is usually enough to kill 3 mobs.<br />
<br />
and the new summoned nuke works wonders on the rocks... you could solo one if you really had to just chain casting. Pretty much any spawns with rocks in em, you have no reason to fail. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the group that i passed with before i was unguilded was...<br />
<br />
61 cleric<br />
62 ranger <br />
61 wizzy<br />
62 mage<br />
62 enchanter<br />
61 warrior<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
in general mages seem to own the trials, they can overnuke on the close ones, and sit out of the next out if they have to and the pet is still there doing damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
pretty much any combination of people will work as long as they are solid people</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">65 War<br />
65 Chanter<br />
2 mages mid 60s<br />
any cleric with a decent mana pool<br />
anyone else<br />
<br />
This was my guild's flagging group, which ran like clockwork.  One mage banished the rocks, one mage nuked, the chanter charmed one mob, and the war did whatever it is warriors do.  Actually, the best strategy was for the warrior to sit down between waves.  This ensured that all the mobs aggroed him on the initial pop.  <br />
<br />
The trials were cake with this setup.  Our cleric made some mistakes, so we failed the first time and succeeded easily the second.<br />
