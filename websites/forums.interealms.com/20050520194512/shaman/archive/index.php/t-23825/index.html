<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slacethehard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">lifted this and thought it may be of intrest to those contemplating the grind to lvl70<br />
<br />
A group of Altera Vita guildmates and myself just completed a 21.5 hour exp grind to ding us all level 70. So i thought i'd post and share some data with everyone that's interested in what they can expect. <br />
<br />
First, the entire grind was done in PoFire in teh second castle. All mobs were level 68. The exact time of the grind took 21:38:40 (rounded to the nearest :05). We killed 1255 mobs. That averages to 0.3195% reg exp/mob and 0.30877%exp/minute. <br />
<br />
here's teh breakdown in # of mobs it took to ding each level. <br />
<br />
67 - 261 <br />
68 - 291 <br />
69 - 332 <br />
70 - 371 <br />
<br />
Additionally, AA exp on these mobs at lvl 70 was right at 4%/mob as compared to 5%/mob at 65. <br />
<br />
I hope this information proves useful and informative to those heading out this week to grind it out. <br />
