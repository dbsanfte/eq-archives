I have been grouping in velks the past 6 lvls, and am sick of ice in that zone. anyone have any clues to a good spot? willing to try anything really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoD and PoN are both good spots. I've been grouping there since 55 and xp is top notch if you keep steady pulls. I've heard you can solo rats in PoD but haven't tried personally. Though I know a 57 ranger that solos them while waiting to get a group. Makes me wish I had a fear spell.</div></div><hr />

PoD is solid, I haven't been in PoN for xp yet.<br />

Howling Stones - there's a walkthru on the first page of this board.<br />
<br />
WL - Geos and Suits.  Not the fastest xp, but they give good AA hits.<br />
<br />
DN - Phase Spiders - In the middle of nowhere, but a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
ME - Toilers.  Overall, pretty easy to kill if you get a safe spot to pull to.<br />

Katta - Guards<br />

<br />
The past few nights I've sat in the different first tier planes and been lfg, and actively trying to find and/or put together a group for hours each night, and each night failed to get a single group.<br />
<br />
Kinda sucks, but I guess it's just hit and miss.  I still go there though, lack of something better to do.  I just wish they dropped some decent items for me cause I'm one broke keety.<br />

LFG for 30 min in POD, then head to PON, and LFG for 30 min.  While traveling through POT, be sure to LFG there too.<br />

Unless of course, you're the lowest level Shaman LFG in the zone, which happens to me more times than I can count.  Who's gonna want a 55 Shaman LFG when there are about 4 60+ Shaman LFG?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's a huge hit or miss in PoP zones. I haven't had much luck just walking into a zone and getting a pickup group -- there are a ton of 55+ shaman on Karana. It's usually a guild group or just one guildmate that gives me a tell because the shaman in his group is leaving :)<br />
<br />
The XP there sure does spoil you. Velks and Seb seem so damn slow compared to PoP hehe.<br />
<br />
UPDATE: Got into a pickup group in PoD yesterday and it rocked my world. I got almost 4 yellows from a 6 hour marathon. Had many many near-death experiences though. Man those mobs hit so much harder than in PoI and PoN it' not funny. Most everything was yellow to me. Great fun. Then found a pickup group today in PoN to ding 56th lvl. Not quite as good xp as PoD but mobs don't hit as hard either, at least the ones near the waterfall anyway.<br />
<br />
So yea with patience pickup groups can happen in PoP zones :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just a hint for all of you shaman who dont know this.  Charm rocks.  Enchanters and Druids like having a shaman partner when charming.  Mobs die fast when slowed and groups pet quads for 250+ and is hasted.<br />
<br />
At 59 I get 1/2 yellow an hour charm kiting yard trash in pon with a chanter and druid friend ... druid doesnt charm because he is 2 boxed with the chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I can testify for the Charm method spoken about above...<br />
<br />
It does wonders for your xp bar!  hella fun too having a mob like a Blood Raven as a pet, hasted.  Makes tanks I know cringe at the thought of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Chardok entrance is good solo and if you can get a group you can go to the good spots.<br />
<br />
POP groups are gettable, just be patient.  PoD is hard soloing at 56 but I had a 3:2:2 record (3 kills, 2 zones/gates, 2 deaths) and both deaths were due to adds, so if you can locate a spot that's add-free you might be able to solo while you LFG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aager</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just my 2cp,<br />
   I've been hunting PoP since 54 and have found awsome exp in PoI with a fast pace group you are looking at 1% exp every 2-3 kills at Lvl 57.  I really like PoN and PoD but they are a bit tricky as to where to hunt at.  in PoD really unless you can get into one of the courtyard groups is really not worth it IMO.  PoN Fighting along the zone wall is good for while you are forming up but I would move to A spot across the lake or the dock on the lake itself to get the higher end Mobs.  Ive been in PoJ a few time and had some good exp fighting the punishers and enforcers in the south eastern part of zone also, good for Diamond and higher end gem drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">CD entrance solo is about as good as group exp in PoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">yeah,the POP planes are the best exp, with almost no loot.<br />
<br />
Katta guards (Nathyn's for the faction conscious) are the best spot for solo.  At 56 I was getting close to one and a half blue peer hour.  By 58 I was still doing that well, killing faster and holding more spawns.  Outdoor zone, so horse and SoW work.  Decent plat drops and the weapons sell like FS.  On the Tribunal this zone went from crowded to empty with the opening of POP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Just as a note for aa...<br />
<br />
I always planned on going to HK whenever I needed aaxp, since nobles are pushovers... but... seeing as I just got over 5 yellows in 3 1/2 hours of grouping in PoN (63 BL, 57 Ranger, 56 Shammy(me))... I think the planes kick ass for aaxp as well.<br />
<br />
This might be completely obvious, but I was under the impression that aa is the same wiether in the planes or not.<br />
<br />
PoN is good, love it, cuddle with it, just don't turn your back on it long enough for a spider to nab ya :p.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, and if anyone tells you not to work on aa at low levels, they just jealous because you are a Baron before them... j/k ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I can solo rats in PoD pretty easy.  Just slow then epic them.  With KEI its real easy,  just got to watch for adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">PoN is great xp, but if you can't find a group try going to ME and teaming up with a druid. I did this and was amazed at how easy the xp came. Have the druid do all the pulling via snare and have him charm one of those wolves out there and use it as a pet. Combined with your slow, buffs and your pet, it's going to be pretty nice xp, though probably not as nice as pop.  Figure that alot of druids are going to be kiting anyway to 60, so just weasle your way in on the deal. Druid/Shaman combo is pretty nice. Bard/Necro is also incredible.</div></div><hr />
