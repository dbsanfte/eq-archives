<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What kind of loss do you get hit with if you sell your horse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">like 70% of ur cash bakc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, I have never sold a horse ... but I thought the 70% was from people selling to vendors in the Bazaar area, where whey were, presumably, indifferent faction.<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that you could take your &quot;bag of gold&quot; (or whatever the bag you get for your bridle is called) to a vendor that regards you as an ally and get a much better return.  <br />
<br />
Anyone tried this?  Max CHA and sell to an  &quot;ally&quot; vendor, what results did you actually get?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bough 94k horse sold back for 76k sell back was the same at the horse merchants as it was in SH will ally faction had 180 odd charisma tho :)</div></div><hr />
