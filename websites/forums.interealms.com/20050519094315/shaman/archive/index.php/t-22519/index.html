<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">me and my friend r going to duo from ascine's lvl to 65.. hes making a necro and im using my shammy.. i was wandering if i should start up a new account.. and make a mage to join.. would that be easy to do? and also.. would there be  more places to get xp than the just regular sham and necro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wander what i should make</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Perhaps those of us who read your post in those 90 minutes have no insight on your situation, Exes. Sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A mage would probably make a better companion for a necro since you get someone with complimentry abilities rather than similar abilities but it really doesn't matter that much. A mage brings nukes, an pet of similar power and summoned items. A shaman brings heals, slows, buffs for the pet and similarly powered DoTs.  It is better to play a character you enjoy rather than one that you think would be the most needed. <br />
<br />
As for places to get XP, the class choice really does not matter that much. Both classes get invis, lev, gate and EB so your mobility isn't a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, I'll take a stab at this.  If the necro and shaman are good players a magician would be a great addition in my humble opinion.  In fact I probably could not think of a better 3 person group.  But remember that without a tank to take some damage, the players need to understand agro and how to properly manage it.<br />
<br />
Purdy<br />
<br />
So, yes I would recommend a magician, and yes I think that that particular 3 person group played well could take most all single group encounters in EQ.  If the shaman is going to 2 box the magician,  the necro should be the puller and by in large direct the action.<br />
<br />
But even with all that said I would suggest that you think long and hard whether you will be happy 2 boxing in dangerous situations.  It's one thing to fight in easy camps with singles coming in and and quite another thing to crawl in tight dungeons where multi pulls are difficult to handle - especially when 2 boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my friend (the necro).. his highest char was 9.. lol.. but i could always find a friend that could play the mage.. but if im not in luck ill make it.. they seem fun.. and plus u could think of it as a 6 person group lol (3 people 3 pets)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I two box my shaman and necro from time to time.  Honestly, two boxing complex casting classes is A) very hard and B) even harder to do well.<br />
<br />
I really feel like I'm only playing half a shaman and half a necro when I two box them.  Whereas, when I main play a melee, and box the shaman, I feel like I'm getting 100% of the melee potential, and about 75% of the shaman.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think you'd be better off with a paladin over a another casting class, and then setup a series of keys to assist the pally with your shaman.  <br />
<br />
Between the shaman and pally, you should have enough heal power to get through most tough situations.  And you'll get rez from the pally when things get really tough:)<br />
<br />
If you decide to go with the mage, it will limit the content you can fight for sure.  As mobs get tougher and tougher, you'll bascially be forced to adopt 2 play styles.  Aggro kiting or root rotting.  <br />
<br />
Until you get Q, your heals won't keep the pets alive at all.  Without a tank, you'll need to let the necro run the mob while the mage and necro pets bite it.  That means that slow is pretty much pointless for the majority of your fights.  In which case, why even play a shaman?<br />
<br />
In additon, you need room to kite.  That will limit where you can hunt.  Dungeons are pretty much out.  As are places like BoT for the most part.  And while you can do it, fighting any mobs that summon willl be a pain.<br />
<br />
Basically, while boring, if your goal is to form a functional group of your own, you need to make some sort of holy trinity. Tank, healer, CC.  Any tank, shaman, necro, can perform those roles ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I definately have to agree with Ungkor here. The lack of a melee class will realy hurt you in the long term. Over the years I have partnered with several pallies and they are probably the best partner for a Shaman. My favorite part of partnering with a pally is the fact you can tell them to shut up and heal themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">haha ill prob make a pally.. would make a sk but i already have one..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">what bout me making an enc??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just pick whatever is fun.  All classes have their strengths and weaknesses and it's not like asking what color an apple is or something, there's no right answer.  If you can't decide, roll a die.  My suggestion is to, whatever you pick, stick with it until you get 65.  I know a lot of friends IRL who switch characters so often I have given up on ever being able to group with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">haha.. man thats a hard decision.. someone told me 2boxing 2 casters is hard.. but i dont think i wanna make a melee.. maybe ill make it on my 1st accoun.. who knows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">haha.. man thats a hard decision.. someone told me 2boxing 2 casters is hard.. but i dont think i wanna make a melee.. maybe ill make it on my 1st accoun.. who knows<br />
<br />
2 Active casters is hard. A cleric is one of the easiest to bot through adventures since you can hot key most functions. You do want a melee class that can get and hold aggro. It is not hard to bot a melee once it is on target. Just make sure your casters don't pull aggro or you will have to take an active role with the Melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hm.. i would make a rogue.. but useless w/o bs.. dunno bout ranger.. might make a sk but i already have one.. but i could make a pally.. left is a warrior  (uh.. no) and a berserker.. so far in the group we have is a ranger.. shammy.. necro.. possible druid OR another necro.. mage.. what yall think would go well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sooda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">IMO, Good players will make almost any combination doable.. I have seen 2 clerics duo things I would have never thought possible, same with 2 warriors, ping0poing'ing aggro....<br />
<br />
The best advice is the most simple.. Pick something YOU enjoy, its a long trip up to 65.. if ya dont know just from playing the game what you would like to try next, start a few new char's give them 20 levels see what you think..<br />
<br />
What &quot;our&quot; opinions of good classes for you to play just doesn't work =)<br />
<br />
Pick classes you enjoy then figure out how to make the combo work for ya.<br />
<br />
Sorry, not the answer you were looking for, I know... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">haha ill prob make a pally.. would make a sk but i already have one..<br />
<br />
Box a tank of some sort and a pally would be a good choice. The higher you go the more you will be limited by healing power (no cleric or druid) so pally will partly bridge the gap. And try to avoid complex characters for the box. In that sense I would box the shammy and play the paladin. Shammys are easy and wont overload your macro/gems too bad. My top 3 boxes (6box on 3 machines) are warrior (main tank so positioning is essential), chanter (complex and mez is important since I tend to overpull), and shammy (I pull with slow most times). Underneath are paladin (dps and grp heals along with BSS), wiz (easy), and cleric (easy). It also depends if you are doing 2 machines or 1 to some extent, 2 machines makes your choices easier to deal with. 1 machine better be easy class to box (warrior, cleric, wizard, etc) and avoid positioning classes to some extent (beast lord due to pet push, etc.).<br />

<br />
Probably a good call, some are better at boxing than others. When I tell people I 6box they either laugh or go OMG. Once you have the hotkeys/etc setup correctly its cake in 90% of the situations. But when you get past your capability (either too much stuff going on or too big/hard a pull) then you tend to crap out hard. That being said I never had to worry about the healer not healing or the shammy not slowing or the chanter not mezzing :) Key is know your limitations and work within them unless u want to do CR...<br />

Any combination is possible but like others have mentioned, two casters combination may not be the easiest  partnership. Both enchanter and a shaman come into power later in their careers. At lower levels a shaman can act as a melee but is soon is made obsolete (compared with the damage a good melee can make).  With an enchanter you have to evolve a strategy that is mostly defensive  but if you have enough charisma you can attempt to charm pets (and there are many stategies for  using pets  including  carefully keeping charmed mob slightly more healthy than the non charmed one , and then break charm when the fight is over  and kill the other mob for experience) There are definite advantages like free clarity, kei, etc,mezes and stuns but if the enchanter gains to much agro, there is not tank there that can taunt the mob away. You may have to be selective about the mobs you go after. For instance since you don't have a tank, you don't want a mob that is MR and hits hard.<br />
<br />
   With a necro it is easier to partner with a shaman since a decent necro by itself can solo pretty easily (with fear and &quot;snare&quot;) Their pets are pretty good and  some of their higher lvl  spells are nice for &quot;healing&quot; and giving mana to needy casters. Also they can summon dead and if you are willing  to pay for the essense gems, they can do a rez in a pinch. If you end up playing with a good necro, most times you will slow the mob,  and heal his pet from time to time. They also have their own version of canibalize.<br />
<br />
For tanks, I think the best ones are SK. They hold agro very well even if you manage to DOT the mob alot. They also can FD  which makes them pretty decent at pulliing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">im making the 2 box basically for this &quot;caster group&quot; mentioned above.. we have a ranger.. necro.. shaman (me).. either another necro or druid.. mage.. and i wanted to make a enc to go in there.. we would have someone to tank (the ranger).. but if the ranger is somehow not on.. then the mage's pet could tank.. or that would be there i would get the pally i would make for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It also depends on whether you are boxing on the same machine or not.  If you have two computers to use then running a Shm + Melee is no problem at all, however melee's become more difficult to effectively box when you do it on the same machine.<br />
<br />
Clerics, mages, and wizards are super easy to box on the same machine.<br />
<br />
A mage makes a great partner for a Shm even on the same machine.  The 61 air pet keeps aggro very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">i couldnt box the sham + wiz because they r on the same account. But yeah it is on the same machine. I have an extra computer but i would have to invest couple $100 for it.. and i have to get my pc fixed right now. Id rather just buy stuff for my pc with everquest on it now so i can 2 box on the same computer. But for the caster group.. we already have a mage and possible 2 healer (me and druid) and if the druid plays a necro instead thats 2 people that can heal themselves. The ranger can heal a little bit too.. and the mage i believe would be able to heal their pet so we r only looking at healing each others pets in the team, but since ranger might have a hard time holding aggro, i can look into making a pally, or possibly a rogue. Would a ranger be able to hold the aggro from all that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">r clerics expensive/fun..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It sounds like you may want to spend a bit of time learning other classes in the game, Exes, before you decide on what to box. Visit the class sites, read a few guides, start a few alts and level them a bit. See what you enjoy. See what abilities each class gets. Work out what you want to do and how you want to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">ive been trying to find most of the sites. im just dont wanna spend all that money to start the account for something that isnt needed for the group.. basically why im making this new account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">ok i got a different friend who is making a ranger.. just incase the necro friend doesnt get his EQ account up.. what are the pros and cons of ranger and shammy duo.. and would we be &quot;wanted&quot; if you what i meant</div></div><hr />
