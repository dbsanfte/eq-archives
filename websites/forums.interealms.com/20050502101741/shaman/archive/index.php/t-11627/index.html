<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was talked about a long time ago before I quit, and I don't know what ever happened with it, I had a bunch of points left over and trained about 30 into beg. I never saw any skill ups, I never got anything except nothing.<br />
<br />
Did verant ever come out and say, sorry this doesn't work? Why is it even there?<br />
<br />
just curiosity more than anything I guess...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a beg of 159 atm, and there are certain NPCs that if you beg them you get 1 copper or 1 silver. A good place to practice your begging is west freeport ---just kidding haha---I mean, Netherbian Lair. Beg the guards near the Nexus zoneline. They give me 1 copper/silver about 3/4 of the time.<br />
<br />
So...useful? Heck no. Does it have a function/work? Yep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it's a usless skill... Unfortunatly when new characters are made they get a new version... beg 2.0, it sends a tell to every lvl 60+ and shouts across the zone 'Have you got anything for a newbie?'</div></div><hr />

heheheheheh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dont low beg levels actually increase aggro? I remember a warrior telling me that he uses beg as another form of taunt, because if you beg enough it really pisses stuff off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It does have some minor taunt.  I'm not saying warriors aren't right when they say they need upgraded taunting, but if more of them used little tricks like this and *gasp* got rid of the wurmslayer they're mainhanding at 55+, it might not be so bad...  I'd say it definitely has a use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had a &quot;Mega Taunt Kotkey setup at one time.<br />
/attack off<br />
/doability X(beg)<br />
/attack on<br />
/doability Y(disarm)<br />
/doability Z(taunt)<br />
<br />
Seemed to work well. I never had a problem getting aggro when I needed it. Now I just use Spells like Tangling Weeds, Snare or the Old School Flamelick(havent used since I got TW).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have 200 begging.<br />
<br />
Still never gotten more than 1 copper from it, although I've heard there are places where you can get more than that (ubah).<br />
<br />
Basically, seems to be useless to me, but as a shaman using it for taunt isn't exactly advantageous.<br />
<br />
Maybe someday they'll put in a charm that is based on begging, and I can get an extra 15 hp, 3 sta, and 2 wis in my charm slot because of my uber begging skillz :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tried beg only once for fun..<br />
I was 58 is halas doing some potion in bear form..<br />
I checked how many skill point I had at guildmaster and trained beg (1 point).. I decided to try beg on my guildmaster  :( <br />
<br />
He chased me and killed me in front of the bank.<br />
When I went back in Halas, there was 20 newbie around it trying to loot that huge named grizzly corpse in front of the bank.. I invised, dragged my corpse under water, looted it and gated then camped for the day.....<br />
<br />
Beg taunt for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lanadena nods.  My monk learned recently from other monks to use the begging skill to taunt a mob off of healers.</div></div><hr />

Rofl! :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OMG<br />
<br />
Real newbies spotted not twinks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luthair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've had 200 begging for ~2 years, I got 1 silver once the rest has been coppers.<br />
<br />
I emailed something to someone at VI once and they told me it was working as intended.<br />
<br />
Imo it should be like PP except maybe through CHA (low, high whatever) into the mix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">t does have some minor taunt.

<br />
<br />
Most warriors do use all sorts of little tricks just like this to keep aggro. It doesn't change how bad warrior taunt is. This is the only real use for beg in game, to help a gimped out tank class get/maintain aggro.<br />
<br />
Eldril..if, as a ranger, you are using beg to taunt..well..you might wanna look into aggro a bit and find out what gets it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Begging is for:<br />
1) getting true n00bs killed: &quot;Go beg from the guards - they always hand out good stuff to beggars&quot;<br />
<br />
2) Swapping tall tales.  Rumors abounded near release of EQ that you could beg decent items from mobs.  One example was the cutthroat rings from the dervish.<br />
<br />
3) Something to do with your pet while waiting for inc.  You won't ever get anything, but your skill goes up.<br />
<br />
4) Maxxing yet another completely useless skill.</div></div><hr />
