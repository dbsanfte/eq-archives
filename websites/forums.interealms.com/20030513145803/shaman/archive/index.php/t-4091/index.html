I m a lvl 55 shammy and new on Luclin. I went and checked out Fungus but almost everyone was lvl 60 and no group was interested to have a newbie (lvl 55) in their group.<br />
<br />
Where in Luclin should I go to be appriciated in a group in my lvl and still get some decent exp?<br />
<br />

<br />
Im not to familiar w/ higher end luclin...but many 55's hunt in maidens, or so im led to believe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with Xertt, although i don't have a toon anywhere near 55, most of my guildmates who are around that level hunt in Maiden's Eye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't have to get in pickup groups much anymore.  Have a pretty solid group I run around with now.  So take this with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
About the only place I actually see people lfg is probably Maidens Eye.  I'm not sure how successful those people are at finding them however.  They seem to be looking for awhile.<br />
<br />
Akheva is pretty good xp, although not much in the way of loot.  It's pretty much a bring your own group kind of place, unless you are a wizard kiting at the entrance.<br />
<br />
Acrylia isn't bad xp either, but it's DEFINATELY a bring your own group kind of place as well.  And I have yet to see a drop of any sort, except an occasional gem, acrylia, or the black acrylia (used for making the smithed weapons)<br />
<br />
Those are my favorite xp spots in Luclin.  I can take Maidens Eye in small doses.  The last time or two I've been there, it looked like the Karnor's Castle crowds might have gone back to Karnors.  You weren't trained 2 seconds after zoning in.<br />
<br />
I try to avoid Fungus Grove when I can.  The caller quest there is fun, but I haven't seen any large rewards for doing it.  We farm the lotus things occasionally for the potc quest.  But shrooms and bandits have to be some of the most boring xp on the planet.  I'm not sure how many people actually look for and actually find groups here though.<br />
<br />
The grey is an outdoor airless zone, and alot of the stuff is easily soloable at 55.  I dont see any pickup groups there though.  The xp is beaten quite handily (for me anyway, your mileage may vary) by Akheava and Acrylia.  I'd stay away from the Shissar unless you have a jbb or epic  (I don't have a jbb, so I don't know if they hit for full damage.  I just know they were a rough solo until I got my epic, being almost, but not totally, immine to poison and disease)<br />
<br />
All that is on xegony btw.  Your server might be different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zooilogical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IF you have a JBB you can solo in Fungus pretty easy. I usually group up with a monk friend and we get killer experience there. Stick with the shrooms, level 60 can solo pull them every time, they spend 80 percent of their time casting their stupid little spells which I resist 99 percent of the time with Talis of Epur and MR on. They really don't melee for much , and they don't resist JBB very often. I've spent my share of time in Maidens , but compared to Fungus mobs they are alot tougher, hit harder etc.<br />
Also trains in Fungus are VERY rare , atleast when I've been there anyways .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dunno about the rest of ya'll,  but at 55 I found soloing in ME and FG very hard.  even with JBB/Horse.  Mobs in ME have at least 8k hp.  They have somewhat high MR for me,  I have trouble landing slows on some of them without malosi.  It takes me about 60 mana to solo one.  I takes me 2 ebolts, plauge, and tons or rounds of JBB + dog dog hasted.  Maybe even an ice blast or two thrown in to end it  when dot run out or so.  And this was on a gatherer in ME,  I would hate to see how hard it would of been aganist a hunter or something higher level.  <br />
<br />
ME is a great zone for loot,  but for exp,  I think it blows.  It moves very slow,  thee are eazier mobs to kill with less HP for their level i.e. Katta guards :)</div></div><hr />
