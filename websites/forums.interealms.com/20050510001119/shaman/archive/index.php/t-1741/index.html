<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ulthaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering how this worked, i'm not using this to scam - just interested as a friend was asking about it recently..<br />
<br />
If someone else has your account and they have changed the email, password, address etc etc, how do u go about retrieving the account?<br />
<br />
I heard it is something to do with using the original CD keys, any info on this would be great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe you have to know the credit card number to retrieve an account. I could be wrong though. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having your CD key is certainly helpful, as is having the credit card account. the CD key is tied directly to your account, so it is a guaranteed way to prove ownership, unless of course... you gave that away too =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wouldn't VI ask you why another person has your account in the first place?<br />
<br />
I thought they were pretty strict about sharing accounts.<br />
<br />
Also, I know you are saying you're not trying to scam anyone, but if you are, think about the fact that he can and probably will press charges and file with the FBI if you did indeed sell the account.<br />
<br />
Not sure what can be done after that, just heard a few stories of this happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've read the fraud messageboard at Playerauctions.com a few times.<br />
<br />
Apparently, the FBI won't do anything unless it's worth at least $10,000, if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
Several people who have been scammed post there, they contacted the FBI, and that's what they were told.<br />
<br />
Besides that, there's just too much hassle in dealing with account selling.<br />
<br />
Ask here for more details:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not the best place for this ... but since it just happened .. i'm complaining to my fellow shammies....<br />
<br />
Had a RL friend loose his character/account because of VI gay-azz rules....  <br />
<br />
Friend 1 was done because his wife said no more... Friend 2 was just getting into the game... So Friend 2 takes over the monthly billing of Friend1's account .. No other money changed hands nor were there any characters on Friend1's account .. In essence, Friend2 got an empty account...  Only thing VI lost out on was the Original/Kunark/Velious media costs(which is now a whopping $30)  However, VI does continue to receive the monthly revenue stream as well as any new media/upgrades(ie luclin and soon PoP).... <br />
<br />
So anyways, a problem with Friend2 bank and the BANK screwed up and cause the account to suspend due to non-payment... Friend2 gets Bank to fix the error.. and calls VI.... Welp, VI does a bit of digging and decides that since Friend2 isnt the original owner to shutoff the account.  Thats screwed up ... Now VI just lost out on monthly revenue to an account, VI lost a loyal fan, and Friend2 lost out on CD cost,  time, and a game he enjoyed...<br />
<br />
Sometimes VI's rule are just fooxed</div></div><hr />
