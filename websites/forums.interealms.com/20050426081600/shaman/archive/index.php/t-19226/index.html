<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im just curious on where a good place to grind out some AAs would be...... I am currentley level 65 with 6 AA's any suggestions on group or soloable places for some fast AA would be greatly appreciated... I currentley dont have any ele flags so im stuck to normal tier 3 planes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tactics, Valor and Droga... all solo-able and groupable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Droga will net you about 2% per kill iirc in some areas (like around Runri).  Inner Acrylia is also very good solo XP.  I get about 25% of an AA in about 90min iirc.  I found Inner Acrylia to be a bit easier than Droga personally, but the few hours I've camped the Arcanist room, I've never gotten a named.  I've had better luck with named pops in Droga.  I've never tried soloing Valor and I am not tactics flagged, so i can't speak for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I have a little time to kill (while waiting for a group) or when playing&amp;babysitting, I always solo in PoN. The Treants/ravens/spiders just north or south of zone in gives almost 2% AA per kill.<br />
<br />
I can gain around 40% of an AA in one hour, which is OK for me. But do not go there if you are after loot - these mobs rarely drops anything at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LDoN man, with only 6aa i am guessing your not overly geared...why AA anywhere else since you can AA while you work your way to gear /shrug.  I have ep access and tend to do most of my aaing in ldon.<br />
<br />
solo=HoH/tactics/bees in bot....best solo xp at your stage imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">currentley starting to off and on LDoN in Everfrost for the spectre armor , its not as fast as grouping in BoT or HoH though almost like its not really worth the time because the amount of xp is so low...but then again the rewards at the end are sweet......im thinking about AAing like BoT or HoH untill i have Canni 5 because not being able to sit on my lizard in the dungeons really hurts with only canni 4 and stoicism......any other suggestions ?</div></div><hr />

BOT might be a bit faster AA, but with no real long term benefit, unless you get lucky on rolling for drops, or don't have some tard claiming NBG on every item that drops.<br />
<br />
I only AA in LDON if possible.  With the right group, I get 40% AA per LDON, average 40 minutes or so.  It might be a tad slower than BOT all things considered, but the rewards in the long term far outweigh the difference, IMO.  EF gear is on par with EP/ornate drops, and with the right augs, can be very rocking gear indeed.  Impatient types can do GUK gear for 1/2 the price and about 70% of the quality gear.  Bane is a solid upgrade, useful in normal exp groups.<br />
<br />
Anyone that says LDON sucks is crazy.  Decent AA, very good gear (if time consuming), moderate loot (150ish pp per LDON), easy to find groups as a shaman.  Can be done on those nights when play time is limited as well.  Only got 2 hours?  Grab an LDON group chain 2 back-to-back.  80% AA, 300pp, and 1/15th the way to a nice item/spell.  Best recent expansion by far (since Velious).  Bitch all you want about the repetitiveness of it, this is EQ, the whole game is about doing the same thing over and over.<br />
<br />
Outside of raids or key camping, I haven't left LDON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah I'm with Galelor here, LdoN is where its at for AA exp. On a good mission you make about 70% of a point, get a chance at some loot, make some coin and earn points. Plus if you do Hard missions, you get a chance at much better loot, make about 85% of an AA and way more points. Best bang for your buck for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I ding an AA every other mission, and it is at least over 50% AA for each LDoN. For boredom, I suggest switching missions around a bit until you have at least 500 in each. Priorities for me are Bane, 650 in Rujarkian, and then the Spell Haste IV augment in Rujarkian for 1150. It is also really great to do a couple back to back. At 65, 7 aa's, and still missing a few spells, and modest equipment (guild working NToV--my only drop though is Bracelet of the Sky), I was comletely under equipped for the single hard adventure a few groupmates insisted upon trying. <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to sound mean but how did you get to 65 without Canni V and Torpor or even just Torpor.<br />
Torpor isnt that hard to get these days with the new Research and the price has gone down to at least 8-10k on my server.<br />
My suggestion would be that you go to Acrylica Caverns Zin or Primalist camps and just farm as much runes and weapons for vendor trash, Prismatic Acrylica shards for the 750pp quest and acrylica bricks and maybe few drops off primalist and then /trader while you sleep. I usually average about 1-2k in runes/weapons, 1-2k in acrylica bricks from trader, and maybe 1-2 drops off primalist in the time Virtue lasts. Who knows you might get lucky that the Evolved Burrower spawns and the Shaman from the group killing him doesnt need the Primal Cudgel (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8973)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i got 65 in like 3 weeks with out a PL... hehe was weird but i didnt care for anything but levels and then quit and started playing him again ... and FYI i have been doing some LDoNs because i saw some of the EF adventure armor hehe and have 10 AAs now =p oh and Torpor is 20k on our server and Q is sometimes 80k...rediculous</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah I can vouch for all those saying that getting Torpor and Canni V will change the way you can play. I nuke a lot more now than I used to and when I am grouped with a cleric that has lots of extra mana I use canni V as soon as it pops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hail,<br />
<br />
PoN Hedge event (solo) is also decent AA exp - much better than trees &amp; such in the rest of the zone.  It is safer too.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Interesting Idea - Any more info?  Do you just zone in and then ignore the NPC or do you actually try and keep him alive (not sure how you'd deal with the multipops).</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
<br />
I ignore the NPC.  One time, for kicks, I started the script (inside the Hedge) just to see how far I could go.  I made it to the second wave and died there.  Not recommended. :D <br />
<br />
There are plenty of static spawns that will respawn before you can clear them all out.  Basically you just cycle through them.  I marked each static spawn on my map w/ a label so I could find them again easily.<br />
<br />
Last time I was there I picked up a ribbon choker to sell as well.  The drops won't make you rich (a diamond, peridot or other gem here &amp; there, some bloodraven parts, etc), but it is steady exp that is SIMPLE and you have no concerns over pacing yourself, getting trained, or have to deal with any outside interference.  There are only 1-2 spots in the whole maze where you can't easily (w/o any effort) single pull.  Getting to the maze is more difficult than soloing inside in my opinion. :p <br />
<br />
I would imagine it would also be an excellent spot to help a lower levelled friend with no flags get some great exp.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I do most of my AA grinding in LDoN right now.  It just makes sense while I work on replacing some of my gear and picking up my spells.  I average an AA every other adventure or so.  When I get absolutely sick of LDoN I mainly do POV or BOT pickups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Tactics.  With the proper motiviation, I can easily pound out an aa every 45 minutes.  Besides the exp, on Zeb at least, Tactics is almost empty all the time.  Beyond that, dedication to the Piggy can net you 100k(on Zeb) per 12 hour stint.</div></div><hr />
