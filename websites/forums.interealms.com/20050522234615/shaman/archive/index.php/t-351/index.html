Anyway I return to find a new board, nice, but I'm acutely aware that I hadnt managed to update the slows table from the thread before I went and I havent had much time yet to look around and see if anythings been salvaged from the old board.<br />
<br />
So, anyone happen to have recent copy of the thread or is it time to start a new one (or has someone?) and if so, any particular forum?</div></div><hr />

Yeah that's Seredith's website, I think she was asking if anyone had a copy of the latest additions to the thread before it was wiped out.<br />
<br />

Ack, I had no idea it was Seredith's website.  Hehe.  Sorry Seredith.  But since I know who the author is now, let me take this time to say THANK YOU!!!  That site is so much more convenient then sifting through the old threads.<br />
<br />
THANK YOU!!!!<br />
<br />
and Thanks Henora for pointing that out to me!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sontalak is confirmed (by client) no longer slowable. He was too gimpy after he stopped being able to dispel it off. People got about a week of super easy sont between fixes tho ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, looks like you folks are happy to pick up where we left off, it might mean some of you who originally mentioned updates at the end of the old thread don't get the credit if someone else mentions them, sorry :/<br />
<br />
Lets start a fresh thread then, how about in the spells forum so it's less likely to get scrolled into oblivion.<br />
