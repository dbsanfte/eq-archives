<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it worth $2600?<br />
<br />
Ok heres the AMD system. Obviously any critiques or help in selection / components that I may of missed or you suggest please tell me. I was amazed that this system is coming in at near the cost of my pent system..price on pent system above isnt adjusted for a video card but was allowing close to $600 for it.<br />
<br />
Case: Thermal Take 7000<br />
Power: Enermax 600W Noisetaker<br />
MB: Asus&quot;k8vse deluxe&quot;<br />
CPU: ADA 3400+<br />
Ram: 2gig(1gig X 2) Corsair DDR400 xtrm<br />
Video: Asus Nvidia Geforce 6800 Ultra<br />
256mb<br />
Sound: CLSBA2ZS<br />
Network: Intel Pro 10/100/1000<br />
HD: 160 Seagate SATA 7200rpm<br />
DVD: Sony INternatl 16X DVD+RW<br />
CD: Sony Internal CD-RW<br />
Floppy: Mitsumi 1.44<br />
Mouse: Logitech Blueperformance<br />
OS: Win XP Pro...<br />
<br />
I decided at last minute to change from the ADA3700 to the ADA3400 to save the $190 as the system was approaching my limit.<br />
<br />
However, with what I have left I can go with 2 80gig Seagates in a raid formation..that will push the cost right to my limit. Or I can leave the 160 maybe save towards a monitor....this system is about 400 less and has better reviews..God know I've learned a bunch load of crud about computers parts tonight, and i bet i still have some incompatable parts listed above.<br />
<br />
This comptuer btw will have my current, monitor, speakers, and wife to yell at me recycled.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help and input on this system....critiques or additions/subtractions are most welcomed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I assume the CPU is 64-bit (not sure what ADA is)?  Either way though, IMHO, it isn't worth it.  Go down to your local bookstore or wherever, and pick up one of those hardcore PC magazines.  Maximum PC is a good one, for instance.  It will cost you a little under $10, but hey you are buying a $2600 computer so ... (also if you want you can just read it in the store).  Anyhow, all those mags do reviews of new high-end gaming computers, but more importantly they have a metric assload of advertisements (usually toward the back) from computer companies.  The Maximum PC in front of me for instance had 8 pages of just the kind of ad where they list multiple systems, with various configurations at various prices, plus a few more pages thta only had a single system on them.<br />
<br />
However, if you really want to get the best system for your money, I think you should build it yourself.  Now, I personally am comfortable with doing anything except soddering (sp?) random weird cooling sstems on to my MB.  I'm guessing you aren't.  Still, if you shop around (especially if you are lucky enough to have a major computer store like Fry's nearby) you can probably find a package that gives you the case with a power source, fans, motherboard, and CPU already installed.  All you have to add then is your drives, your RAM, and your AGP/PCI cards, all of which just involve just pushing components in to slots, or connecting ribbon cables from a drive to your MB (well, that and a bunch of screwdriver work).<br />
<br />
If you want to go that route, I suggest using sites like tomshardware.com and cnet.com to review various parts, and sites like techbargains.com and CNet's price comparison thing to find the best deals.  But however you end up doing it, good luck building/buying your new system :)<br />
<br />
P.S.  If you want to just buy your system techbargains.com, CNet, and other price comparison sites can be useful too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">oh sorry lol ment to say this is the systme i'm wanting to build myself.  i spent about 3 days looking up information of amds and compatable hardware.  I learned alot of things such as an AMD 64 3200+ ,such as the chip I have listed here, is not a 3.2ghz chip.  It actually runs at 2.4 ghz but is more effecient in the way it handls things.  Unlike the pent 4 chips that arent as effecient even though they can attain higher speeds.<br />
<br />
This system is still about $700 cheaper then what my local retailer will make it for me.  I just need to find out what parts you would reduce or you think isnt needed before i do.   Would be my first computer I built but I have friends whho are going to help me.<br />
