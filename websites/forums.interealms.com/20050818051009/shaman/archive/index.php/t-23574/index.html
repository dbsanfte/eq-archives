Poisonmaking and alchemy will have a {cough} few more marketable items than they did before, as they take basic player-made augments and make them significantly better. (Yes, I have a talent for understatement - only a &quot;few&quot;. Just like that was a &quot;small&quot; train by a bard being chased by half the zone population ...) <br />
<br />
I'll believe it when i see it, but looks promising...<br />

<br />
I kinda like that idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/auc WTS +2 STR aug, cost 10K to make!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol... take note that we take player made auguments and make them better, making us rely on another tradeskill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lol... take note that we take player made auguments and make them better, making us rely on another tradeskill<br />
<br />
I'd like to think of it as making other players put some effort on their own tradeskills if they want some.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, if the materials required are rare enough, they might well equal the quality of PoP tradeskill items without killing the market for them. The GoD weapons were good as well, but the stuff needed to make them is just far too common for the quality of the goods they produced. Some of the GoD JC raw materials are rare as heck, but they just produce junk. GoD TS wasn't very consistent at all from that perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow, this could be really fun if we could imbue effects into augments.<br />
<br />
Like take a +6 str aug and fuse it with a levitate potion? So you end up creating an aug that imbues levitation?<br />
<br />
I really hope its not just stats and stuff.<br />
<br />
EQTraders also mentioned custom titles based your tradeskills, as well as AA's that give you a chance to avoid losing components on combine failures.<br />
<br />
Wonder if my title can be &quot;Grand Poopah Potioneer Heyokah Ungkor&quot; lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If the ability to create or modify augments was Alchemy only, then yes, that'd be cool.  Give the chanters their jewelry, I'll take augments any day of the week, and twice on tuesday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe it will have augs that have &quot;charges&quot;, so instead of using potions from inventory, you use them in gear slots. Maybe the augs will have stats too, that degrade as the charges get used. <br />
<br />
Has potential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ya, that would probably work. But, it would in essence be potions in your armor, which would be pointless since we allready have potions  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ya, that would probably work. But, it would in essence be potions in your armor, which would be pointless since we allready have potions  :D<br />
Yes, but I am thinking NOW, an aug has, say, 5 charges of Gate, AND +5 str, sta, dex, +20 hp/Mana. Each time a charge is used, you lose 20% on the stats. After you use the last charge, it poofs. Make em LORE, maybe.<br />
<br />
I dunno, just bouncing around ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its probably more likely a case of augs being made through some tradeskill with basic stats, and then &quot;imbued&quot; with some magical effect using some rare drop and alchemy. So the final product would require you to assemble it through multiple tradeskills with increasingly rare components. Sort of like mini-Aid Grimmel quests, but with tradeable outcomes. That would be neat.<br />
<br />
I guess that there are a lot of things they could do along those lines, and make good use of tradeskills as part of the itemization process. We'll have to wait and see how much imagination they have ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">augs are no drop.. how exactly do we take someone elses augs and imbue them? <br />
<br />
aug trading exploits inc!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Current augs are no drop, but that doesn't mean they cant make tradeable ones in the future. They wouldnt be the current augs anyway, they could be ones made using tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have a quick though it on this subject<br />
<br />
- Aug drops - still no drop<br />
- Shaman picks up<br />
- using alchemy skill improves the aug<br />
- New Aug created which is now dropable<br />
<br />
This means that we will need to win the Aug drops and will need to be one of the ones that someone wants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ya, but Denmom said player made augs, so unless she misunderstood what was said during her tour, we will be getting tradeskill made ones, and those are the ones which will be enhanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I like Tug's idea.<br />
<br />
Augs made by players, any player, with certain TSs like Pottery, Smithing, whatever. These should be NO DROP, I think.<br />
<br />
Augs enhanced by a Shaman potion. Potion is tradable. Aug from player is NO-FAIL combine in whatever medium was used to create the original aug. <br />
<br />
So a player can make his own +10 ac aug. If he wants it bigger, or to have more stuff like some HPs or Mana, Shaman potion does that. <br />
<br />
Maybe the potion will combine augs into one. A +10 ac aug, a 20/20 hp/mana aug, rather than taking up 2 gear slots, Shaman potion combines them into 1 aug.<br />
<br />
The possibilities are exciting, but for some reason, I am pretty sure SOE will drop the ball on this. Dunno why I could posibly feel that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Player1: Dude you gotta enahnce this HP 50 Mana 50 FT 3 Aug i gots!!!<br />
Alchemyvictim: Ok hand it over and i'll mix it with this uber potion that costs 2300k to make<br />
<br />
*poof*<br />
<br />
Player1: Dude where's my aug?????<br />
Alchemyvictim: Um 2300k pls...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I can see tradable augs if they're like required level 66....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Player made augs are attunable..they are droppable till equipped. there is also a portable aug box that can be bought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'll believe it when I see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">And dropped augs will follow the fine tradition of being 50x better than anything any player can make.<br />
<br />
The alchemy components will be on the forage table, and the poisonmaking components will be left off all loot / merchant / forage tables.<br />
<br />
They will destroy the item they are augged to if you try to remove them, for the first three months of the expansion. They will then change this, saying they thought it was a freat feature that brought in item decay, but because they love the players SOOOO much...<br />
<br />
Player-made augs will also be no-drop, while the alchemy additives will be combinable by any schmo with a potion bag. Thus druids will be making most &quot;potions&quot;.<br />
<br />
You will also need enchanted velium to begin any augment.<br />
<br />
(Hey, now anything else will look great by comparison!)</div></div><hr />
