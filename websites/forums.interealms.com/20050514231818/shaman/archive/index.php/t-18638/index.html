<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was bored today, so I was walkin around Norrath beating on small and helpless furry creatures with my sharkspide club. While FAing myself, I noticed that my yellow stamina bar dropped by about 5%.<br />
<br />
Naturally, I was alarmed, since this can only mean two things -- either FA raises the max stamina bar, or it takes Stamina to cast. Since the second posibility really do not make any sense at all, which is SoE's trademark when implimenting features, I decided to do a little test.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the results showed that FA does not, in fact, take Stamina to cast, but it does raise max Stamina bar. So, with some further testing, I've discovered that the Stamina bar is based on a combination of Str, Dex, Sta, and Agi. Each one of these stats increase the max stamina pool.<br />
<br />
The test itself was easy -- cast each stat buff on yourself, note Stamina bar change, click off the buff, note change again.<br />
<br />
No, it's not a spectacular discovery, but knowledge never hurts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is no longer a stamina bar, it is an endurence bar.  And yes, you are right, endurence pool is based on all 4 melee stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your endurance pool grew by that much as a result of whatever additional stats you gained up to the cap because of FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your tests are correct - a Sony dev posted on the warrior boards a while back that your endurance pool is based on str, dex, sta, and agi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was picking up some spells for my new cleric, and noticed the spell Extinguish Fatigue now says it replenishes Endurance, instead of Stamina.  Not sure if anyone else had noticed this or not, or tested it out...if so that puts the Endurance regen capability in several classes.</div></div><hr />
