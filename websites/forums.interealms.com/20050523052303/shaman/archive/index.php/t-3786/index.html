<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I returned to ToV HoT with my guild last night.  I missed the phase when they were really hitting ToV hard, but I have nonetheless made many many trips.  We've started going more often trying to get some alts and new people geared up.<br />
<br />
Last night, in 8 hours there, we got about the following:<br />
<br />
Plate:  5  (including leggings)<br />
Leather: 2 (including leggings) (thse guys usually get stuck pretty badly too)<br />
Silk: 4<br />
Chain: 1 (boots, which I already had)<br />
<br />
Last week, there were NO chain drops.  I died 4 or 5 times.  These figures are typical.  So far, in all my trips, I have rolled on 3 items and have only boots to show for it.  It reminds me of hate when we could spend ungodky amounts of time there with few or no Shaman drops while we were knee deep in cleric armor.<br />
<br />
At this stage of the game, is it even worth it to continue to farm ToV?  It just seems like he drops ae REALLY stingy for the turnout you have to have to get at them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HoT chain drops just suk..period...great for stats if u got the time to farm it....but with wtov..chain drops like rain(although not as much as silk) and the difference in stats.. i believe is negligible and made up for with nicer drops in off<br />
slots (shield...waist...range...neck..ears..rings etc...) from the luclin loot table...<br />
<br />
<br />
so basically u are able to get best AC possible with Kael armor and your stats are very comparable (if not better) to full SS as long as you are hitting luclin bosses and mini bosses for their loot table also<br />
<br />
imo dont fret that u are not getting lots of SS as long as ur guild has a plan to eventually move to wtov...ur gear will fill in nicely</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was in HoT on Thursday night: 2 Silk, 2 Leather, 5 Plate, 0 Chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One thing I have noticed about HoT is that everyone quotes time there, but not the amount of mobs killed.  The thing is, this is something that varies from guild to guild greatly.  I have raided with EXPERIENCED HoT guilds that kill mobs at a snails pace, and complain about the slow drop rate, and I have raided with guilds that clear the entire wing in 45 mins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe you already do this, and you have really bad luck, but it  might be some helpful advice:<br />
<br />
If you want your drop rates to increase, you need to kill mobs faster.  The easiest way to do this is to NOT camp the entrance pit.  If your pullers have to pull every single mob from across the zone, they are wasting valuable time that you could be killiing things.  Not to mention the risk of a mob gating on you, or getting repoped add on the way back.<br />

<br />
Why would a guild that is already established as a CoV  guild, and is to the point that they are farming armor for their ALTS, go through the effort to switch factions, only to get armor that is basically equal to the armor they get now.  I can see switching factions when its time to move on to NtoV, as that would be a step forward, not a step backwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well i was assuming that his guild of course had bigger plans and wants to eventually move into the end game...if they do then my point still stands...if they are not interested in the end game than it was a bad assumption by me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Remember that Wurms are the chief armor droppers. WToV has a LOT more wurms then the HoT. Because of that, WToV Drop Rates &gt; HoT Drop Rates.<br />
<br />
HoT drop rates are also EXTREMELY random. I've been on HoT raids where no more then 5 items dropped. And just when you think that's common, it does a 180 on you... I recall a HoT raid with 50+ drops on it... no joke. It's all luck, really. On the HoT raid where I got my BP, we had a total of three Chain BP's drop by the end.<br />
<br />
Ahh yes, the Elder Shard Wyverns (white color) ALWAYS AND ONLY drop chain. (At least, from what I have seen.) Nab your puller in the side to make sure those get priority when pulling. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">for a guild that is farming HoT for their ALT characters, Wtov is not a step forward.  It is a parallel move, and when you think about the time required to switch factions, then it is a step backwards, because the same guild could have moved on to other things, that would have been a step forward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guild does tov very regularly. about twice a week.<br />
<br />
We have gotten 1 mage robe, 3 plate legs, 1 leather leg, 1 silk robe, 5 chain bracer, 3 chain boots, 2 chain BPs, 1 chain helm, 3 plate helms, and even more that I can't remember. Generally we get 2 chain pieces for 1 drop of any other type.<br />
Great drops imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">stick it out.<br />
<br />
personally, i think leather drops are about the same as chain drops in HoT. depends on the day what you see more of really.<br />
<br />
i've camped my arse in hot, and nothing pleases me more than when i finally get a new piece. just missing legs and BP now for my set :D<br />
<br />
it's worth it in the end, when i finally get my BP, it'll be one of the greatest things i've ever done in EQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
good luck with it. and may Tunare guide your monk to the mobs with that umm...chainy feeling in they tummy :D</div></div><hr />
