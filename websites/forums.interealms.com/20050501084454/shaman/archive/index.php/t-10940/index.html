<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Its going to be a while before my guild gets there and i was told there is a alternative quest that is alot easier but doesnt let you fight the end boss or soemthing like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont care about bosses , i care about specs and runes ;)<br />
<br />
anything i  find is very vague and doesnt even say what you need.<br />
<br />
<br />
thnx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">gotta kill diaku raiders for a rare drop in desert of PoStorms IIRC, need 4 pieces of a talisman..... hand them to Askr I think.... was a thread on the safehouse about it<br />
<br />
maybe that was another quest completely though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kill Diaku raiders in PoS ... thats all I know ... u gotta gather some ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yea i just found the quest finaly , thnx .<br />
<br />
you guyz know if the rumor that the diaku aggro all creatures around them  when you attack , is true ?<br />
<br />
i cant find levels or attack type on them , but they are blue to me.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse theonly resource i know is allak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oaks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hand 4 pieces into the gnome, not askr.  also, every mob around them used to assist, i'm not sure if they still do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">rofl, div's post was up under mine when I hit post, so I guess we're probably right if we guessed the same thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Diaky Raiders = uncommon spawn on the 'animal' (snake, scorpion, clouds and cacti) spawn table.<br />
Pieces of Medaillon = uncommon drop from the Raider. The common drop is 'nothing at all'<br />
<br />
4 pieces medaillons, three of them seem 'common'. The last one, of course, is rare. <br />
<br />
You don't turn them to Askr (that's the BoT key) but to a gnome in the same caves. The combination of uncommon/rare drops from an uncommon spawn makes that pretty much another SOE bad joke, mind you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Raiders are rare and spawn all over the desert. They are KoS and desert trash assists them. Some are SKs with a nice 1k HT. Not terribly resistant to spells. They are ogre's btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am flagged for Tactics, and I did it through the Diaku quest. The Diaku raiders are in the Plane of Storms desert. They are around level 60 and are an easy kill for any group that would be there. They are KoS to all, so will aggro on you. Everything in the PoStorms desert (Snakes, Scorpions, Cactuses, etc.) will assist them. Regular desert mobs appear to be placeholders for Diaku.<br />
<br />
We took a single group to the desert and did exp there for many many days. We ultimately killed enough Diaku to get all 6 of us keyed, and we have now moved on to Tactics. FD pulling (or some other way to ditch unwanted aggro), and tracking are highly desired to attempt this.<br />
<br />
This is a very long road, since less than 50% of the Diaku actually drop a key piece, and you need 4 distinct key pieces.<br />
<br />
Unless you have a very committed and talented regular group, I would not bother with this quest. You will need to bring your own group to Tactics, since it is not a pickup zone (at least not on Quellious).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">my understanding is that there are soloable parts tothis zone , it was also expressed to me that a shaman can solo named there for runes , is this true ?<br />
<br />
But yea ,pi do intend on flaging more then just myself. The goal is to get me and my guild runes. I mean ic ant be greedy heh , i only need 5 spells or whatever anyway ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">pretty sure drops there got nerfed beyond usefulness Lit, but I missed our behemoth run so that's 2nd hand info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">damn them. Im so sick of fighting over 4 spawns every 6 hours in BoT , now that everyone and their mother are flaged for there , getting a rune is a bitch. i got 1 a month or 2 ago and havent seen one since ( mostly bad rolls to be truthful).  Dont care if i cant solo but for crying  outloud , let me get some damned  runes !!!!<br />
<br />
/deep breathe ...<br />
<br />
im ok now =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">could be like terris Lit, 2 enchanters take turns timing the nameds, plus all the groups that try to fight the chanters for them.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">usualy a cleric enchanter and mage on my server =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aye Drunder drops arent to good anymore.  there was a week or two around christmas when stuff droped like candy.  now spectrals drop rarely and runes drop like never, though i have seen one drop off an enraged war boar in the arena.  if you are going just for spells will be tough.<br />
<br />
As for soloing.  you can techincly solo stuff in the arena but they all hit hard and have a lot of HP.  i duoed with a cleric the other night (to get him last few blues for lvl) and it was prettyslow going i used a lot of mana to dot stuff down etc and he was healing me still had to refresh slow once i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">SO basicly , i should just give up and buy the spells lol.  /sigh<br />
<br />
what is wrong with letting us get our spells ? <br />
meh ok , well maybe ill do it for fun and just exploration ebfore i get whinny about this ;)<br />
<br />
thnx for the feedback guys , was a big help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the mini named in BoT drops specs a lot.. and he's easy to beat down.. has a very short pop time too :)  I think his name was Lief.. Leif.. something like that =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">dont want specs ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Names don't seem to be any more common in PoT, and arena exp's comparable to PoV if you solo, or BoT/CoD if you charm.<br />
<br />
Random stuff on the way to TZ and VZ drop runes, proximately one in 200 kills. Most of the mobs can be handled by an exp group--but it's going to suck exp wise, and the group has to be above average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">it was also expressed to me that a shaman can solo named there for runes , is this true ?<br />
<br />
You were expressed to incorrectly. A charming enchanter *MIGHT* be able to pull this off (personally, I doubt it). Odds of a shaman taking down (or even getting to) one of the rune dropping nameds in Tactics is remote at best.<br />
<br />
Best bet would be in the pit, but the drop rate there has been nerfed at least twice. Stuff on the way to TZ/VZ is not possible for a shaman to solo. (Quadding 700 hitters with partial mitigation and 40k+hp, some of whom split at low health, and others do knockback/dispels).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">then why have shaman here claimed to do it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Because the named that USED to drop runes were soloable by a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">3 weeks, 4-5 hours a day...<br />
<br />
<br />
1 rune off an arena named, and I think an ornate plate helm.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is 21x5 hours spent camping this area (grped of course).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5 overseer kills<br />
<br />
<br />
2 chain bps<br />
1 crap<br />
2 runes<br />
<br />
<br />
Anival (?) 1 rune<br />
<br />
Shadow Master Vinta (?) 1 rune, 1 earring.<br />
<br />
TZ / VZ rune about 1 in 3 times<br />
<br />
The recuso named killed him once dropped rune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Have been working on this quest for a while with my group. Out of 27 diaku raiders have only gotten 5 total quest pieces so the drop rate isnt very good or else our luck sucks. Not one completed key yet after over a month of hitting this place 2-3 times a week for 2 to 5 hours at a stretch. At this rate my group will be fully keyed in roughly 8 months, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Just a confirmation Jeraem . . . any desert mob = ph for daiku raider?  Was my understanding that those raiders were on timed spawns  . . . if that's not true then that makes the quest much more reasonable for anyone willing to grind out the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Dont think they are timed, just purely random. Had days without a single Diaku Raider and days with three or four Raiders.<br />
<br />
Yesterday we had two Raiders spawning directly one after the other at the same spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Havent figured out if they have a PH or timed. Seems fairly random, I really dont know. Had similar experiences to Enkebesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You have bad luck with runes, Lenine.  My guild has killed Tallon and Vallon zek probably close to 25 times now between the two of them. 1 rune, 4 spectrals, EVERY time.<br />
<br />
Occasionally we'll get a couple extra (spectrals mostly, don't think we've gotten a rune) while clearing the way to there, but that's pretty rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The BIG issue is that I've heard that if you want to kill TZ/VZ and get those flags, you can't advance unless you kill MB, no matter if you did the daiku quest or not!  So SolRo tower =&gt; elemental planes are off limits if you haven't killed MB, making this quest so not worth doing.<br />
Specially since tactics sux for rune droppage anymore. <br />
<br />
Tell me if I'm wrong about this.  I hope I am, but I fear I am not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Side quests just let you enter the zone. They dont do anything for the normal progression. Just a bone to people not doing the guild thing like me so this expansion isnt quite totally worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The alternate pop quests are asinine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The alternate pop quests are asinine.<br />
<br />
I disagree. It really depends upon what game you are playing. For my guild, these alternate quests ARE the PoP storyline. We dislike huge 100 person raids, and have no intention of ever going to zones like the elemental planes or vexthal. So - zones like PoTactics are the endgame for us.<br />
<br />
A single committed and talented group who works together can complete these quests in a reasonable amount of time. We spent probably 24 game hours exping in the PoStorms desert to key up 6 of us for Tactics. Time well spent, IMO. Half of you spent longer than that camping vexthal shards in non-exp zones.<br />
<br />
Now we have an exp zone with access to ornate molds, runes, and spectrals almost entirely to ourselves. We are just now starting to explore PoTactics, so I can't really comment on drop rates and hunting spots too much yet.</div></div><hr />
