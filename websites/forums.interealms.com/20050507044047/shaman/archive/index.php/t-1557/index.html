<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just how good is the kitties as a shamy?  If I was going to start an evil char anyways whats the pros/cons?  was previously thinking of making troll shamy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As for your second question, faction is not as big of a deal as it once was if you have Velious and Luclin (even Kunark isn't that bad). The best thing that Trolls get (along with Iksars) is improved natural regeneration. Troll regeneration probably isn't going to save you during a fierce battle, but over the lifetime of the character it really adds up. The biggest downside to being a Troll is the experience penalty: it is definitely there and it is noticeable. Starting Wisdom is also the lowest of the Shaman races, though personally I don't think this is that big of a deal. Starting Stamina, on the other hand, is pretty good.<br />
<br />
I've been very happy with my Troll Shaman, and the only other race I'd consider playing, were I forced to start another character, would be an Ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is generally considered that trolls are the best shaman race. Faction is not much of an issue, although it is noticable, mostly when going to the trade center of the server and trying to bank. If you want a vah shir, go ahead. Basically, if you would make your shammy a barb, make a vah shir :) if you have a preference to race, be that race. If you want the best, go with a troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My lv40 Shaman is a VarShir and I haven't regretted in picking that race. The one thing that I noticed is that there are very few VarShir shamans on my server. While growing up in the newbie area on the moon, I would say that 99% of all new VarShir were Beastlords. So as a Shaman, I was in high demand in joining post lv10 parties. To tell you the truth, I've so far met 1 VarShir Thief, a few fighters, 3 Shamans and all the rest Beastlords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a level 24 Vah Shir Shaman, and hes my favorite character ever.  Definately a good race/class combo :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>raburr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">54 kitty shaman and love it..being able to sneak is a goidsend at times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I give em 2 paws up!    d('.')b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's funny seeing the barbarians that I hunt with slipping-n-sliding on the ice getting hurt. I love the Safefall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Too lazy to click search ....<br />
Do Val Shir's get diety items?<br />
<br />
Anyone got a site that overlays the dieties in relations to moon content?  ie where's the CT stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sasanaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Vah'Shir = Agnostic <br />
/sad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Aye. Thats the only part I hate is the agnostic bit. A wanted some diety stuff, but alas, is not to be :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Vah Shir have the best shaman ability of all, no xp penalty :)  Less grinding = less suckage.  (at least as far as I know they don't have one).<br />
<br />
I can also imagine a lot of situations where sneak would be pretty useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">wouldnt sneak only be useful in situations where enemies can see invis and you dont have invis yet?  Ok now im cut between va shir and troll.  People say both are great.  What can a vashir do that troll cant and what can troll do that va shir cant.  As experianced shaman players what do you think would be best?  I do think the regen would be great for canibalize man regain also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just for the record I play a troll shammy :D <br />
<br />
the advantages that the troll has is the extra regen and ultravision, <br />
there disadvantages are the 20 percent exp penalty and that they are kos almost everywhere on the main land. then again if you are me, I kill the guards anytime I feel like I need to relieve some stress. <br />
If you are going to create a troll religion is a big issue, the options are Cazic Thule and Inny. I chose Inny for no particular reason and learned later that it was a good choice since there is a religion based necklace quest in Neriak that does a basic snare spell. I assume that there are religion based items for the other gods also but don't know what they are. I have a few friends that worship CT and have said that if they were to start over they would have switched to Inny just for the necklace. (fyi the necklace works on mobs in seb and other high level zones that I figured would make the spell used on it useless)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sneak is basically an invis that doesn't break when trading, or doing quests. Which means, that for all intents and purposes, you can make yourself dead center indiff to any NPC in the game.<br />
<br />
This has all sorts of uses, as I'm sure you can imagine. You can buy from ANY NPC IN THE GAME. And you can do ANY quest which is doable with indiff faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&lt;meow&gt;&lt;purr&gt;<br />
<br />
Women dig the tail, thats all i gotta say about that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As a VahShir shaman who is only level 20 now, and so doesn't have invisibility yet, I find that sneak isn't as useful as I hoped it would be, because it only works to keep you invisible when the NPC is turned away from you. As soon as it looks in your direction, it will see through your sneak at once. So it doesn't help with things like getting through Paludal Caverns to play on the other side (had to beg an invis for that).<br />
<br />
That said, I love my kitty shaman - he seems tough enough, and smart enough, and I appreciate the lack of faction issues. Plus, of course, we are by far the sexiest of all shaman races!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sneaking through dungeons isn't really that bad. If you know the spawns, and know your way through, you are usually okay. I snuck through paludal many times before I got invis, and I was seen twice, tops. Hug the walls the whole way there, and if you have to get in front of something, do it QUICKLY. Sneak also reduced aggro radius from the front, so you can get away with mistakes sometimes. Think of it like a really crappy lull on everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Originally posted by Carne <br />
If you want the best, go with a troll. <br />
<br />
If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times:  there is no best shaman race!  <br />
All races are equally-viable.<br />
<br />
Anyway, back on topic.  I'd like to try a cat shaman sometime, but I'm so busy with Rodahn I can hardly get any motivation to play alts anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They got the best equipement selection of all shamans (IGS/JBB, Sebilite Scale, etc ..). They lack slam. Can't wear Funguy Tunic before 51 and you better get 12+ friends. No XP penalty nor bonus. No regen, no AC bonus, no faction troubles, have sneak and safefall. <br />
<br />
IMHO, sneak is very interesting. I'd say a damn good shaman race. The only race needing boost IMHO are ogres. Rest are pretty much equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well it seems that after reviewing all the pros and cons of different races available to shaman I have come up with the anwser I need.   I will make a druid. jk Ill go with troll shaman I think.  va shir seems like more of a solo shaman and not as group orientated as a troll might be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sneak isn't really a traveling thing.  You have invis for that, and SOW.<br />
<br />
It's really great for buying from merchants who wouldn't normally buy from you, though.  That makes buying and selling everywhere possible, which is very handy.<br />
<br />
Being agnostic is extremely handy, too.  Lack of deity-specific things doesn't matter much, and not nearly as much as the freedom to walk, bank, buy and sell most everywhere freely.  That's really, really handy.<br />
<br />
That also means you can get the Overthere hammer, too, which is a great way to teleport yourself instantly there to save travel time, bank, buy/sell, buy spells, etc.  It's a really great item to have.  And if you're agnostic, you're able to do the sarnak beserker tails quest, too, to raise your OT faction.  This is an incredible quest; killing the mobs that drop the tails is great experience, and turning in the tails four at a time is outrageously good experience.<br />
<br />
Good-aligned race, agnostic for deity, and sneak means you have an incredible ability to move freely throughout the world.  That's very nice in EQ, where faction can make things very difficult and time-consuming, and trying to fix it can be incredibly tedious.<br />
<br />
Safe fall is pretty darn nice too.  Bad falls slowing digging away at your health is annoying, and without batwings when you're on a corpse recovery, you either have to go much slower to avoid it or just lose a lotta health when you have no gear on at all.<br />
<br />
Anyway, cat shamans have some real negatives, too, but they have some very nice positives as well.</div></div><hr />
