<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zheen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying desperatly to find these spell reasonably priced at the bazaar. I barely see the 55 pet spell and if I do it is priced around 1500pp. I see Form of Great Bear there once in awhile, but it also is around 1500-3000pp. I dont have that kinda plat, since I hunt mainly in tier one planes. So my question to you wise old Mystics, where is the MOST common place to get these spells off of mobs, AND what is the best tactics? I would greatly appreciate your help :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giden Grooverider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For all the high level spells, if you constantly monitor prices in bazaar, you will eventually find the spells very cheap.  You have to start early, and check as often as you can.  I got the 55 pet for 100pp, normaly sells for 500-1k and I got Bane of Nife for 250pp, normaly sells for 1k minimum.  I always try to keep an eye on the going price of the spells so that I couldn grab a good buy.  I had bought the 55 pet at lvl 51 or 52, and for the longest time had two bags full of spells, but now that I'm getting high enough to be able scribe them, it's nice to know that i don't have to go searching for most of them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, I followed Giden's tactic for my level 56 spells, have all of them I am waiting to scribe.  I checked the bazaar each time I logged on and right before I logged off.  I also managed to get great deal on all of these spells--the prices seem to flucuate greatly depending on how many copies are for sale and how other folks price them at any given moment.<br />
<br />
I think you should camp the bazaar.<br />

Then again, I plan to try and camp mobs for many of my 57-60 spells.  Some of them get a bit pricey.  Saw Torpor for sale for 60K on Torv. last week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Lawful</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You guys are lucky.  Well, I was looking for Spirit of the Howler for about a month.  I saw one copy pop up, actually my necro friend pointed it out so I gated back and bought it.  I paid 5k.  I had previously bought Form of the Great Bear for 700.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend paying what I did, but my server doesn't see many copies of Spirit of the Howler, for some reason.  I wasn't about to be SoL dinging 55 without it though, and having some wanky little no HP pet to threaten to turn green to me...  Someone knew a bunch of shamans wanted the spell, and I gave in.  Oh well, screw them.  I pitied them for not being a shaman and bought the spell. :D</div></div><hr />
