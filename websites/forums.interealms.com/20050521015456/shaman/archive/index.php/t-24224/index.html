<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gabe99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I just reached level 55 and I'm finally starting to work on AAs.  I have 3 so far, but I don't know where I should spend my AAs first.  I'd appreciate any and all opinions on AA prioritizing so I know where to best effectively use my AAs now and as I continue to accumulate more.  I appreciate any help on what AAs are crucial and what I can skip altogether and the order in which I should place my AAs.  Thanks for the advice in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">run 3<br />
regen 3<br />
scm<br />
canni 5<br />
mgb<br />
scmr<br />
radiant cure<br />
all healing aa's<br />
all defense aa's<br />
VP<br />
dog pound(aka spirit call)<br />
crit nukes/dots/hot crits(oow)<br />
then all the others<br />
<br />
least this is what i did or close too it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PaabloEscobar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say w/o a doubt <br />
Run 3 <br />
Regen 3<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
Massive Canni<br />
MGB <br />
most bang for your buck from there it's all about play style etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It doesn't really matter where you spend the first 6 points. Run speed3 and regen3 are the most popular choices, buut whatever takes your fancy.<br />
<br />
Mental clarity 3 (sucks, but required)<br />
<br />
Canni5<br />
<br />
After that, it really depends on your play style. Personally, I don't thank MGB is that big of a deal. Certainly, unless you are in a big raiding guild that raids often and is short of MGB shaman, I wouldn't bother for a while.<br />
<br />
Personally, I really like Virulent Paralysis. I also particularly like Lightning reflexes - it is really noticeable. <br />
<br />
You need to get natural durability somewhere along the way, but it doesn't actually add all that many hp.<br />
<br />
SCM and SCRM are nice for the extra Q ticks<br />
<br />
Go to the medecine cabinet for a long and detailed thread on AA progressions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grammaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Conventional wisdom holds that you should go run3 regen 3, then mc3 then Can5.<br />
<br />
However, if you have OoW, I would strongly look at mnemonic retention.  Level 55 is needed, but then it is just 3 aas for an extra spell slot.  An extra spell slot for the rest of your life is pretty uber.<br />
<br />
Run3 is sweet.  Sure, we can buff our run speed with SoW/Billy outdoors, and Shrew (if you have LDoN) inside, but run3 is just plain handy.<br />
<br />
Regen3 I would say is questionable anymore. We can buff our regen to pretty significant levels.  And with the recent regen changes, 3 extra points is IMHO, not all that needed for us.<br />
<br />
Instead, you might want to look at your playstyle.  If you use a mount and stat food, Innate metabolism can be very worthwhile.  Lasting breath isn't great in and of itself, but it is a prereq for eternal breath, which can be durn handy down the road.  If you are heavy into tradeskills, Crafting mastery might be worthwhile.  OOW seems to have shaken up the tried and true aa paths.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be:<br />
run3<br />
Mnemonic retention<br />
regen3 or metabolism3<br />
then follow the canni5 path of MC3&gt;&gt;&gt;Can5<br />
After that, there are so many viable routes to take that you will have to see what best suits you.</div></div><hr />
