<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to dual box zlandicar for several weeks now, i am playing a rog(VT and a little EP stuff, 4500+ hp unbuffed) + my sham(full ornate and all essential focus, 3500hp unbuffed). See the magelos in the sig. I play the sham and the rog since the lvl 1.<br />
<br />
i buff with virtue + chaman buffs + FR, DR, MR and PR based potions so that no AE or single cast from Zland can hit me<br />
<br />
first time: i malosed him and i had 14 resist on turgur's Oo okayyyyyy...<br />
<br />
second time: i annuled him 4 times, then tashani(with tash stick dual wielded by the rog) and malos. I had 4 turgur's resist before he bashed me to death...<br />
<br />
last time, this morning: i annuled him 5 times(i use a drop from SSRA with the rog to right click annul magic, 3 sec casting time + 3 annul magic spell with the sham), i tashani him fast(after 4 or 5 swings) and put malos on him then i tried to slow him(while casting some heals to keep the rog and the cham alive) and he resisted 7 times turgur!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
please any of you have any idea to help me slow this dragon?<br />
i tried to keep the heals while unslowed but after 1 or 2 mins he stops casting and quad for 315 every second! i can sustain this dps more than 4 ou 5 tnargs(i keep quiesc always on)<br />
<br />
Thx for all the hints you could give me to successfully slow Zland :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can slow him in 4 or 5 casts of nihil with just malos, nut from past experience when we raided him, I needed Tash + malo and sometimes even hos to have a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">did u dispell his RM buff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For any spell to stick on Zlandi, yu HAVE to be within melee range, best thing to do is to park yur shaman ontop of his for the slow to stick, Malos will hit right from the bat, as it is unresistable<br />
 but for turgurs, yu need to be on top/melee range for it to land<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*proviso, this is correct as long as yur on about the dragon outside DN*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i cast it on the middle of his target circle ;) i cannot cast it more on top of him <br />
<br />
<br />
do u think i should try the poison and disease based slows?<br />
i was told he is almost immune RP and RD but i would like to know what are you thinking about it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">turgurs will slow him, i had issues trying to slow him the first 3 times (threw a pissy about it too cos chanters kept beating me to the slow... and even then i could never slow it) make sure yur swinging at him with yur shaman, that should guarentee a slow land... er lead with malos then malosini, he doesnt like poison to much, i have landed SoT and the dots on him. i would say stick with turgurs... but theres no harm in using both turgurs and grummus chain, until one hits.<br />
<br />
RD and RP? sorry i dont know what they are :(<br />
<br />
<br />
other than that... keep plugging away</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">u are speaking about Klandicar wich is outside of DN<br />
<br />
i am speaking of zland, in DN, which is almost 100% RD and RP(resist disease and resist poison)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sounds fun, I want to hear if you wind up doing it!</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
my apologies then, i dunno, about him, but i was under the impression that Turgurs was a magic based slow but was removed by cure poison (just checked lucy - and it is) so i would stick with turgurs and ice nukes.... but yes if yu do it let us know, would be nice to hear<br />
<br />
<br />
GL btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good Luck, I tried to duo him with a necro, he has no small amount of hp.<br />
This was with him slowed with nihil the whole time, the necro (EP geared went oom before he was 50%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">it's still my hope to solo zlandicar, one day.  as it is with a well geared hybrid its a pretty trivial duo.  the problem for a shaman, really, is being able to do enough damage to kill him.  i haven't done him yet since getting balance of the nihil, but i imagine it would help a ton early on.  if you're doing this with a partner, malos, then move behind him, and make sure tash procs.  landing sinia is really helpful if you can do it, usually won't take too many casts.  once it's on, slow is pretty easy, especially with balance of the nihil.  i've slowed him 15 seconds after engage before with me and an sk friend, with lucky tash proc, 1 resisted malosinia, 1 resisted tugur.  time's antithesis is also real helpful for this as you can chain slow twice as fast.  once i take a hammer of hours i may try again solo, with proc damage + pet damage as the way to do damage to him, with devoting all mana to keeping myself alive.  also, if you open with spiritcall, you'll have a good bit of time to cast on him as each dog enrages :).  good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've soloed him a couple of times, although it takes an insane amount of time. Relying on Velium strike, melee and pet for dmg sucks :p<br />
<br />
Nihil is almost a requirement for soloing him safely since he's semi-nasty unslowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">see my stuff i am very far from you and can't manage to find nihil :(<br />
<br />
i must rely on tashani + malos to slow him or should i try to stick malosinia?(i think myselft it's a loss of time since it has no resist adjust and i could land slow instead)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm thinking that if you don't have access to Nihil you probably don't want to mess with Zlan.<br />
<br />
But if you insist . . .<br />
<br />
Why not land Tash, Malos, THEN malosinia before trying to slow.  Not sure if the extra 15 would help much, but heck, its your corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I usually don't bother with sinia before turgurs is on.<br />
<br />
Malos + tash stick is enough to slow him but it will  most likely take several casts. Without TA I would probably chain Turgur + Togor after tash + malos until either sticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Btw, you don't need nihil unless you are soloing him. Turgur, malos, tash is enough when duoing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well I have a way you can land slow but you may not like the method.<br />
<br />
Thou, I am not sure if it can be done with a shaman and rogue.  For best results maybe a shaman and necro or enchanter.<br />
<br />
Best method to slow Z would be to have the shaman get killed.  <br />
Have the shaman come back loot all but one item.  Rebuff the shaman.<br />
Have the necro Wake the Dead on the shaman corpse.<br />
<br />
Enter the fight.  <br />
And for some reason from the necro's WtD pet slow can land this way on a mob that was not ment to be slowed all that easily.  Aka a Bug.<br />
<br />
If you have an enchanter or perhaps *shrug puppet strings you could try to charm a (if there is one) shaman mob in the zone.  The mob has has a chance of landing a slow on the Dragon.<br />
<br />
Lastly, perhaps if the enchanter has Doppel AA a slow can be landed.<br />
<br />
Now all three of these methods may have not been what you were looking for, but I am trying to be helpful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Turgur's, as do all slows, adds disease counters not poison counters.  It cannot be dispellled by cure poison, only by cure disease</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wulf, you really have to do something about that crappy 100hp charm slot item. lol  Its bringin you down man!<br />

Sweet gear btw.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this true even for the rogue poison slow?  I know its a poison check for landing it, but does it also add disease counters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thanks Walknot :)<br />
<br />
Not all slows have disease counters, the necro undead only 70% slow does not have any counters and is removed with dispell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Try spamming malosinia after tash and malos are in...alternate slow and malosinia. I have slowed him before duoing him and it took several casts but eventually stuck.<br />
<br />
This is exactly what you do NOT want to do.<br />
If you do this, the one time that Malosinia lands is a time when Turgur WOULD have landed if you just cast that in the first place.<br />
Why cast sinia when you could just chain Turgur.<br />
If sinia lands, all you've done is drop his resists by a few more points so you can once again, keep spamming Turgur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">In my case duoing I didn't WANT aggro so malosinia gives you a better chance for slow to land without catching aggro. He said he was duoing as well. A melee will be able to last longer with aggro in general. When soloing yeah probably just spamming slow would be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thanks Walknot :)<br />
<br />

<br />
Ok, I should have qualified by saying all OUR slows add disease counters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i finally succeeded in slowing Zland<br />
<br />
first i sent the pet(with quiesc on him) and started to dispel zland, i dispelled him about 10 times before starting to melee him with my rog(dual wielding tash sticks)<br />
tashani landed then i malosed the big bastard and started to try turgur's<br />
<br />
i slowed it on the 3rd time!!! yay!!!<br />
<br />
from this point the fight was easy, almost trivial, i landed malosinia after about 10 tries then i reslowed at 75%, 50% and 25%<br />
i retashanied and remalosinia at 50% just in case<br />
<br />
the fight took about 20 mins<br />
see my magelos in the sig<br />
<br />
See the pic:<br />
zland down (http://bed23.free.fr/zland.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
i'm so happy! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This is exactly what you do NOT want to do.<br />

Why cast sinia when you could just chain Turgur. <br />
<br />
I fail to see why it would be bad, yes Turgur would have landed, but between each cast of Turgur you have to wait 3 seconds unless you are using 2 different slows, in the dead time of waiting for Turgur to refresh, cast Malosinia.  In the case Malosinia lands, every attempt to slow after that means a better chance, seems like a good idea to me.  If I didnt have Nihil, I would probably do the same.<br />
<br />
I havent watched for Zland actively, but I have a bot placed just outside his room, check on him from time to time and he is never up, no doubt some small group farming him, still has some good resellable drops.  Your gear is very close to mine (and same classes) and would be a fun challenge if I could ever find him up or put some effort into timing his spawn, congrats on your kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">zland is perma killed on my serveur too but it has been 2 months that i have an alt watching for him in his room<br />
i check every morning and every evening before raids<br />
<br />
this morning at 7AM i saw him after almost 2 weeks of perma kill by a farming grp :p<br />
i need another kill to flag my both char for ST(or i'll try to trade the heart for a talis)<br />
<br />
good luck to you :)</div></div><hr />
