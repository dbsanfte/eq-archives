<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need some assistance or guidance plz on how I might be able to skip a 1314534242 hour camp.  Helpful spoilers or tips would be more than welcome since I HATE camping things.<br />
<br />
All right, ogies out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, that post sounds like I could have written it.  I need jboots, but long camps are not my bag, baby.  I have heard that there is a way to reliably trigger the AC in SRo--if anyone knows the secret, maybe we can get a group together and get some jboots for people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">so far this is what I have found as far as spoilers<br />
<br />

<br />
Seems reliable, but I want a cheat guide that someone has used and knows works hehe.  <br />
<br />
What can I say, I'm a lazy arse ogie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I heard of about 20 theories on how to trigger the one in sro, bud, and I've tried a billion variations.  Including the spawn in the little ruin/pyramid temple thing at the south end (i.e. &quot;kill him after 6pm and at midnight the AC will spawn&quot;)  -- no variation of that seemed to work.<br />
<br />
You are big, and you are strong -- you can clear that zone 10 times or more before you will need to rest.  Rinse and repeat.  Don't sound fun, does it?<br />
<br />
Or, you can do what several of us did -- get a little group to camp the one in oot -- and kill seafuries and stuff for exp and loot.  Those guys drop midvalue (70pp) gems suprisingly often.  Throw in a Gornit here and there and get the same loot table as a Hill/Sand giant - i.e up to 40 or so pp and hundreds of other coin.  I was unlucky, and spent a total of like 50 hours on this crap -- in broken events.  I have heard of some really really long straight camps, the nothing longer than 28 hours.  <br />
<br />
However, a married couple took over the camp from me when I finally got the drop from oot at about 6pm, only two hours into my last attempt at it -- I saw them both in rathe mountains the next morning around 10am, and both had gotten it -- so that's three spawns in oot in a 15-16 hours period - so it's doesn't ALWAYS take forever...Yes, they stayed up all night, but both got it.<br />
<br />
Or, with the new running speed in alt points - you just say to heck with it and do it that way......how much alt exp and how much money to buy sow potions do you think you will get in 50 hours of play?  I now have 2 points in running, and it's about 90% of jboot speed, i would estimate - 3 points is bound to be the same, or faster, and works inside...<br />
<br />
If you pull the oot small group thing, let me know -- I'll bring over Flaame -- I should ding that guy planar capable and get it over with, anyway :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After 16 hours straight at the AC camp in OOC I said forget this. I went and spent the time killing HG's and other stuff to get the 5250pp I needed for tboots and never looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well since I have never hunted in OOT, hell only time I've been in the zone was going the boats, I'd like to go kill some furies or whatever. I'll chat with some people when I get time to play the game enough to camp that spot for a while.<br />
<br />
As far as scheme's go J, that's what I figured, hope for the hopeless basically. Oblah di, I'll go on ;0)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Neverflee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Every Monday I get off work early (is my easy day), I first check to see if there is anything going on or if I can find a group, then drag my wifes Druid with me too OOT. If and I mean IF you can get that AC camp, good luck I have tryed to make him spawn in OOT and south ro I don't know how many time using as many tricks and secrets as I could to no advail. In fact I once got him to spawn in South ro, but it broke my heart and miffed me off. When he spawned he poped right next to the Inky merchants there in South ro, he walked over hit one and she cleaned his clock before I got there and could drag her way from him.<br />
<br />
If you do deside to camp for the AC OOT is your best chance, I have seen whole groups set up in South Ro and KS like you have never seen in your life. Just try to keep 4 wizards and a druid from KSing you. <br />
<br />
The clops there you have to kill in OOT is still blue to me at 54, although he doesn't hit to awful hard, he does have alot of HP. To get to him the easiest way is to catch the boat in freeport (a few invis and sow potions will make that much easier and not so deadly for a KOS orge) ride it to sister island. After the boat leaves the docks there it is the next island you come to (same side of the boat, and very short trip) with a  tower on the top of the island. <br />
<br />
The only down side to going for Jboots is you should check your faction with the gnome in Rath mountains first, a friend of mine (a Orge sk with Cazic religion) said Hasten would not give him the quest although he was dubious to him. Not sure if killing Minos in Steam front would raise that faction or not.<br />
<br />
That is about the only tips I can give ya bro and good luck with em, I just have DC make me sow potions for around 60 pp a 10 stack now, until I can get enough alt experaince to run with near jboot speed :)</div></div><hr />
