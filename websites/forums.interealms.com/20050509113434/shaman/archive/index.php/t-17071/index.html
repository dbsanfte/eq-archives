<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darngudlukenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">k my guild has quite a bit of low lvls(mid 50s) that arnt able to go on alot of are raids and the raid leader realy wanted to do sumthin for the lower lvls but alot of people dont want to. so i decided i am going to take a group of mid 50s and a lvl 65 pally/sk/warrior not sure and go farm for sum armor drops and spells and cash im a 65 shaman and since ive read that even after the Protecters were back on zonewide aggro a shaman could still solo here just very annoying and maybe even not worth it. so if will be pretty much me and a 65 tank class war/sk/pal not sure yet and a group of diff. classes in the mid 50s. so im looking to find out what the best startegy is, what not to do, what to make sure to do. lol and what to be carefull with.. any and all info is much appreciated</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were able to fight rather well there with just this group. Be sure to not let the mobs run when low on health, getting adds will suck since you have to (in our case at least) be done with all aggro when the PoG's respawn (22 min timer i believe).<br />
<br />
What we did was zone in... aggroed the mob at zone in, killed it, waited for the pog's to attack us. I root parked one while slowed/dotted/pet the other and let the warr go to work. Repeat for the second PoG. <br />
<br />
In the remaining time before PoG respawn we pulled to zone wall. Ended up getting wiped due to a runner, root parked adds that we couldent finish before the PoG respawn.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild has done quite well there with 3 groups.  First time we had 4 groups though and took out a named tree and got a BST bp.  Second time we had 3 groups and took on the same named treant and I guess we killed him too slow because he called for help and summoned a bunch of sylvan's down on us.  WE got him killed before we wiped,  he had an enchanter robe on him and since I was the only enchanter on the raid, I looted it quickly before they killed me :-)  I think we had like 12 or 15 sylvans on us :-)  we didn't stand a chance!<br />
<br />
Other than that....we stayed almost exclusively on the side of the river that you zone in on.  Rumors of massive HUGE aggro radius on theother side kept us from going over there and fighting.  <br />
<br />
 If you can field 2 groups and at least one 55 or higher enchanter for mezzing you shouldn't have any problems if you avoid the named stuff :-)  I'd suggest that for your first trip to see how it goes and then once you have a feel you might go with a single group.<br />
<br />
Armor definitely isn't a common drop but the vendor trash stuff drops pretty good!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A few quick tips on PoG and named trees:<br />
<br />
All of the named trees summon a particular type of mob to &quot;aid them&quot; when they are aggro'd. <br />
<br />
There are four named trees. <br />
<br />
Ail the Elder<br />
RumbleRoot<br />
Fayl SomethingorOther<br />
Treah Greenroot(?)<br />
<br />
Do NOT mess with Ail or RumbleRoot unless you have a powerful raid. Ail AE silences. RumbleRoot has a powerful AE dot. People kill them when they're clearing for Tunare, and otherwise generally avoid them. <br />
<br />
Treah is easy. No AE, and he's slowable. Your small raid can probably take him, if you have at least two clerics. And you might not even need that. Heck, a 65 pally and shaman duo might be able to take him, although I wouldn't want to promise you that (and it'd take a loooong time, he has HP). <br />
<br />
Fayl is similar, except that he's not slowable. Your raid can probably do him as well, with that good a tank. <br />
<br />
Treah summons sylvan protectors. Fayl summons all the little wooden tree guys that generally wander east of the river (forget the names, it's been a while, hehe). Ah, the Entolling Whatzits, that was it. <br />
<br />
They summon help when they are aggro'd. What this means: they shout for help, and all the mobs in the zone of that type RUN to the spot where the Tree was when it shouted. So, the trick is to aggro the Tree a substantial distance from where you want to fight it, and then lead it away quickly. If you have cleared a path first, you can pull the Tree away before any of its help gets close enough to actually aggro on you. If you get too far away during the pull, you'll have to reaggro the Tree, and it'll call for help again, leading all those mobs to run en masse to the new location. It's important to avoid that, or they'll end up close enough to possibly find your raid.</div></div><hr />
