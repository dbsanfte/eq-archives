<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sakiris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It took me 9 months, and i know thats crazy, but hes finally lvl 65.  Im so happy...cept i cant afford spells.  Any ideas for quick cash?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LachdanonColdpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not very crazy at all actually, I started my Shaman back in 2001 and right now he's only level 61 (11 AA's from Cann V). I've spent alot of my time playing the game the way it was ment to be played, not grinding. He's my only character, and I don't regret it one bit. As for making cash, there are numerous ways. First ya should try typing &quot;Making Platinium&quot; or &quot;need cash&quot; into the search feature, im sure you'll get a bunch of info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Exeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It took me about 9 months also.  I took a couple two week breaks from the game and spent some time on tradeskills though.  Myslef, I found the 40's the funnest part of the level mill.  Groups still loved having me around, and I had lots of options for soloing.<br />

<br />
Im in the same boat as you for spell money, being only 21% away from hitting 65. For cash, I usually camp the Soulstripper, or farm stuff in ToFS on the 5th floor (wedding). With all the weapon and plat drops, I can make about 2k in a 4 hours session if I can keep up with spawns. Plus the velium can sell for about 80pp a piece in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm taking my time...been playing 2 years and I'm just now 52% into 64 with 45 AA's.<br />
I am working on the Coldain shawl and I am trying to GM all tradeskills:-)<br />
 <br />
Congrats on 65 Sakiris:-)<br />
<br />
I'll get there soon=^.^=</div></div><hr />

Gratz on 65.   <br />

If you can 2 box with a Tank class - make a few run's on G-wurms in Skyfire.   They can be solo'd but you need your spells and AA's.   With a tank type partner, you can handle them with your lower spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Speaking of the G-Wurms...I cant find them...anywhere in SF.  Am I just unlucky?</div></div><hr />

They hang out at the entrance to Veeshan's Peak.</div></div><hr />

The elder wyverns are their placeholders.  If you cannot find any guardians, you need to kill some wyverns!  About a year ago, a couple friends and I went to SF to kill guardian wurms, and we found that they were a relatively rare spawn then; doubt it's gotten any better in a year's time.</div></div><hr />
