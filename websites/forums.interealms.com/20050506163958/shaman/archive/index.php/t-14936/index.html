<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) saryrn's earring<br />
2) ceramic shackles of torment - Tradeskillled pottery item, using incredibly rare drop from an event that almost nobody does more than once or twice<br />
3) Shadowknight elemental sleeves</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are other effects besides burning affliction 4 that will give you increased dot damage, thankfully.  Basically, anything that used to make detrimental spells last longer now makes them hit harder instead.<br />
<br />
Still, though, I think burning affliction 4 needs to be added to a piece of our ornate armor, and an upgraded copy of the same focus needs to be added to a piece of elemental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unfortunately the only other effects I know of that increase dot dmg like Burning affliction are either in VT or elemental planes+. If your doing those zones then you have a descent chance at getting those but otherwise there isn't any really practically obtainable lvl 4 items.<br />
<br />
I've read a couple reports of necros duoing the bloods for the pottery item but haven't seen any specifics about it. Plan to try and get that one myself at some point. If I do I'll let you know how things go. Even so the stats are pretty piss poor on those.<br />
<br />
Part of me is torn about ornate/elemental armor. The only peice that would really make sense for the dot focus would be gloves. Wouldn't want to change any of the other ones. I don't see the poison nuke mp focus on the gloves as being really useful but if we where to get them changed I think i'd rather have it changed to nuke mp for velium strike rather than dot focus. Dots are just unusable outside of soloing most of the time because of aggro and duration. Velium strike on the other hand I'm casting so much in exp groups i've spend aa's for 4 levels of fury to get more crits with velium strike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just been soloing in PoM quite a bit, wanted to up my dps a bit more. Might try to get an BA 3 item for bane and pox and just stick to using those as my primary dots. At 65 PoM is pretty much trivial for me, i just want the boots, unfortunately the cards wont drop off the mobs im killing, and the good mobs are perma killed on A'ro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Stomples and the chessboard/theater are all perma-camped for you?    Stomples I can see as easily being pinned down, I used to keep Emarr from seeing the guy more than 15 minutes a week myself.   But the chessboard and theater yeild some decent throne rates and each would need a dedicated group to prevent you from getting in on the action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think maybe make Improve Damage item include dot damage, then just like other fire/cold/magic damage focus, Burning Affliction  will only improve dot damage</div></div><hr />
