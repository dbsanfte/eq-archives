The &quot;official&quot; role description:<br />
Before announcing who was chosen to be the shaman correspondent, I would like to tell you a little bit about what we see as the role of a correspondent.  The role of a correspondent will be to help us gather information; unfortunately we may miss posts on each board so these folks will be our extra eyes and bring posts we may have missed to our attention.  They will float posts that they feel the community should comment on, and we may also rely on them to start posts to gather information, and to bring posts regarding bugs to our attention.  Each correspondent will have access to a correspondent only board to ask questions, have discussions and bring information to our attention.</div></div><hr />

It's Danille, who actually is an active poster over on the mage compendium boards.  I was pretty disappointed to see that the shaman class is represented by someone who, at least by that name, is known by no one here at the Crucible.  Perhaps it's an alias  :p <br />

They are &quot;stealing&quot; all of our hopes and dreams.  It's highway robbery - pun intended.<br />
<br />
I am surprised they did not get a monkey to represent us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a link to his posts incase you want to read up on his views- Banditman's Posts (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/tracker?user.id=16821) <br />
<br />
I'm guessing they were looking for active people on their board.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Sudedor is my character in game, Banditman is my station sign in.  Clear as mud, I know.</div></div><hr />

I do hope he at least reads the crucible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">His posts show him to be 62-65 shaman (was 62 in GoD).<br />
<br />
So we aren't talking someone who has been a shaman since Velious.  Or even someone who raids 24/7.<br />
<br />
He argues his points well, isn't very confrontational.  Reading some of his posts he does seem to have good ideas.  Above all, he posts a lot and in a positive way.  Perfect SoE class representative.<br />
<br />
They defintely couldn't have picked my first choice. The fact that the game is broken in the highest tier raids mars the positive spin sony would like on the forums.<br />
<br />
Maybe the shaman will be a better class as a result.  But if we're talkinga bout making shaman better for the &lt;65 or new to 65 crowd casual gamer you might as well look at OTHER games approaches to shaman.  I wont be playing WoW but at least a shaman isn't a cross between so many classes that they can be easily replaced.<br />
<br />
If your goals are to be a primary healer in BoT.  Welcome your class representative with open arms.  If your goal is to figure out what the heck to do with 6 shaman on a raid restricted to 54 when you can replace them with wizards.  Don't plan on much.</div></div><hr />

He's made numerous reference to our data collected here, so it's safe to assume he reads the Crucible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have made a post or two here.<br />
<br />
Actually, I only started using those boards after I noticed that a good deal of the information there was very poor by comparison to what is found here.<br />
<br />
Crucible was my first &quot;Shaman&quot; board.<br />
<br />
No, I haven't been a Shaman since 1999, but I was a beta tester for EQ and for the early part of my EQ career I was a Magician.  My magician's birthdate is March 31, 1999.<br />
<br />
I do know EQ, but perhaps not as well as some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well mate, let me be the first to congratulate yu.<br />

Hope yu enjoy it, and Do us pround Mr Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thank you.<br />
<br />
Well, I can tell you that right now I'm not exactly sure what the &quot;job&quot; will entail.  They certainly are charting new waters with this, and I think they are looking to go slowly in the beginning and decide what sorts of things they want as we go.<br />
<br />
For myself, I am there as a representative and advocate for the Shaman class.  That will be my only concern.  My only concern for the other classes is that nothing I accomplish for the Shaman class causes another class to get thrown into the position we find ourselves in.<br />
<br />
What I may or may not accomplish, at this point, only time will tell.  But I assure you, Shaman, all Shaman, are my concern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sudedor may or may not remember me, but I did many Adventures with him with my bard when he was in his high 30s-low 40s. Bard is Porksoda.  I can vouch that he  was indeed a good player at that level.  I have not had the opportunity to group with him since he has leveled, but I think he will listen to us, and be a fair advocate.  Congrats Sudedor, and good luck.</div></div><hr />

You may be right, but SOE picked their person, so we may as well get behind him and do the most good for the most people. just my opinion, flame on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">dude, i would have never ever ever done what you agreed to in a million YEARS.<br />
<br />
you have faith in Sony.  i do not.  worse, i think your faith is misplaced.<br />
<br />
you can't heal effectively, you can no longer slow effectively, you cannot nuke effectively and you are hard pressed to find a mob that lives long enough to DoT effectively.<br />
<br />
you took the 'job' thinking they will listen.  i think they offered the job to defray some of the posts.<br />
<br />
next instead of posts of Brenlo's greatest hits, we will have yours.<br />

&quot;/rant on&quot; and &quot;/rant off&quot; are about as lame as it gets. He doesn't need to prove himself to you, whether by magelo or defensive posts, he's a contributing poster here so we're going to back him and try to suggest as much as we can to help.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake, he's not the best known Crucible member, but odds are he's been around for quite a while and I'd be willing to be he's eager to help the shaman class get as much done as possible. Just because the expected person wasn't nominated doesn't mean the rest of the knowledgeable shaman can't still contribute and voice their united opinion through Sud.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you, Sud, you're dealing with some real genuine idiots here. And I'm not talking about some of the posters on this board...=/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Grats on your new role. Hope it goes well. If they listen and implement even a fraction of what you bring before them, I'm sure the Shaman class will be on its way to a better direction. :)<br />
<br />
And to those detractors: from what I've seen, Sudedor posts a lot more level-headed than many. Perhaps that's why SoE chose him. People can be passionate about a class and not have to be cynical or jaded. Nor do they have to be a cheerleader/&quot;yes&quot; man type either.<br />
<br />
Sudedor, you're now bearing a large burden on your shoulders. As someone else said earlier, you'll most likely bear some of the anger, frustration and blame that gets heaped on the shoulders of Brenlo. It looks to be a thankless job, and potentially a difficult one as well. Thank you for stepping forward to assume that responsibility. Do us proud!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I can only say what I've already said above.  I took the job to be an advocate for the Shaman class.  There are only two things I refuse to do in order to get our class improved. <br />
<br />
1.  Suggest that another class be nerfed.<br />
<br />
2.  Suggest something for us that might put another class in the same position we are currently in.  (Kinda closely tied to number one but possibly different)<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'm not sure what it will be within my &quot;powers&quot; to do.  All I know is that I care deeply about the Shaman class, and whatever those &quot;powers&quot; might turn out to be you can rest assured they will be used to make improvements to this class.<br />
<br />
I can't go so far as to say I don't care what people think of me, I do care.  But I can say I'm well aware that I won't be able to please everyone, nor have they given me any &quot;power&quot; to do anything at this point.<br />
<br />
I, like you, will have to wait and see what SOE has in mind.  I can only suggest that we continue to collect data and experience what we can of EQ from our unique perspective.  Hopefully in the end it will become more clear what my role is and I can then parlay that information into positive changes for all of us.<br />

I can honestly say I'm pleased I didn't get chosen!  :)  I am definitely afraid you're in for a lot of work with very little payout.  They've consistently shown a complete inability to respond to their CS reps, so I think our poor class reps are going to get even worse response.<br />

what i would like though, is a post on what idea you think you would &quot;pass&quot; onto soe:) if that is possible without too much pain.<br />

i would say though that i think you got a better responce than poor old dani on the mage board:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always want to remind you that this place is probably the better ( but not only ) source of shaman data/debate/discussion, but im sure you know that. im not saying to not post at SoE or listen to anyone there, just remember that the &quot;Shaman Proposal&quot; was started here and parses tend to be done here and the really hard core stuff all seem to steam from here. <br />

I guess im just saying, dont forget us and keep us in the loop of information. :)<br />

However, before that happens, one of my first goals is to get from SOE, a definition of what THEY think the Shaman class is.<br />
<br />
How successful I am at getting that definition is certainly unknown.  That is simply my goal.  I want to know what THEY think before I try to tell them what WE think.<br />
<br />
Will this happen in the next couple days?  I don't know, like I have said throughout this post, SOE is charting new waters here.  I'm not sure they know what they want to do with us or what they will allow us to know or do.  I will give it some time to sort itself out.</div></div><hr />

Sudedor,<br />
We do not always agree on issues, in fact I recall something about a huge Asteroid on a collision course with Earth if we ever agreed. <br />
<br />
The fact that an argument from you is a coherent series of statements leading from a premise to a conclusion, rather than some of the embittered rants I have seen on the various boards, has earned you some respect. I have no doubt at all you will try to do what is best for our class. I won't promise to agree with what you think is best though.  :D</div></div><hr />

Su has demonstrated a level head and a fairly coherant understanding of the issues. He ALSO understands something a LARGE majority of people don't seem to grasp, and that is that balancing ANY class involves EVERY class in some form or another. <br />
<br />
One thing I hope you remember Su, and that is you represent the community, and that its possible there will be things we support overall that you may not fully agree with. <br />
<br />
All I ask is 2 things. Keep an open mind, and PLEASE keep us informed. The silence of people like Brenlo is pissing a lot of us off (some more than others, but we are all annoyed, to say the least)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I will cheer Sudedor up.<br />
Rep is a definitely very tough position, but he will do well.<br />
If Dev team wants to know our opinion or experience in EQ via Rep.,<br />
it is not so bad thing.<br />
Anyway, I will strongly support him as long as he stands by our side.<br />
<br />
I hope Dev team do not make our Rep. as their convenient speaker, prob that concern might prove unfounded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Ah so this correspondant will effectively filter the main issues for SoE to save them reading a lot of the not so relevent posts on the board.

After all it does not really matter who brings the news if the guy at the other end is not listening.<br />

Good luck getting Rytan to actually start working on improving things without getting a flat NO after each suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Gah - lot to respond to - I'll try to hit it all without the blatant quote abuse.<br />
<br />
I think that one reason Rytan (and Dev's in general) were frustrated was that it seemed to them (perhaps rightfully so, perhaps not) that it was him against everyone.  That would certainly frustrate me.  My hope is that SOE will allow us to debate one on one with a Dev, instead of our entire community.  If that happens, this will have been a wildly successful idea.<br />
<br />
Yes, I think one of the main reasons these Class positions were created was to save SOE a lot of reading.<br />
<br />
You can count on me to be here.  I may continue to tell you I have nothing new to tell you, but I'll be happy to tell you that as often as you like.  I'm not going away.  (Well, ok, Im going to a family reunion next week.)<br />
<br />
As far as a &quot;casual rep&quot; and a &quot;high rep&quot; I must say I disagree.  By doubling the number of people involved you cut in half the chances of anything being agreed upon.<br />
<br />
As far as things I may not fully agree with, perhaps.  I doubt it, but perhaps.  We'll see when one of those issues comes up.  I think at this point though we have nothing to lose and everything to gain.<br />

I won't ask everyone, or anyone, to agree with me, but if you disagree, you need to be able to back it up.  I want to see your facts and numbers.  Emotional arguements don't work well with me.  (which seems to tick my wife off daily)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Heh.  I disagree on Rytan.  Most people looking at an issue, when confronted with an entire class of angry people who are both intimiately familiar with the details of the issue AND telling you that you're wrong, would take the time to re-consider.<br />
<br />
Instead, we get the tin-god aspect of Rytan's less than stellar personality.  He's clearly one of those guys who have to prove they're in charge rather than caring about getting something right.<br />
<br />
He's a salaried employee (why, I don't know).  He has NO excuse for the sub-standard work we're getting, and certainly not because he's unhappy with us.  He can always resign if he can't be neutral.  As I've said in other posts, maybe they can find him a nice position texturing walls as long as he doesn't get to place them (ie, he'd probably block off all the entrances).<br />

<br />
Rytan has no balls, period.<br />
<br />
When things are balanced and you enhance 1 class you need to enhance everyone lese as well, I agree, but things are *not* balanced and if you think about what improvements Shamans and only Shamans have received since we started to become more vocal, you will realize that it's negligeable.<br />
<br />
I am not going to list Daluda's for obvious reasons. So that leaves us with:<br />
<br />
- Balance of the Nihil upgraded from 60% to 75%<br />
<br />
Anything else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I agree, we have received nothing of great import, and certainly nothing that touches on balancing us.<br />
<br />
Sure, the changes to our Regen spells were nice.  Sometimes I don't even heal myself after a Can 5, I just let the Regen do it.<br />
<br />
Sure, Q now heals a bit more, and that's great.  Very helpful . . . in BoT.<br />
<br />
I certainly don't think the changes we've received thus far are in any way what we need.<br />
<br />
Since I have no personal experience with Rytan outside reading a few posts and quotes, I will reserve judgement.  I wish to give him the benefit of the doubt.  If at some point I am able to have a reasoned discussion (and it is my hope that this will happen) with him, I will then be able to decide for myself whether he is on a power trip or simply frustrated.  I merely hope the opportunity to have that discussion happens, and before OoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I just wanted to add that both, the regen and the HoT upgrade affected all priests having those types of spells at their disposal. One could even argue that going from 420 to 630/tick(Shaman HoT) is not as good as going from 600 to 900/tick(Cleric HoT).<br />
<br />
Especially considering Shamans were the first class to have HoT spells and that by the end of Kunark, a time were efficiency was the most important criterium for spells, Shamans healed for just as much as Clerics for 66.6% of the mana.</div></div><hr />

Those changes make us &quot;viable&quot; secondary healers.

I have no problem with people focusing on something else than healing. Yet you have to admit that absolutely NOTHING has been done to actually adress Shaman's DPS and durability issues. <br />
<br />
Hell, look at those Omens DoTs. We are falling behind more and more DPS wise. I haven't seen anything that would indicate they are giving us better durability and survivability tools. The only thing we have actually seen have been HoT upgrades, that, why the **** ever, were given to Clerics as well, and as I noted above were arguably *bigger*.</div></div><hr />

2.  Suggest something for us that might put another class in the same position we are currently in.  (Kinda closely tied to number one but possibly different)<br />

Amen brother. Coming from DAOC, the land of the broad-sweeping class based re-balancing cause someone bitched nerfs, I can say with certainty that you are spot on. That and if you nerf some other class you gonna get me too (I box 65 shammy / pally / wiz / cleric / warrior / chanter / ranger) so its win/lose for me.

<br />
Ok Bloxr, I'll answer at least some of that.  ;)<br />
<br />
1.  I hunt in Tier 1 and Tier 2 PoP for the most part.  Most of the folks I group with regularly are pre-65.  I still love them.<br />
<br />
2.  Gah, where have I never been?  Wow.  (/em pulls up EQAtlas)    Lots of places it seems!  I am very familiar with Odus, all zones.  The area around Qeynos and Halas, the Karanas, Highpass.  I've been to most of the LoY zones, but not very many of the Luclin zones.  Lots of Kunark and Velious.  I've been to Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu and Tipt.<br />
<br />
3.  No, I'm not guilded.  I have several standing offers, but I've yet to exercise any of them.  Doesn't mean I don't raid tho.  ;)<br />
<br />
4.  Working toward Elemental myself.  Being unguilded definitely has it's drawbacks and this is one of them.<br />
<br />
5.  I've played a lot of other classes, I had a L50 Mage at one point (when L50 meant something).  I've played Pallys, Clerics and Wizards.  As you can see I have somewhat of a &quot;caster&quot; trend.  I did try a Monk, I despised it.<br />
<br />
All that said, it doesn't tell you the first thing about me.  If you want to know who I am, read my posts.  Or ask me.  Either way.<br />
<br />
Gah - that got long.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Grats Sudedor.<br />
<br />
Just my perspective.  These class reps are exactly what they have on the SWG forums.  I played SWG for about 4 months when it first came out.  I had a Master Ranger/Novice Fencer when I quit.  <br />
<br />
A little background.  Ranger was similar to shaman in that they were supposed to be the &quot;master&quot; of certain skill, but many many others could do what we did almost as good.  The benefit of being a master at, harvesting creatures for skin, bone, and meat, for example, was barely worth the time and xp to get over a Master Scout.  And Master Scout was the prerequisite for a few other professions.  Anyway, besides that, there were quite a few things that were incredibly broken, things that were nerfed/un-nerfed/nerfed again.<br />
<br />
Well, SOE had &quot;class reps&quot; for each profession.  We compiled huge lists similar to what is done here.  The class reps have the emails of the &quot;class dev&quot; (hehe, a joke I know) and would correspond.  Well, I think there was like ONE response that basically said &quot;we're aware of this and we're working on it&quot; sort of run around, exactly what we get here.  And I browse those forums now one year later and there has been nothing implented.  Nothing.  SWG workers were probably faced with similar pressures of &quot;push out the space expansion and vehicles&quot; rather than fix things... like in EQ.<br />
<br />
Class rep did nothing more than Kyathera (or whatever her name is on SOE forums) and passed on the info and waited and prayed for a dev to bless them with a response, most times just saying nothing.  I think this is just another charade to try and appease the whole EQ community, not just shamans, into thinking things will be done.  Maybe SOE is scared enough now to take this seriously and push some nice changes through rapidly (pets zoning and aug removal are gonna be nice!), but the class rep thing is just really weird and seems like an insincere effort on SOE's part.  If things get done now, it's because of known issues and backlogs of bugs... I doubt it will be due to the efforts of these individual reps.  From posts like &quot;One Voice&quot; and the top 10 list on the SOE forums, they know the issues already.<br />
<br />
Anyway, grats again Sudedor and good luck.  I hope they take this effort seriously.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">From my understanding of what these correspondents are, from the posts on eqlive, basically Sony wants them to be information gathering services that collect and collate information and ideas that are posted class boards. They dont say anything about these folks being class representatives or advocates. Creating the expectation that they are something other than that in the absence of any evidence to the contary is only setting one self up for dissappointment.<br />
<br />
If they wanted to create representatives, they could hardly appoint them and expect them to be representative. It should be done in the form of an election.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Well, I can tell your from what is said in the Correspondents forum that even SOE isn't sure what they want to do with them.  I am sure they will start slowly.  I think their hope is to create a more focused discussion.  We'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Well grats and welcome Sudedor.  I agree 100% with your analysis in one of your posts about subtle changes (or re-tuning) of the shaman class rather than asking for an overhaul.<br />
<br />
I do suggest, though, that since you have not experienced the big hitting mobs in vxed, tipt and up that you read some of the posts here on those topics.  For instance, while the improvements to Q and regen may be uberific in normal LDON, they are very marginally better in harder content because of overhealing, and regen isn't exactly going to save anyone. <br />
<br />
At the risk of sounding too simple, Shaman tend to Q the tank before incoming (no benefit except as a buffer until cleric heals) and Q up the non-MA's who are at 80%ish (again usually overhealing).  Regen really doesn't top anyone off and Shaman emergency spot heals also tend to be (overhealed) by cleric fast heals. Now, I'm not necessarily promoting any increase in Shaman healing personally since I believe that balance includes many other things as well, but you as our advocate need to be aware that our &quot;paper healing potential&quot; is not very applicable in 35 second fights against high dps mobs.<br />
<br />
I do like your idea of the -50 resist modifier for our rain spells.  That is a very good situational damage idea that as you mentioned can bridge the gap between our pretty gimp DD's and our slow working and broken DOT's.  If we can get that accomplished and faster casting on our DD's I think that our poor DPS can be helped without unbalancing content.  It's subtle changes like these which will not only help balance our class but make it more fun to play.<br />
<br />
So, again, welcome and please feel free to read up and ask questions.  There are many fine Shaman players who post here often and who will be good resources for you.<br />

I even have the Bauble of Rejuvenation (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26348) off the Enraged Maternal Cragbeast to show for it.<br />
<br />
Do keep in mind, that I don't want to supplant another class with any changes.  No, I don't think changing the resist on Tears (or adding a Cold based rain) would do that.  Just saying.<br />

Clearly smart, well spoken and capable of analyzing.  And most importantly, not just capable of analyzing but actually applying numbers to game reality. <br />

Lots of code monkeys can throw numbers around and act like they've made a point, but placing the numbers in a meaningful game context is quite different.  <br />

Anyway, I was mighty impressed with the healing posts Sudedor made, and I think he struck upon a key framework for viewing these issues that had not really been done by anyone.

Gee. thats just swell. I guess SOE figures that a correspondent who doesn't really deal with the shortcomings of the shaman class first hand won't be as pushy for reform.</div></div><hr />

The correspondants role is to report to SoE what bug and issues we have with the class, and if he can make a collection of information from game and from other shamans i think he can do a fine job of it.<br />

In fact, I think I may have raided with him once or twice?  I don't know, maybe he can correct me.<br />
<br />
Anyways, he knows he stuff.<br />
<br />
But, I do wish they had picked someone with some deeper end game experience.  After all, as someone put it, &quot;a level 50 shaman doesn't know what it's like to be 65 in the end game, but a 65 uber shaman can still remember what it was like when he was level 50....&quot;<br />

<br />
Once again, don't judge me by my character.  Read my posts.<br />
Thank you, I just did (well skimmed them mostly anyway), and I'd still like to see a Magelo profile if you'd be so kind.  I too was wondering 'who the heck is this', as the only recent memory I have of Sudedor was the little 2-3 post back&amp;forth we had this week in the Spells forum on invisibility (Mantle of Stealth?  :p, No. )  So since that was my only recollection, I did some digging right here on our own boards.  Here's what I come up with as a brief timeline for our SoE Class Representative.<br />
<br />
<br />
Moved to Solusek Ro last November to start my Shaman (NoV 2003)<br />
I am merely a L54 Shaman (Feb 2004)<br />
As a L55 Shaman I am currently very happy with my class. (March 2004)<br />
As a L59 Shaman  (April 2004)<br />
I am currently L60 and will be 61 as soon as I kill 2 or 3 more... (April30, 2004)<br />
<br />
I was suspended from the PlanetSide message boards while I was playing that and it did in fact carry over to being suspended from playing the game as well. (May04)<br />
<br />
While negativity may be a problem, I'll take it over apathy. (I liked this)<br />
<br />
As a L61 Shaman I am at the height of my powers in the current environment. (May04)<br />
<br />
I really had hoped to play EQ for a while, but, I simply don't have the desire to level up an Alt to 60+ given the level of support in EQ. (June04)<br />
<br />
I have a whopping 29 AA's, no Q, no Fo7. (June16th, 2004)<br />
<br />
At L65 I am wearing the Ghastly Greaves, Ghastly Chestplate and Ghastly Vambraces. (June23)<br />
<br />
Well, I can now &quot;officially&quot; throw the BS flag on Shaman healing in GoD. I did my first GoD trial last night, Tipt. (June28, 2004)<br />
(Parenthetical dates/statements are mine.)<br />
From reading backwards (first posts back in Feb-March to now), you can definitely see Sudedor's transition from the happy-go-lucky Shaman in his 50's (lalalala, shaman are awesome) to the bitterness &amp; love-hate relationship many of us feel as Shaman in today's game.<br />
<br />
My concerns are that Sudedor does not have a long time playing a shaman, and honestly a little suspicious of him possibly being a sleeper SoE plant (that's my mild paranoia kicking in I'm sure ;) ).  He does have a very well rounded overall knowledge of the game dating back to its infancy, which is definitely a good thing, even if that knowledge wasn't Shaman centric until relatively recently (Nov'03).<br />
<br />
After reading through alot of his posts, I find him intelligent. His posts are usually thought out, though he can be a bit snippy when provoked. :D   While definitely not my first, second, or even third choice for our representative, I think if he puts the energy &amp; effort into it, he'll do fine.<br />
<br />
I wish you the best of luck Sudedor, both IG and as our SoE rep.   :cool:   <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">...though he can be a bit snippy when provoked. ...<br />
Gah.  Guilty as charged.<br />
<br />
I would like to say that I remember that quote about being at the height of my powers . . . and if I remember correctly I went on to say that I knew the downward slope was looming large on the road ahead.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just remember to pay more attention to what I say than what gear Sudedor manages to aquire.  Sude's a great guy, but he isn't me.  My in game choices in no way reflect my out of game person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">I don't see what the big deal about Sudedor's qualifications is.  He's essentially another Brenlo, except he doesn't have physical access to the developers, so it's easy (easier?) for them to ignore him.<br />
<br />
If it's not possible to explain clearly to someone who isn't playing the raid game what the problems are, how are the devs going to figure it out? They don't raid *either*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I completely follow Vigdis's opinion.<br />
<br />
Sudedor is OUR representative, not SoE's speaker.<br />
He does not have to tell any information about update to us instead of SoE's Customer's Service.<br />
And he does not have to be a UBER player, because his role is not 'how to play EQ well', but 'how to collect and organize our opinion'<br />
<br />
So if he has some discussion with Dev.team concerning about Shaman, I would like to hear about that.<br />
Because he is our representative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Hail,<br />
I don't see what the big deal about Sudedor's qualifications is.  He's essentially another Brenlo...<br />
That's just it.  We don't want a Brenlo for our rep.  We want someone knowledgable and well spoken.<br />
<br />
Would you rather have someone from Advertising or Marketing with little to no game knowledge speaking for us, or someone who truly cares about Shaman and has enough personal experience to speak intelligently about our concerns when someone from SoE asks a good question in reply to our comments.<br />
<br />
He doesn't need to be Uqua flagged, but if he was playing  a level 44 Shaman ALT, he wouldn't really be able to relate well to the problems we are having at that stage of the game.<br />
<br />
SoE has made bad choices imo for their reps in the past.  Brenlo certainly isn't the worst mouthpiece for them, but he could definitely do better.  <br />
<br />
I think Sudedor will be fine.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">One of the main things I am doing is saving Brenlo time.<br />
<br />
He was reading 50+ forums per day trying to keep up with all the classes.  You guys know how I love math, so here goes.  ;)<br />
<br />
If Brenlo spent 7 minutes per day on each forum, he would be left with a whopping 30 minutes at the end of it to go look for answers.  And really, is 7 minutes enough?  I don't think that 7 minutes is nearly enough to read and absorb what is being said on each forum.  Let alone if you have to sift through a bunch of junk to get at the really important stuff.<br />
<br />
The more time Brenlo has to annoy the Designers and Programmers (collectively, the Devs) the better off we are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">The lack of end-game experience does not really concern me, but it will require more communication from those people who are pushing the limits of the game on what issues they are facing.  That way Sud will have an idea what difficulties are present at every level of the game.<br />
<br />
Just because you have a key to Time (which is far from end-game atm), does not mean you really have a deeper, secret understanding of anything other than what goes on in those specific zones.  Every raid issue can be summed up simply in posts, and as long as Sud brings those problems to SOE, the job is getting done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Yeah, I have a feeling SOE took a look at all the time their people were spending reading message boards and said &quot;Get back to work you slackers&quot;.  This is just another way to save themselves some money...<br />
<br />
By the way, congrats Sudedor.  I hope this actually pans out for all of us in a positive way...<br />
<br />
Gert</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">I think you missed my point Gert.<br />
<br />
What &quot;we&quot;, the EQ community &quot;want&quot; is for Brenlo to annoy the ever living (*@# out of the Designers and Programmers until they fix things.  However, at the same time, we want him to keep up with the issues of each and every class.<br />
<br />
Now, I personally don't think spending 30 minutes per day is an adequate amount of time to keep up with the issues of any class.  Do you?<br />
<br />
Yet, if Brenlo did spend 30 minutes per day on each class, reading and understanding their issues, that leaves him with, literally, no time to actually go find answers.<br />
<br />
Am I asking you to feel sorry for Brenlo?  No, not at all.  He has a great freakin job!  I am merely asking that you understand him and the true size of the job.<br />
<br />
If I can help him understand and tackle our issues better by giving it to him in chunks he can digest in 10 minutes, that gives him more time to go annoy Rytan and company.  How can this be a bad thing?</div></div><hr />

I agree. In Brenlos defense, I imagine he has more responsibilities than just &quot;See what Shaman need work on&quot;, but regardless, its better to have someone DEDICATED to the task. Su reads the threads. He knows the deal at all levels. You dont have to play a Post Time Gates Shaman to understajnd the deficiencies, if you know the class. Just reading what they have to say is enough to picture the magnification of the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sudedor,<br />
When you compare the current description of Shaman to what is played everyday on the servers, it makes me wonder if SoE has any idea what our &quot;slot&quot; is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some things i cut from my old guild board regarding the monk correspondant:<br />
<br />
your monk representative is an idiot, his first question he asked the dev's was something about pacify and aggro pulling in temple of veeshan. <br />
<br />
Apparently the correspondent got so much **** and flamed for being only 62 and not knowing very much about the monk class the admin had to come in and delete a ton of posts so the correspondent didn't look stupid. Who the hell would even send in to be a class correspondent for a class then openly say he doesn't know that much about said class. What a joke. <br />
<br />
Also here is a saying from the monk himself, obviously he never learned about FD being broken by casting mobs if you feign between the mob starts casting and finished casting, this is priceless:<br />
<br />
I posted a small rant and found my problem was not isolated. It seems that when in a LDoN when you are in mellee range of the mobs FD doesn't work sometimes. It not a fail, no &quot;you have fallen to the ground&quot; message. Also this seems to be happening in other zones and from what I've read seems to be the larger zones. It happen during a vindicator raid too, i was pulling the protectors in front of vindicator and i FD and they still nuked me. Can this be looked into to see if it is a lag bug, the mobs just don't recognize FD, or if this is how the mobs are suppose to be (seeing through FD).<br />
<br />
On another note, an ex-guild friend of mine (Phroak aka Cognak) got selected as PVP correspondant. While he might not the most popular guy on the server, he atleast knows the ins and outs of PVP.</div></div><hr />

Actually what he first described has nothing to do with mobs casting on you and it's alwasy been that way. Sometimes FD fails and you don't get a &quot;fallen...&quot; message. It used to be attributed to lag but that doesn't mean it really wasn't a bug that was never thoroughly tested.</div></div><hr />

I think it's priceless that anyone is presuming to determine who the &quot;minority&quot; really is; that anyone would feel the players shouldn't attempt to give their opinions or &quot;validate&quot; anything and everything including who their supposed representative is, and that they don't have both the right and the obligation to do so; and that anyone would possibly be so dumb as to think this &quot;self-proclaimed&quot; class board has not indeed been the shaman class board for years and years.<br />

Just curious, this seems to me that you don't yet have Q?<br />
<br />
And I, too, have some concerns about the fact that you seem to have little to no high end experience.  I do, however, think that it's good that you aren't so much of an old timer, I personally know that people like me could not relate well to a new shaman these days, as I didn't grow up with spells such as stoisism.<br />
<br />
However, the problems at the high end are something you don't seem to be very familiar with (I'm primarily concerned with raiding, stacking issues, burnout issues, usefulness issues, etc.).  I understand that your current job is just to collect information and relay it to the devs, but which information you decide to pass on and what emphasis you place on it is effected by your experiences.<br />
<br />
I'm also slightly curious if you yet have any of your god spells, especially balance of the nihil.</div></div><hr />

I don't see what the problem is with Sudedor's level or game experience... AS LONG as she/he is representing the views on this board then surely it doesn't matter if they aren't in Uqua or beyond?<br />
<br />
Or do we only think that someone who has been playing since release and who has completed Uqua is qualified for the post?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">When I hear the term &quot;correspondent&quot;, I envision someone who will relate things. They will relate the concerns of the shaman class to SoE, and at the same time relate SoE's feedback back to the shaman community. From what I have read, Sudedor seems capable of doing that. He seems to have a good style of communication and is not afraid to speak.<br />
<br />
Nowhere in what I hear about correspondents is a need for or a requirement to be an end game raider. While I'm sure as much experience in that end will make it easier to relate issues in that area, it is not necessary. It seems that some people thing that this position makes Sudedor the &quot;idea man&quot;. It doesn't--it makes him the mouthpiece of the shaman community to SoE, as well as SoE's mouthpiece to the shaman community on the class issues. It doesn't mean that Sudedor might not have ideas for issues to present. I would hope that anyone who's spent a lick of time playing for a class they DEEPLY care about can offer ideas. But to be most effective, he's going to need to present THE COMMUNITY's ideas. He's been in these parts long enough to have a handle on the major ones. And for those end game raiding shamans: if you feel he needs to learn more about end-game issues to better present a case, then by all means educate him on the issue! Constructive posting and working with him will accomplish more than will crisicizing his skill or ability to represent us as a correspondent. <br />
<br />
I, for one, am glad he at least is offering his time to take on this responsibility. Thank you.<br />
<br />
On a side note, many classes have expressed a great deal of reservedness and trepidation over who their correspondents are. We have heard of the problems the monks have with theirs. For some reason, every new anecdote about him kind of reminds me of Dan Quayle. :) Other classes have a great dislike for the person chosen based on popularity, active vs lurker status on class boards, etc. If nothing else, they should be appreciated for what they are trying to do for a game they care a great deal about. In looking at the rest of the classes' correspondents, we are FAR from the barrel's bottom in who we have obtained. If you doubt that, read some of the other classes' message boards (non-EQLive ones tho).</div></div><hr />

I don't know what the big deal is.  i am not at the end game so I don't experience everything that's going wrong with the class, but I know my character, I know our spells (except the GoD ones I'm missing, but can read about them from all of you and Lucy), and can read up on the mobs that are due to come. I can put 2 and 2 together to see that things are broken.  If we weren't able to do that, then how did we get all that support for the proposal?</div></div><hr />

YES - that about sums it up<br />
<br />
Why Nuggruk? It's irrelevant as long as Sudedor reads and comprehends what high end shaman are complaining about here on the Crucible. And from the content of Sudedor's posts here it seems that he does understand what our problems are in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">Okay first thing, I really have no problem with Sudedor as a person or to be honest with most of things he has posted.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Second thing, what do you choose....<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Somene who has EXPERIENCED the problem's you are concerned with<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2. Someone who has READ about the problem's you are concerned with<br />
<br />
<br />
To me it's a no brainer, obvious, smack in the head with a clue by 4 answer, Experience. <br />
<br />
Now okay I will grant you that there are many ignorant turds who have the correct experience who I would in no way want to be associated with or represented by, purely on the basis that they could not articulate themseleves out of the back of a truck.... however there are a lot of very experienced very articulate shaman they could have chosen over someone who is not even in elementals....<br />
<br />
/Sigh in anyevent I guess we have our class rep and we should probably try and work with him in the hope that SoE decides to actually listen, my personal view though is that the appointment of these reps is just another sop to the playerbase that wont really achieve very much.<br />
<br />
SoE are just so damn frustrating, I would like to go over there and have a chat with some of them.... maybe in a dark alley late at night :)</div></div><hr />

Sorry that is bollocks.<br />
Slow being handed out to 3 classes and slow mitigation etc affects every level of shaman not just people in the high end.<br />
Now believe it or not there are problems with Shaman that are lvl 65 but not EP,Time etc flagged.<br />
Now to someone who has finished Uqua these problems are probably not even known or cared about.<br />
You could probably walk into Tactics etc and have no problem but believe me some of us do have problems.<br />
Next time you log on your shaman look at LFG and see how many 65 shaman there are lfg compared to how it used to be.<br />
I would personally have liked to have seen Chutoi as class rep as although he knows all about the end game he doesnt seem to have lost touch with how it is before the end game.<br />
Good luck to Sudedor because not only is he probably going to be ignored by SoE but hes gonna be fighting against a lot of people who hes supposed to be helping judging by some of the posts.<br />

You want someone who can represent your problems (assuming you are talking about problems you are personally experiencing), I have no problem with that whatsoever.<br />
<br />
However please extend me the same courtesy of wanting the same benefit, i.e someone has experienced my problems.<br />
<br />
Anyway I don't really want to get into a big argument over something neither of us can have the slightest effect on, so have fun and enjoy the game.<br />

Yup I saw your point.<br />
Yes you have many more problems than me the bazaar/Ldon geared shaman.<br />
But in all this debate the typical bazaar/ldon geared shaman is being forgotten about.<br />
Perhaps we need 2 reps 1 for normal players and 1 for high end players.<br />

Think thats a joke one of the past sony reps told or something.  Considering it came from inside you might end up finding it rather fitting.<br />
<br />
btw, good luck</div></div><hr />

Prolly not more problem, but different for sure.<br />
I still group in BoT, I still answer to fellow shaman brother and sister  questions (even from level 1 shaman), but I'm far from beeing able to understand your problems and solving mine would prolly not help you at all. Like solving yours will not help me. <br />
We don't have the same &quot;vision&quot; of the shaman because the &quot;vision&quot; changed for us once we stepped into high end GoD. <br />
<br />
I don't care if Sudedor is a &quot;high end GoD&quot; raiding shaman or a Ldon/bazaar equiped one (no shame beeing one). <br />
I'll judge him on the results, but he gotta explain me his post about shaman not beeing slower and the effect on our muramite bp *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">Shaman rep is Banditman<br />
<br />
The &quot;official&quot; role description:<br />
<br />
Based on the official role description the job is not to represent shamans as such, but to report what is being discussed by shamans.  If this is the case, game level is less important than the ability to commuincate and to report coherantly what is said on sites like this one.<br />
<br />
I think SOE made a fine choice, given the job description.  Communication skills and a level head are more important than knowledge of the end game.<br />
<br />
It remains up to the more experienced people to bring up issues that concern their level of the game, and I have little doubt that they will continue to do so.</div></div><hr />
