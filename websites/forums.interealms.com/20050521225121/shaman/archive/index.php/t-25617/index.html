<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baron Fuzzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Its been a long time since I've met a player new to EQ. Been longer still since I had a little fun messing with em. Below is what happened when I brought out an old retired char of mine to help my group gain exp,  he was mostly naked and sitting near the group  to cast buffs and heals.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Group member - Who is he?<br />
 <br />
Me - Hes a heal bot.<br />
 <br />
- Is he an npc? That follows you around and heals?<br />
 <br />
Me - Yes, exactly.<br />
 <br />
- Howd you get him?<br />
 <br />
Me - You know, that quest with the dragons in western wastes. You give them fishing grubs to start it.<br />
 <br />
- Can you help me do it?<br />
 <br />
Me - Sorry, were too low.<br />
 <br />
- Howd you do it?<br />
 <br />
Me - I summoned a dragon to help me.<br />
 <br />
- How do you summon dragons?<br />
 <br />
Me - Leave dwarf meat out all over the zone, calls em every time.<br />
 <br />
- Can I do it?<br />
 <br />
Me - No, you have to sacrifice a bunch of dwarves first. At least 50.<br />
 <br />
- How?<br />
 <br />
Me - Basically you have to sneak up on them and club them from behind. Ask in bazaar or pok, theyll know how.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Around this time I had to leave. I wish I couldve stayed to see if he actually asked. If he asks me any more about it, got any ideas what to say to him? I dont really want to send him off to some zone where he'll be sure to die, but I can rez him if the evil urge is too great to resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">dont mess with newbies :\ we were all new at one point or another.. it only leads to dumber raiders later on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i always loved to:<br />
<br />
tell random_noobie_02: hey you want some cash ?<br />
<br />
random_noobie_02:yeah<br />
<br />
me: hands him 2000cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it used to be funnier.. leave a few thousand copper pieces on the ground and see which newbie has the patience to bring it to the bank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">:(   I have only been playing EQ for 10 months.  I was a total newbie when I started.  MOST everyone was nice to me, but there were a few times when people mocked me.  I go out of my way to help people now.  I remember what it was like not that long ago.  The one problem with that is that you get little people following you around.  <br />
<br />
I gave a whole bunch of my low level gear to a little shaman (level 23 or so)  Found out this kid is 13 in real life and he likes to chat.  Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind talking to him, but sometimes it's hard to deal with.  Get tells from him almost every day.  Got a tell from him the other day, don't know what zone he was in, but his group had wiped, he was the only one alive and was lost in zone.  He asked me to come help him.  Now, I would have, but I was in a MPG group.  So what do you do with people like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Now, if you had only worked Burned Woods into the whole conversation....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ROFL....yeah...everyone needs to read that story...Burning Woods...<br />
<br />
anyway, I'm not so new, though I've only recently started posting to the crucible in the most recent months (simply because I feel I have gotten to a level of play that I might have something to contribute to conversations)<br />
<br />
I've alway been pretty generous to newbies who are respectable, this is in striking contrast to the ones that annoy you to no end.<br />
<br />
I have no problem giving a true newb a few plat (its easy to spot when you have a low alt in gloomingdeep) , and maybe a piece of gear they could use. what annoys me is the ones that sit outside the main bank in PoK OOCing for plat, gear, and buffs constantly. these aren't newbs. <br />
<br />
When I started to play seriously,  I didn't know how to get around, nor did I know how to /ooc or /t people to beg the crap out of them and honestly, I wouldn't ask for plat or gear, buffs are something I don't typically ask for, but if offered, I won't deny. the ones who sit in PoK OOCing are typically people looking to stock their trader.<br />
(get your skill at begging up to 10!)<br />
<br />
anyway, back to topic, I'd mess with a newb a little bit from time to time, but before it gets too bad, I'll let them know I was toying with them, and point them in the right direction....just the way I do things...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ah, what the hell,  here's the Burning Woods story<br />
<br />
E-Bay Babies (get 911 on the way this will kill ya)<br />
<br />
I was forwarded an email from Battle Cry's website....I just HAD to share this....<br />
<br />
<br />
HAVE YOU EVER MET SOMEONE LIKE THIS? A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A NECRO !!!!!<br />
<br />
So there I was.....minding my own business in The Overthere, when all of a sudden I see the message: &quot;d00d sow plz&quot;.<br />
<br />
Of course, my natural instinct was not to answer, since I thought the clueless newb (hereafter referred to politely as &quot;the petitioner&quot;) must have been poorly informed at best.<br />
<br />
Boy was I ever wrong.<br />
<br />
I switch out of 1st person into an external camera, and what did my wandering <br />
eyes behold? Only myself and the <br />
petitioner. <br />
<br />
So I says to myself....&quot;Self? You need to edumacate this fella!&quot;<br />
<br />
(Keep in mind what the overall setting looked like: There I was, in skeleton form, carrying a scythe, FLOATING IN MIDAIR IN A MEDITATING POSITION, with a LARGE dark-brown skeleton named &quot;Gibober&quot; standing behind me. Ummm....No, skippy, I'm not a druid or a shaman.)<br />
<br />
I say &quot;Wish I could, bro, but I don't have SoW. I'm a Necromancer.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Petitioner says, &quot;$#*&amp;@#$ dick, sow me already! it's for a cr&quot; <br />
<br />
Feeling as if my feathers had been ruffled a bit, I do a &quot;/who all dumbass&quot; (um..pardon..I meant &quot;/who all petitioner&quot;)<br />
<br />
This is where I discovered the &quot;/who all&quot; bug. Certainly it must have been a bug, right? There's NO WAY IN CREATION the dumbas...err...petitioner could have been a level 31 Dark Elf Wizard, right???? RIGHT????? /em begins to cry like a little girl.<br />
<br />
Well, needless to say, I couldn't have been any more shocked than if my pet began dancing an Irish Jig. I quickly begin the arduous task of maintaining my composure, while deciding how best to deal with this tricky situation.<br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Necromancer's can't cast SoW&quot;.<br />
<br />
Petitioner says, &quot;Bull@#$%! you cast a spell while you were running and you sped up! i couldn't catch you until you sat down! if you're not going to sow me just say so you dont have to be a dick about it a$$hole&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes I know....he didn't use any punctuation in that last sentence.<br />
<br />
I say, &quot;I have JBoots.&quot;<br />
<br />
He says, &quot;what are they&quot;<br />
<br />
Before I have a chance to pick my chin up off the floor....<br />
<br />
Petitioner asks, &quot;can you buff my hps my hp sux&quot;<br />
<br />
I say, &quot;I can't buff you, dude. I'm a necromancer. I only have one buff that you would probably want.&quot;<br />
<br />
He says, &quot;yeah the one you won't give me dick&quot; <br />
<br />
Ok. Time to have fun with the hopelessly clueless.<br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Why do you need a sow?&quot;<br />
<br />
He says, &quot;i need to get to burned woods to hunt. sumbody said its perfect for my level&quot; <br />
<br />
Yep. That's what he said......&quot;burned woods&quot;.<br />
<br />
I say, &quot;man are you ever in the wrong place.&quot;<br />
<br />
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br />
<br />
Apparently he found the &quot;question mark&quot; key conveniently located nearby other various and sundry communication facilitators.<br />
<br />
I didn't answer him.<br />
<br />
He repeats, &quot;??&quot; <br />
<br />
Found it twice...good for him. <br />
<br />
He repeats, &quot;???&quot; <br />
<br />
Having an IQ greater than plantlife, I sensed a pattern forming.<br />
<br />
I say, &quot;You are NO WHERE near Burned Woods.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;my friend told me it was in kunark&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Yeah, the operative word there is 'WAS'. There was a major patch a couple of months ago after a bunch of complaints were filed about 'static content'.&quot;<br />
<br />
He says, &quot;?&quot;<br />
<br />
I say, &quot;!&quot;<br />
<br />
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;,&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;***&quot;<br />
<br />
I say, &quot;no, already have some.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;????&quot; <br />
<br />
I don't respond. <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;so where the @#$% is burned woods&quot; <br />
<br />
He lost the question mark button again. Probably popped off when he was sniffing his feet. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Well, THIS week it's south of Freeport. It changes with every patch, since they began randomizing zone locations.&quot; <br />
<br />
My guild is hysterical at this point. And I haven't even told them the ENTIRE story yet. Just snippets. <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;@#$% i just got off the boat&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;You don't need the boat.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says &quot;why&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;You're a wizard!&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;how you know that&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
<br />
I say, &quot;I did a /wh...nevermind....the important thing is you have <br />
teleportation spells.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;oh yeah the green ones&quot; <br />
<br />
I nod. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Yep. The 'green ones'. Pretty nice how you have them grouped by color.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;thx&quot;<br />
<br />
I say, &quot;How'd you think about doing it that way?&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;they were all @#$%## up when i got this char&quot;<br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Sit down and mem the spell 'Fay Gate'.&quot;<br />
<br />
He says, &quot;why&quot;<br />
<br />
Question mark key is on the ground in front of your chair, guy. Mixed in with your collection of boogers. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;It's going to put you within spitting distance of Burned Woods.&quot;<br />
<br />
He says, &quot;how do you know&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;All patch messages come with a zone connection map.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;oh&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Ok. You have it memmed now?&quot; <br />
<br />
He had just stood up after what I assumed was meditating/looking at his spell book. <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;yeah&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Ok. Cast the spell and let me know when you get there.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dumba...errr....Petitioner begins to cast a spell. <br />
A LONG time goes by.....ok, maybe 5 minutes <br />
I still haven't heard from him.<br />
<br />
Getting curious:<br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;Are you there yet?&quot; <br />
<br />
No reply. No reply at all. [Yes, I'm a Genesis fan... ] <br />
<br />
Obviously he's there, or my tell wouldn't have gone through. <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;Hit the 'r' key to reply to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;i'm here now where do i go.&quot; <br />
<br />
Right idea....wrong punctuation mark. Oh well. &quot;C&quot; for effort. <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;Ok, do you see a hotkey on the screen that says 'Sense Heading'?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;no&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Hit the arrow buttons one by one until you see one.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was a guess, but an educated one.<br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;found it&quot;<br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Click on it.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;north&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Ok, you need to head east along the path. Keep going until the path turns north. When it forks to the right, take the right fork.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;ok&quot; <br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe the guy who sold his account on Ebay worked his Felwithe faction up. <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;sumbody told me i shouldnt be here cause i'm a dark elf&quot;<br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;They were roleplaying.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;oh hehe @#$%@#$ morons ;P&quot; <br />
<br />
Priceless. Utterly priceless, I tell you. <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Where are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;i see something now. looks like a castle&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Run into the castle as fast as you can. The guards might give you some trouble, just keep running.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah...damned conscience started kicking in.<br />
<br />
A fairly long period of time passes. Not sure how long, but longer than I was expecting. <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;What happened?&quot; <br />
<br />
As if I didn't know.... <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;my spells are gone!&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;i died why&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Oh man! Did I tell you to run east or west?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;east ***???&quot;<br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Yikes. My bad. You should have run west.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;?&quot;<br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;So where are you now?&quot;<br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;how can i tell&quot;<br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Look right after you see 'Loading please wait'. It should tell you <br />
'You have entered [zone]'.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies &quot;it doesnt say [zone] there.&quot; <br />
<br />
After smacking my head against my monitor.... <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;What does it say in place of [zone]?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Get this.... <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;Burning Woods&quot; <br />
<br />
I nearly fell out of my chair! I couldn't have PLANNED it that way! <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;is that the same as burned woods&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;No, but you're close. Start running south so you can get your <br />
corpse back.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;i have to get my corpse back?????&quot;<br />
<br />
/ignore petitioner<br />
<br />
Moral of the story: EBay...Just Say No! <br />
<br />
Out of sheer curiosity, I took him off ignore later to find out what <br />
happened. <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;How's it going?&quot;<br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;***? where you been&quot;<br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;been afk, sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;got my corpse back. some dude rezzed me.&quot; <br />
<br />
My conscience somewhat eased... <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Really? Cool! Where are you now?&quot;<br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;iceclad ocean&quot;<br />
<br />
I scratch my head a few times.<br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Why Velious?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;the guy that rezzed me told me burned woods was in western wastes this week&quot; <br />
<br />
I don't recall exactly how long it took me to stop laughing. I stopped <br />
breathing shortly before my dog dialed 911. <br />
<br />
He replied, &quot;@#$%&amp;* wouldnt sow me either. what is that sh#$ gold?&quot; <br />
<br />
That's what finally killed me. I'm writing this from the afterlife.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That story cracks me up every time!  Anyone have the followup story?  The one with the dwarf in GFay seeing this dark elf?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nevermind.  I found it.  :)  I just cut and paste it.  Didn't bother to clean up the formatting any.<br />
<br />
This is the follow up story from the cleric who rezzed him near Felwithe. Friend of mine digged it up, probably on the same necro site. &quot; <br />
quote <br />
Here comes some idiot Dark Elf running past me, running straight down the road that is going to lead him to Felwithe. I scratch my head, and being the nosey sort of Dwarf that I am...I send him a tell. <br />
I tell the DE, &quot;Wait&quot; <br />
DE tells me, &quot;?&quot; <br />
I sigh into my ale as I take another long draught off of it before running up to him and saying, &quot;Ye really don't wanna go messin around over there with them High Elves' They look like pansies, but they aint.&quot; <br />
The DE stands there with a vacant look on his face for a few minutes before just running away. Do a /who on the DE and find out he's 31st level. Ok, so maybe he knows what he's doing. I've seen Ogres in North Freeport, after all. I go back to drinking my ale. <br />
Out of curiosity, I send him another tell a few minutes later. <br />
I tell the DE, &quot;Not gettin' into any trouble over there are ye?&quot; <br />
DE tells me, &quot;**** !@#$% roleplayer&quot; <br />
I sigh into my ale again, finishing it off. Ah, tis the season of the twit. <br />
I stand up and head towards Felwithe to resupply my ale. <br />
Just as I get to the gates of the ugliest city on Norrath, what do I find but a dead dark elf and a pair of guards snickering and cleaning their weapons. Now this is priceless. <br />
I do a /who on the poor soul and see he is in Burning Woods. Being the sucker that I am, I feel compelled to rez the twit...after all, I am a !@#$% roleplayer and I roleplay a !@#$% cleric...albeit a !@#$% grumpy one. <br />
I sit down to mem Reviviscene and while I am waiting for it to refresh I send the DE a tell. <br />
I tell the DE, &quot;Would ye like a rez?&quot; <br />
DE tells me, &quot;no i want a !@#$% sow dumbas i have to run south to get my corpse back so dont be a dick and just sow me plz&quot; <br />
I look around for an ale but unfortunatly Brell hates me at this moment in time, so I simply reply. &quot;If I rez ya, ye wont need to run south to yer body. You will appear at yer body. I am not standing near you, I am standing near yer corpse.&quot; <br />
DE tells me, &quot;d00d rez plz&quot; <br />
As I sigh I look at my Holy Symbol of Brell and sigh &quot;I'm gonna get a stout named after me right?&quot; and I tell the DE &quot;Consent me so I can rez ya&quot; but I get no reply. No reply at all. So I say it again &quot;Consent me so I can rez ya&quot; <br />
DE tells me, &quot;ok you can rez me&quot; <br />
I sit down again at this point. I have no ale and this is gonna take awhile. <br />
I tell the DE, &quot;Type /consent and my name&quot; Being a smart dwarf I tell the DE, &quot;/consent Cleric_01&quot; and say again &quot;Just like that&quot; before he can make my head hurt more. <br />
Sure enough, I recieve consent to drag his corpse. So I stand up and get ready to drag the corpse when suddenly I am denied permission to drag his corpse. I begin to think like him and I think &quot;***?&quot; So I tell the DE, &quot;No...just type it once. One more time. That's it. Dont type it again&quot; thinking that as soon as I get this over with, I can go buy more ale and my head will stop hurting. <br />
I recieve consent and I quickly drag it towards the zone since this is the direction the guy was going anyway. I get the body by the zone and cast Rez on it, comforted by the fact that I am one heal away from being done with this guy. <br />
The naked DE appears in front of me and I stand up to cast my final spell of this exchange when he says to me &quot;your that !@#%% roleplayer&quot; and then a moment later, almost as an afterthought &quot;thx&quot; <br />
Compelled at this point, I ask &quot;Why were you running into Felwithe when you are KoS?&quot; <br />
DE says, &quot;I was going to burned woods&quot; <br />
I say, &quot;Burning Woods?&quot; <br />
DE says, &quot;no dumbass i go there when i die i want to hunt burned woods&quot; <br />
I say, &quot;Who told you to go hunting in Burned Woods, inside Felwithe?&quot; <br />
DE says, &quot;some dick who wouldn't sow me&quot; and then &quot;will you sow me plz, its for a CR&quot; <br />
I stand there drooling on myself for a moment, trying to catch up. I havent had an ale in a good 20 minutes at this point, so I am starting to see spots. <br />
DE says, &quot;dont be a dick just sow me before they move the zone again&quot; <br />
I stare at the lad and ask &quot;Move Burned Woods? Again?&quot; <br />
DE says, &quot;yea&quot; <br />
I finally snap and say, &quot;They aren't going to move it again. Once they moved it to Western Wastes, with all the snow, it stopped burning.&quot; <br />
DE says, &quot;i saw a burning tree&quot; <br />
I say, &quot;Exactly my point. Now if they would only move Burning Woods there it would stop too and people wouldn't go there when they die.&quot; <br />
DE says, &quot;can you sow me, its for CR&quot; <br />
I say, &quot;sow doesnt work in IC until you get past EW and then it will work for CR's only until you get to WW, then ask the first person you see for sow there.&quot; I add as an afterthought &quot;Sometimes they look like flying blue things but they can sow&quot; <br />
DE says, &quot;***???&quot; <br />
I say, &quot;Allow me to use smaller words. You do not need a sow yet. Do what I say and you'll get there right away.&quot; and then &quot;Sit down and mem the spell Bind Affinity&quot; <br />
DE is silent for a bit and finally says &quot;its red&quot; as he is standing up I say, &quot;I am glad they covered Colors this week. Now target yourself and cast this spell. &quot; He just stands there for a minute, so I add &quot;it will r0ck&quot; and he begins to cast the spell, binding himself behind the guards at Felwithe. I feel somewhat better already, maybe I dont need ale. <br />
DE says, &quot;it said bound&quot; and begins to giggle <br />
I say, &quot;Now sit down and mem the spell Iceclad Gate. This will r0ck even more.&quot; <br />
DE says, &quot;this one is green&quot; <br />
I say, &quot;You're damn good at those colors man&quot; <br />
DE says, &quot;thx&quot; <br />
When the DE stands up I say &quot;This is going to take you to Iceclad Ocean. <br />
It's an ocean so that's why they moved Burned Woods there....to put it out.&quot; <br />
DE says, &quot;what about sow&quot; <br />
I say, &quot;Remember that sow wont work until you are on a CR in WW. In fact you actually run faster in snow if you set the RUN button to WALK. Do that now.&quot; <br />
DE says, &quot;ok&quot; <br />
I say, &quot;Now cast Iceclad Gate....the Green one. Remember to run straight out of where you appear and dont stop swimming until you hit Burned Woods.&quot; DE begins to cast a spell and I zone in to get my ale....remembering that the Ignore list cures most headaches that ale cant and feeling somewhat better about going back to Sebilis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Once a friend and I were sitting around in EC (before the bazaar) and someone /ooc'd &quot;where do u get ore?&quot;<br />
<br />
He must have been frustated by the 6th one, because suddenly I get a tell from the guy.<br />
<br />
Him: where do u get ore<br />
Me: from vendors<br />
Him: i went 2 the vendors here they r out<br />
Him: where do u get ore<br />
Me: I think the orcs here drop it too<br />
Him: that takes 2 long<br />
<br />
I snickered to myself and thought...this ought to be good. I may as well have fun since this guy decided I knew anything about smithing for some reason.<br />
<br />
Me: Oh...well you can also dig for it.<br />
(long silence)<br />
Him: where<br />
Me: Sometimes you can get it here in EC, but first you have to go get a shovel. You can use your hands, but it goes faster with a shovel.<br />
Him: where<br />
(A man of few words...)<br />
Me: The gardener in the very north west corner of this zone.<br />
Him: thats 2 far. where do i dig<br />
Me: OK, you have to dig in the sand. Just go over there and type /dig. Since you don't have a shovel it might be a while before you get something.<br />
Me: If you don't have any luck after a while, try moving spots. Someone might have already dug it up from that place.<br />
Him: thx<br />
<br />
I camped from there...I was laughing too hard.  My friend said she saw him wandering all around the desert-y part of the zone untill she camped herself.  Can't help but wondering if he ever went to get that shovel :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baron Fuzzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Most annoying thing anyone could do to me back in the day was ask for money or items. Some poor guy who just started and had nothing I would help out, but never a beggar.<br />
 <br />
Can u give pp plz?<br />
 <br />
Hated em. Took every oppurtunity to hurt them. The /d for donate thing got old fast, so I had to improvise. Inviting them into my group and porting them somewhere distant was good - toxxulia was good before kunark, then emerald jungle or skyfire was perfect.<br />
 <br />
I think the best thing I ever did to a beggar was bind him over one of the lifts in kelethin. I told him to wait a second after I started casting and then jump off. We timed it perfectly, he got bound right as he stepped off and fell to his death.<br />
 <br />
And he kept dieing. Again and again, until a gm came and rescued him. I did split 10pp over the group when he was with me, so at least he got something out of it.</div></div><hr />

Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind talking to him, but sometimes it's hard to deal with.  Get tells from him almost every day.  Got a tell from him the other day, don't know what zone he was in, but his group had wiped, he was the only one alive and was lost in zone.  He asked me to come help him.  Now, I would have, but I was in a MPG group.  So what do you do with people like this?<br />
<br />
oh god.. i hate people like this.. you help them once and they think they can just message you every god damn day, heres a hint: /ignore :P</div></div><hr />

I guessed what he really wanted, and invited him to my group under the pretense of buffing him. I jump into the arena, and in seconds hes on me trying to backstab. Rooted him, took a step back, and he didnt even realize what I started casting. One minute later, hes stranded in emerald jungle and I've already gated back.<br />

Rogue tells you, 'you better not be there when I get back.'<br />

I never saw him again.</div></div><hr />

Apparently, for a very short time mind you, Wizards could also TL people to other planes.  Again with no confirmation.<br />
<br />
This led to some interesting moments I am sure.<br />

Group_Member_01: &quot;Yo Wizard, we're camping this {Item}.&quot;<br />

My favorite was to have beggars in Gfay auto-follow my Monk to the bank. Of course he would promptly run over the side of the highest platform I could get away with.<br />

*chuckles*<br />
<br />
Natural selection.<br />
<br />
The care and feeding of newbies is a fine thing.<br />
*grins*<br />
I shall never forget when my friend took the time to fully buff me, and then told me to go directly to loc somehting,, it was right over the water.<br />
<br />
I died cause I did not know how to swim, he had never explained how and I was huriedly paging through the EQ manual looking for &quot;swimming&quot;, &quot;going up&quot; &quot;breathing&quot; and anythign else I could think of.<br />
I honestly got it into my head somehow that I must be forgetting some keypress, somewhere, that made my toon breathe.<br />
<br />
I see nothing wrong with the teasing of newbies. It was funny then, and even more funny now.<br />
<br />
Yeah, some of the stuff we've discussed here is cruel.... But not most of it.<br />
<br />
I don't agree that it leads to dumber raiders later. it simply helps mark them. *everyone* needs to be messed with at one point or another.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's healthy<br />
