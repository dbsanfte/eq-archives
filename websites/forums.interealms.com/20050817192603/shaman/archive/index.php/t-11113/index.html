<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I remember we used to have a shaman wish list sticky for ages, but it eventually vanished.  I thought it was a well thought out, collective compilation, and was updated a lot.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's time for another one.  Off the top of my head, I've done a small list.  I'm sure there's many more that can be added.  Perhaps someone better informed then me should try and get a stickey put up. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Still waiting for post 60 STR/DEX spells to be removed.<br />
<br />
- Alchemy, improved but still not rewarding enough.  Definately not on par with other trade skills, not even the other class specific ones.<br />
<br />
- Forage Herb, this has been a good idea for years.  Would make alchemy profitable and if done correctly not overpowerd.  My personal suggestion is that the more expencive the herb, the harder it is to find.  So say a 100pp herb could only be found in the bottom of Lower Guk, or deep in HS?  Each zone could have a specific herb allocated to it, otherwise people wil just get bogged down with random herbs they don't need.  This could maybe be an AA skill.  This would be totally seperate from normal forage.  I think even from a Roleplaying PoV, this is a good idea.  Only drawback I can see is coding.<br />
<br />
- Critical DoTs, we're not nukers we're Dotters.  Crit AA's are of limited use to us, how about we get the DoT equivilant?  Even at the expence of losing our nuke AA's?<br />
<br />
- Rabid bear, this is a gimic AA and serves no real practical use.  Something radical should be done to it maybe?<br />
<br />
- Shaman melee, this is more a personal request.  But I've always felt that the melee penalty on shamans is far too great.  It doesn't need to be made much better, just less gimped.<br />
<br />
- Spell drops, at least before SoE had the excuse that our top of the range high level spells (topor, malo, VoB, etc.) are soooo powerful that they have to be limited greatly in their drop rate.  But let's face it, with some of the great stuff out there now for other classes, and the fact that we get even better versions which are easier to get at 65.  We have a stronger case now then ever before to get thier drop rate massively improved.<br />
<br />
- Healing?  Controversial one this one, personally I'm happy with our healing the way it is, I don't even like healing.  But many others seem to be unhappy with it.<br />
<br />
- Affliction focus for more then just DoT's?  OK, most of us grudgingly admit now that it shouldn't have been there in the first place.  But the amount of time it was left in, only to be removed unannounced left many people bitter.  Perhaps some compensation is in order or maybe just reversing the decision?  (again).<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of these are personal ideas, some other seem to be the general concensus.  I'm not trying to speak on behalf of all shamans here, just trying to get the ball rolling on putting our collective minds to positive use in this way again.</div></div><hr />

Yes.<br />
<br />
As far as Foci that work for our detrimentals, we have them already.  they are just not as easy to get.</div></div><hr />

Bah it's not like the people at Verant can spell any better.. I recall a serverwide message saying that EQOA was going to be released on 'Wenesday'. =P.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1 and 6 I agree with. 2 I agree with to a point, I just don't think it should be on our top ten requests, its not like your missing anything if you choose to do alchemy or not to.<br />
<br />
The rest are just gimme gimme gimme. Maybe VI would be more willing to listen to there customers if there customers didn't make ludicrous requests all the time.</div></div><hr />

Man, can't say jack anymore without getting made fun of on these boards. Sheesh.:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Every class have some junk spells in spectre parchment turn in.<br />
Even they nerfed from turn in list, you might get 3 lv 64 root like me.    <br />
<br />
Does anyone care about their eternal parchment turn in now?  Most lv 61, 62 spells are selling at bazaar now.  And shaman junk lv 63, 64 str, dex buff on sale at bazaar all the day.<br />
<br />
UPGRADE shaman str, dex spell will be better idea, like add proc effect or skill mod,  and upgrade Tailsman of Kragg.   So shaman will consider it useful.<br />
<br />
ADD deity only spell like: Bless of the Warlord(offence +5%)<br />
                                        <br />
                                       Bless of the Faceless(alt +5%)<br />
 <br />
                                       Bless of the Lightbringer(defense +5%)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just a few off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
1.)  Make all Dots last 3 tics, or at least the 50+ ones<br />
<br />
2.)  Reduce agro and resistance on poison Dots<br />
<br />
3.)  Make all buffs cast faster with a faster refresh<br />
<br />
4.)  Remove all 61+ single buff spells<br />
<br />
5.)  Either up our healing spells to the Druid equivalent or scale back the casting time and agro accordingly<br />
<br />
6.)  Extend the duration of our 60+ group buffs<br />
<br />
7.)  Group Shrink<br />
<br />
8.)  Alchemy<br />
<br />
9.)  Curses<br />
<br />

That would be Malo[sini] then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really can't believe you made this comment.  Look at Druids, Rangers, and Bards....they need to be hit with the nerf bat many many times over....yet they(SoE) won't because they cry the loudest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It does seem like Shaman could stand to have a bone or two tossed to them, along with, off the top of my head, warriors and monks. Just because they aren't casters doesn't mean they shouldn't have any utility anymore.<br />

<br />
 Yeah  I love how that played out, we effectively got punished for the relative uselessness of DoTs. If DoT's hadn't sucked in the first place those focus effects could have had smaller percentages and worked for all afflictions except charm. And now SoE has the nerve to say &quot;yeah we might introduce a new focus effect for you, but like, you know.. later &quot; Sure they will.<br />
<br />
 That aside I agree with Scurvey, it would be fun if Shaman could melee now and then and if rabid bear was actually something you looked forward to using.<br />
<br />
 As for healing, why does our heal have to cost the same mana, have the same agro, same cast time, but heal less than a druid? Could they at least have like, a smaller chance to fizzle? Anything so its not categorically inferior.</div></div><hr />
