<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chasim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have all the parts for Canni II, except the Crushed Diamonds.  I've been to Gorla Island a few times... and looked around -8840, -6080, I haven't found any ground spawn.<br />
<br />
Do the crushed diamonds still ground spawn there?  If so, have I been in the wrong spot or is there a respawn time (so maybe someone is grabbing before me)?<br />
<br />
Also... when I con the Great Oowomp (I'm a troll), he's dubious.  He responds to Hail but I can't get him to tell me anymore.  Is dubious good enough to do the hand in and get Canni II?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help... hoping to finish in the morning if I can figure this stuff out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did the quest about 2 months ago and had no trouble finding the diamonds.  They pop right under one of the Gorlas spawn points so you will probably have to kill one of them.  I got them right away so I don't personally know the respawn but I've heard between 8 and 12 hours.<br />
<br />
Check in the bazaar and see if someone is selling them,  it's a common tactic for someone to time the spawn and then monopolize it for profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there is a decent respawn on them, probably an hour or 2 at the least.  Maybe just had bad luck on that.<br />
<br />
Also, I believe dubious faction will work, don't remember what mine was, but I'm an iksar and it couldn't have been too good.  If you're worried about it, give her the diamonds alone first, she should ask for the rest if you're ok, or tell you to go away if not.  At least that way you lose the easiest piece to pick up (literally).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like the right loc, you should find em there if you hang around.<br />
<br />
I did this quest on Friday just gone, and gave stuff to oowomp at dubious and got the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chasim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the replies, I finished the quest early yesterday.  I logged in very early EST and the bag was there - btw, it's very easy to see, so if it's not there, don't think you're just missing it.  Also, dubious faction was fine... I actually MQed the bones with another character of mine that was also dubious.  Funny thing, neither could get Oogwomp to continue his dialogue past Hail... but obviously that's not needed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What is your religion -- Innoruuk? I'm wondering what makes him dubious to you instead of indifferent.<br />
<br />
Does he respond to Hail or not? Does he respond to 'Who are the McMerin Clan?'<br />
<br />
Invis works fine for picking up the diamonds if you don't feel like killing the Golra.</div></div><hr />
