<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brettation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seeing around Level 65... What would our DPS be using Blood of Sryrn, Breath of Ultor and the doggy w/ super shammie buffs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Blood of Saryrn: dps of about 53 for 7 ticks (42 seconds)<br />
Breath of Ultor: dps of about 22 for 26 ticks (2.6 min)<br />
Pet (depends on mob): dps of approx 35<br />
<br />
So for short periods of time while you have mana, you could theoretically do 110 dps.  This does not factor in mana regen, resists, and the variation among mobs in their ac, damage mitigation, etc.<br />
<br />
Problems with this scenario are that the dog cannot tank effectively mobs that are much more than light blue or low dark blue at level 65.  If the shaman tanks, then lots of mana will go into healing, and even with good regen, mana regen (FT stuff), mana recovery will be a problem.<br />
<br />
Another source of dps for one minute (6 ticks) is spirit call.  With SC 3 (5 pets), each doing approximately 1500 damage (will vary with mob), you could theoretically get an additional 125 dps.<br />
<br />
The overall dps of a level 65 shaman is not sufficient to effectively solo in PoP Tier 2 and 3 zones as some classes can, so shaman soloing at 65 is probably not an effective way to gain experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   Since most groups tend to be riddled with these problems however, I still consider soloing to be my main source of exp.   We are quite capable of doing it at 65 :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Recalculate that Gardeltron, a tick is 6 seconds not 10.<br />
<br />
You're right.  A tick is 6 seconds, which is 1/10 of a minute.  26 ticks is 6*26 = 156 seconds, which is 156/60 = 2.6 minutes.  Or looking at it another way, one tick is 0.1 minute, so 26 ticks is 0.1*26 or 2.6 minutes.<br />
<br />
My calculations are right as given.<br />
<br />
Numbers for spells were taken from Lucy:<br />

<br />
Pet damage estimates were taken from parses done on mobs that conned blue to me.  And for the pets, yes, a minute is 10 ticks instead of 6, but the damage output was calculated by dividing 1500hp*5pets by 60 seconds, which gives a dps of 125.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Caanus, I'm wondering what you're soloing technique is, and where you go to solo in PoP.  I've found that in HoH, for example, I can't really effectively solo IN TEH FACE because mobs hit so hard I'm constantly healing myself and run low on mana.  So I end up resorting to root/dot, but this is very slow and generally sucks up mana very fast, plus I can't use the pet effectively in such a situation due to its inability to take much damage.  Without snare or any type of pacify spell, single pulling can be a problem as well.  I would argue that once out of PoJ, PoI, or PoN, shamans cannot solo effectively in PoP.  How has your experience differed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think he was referring to this part.  1min = 10ticks<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you read some posts in the hunting post 60 section you will see the areas where shaman solo and the methods.. it's basically root/rotting.. if you need to break camp you root a mob by zone and zone out then come back and kill it.. root/dot is the way it's done canni makes downtime go away.. there are shaman that solo tier 4 at 1 kill per 6.5 min for 18% aa... but that's just a preview for you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Soveraign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't forget we can stack our dots.  So, say you stacked the top four poison dots you'd get:<br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn: 330/tick<br />
Scourge of Nife: 254/tick<br />
Bane of Nife: 214/tick<br />
Envenomed Bolt: 146/tick<br />
-------------------------<br />
944/tick<br />
which is 157 dps<br />
<br />
Of course, cast times will likely throw a kink in this.<br />
BoS is 5.7 + 2.25 recovery<br />
SoN is 5.0 + 2.25 recovery<br />
BoN is 5.0 + 2.25 recovery<br />
Ebolt is 6.1 + 2.25 recovery<br />
--------------------------<br />
This makes 30.8 seconds total casting time assuming no lag in recast, but also no spell haste items.  Sounds very doable to me.<br />
<br />
Total mana used for those spells is 535+425+425+320=1705.  Top end shaman should be able to do this for three rounds before going OOM.<br />
<br />
If he started out by casting the disease dots before going the 7 tick poison dots you could also add:<br />
<br />
Breath of Ultor: 131/tick<br />
Pox of Bertoxxulous: 111/tick<br />
Plague: 55/tick<br />
<br />
Resulting in a mass combined total of: 944+297=1241/tick.  Which is 206 dps.<br />
<br />
But of course to get to this point would take a casting time of:<br />
Plague: 6.1 + 2.25<br />
Pox: 5 + 2.25<br />
Breath: 6.1 + 2.25<br />
Total from poison: 30.8<br />
----------------------<br />
This would take 54.75 seconds before you are done casting that last spell!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually the best dps for a shaman is actually going to be casting our ae rain spells.<br />
<br />
Tears of saryrn 3 waves of 650 with a cast time of 6 seconds and a recast time of 12<br />
<br />
Torrent of poison 3 waves of 540 with a cast time of 6 seconds with a recast time of 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the normal recast time you can end up getting both off and be ready to recast by the time the 12 seconds refresh is up so in 18 seconds you can do 650x3 and 540x3 for 1950 + 1620 = 3570 which works out to slightly under 200dps<br />
<br />
If you've got a spell haste item you should be able to get a spear of torment cast in there too adding 675 dmg pushing the dps upto about 230dps<br />
<br />
This does of corse burn a bit of mana total of 1105 if your getting spear in there or 830 if just doing the too rains.<br />
<br />
Not sure how the exact numbers work out but I've found alternating rains to be sustanable for alot longer than you'd initially think looking at the numbers. Factoring Specialization, Spell casting mastery, MP4 you save a fair bit of mana and with ft, mana song, c5, PoG and SD you regen a fair bit and you can even sneak a cann v/torpor in there with out effecting the cycle too much.<br />
<br />
This of corse assumes a fairly low poison resist mob but then again so do the dots and you have less aggro issues using the rains =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">*Gasp* don't tell others about our possible DPS that:  we can obtain via soloing, while in a group without recieving aggro, or during a full burn.<br />
<br />
The Beastlords may have a film fest whining they infact can't out damage us.  <br />
<br />
Yes, Rains can be chained.  And it is really sweet with casting fury III.<br />
<br />
Also, it is entirely possible for a shaman to solo in a teir 4 zone like PoF.<br />
Greater Flame Lords in PoFire. Level 67, don't summon and are rootable.  So there you go.<br />
<br />
Gardeltron... Tank the mob... *rolleyes* omg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gardeltron... Tank the mob... *rolleyes* omg<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Let the truth be known:  In the endgame shamans are reduced to root/dot panzy casters with inferior dots (the necro lineup of dots at 65 is far superior to anything we have).  No real need for slow.  Forget the useless pet.  Stay out of TEH FACE.  Just use Malicious Decay for the disease dots and Malos for the other spells.  Better be careful with Pox, Bane, and the lesser dots because they will break root.  Then just sit there like a dr00d smelling daisies (LOL, Gagner67 is a 35 dr00d).  Dang, and all this time I was letting all the FT items go to the casters so I could concentrate on hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As far as DPS goes, popping on BoS and then rain is probably the best way to go. However, given the poor resist rate on rains when dealing with certain mobs, BoS and nuke is a good alternative.<br />
<br />
As far as soloing area goes, when I want some AA and only want to spend minimal effort--a state known as Braindead exp grind--I go to PoV to kill some golems.<br />
<br />
Pull with malo, run to camp, root with ring (or PE for long duration). Turgur, BoU, BoS, Epic. Reapply DoTs until mob dies. Canni a little and burn Can5 once is all it takes for ~5 min per kill from pull to mob dropping dead, with FM at the end. This is with self buffs only. This usually nets 1 AA per 90 min given sufficient pulls, which is not bad for minimal effort spent.<br />
<br />
If you want to be a little more proactive, there's little reason why you cannot kill a golem every 4 min and have no downtime.<br />
<br />
PoV, HoH, and PoTactics are good for Braindead exp grinds. With VP and PE, breaking spawns take slightly more effort than killing.<br />
<br />
If you feel like tanking a bit, PoS and BoT are viable soloing areas with just self buffs. Or, you can always bum a buff or two to make it effortless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shamans really can do pretty good dmg, in VT on boss mobs I usually do 30k+ dmg a fight with rains (would do more but they are semi resistant).  I can keep going with rains constantly for quite a while, of course I just hit cann5 sometimes without torpor and let clerics heal me, or a cann4 here or there if i can get it in (theres a few seconds between each rain that it is still greyed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gardeltron, in response to your wondering my tactics it is a pretty simple strategy....  I don't limit myself :)<br />
<br />
<br />
   If I want to get a quick 1 or 2 percent belted out on off peak times, I go hit up PoV OC camp, pet up with alpha (normally just junk weapons, no need for procs really) cast Tali of Kragg or FoSoul on pet for hp, and replenishment.    Park pet a ways away.<br />
<br />
   Pull mob with root, if it holds, debuff mob on the spot and swap spells out, cast in BoS BoU epic, then Bane and pox to break root.   Bring mob back to pet.   Tank mob hitting with weapon and tanking for pet till you reapply BoS and Bane, then root and back up, get out horse, send in Spiritcall.<br />
<br />
   med on horse, re-apply epic when needed, back off pet and send in so that Spiritcall pets are closer than it and thus get hit.    When spiritcall breaks refresh Bane and BoS, breaking root and getting mob on you again, tank breifly while hitting, root and back up and get on horse, canni 5, and back off pet at about 20 percent health.<br />
<br />
   pet will regen to near full quickly with Replenish and no aggro, send pet in again at 50 percent, and toss a nuke to break root, tank mob to keep enrage away from the pet and then join pet chasing mob as it runs for it's last 5 percent or so of life.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Kills are very fast, med time is extremely minimal (I don't use other people's buffs, so if you wimp out and use KEI/Aego then you have NO med time).<br />
<br />
   And the biggest aspect of why I can solo for more exp than most people.....<br />
<br />
   All the rest of the server is sitting in the planes, and I realize that there are OTHER blue cons in the world even at 65, with lower DPS, less hp, easier splits, and crap for resists.    I also make quite nice cash out there in the older worlds while I build up exp, finish quests, and have a blast knowing that the zone is mine and mine alone.</div></div><hr />
