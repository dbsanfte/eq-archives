<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rahvin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have turned in the Silver Chained Locket to Niera Farbreeze 2 different times and haven't received the Platinum Speckled Powder.  1st time i did it i wasn't sneaking so i thought maybe that was the problem. did that part of quest over. while sneaking, turning in locket again..nothing.  both times i get the correct dialogue.  &quot;This, this is my...blah blah blah..take this powder..&quot; but i never received the item..<br />
<br />
i am apprehensive to her until i sneak, at which point i am of course indifferent.  do i need to faction? if so how do i increase faction with her? is there a quest to increase faction if that is the problem?<br />
<br />
please help..thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sicel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well my friend, you would think you'd learn the first time, haha, just kiding buddy. But yes, the problem is your sneak, sure the dialog is desplayed, but since u are in sneak mod, that equals no item, so the answer my friend, is that dreadful word... FACTION. I forget what it was that u need to gain that faction, but im sure you'll figure it out friend. Good luck, and no more sneak-giving.... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sionach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It sounds like it's bugged, Rahvin.  If faction were a problem, she would say something like &quot;I will do nothing to aid beings like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Depending on how long it's been since you did it, you *might* still be able to petition on it.  If it's been a while, do the turnin again, and if you still get the correct response but no item, then petition it.  They should be able to check logs and confirm you handed in the correct item and didn't receive the proper reward.<br />
<br />
That said, if you want to work faction up to amiable before attempting again, kill lots and lots of BB Gnolls - that should do it.<br />
<br />
Good luck; hope you get it sorted out!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe she is on Protectors of the Pine faction which you cannot get from killing BB gnolls(they give Jaggedpine Treefolk faction).  So, head into Jaggedpine Forest and kill the gnolls there, they give both Jaggedpine Treefolk and Protectors of the Pine faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sionach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You're right, Raltar - Niera's a Ranger &amp; the only way to raise Protectors of Pine faction is by questing (poacher's heads, etc.) or killing JP Gnolls.  Sorry for any confusion.  :)</div></div><hr />
