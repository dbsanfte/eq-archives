<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Burrlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After dying in WoS twice tonight on my way to MPG, I was told there is an article somewhere on rpgexpert that describes the easier paths to take thru Omens zones.  Can anyone provide a link to it on whatever site it might be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I went there and searched on 'omens'... found: http://www.rpgexpert.com/3159.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Burrlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanx much.  I didnt go quite as wide in my search as 'Omens' and couldnt get a hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Discordling Warfiend randomly spawns in the second field (after the wall) but is normally killed by exp groups so is not usually up.<br />

Not on our server for what i have seen  ;) . And such advice just results in a 'randomly' chance of getting beaten to a pulp /boggle. That mean bugger roams almost exactly in the painted path in north field ...<br />
<br />
Anyway you can also sneak along the eastern wall in second field, when you make sure, you walk roughly in the middle between ruins with see invis ukuns and the Dragorn Champ to the right (hides in an alcove in the wall, that separates north and south field) - stay clear of both obviously. Move back to zone wall after champ and you should be fine for the rest of the way.<br />
<br />
Oh and the 'best' and fastest route through Dranik's Scar to NC is the eastern route along wall, only one ukun at tree near PoDs for shaman epic and that one can easily be avoided. After that just move north along east wall until you are roughly on same north/south loc of the castle entrance, then move directly west to castle and north to NC entry.</div></div><hr />
