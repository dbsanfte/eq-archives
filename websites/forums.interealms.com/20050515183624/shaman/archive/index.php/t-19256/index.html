<br />
Last night, we finish a kill mission LDON with 3 minutes to go. As we are recovering from the boss fight we barely won, after the &quot;your adventure is a success&quot; message is just wearing off, the ranger, who had played awfully all night says in group chat, &quot;How many more do we need and how much time left?&quot;<br />
<br />
In two years, that takes the cake. I am still laughing about it today.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Probably the most idiotic thing said to me by a group member was back in DL.  The group was breaking up and the bard asked me for a port.  I told him I was a shaman and he just said &quot;ya?&quot;  It's been a few years but I still remember it clearly.<br />
<br />
Other things I really hate is when people ask for FA the second it starts blinking when you've explained to them that you have a timer and they don't need to ask everytime.  Another one I hate is when someone asks for it and then runs out of range so its down for 60 seconds.  <br />
<br />
It also bothers me that the 3 classes I try to hit on raids with FA the most are always the most difficult.  Monks are always out pulling, rogues scouting/dragging and rangers love to stand as far away as possible from everyone else.  Oh or when you are FA'ing rangers on raids and it won't stick.  I send them a tell asking if they want FA and they saw &quot;Nah, not until the boss.&quot;  I can't magically hit 3-4 of these rangers with FA right before the boss.  Maybe they think they are doing us a favor but I'd rather just keep them in the FA rotation the whole time than try to squeeze 8-10 people in before the boss, it really isn't possible.  FA is the devil.</div></div><hr />

guess you really had to be there, but think of the tv commercials where something happens, the music goes whoooop, and the lights go on.  all that is left is the idiot standing in the middle of 1000 people who are just staring at him in dumbfounded amazment.<br />

-during luclin the premeri guild at the time was first trying BB in Deep.  I remember seeing necros useing the nuke that turns the mob into a skelly so everyone could they could find.  the top tank at the time shouts &quot;STOP BONING THE ****ING MOB!!!&quot;<br />
i thought that was pritty funny...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">OK, my turn.<br />
<br />
Am a replacement for the 6th member of a nice group in Dreadlands (Dread is right, it's land of the clueless).  SK, rogue, ranger, wiz, shammy (level 44), and myself, shammy (level 49).  Wiz just got ice comet and I just got e-bolt, so we are both casting nukes and dd's on the mobs, in addition to the SK, ranger and rogue doing their thing.  However, junior shammy (in bear form at the back of the group by the wall) is not doing much except sending dogdog in and casting his weak dd's, eventhough we agreed ahead of time that he would be main healer and I would slow and back up heal.<br />
<br />
Second or third pull, the SK gets down to 30%, he and I both ask the junior shammy what's up with the heals, he says he is &quot;low on mana&quot;.  OK, I just ask him to call OOM when low so I know to jump in.<br />
<br />
A couple of pulls later, we get two, plus a wandering add, so 3 total.  Junior shammy yells out &quot;RUN&quot;, and takes off.  The rest of us watch him run off as I root one, off-tank the other and the group kills the first.  We don't even break a sweat, keep in mind he was our main healer.  He walks back over a couple minutes later, goes back to the back of the group.<br />
<br />
Every other pull, junior shammy is calling &quot;OOM&quot;.  So, seeing that he has not been casting much and not noticing him &quot;canni&quot;, I send him a tell asking if he is using canni to regen.  At this point he tells me flat out, &quot;I don't use canni because it generates too much aggro.&quot;  I fell out of my chair.  4 dps classes going all out, me slowing on incoming, and he is afraid of getting aggro from canni?  Beyond stupid.<br />
<br />
After an hour or so of great destruction and fun, the group breaks up.  Junior shammy is getting ready to go and clicks off bear form.  Turns out he is an Iksar.  Duh, he picked Iksar and does not canni, does not compute.  I put gun to head.<br />

Just as I get done casting all the group buffs, the pally tells the group he needs to quickly hit another camp for shaman buffs.  I guess mine weren't good enough even though his new ones wore out before the rest of the groups. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">playing my rogue I have a group of myself and 4 other melees, we are dying for a healer when a druid takes an invite. druid is informed that they are the only healer. first pull, FIRST PULL mind you, the puller gets 3 the druid (who doesnt use assist) Nukes the crap out of one of the adds. now the add is pounding the hell out of our healer who just grabbed a couple hundred points of agro and you guessed it, starts running around all over the place trying to shake it off or whatever those idiots are doing when they run around the camp with a mob beating them senseless. after he dies and we finish off all 3 mobs (seems we didnt need that healer quite as much as we thought) he comes back, loots, and sends the group this message &quot;I am leaveing you guys are noobs you dont protect the healer and everyone knows you HAVERTOPROTECTSTHEHEALR!!! now I have to solo for my exp back cause you got me killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
note my spelling is infinitly better than his,<br />
note he was later rejected by at least 3 high lvl guilds based on my (and a few other peeps who had grouped with him) suggestion that adding that druid to the guild might very well cost them a rogue.<br />
<br />
that and the infinite number of people who dont understand why the duel weilding barbarian wont buff them,<br />
and of course the 1 or so a week newbie that I got to gank with my inspect message/hotkey that I set up with the above people in mind.<br />
hotkey /say %t please read my inspect message...<br />
inspect message &quot;if you are in need of healing, magical buffage or other assistance target my and type /d to Declare yourself in need and I will be happy to help.&quot;<br />

...<br />
Need HoS<br />
... Ok, there is a stacking issue between HoS and Focus, click off Focus so I can cast HoS<br />

So off we went, and the MT was happy because he had got his HoS in place. Suddenly the guild needed me.</div></div><hr />

I'll run up to someone in the PoK - troll shaman, all chain graphics, equiping my epic... and ask random non-sow classes for SoW....<br />
<br />
Normal response is &quot;sorry - can't cast that spell&quot;... one guy though decided to help me out:<br />
<br />
me: &quot;SoW plz&quot;  - have to use the true n00b demanding abreviated mannerisms<br />
him: &quot;I'm a paladin - I wish I could cast SOW for you as well as for myself&quot;<br />
me: &quot;you can't cast sow?&quot;<br />
him: &quot;sorry no I can't.&quot;<br />
me: &quot;crap - do you know anyone who can?&quot;<br />
him: &quot;you're a shaman aren't you?&quot;<br />
me: &quot;yeah - level 65!!!&quot;<br />
him: &quot;you know you can cast SOW on yourself?&quot;<br />
me: &quot;I can't find the spell.  Can you please just SOW me?&quot;<br />
him: &quot;follow me - I'll show you where you can buy the spell&quot;<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
The guy proceeded to lead me into the Library right to the shaman vendor who sold the SOW spell - and gave me 20p to buy it.<br />

Almost made me feel bad... the guy was too patient and kind and I was being a jackass....  *sigh*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">So many stupid statements I can't count, especially with people not knowing what my more common spells do (a more extreme example a AM3/EQ lvl 65 ranger not knowing what FA does ...).<br />
<br />
Here are a couple of examples:<br />
1. Regular group tried some named, I forget the zone.  Adds all over the place, I can't count em all it happens so fast.  I slow the named and get 2 resists on alternate adds (I swap targets to reduce aggro, hoping the MA can get it).  Next thing you know I got the named 2 respawn and 2 adds all reffing on me (all unslowed but the named) and I go down like the titanic.<br />
<br />
Next thing, I'm pop in at my bind point, and the cleric says ... &quot;damnit, slow the f***ing mobs.&quot; ... so ... I type my hotkeyed message with a mobs name ... and ask the cleric if thats better and can he ress me when they're done.<br />
<br />
The other one is I group with a guild SK (LONG TIME AGO and in a previous guild) this time, we've got a tough pull up ahead and I ask the SK to split the mobs.  She says how?  I say yo got FD right?  She says ... &quot;it never works so I don't use it&quot;.  The other shaman says &quot;I gotta go.&quot; and the ranger shoots me a tell asking if this SK is for real.</div></div><hr />

I was also the main slower so my hotbutton message &quot;/%t is slowed&quot; was fired in a group chat about every minute or so. As we getting near the end of the  adventure (probably about an hour and 10 min into it) the cleric turns to me and asks &quot;Are you poisoned&quot;. I say to her &quot;No, why do you ask?&quot;  She goes &quot;Than why do you keep dropping on HPs?&quot;  I patiently try to explain to her that I am using cann to get my mana back up.  She, then, proceeds to tell me &quot;Oh, I forgot what class you are&quot;.

Was doing a Ldon with a bunch of level 57 to 63's and we had a Ranger, Cleric, Shaman (me), Mage (My wife), Enchanter and a War.<br />
<br />
Quotes:<br />
<br />
1. After 20 minutes of trying to talk to the Warrior to pull from Dead ends, we finally got a response from while inside MMC<br />
<br />
Warrior says to group,  &quot;I don't read group messages or i get distracted&quot;<br />
<br />
2. The Enchanter then said to the group &quot;I don't mezz or paci incase i get agro&quot;.<br />
<br />
3. Cleric tanks, nukes and rarely heals which the shaman ended up healing and slowing. Then Cleric then asks my wife for a mod rod. After I snapped at the cleric a few minutes later for not healing the cleric replied  &quot;Oh i thought (name of my wife's mage) was the healer&quot;<br />
<br />
4. After Ldon we did the ldon and did the split the cleric asked and i quote &quot;Shaman can i have bot9 please?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">People are such morons about FA. On one hand, if you don't FA the MA, he'll bitch. On the other hand, if you don't FA everyone else before the MA, they'll bitch. Now, in LDoN and exp pickup groups, I say right off.<br />
<br />
&quot;After I determine my mana usage in the group, I'll FA...MA first.&quot; <br />
<br />
I did this because a rogue, who shall remain nameless, whined for several mins for FA as soon as we zoned into LDoN. I told him, that I always FA the MA first (one reason is above, and the second reason is, that I just always have the MA at the top of my FA list in my head). The ****ing rogue bitched to me in tells and I said &quot;thats fine. I'll just take you off my FA list&quot;. He promptly LEFT the adventure. We survived without him but not five minutes after he took his ball and went home, a guildmate of his (and a stranger to me) sent me a tell &quot;You should always FA the rogue for added dps&quot;.<br />
<br />
No kidding. :O OMG! I was FAing Mages!! /snicker<br />
<br />
I replied &quot;You might want to listen to the other side of stories before you solicite advice. Thanks&quot;<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, I didn't get any reply back. FA is evil and if I didn't have friends and guildmates that are cool about not harassing me for FA, I probably would have deleted it.</div></div><hr />

The battle clerics have got to go.  If they really think they are adding DPS by melee then they need to have their head examined.  I have died more than once because a Cleric is too busy meleeing to heal, and basicly do their job.  Stun is a forgone conclusion to them as most that I meet cant stop a gating mob or a CH if they tried.<br />

So here are some more...<br />
<br />
The classic having Dogdog asked for a sow.<br />
<br />
I've been asked why my health keeps going down, and when I explain Cannibalize, they ask me not to do it any more.<br />
<br />
Luckily, that same person didn't ask me why my mana was regenning so slow afterwards.<br />
<br />
But here is the best one by far for me...<br />
<br />
I was in a group, a while ago, in Crystal Caverns, killing orcs.  We didn't have anyone who could snare, though, so we were having a little bit of a problem.  A bard comes around and we are able to promptly invite him into our group.  Yay, we have a snarer! we said.<br />
<br />
So what happens?  We go a number of fights and cause one moderate sized train because the bard didn't slow.  Not only didn't he slow, he didn't talk at ALL, or reply to our questions.  And he wasn't busy chaining multiple songs.<br />
<br />
So he was booted from the group, and the group leader gets a tell, &quot;You need me to snare&quot;...<br />
<br />
Bah.<br />
<br />
I love bards.  A well-played bard is great.  But why does Bard seem to be the easiest class to be stupid in?   I dont mean screw up - i know WHY it's easy to screw up being a bard.  But there are so many that make dumb decisions, dumb comments, dont know their songs...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Lotrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Was in a CoD group, all melee sans myself..the only healer and slower in the group. After a time, we rotated in a bst, just barely high enough lvl to even be in the zone. <br />

I polightly informed her that I at presant I didn't have the mana for haste, as it was being used for slows and heals.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">You guys are pretty harsh.. I don't think that i would ever deny someone a buff (meaning.. someone in my guild or in my group).  if they want agility and they are a wizard, hell, i'll give them agility.  <br />
<br />
I did like once when I went into BoT (this was well after I was finished with there and was in half time/elemental gear) and joined a group in the west wing.  The tank was a pally who had about 700 less hps than I did and no defensive AAs (I had all def AAs).  No biggie, but once in a while the puller would pull two mobs and I told the pally several times that I would tank mezz the second giant while the rest of the group worked on the first.  But, this pally wouldn't have it.  He chain stunned the secon mob till he had agro on both of them, and proceeded to get beat into a pulp,with the cleric and I both tryin to chain keep him healed.  Needless to say, it was times like that that reminded me of why i didn't group in BoT anymore.  I did go back there recently using one of my guildees shaman to PL my beastlord, and made sure that the rest of the group knew that I was using the shaman to be the main tank if I had to, and most of the time no one cared.  When the clerics actually told me that they were glad cause it was easier to heal the shaman, it brought a tear to my eye.<br />
<br />
Most of these reasons on the posts above are also a part of the reason why i have a hard time grouping in ldon outside of my guild or the guilds close to our progression.  Getting a group with someone that doesn't know how to play their class, or even what abilities your class has is so disappointing.  Like the cleric once who didn't know how to get from South ro to Inny swamp, and then when our bard went back and got him to the zone in area for the adventure in guk, he didn't know how to click into the adventure.  Needless to say, we did that one with me healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never refused to buff some one with my shaman unless the following reasons.<br />
<br />
1. If they ask for KEI/Clairty/breeze, Temp/virtue/Hov, BL crack, Bo9 or any other buffs that i can't cast in my class.<br />
<br />
2. If a player is in a stupidly far away zone and i don't know them and except me to drop what ever i doing just to buff them.<br />
<br />
3. Demand me to drop what i doing to give them buffs by giving me a speach how I lost all rights to refuse to buff some one and most help them no matter because i play a shaman before i even give a reply yes or no.<br />
<br />
4. Ask for money/items for free then ask for buffs, expecting you to give money or your armor freely.<br />
<br />
5. Any spells that i don't have or spells that are too high for me to cast (One time some one asked me for Fo7 when i was level 40).<br />
<br />
6. When i am AFK and my AFK message on, you be shocked seeing how many people on KB will send you tells asking you if i am there while i am /role and afk on my head.<br />
<br />
7. When i am in a group (EG ttbot) and a player expects me to tell my group to stop just so i can canni down to get mana to buff stranger X while in chain pulls.</div></div><hr />

You might want to edit the piece I underlined and bolded before folks rip you to pieces. I assume you meant heal, but I couldn't resist highlighting this due to the very nature of the thread. Feel free to bump my reputation in either direction. It probably won't affect the content of my posts.</div></div><hr />

That reminds me of a group I was in a while back.  Two RL friends and I, in our 30s.  My druid, his paladin, her shaman, killing giants in the Great Divide.  At one point I ask her 'are you slowing the mobs?'  She responds 'I thought YOU were snaring them?'<br />
<br />
After I stopped laughing, I reminded her what slow does.  What's odd is that she always did an excellent job as a shaman, and dutifully slowed mobs as needed.  But the whole time, she thought she was snaring them. :)<br />
<br />
Two weeks ago, playing my 52 shaman in an LDoN group, and the 54 cleric with us asks the enchanter:<br />
<br />
Cleric_01 tells the group, 'chanter can I get a refresh on Tashania?'<br />
<br />
 :eek: <br />
<br />
A couple of us had been tashed by one of the mobs, and a level 54 cleric thought it was a buff.  That and a few other things convinced us that she was either eBayed or being played by the owner's brother/cousin/pet goldfish.</div></div><hr />

I almost understand not knowing the obscure abilities of other classes, but your own class.... that makes baby jesus cry.<br />
<br />
My story is full of stupid people, but im one of em. <br />
<br />
Shortly after i got Ldon, i got a pickup group and its not to heavy on dps but it seems ok. Warrior, 2 rangers, cleric, druid, me. All of us are around 55 or so. So we head down and the cleric decides to pull, fine with me. <br />
<br />
/g So did we get lucky, any named on track.<br />
Like 5 minutes late no answer. Try again.<br />
ranger1: i dont think so<br />
<br />
hmmm.... ok ill let that slide.<br />
<br />
so we are fighting and out of the three possible snarers, no one snares....anything.<br />
<br />
The cleric is to busy pulling to heal, the druid is to busy keeping up a damage sheild apparently to heal or nuke, so im healing slowing and trying to CC with root and such.<br />
<br />
Finally i get so fed up with it id thougt id send a couple msg's to my friend who went afk in baz for a while. Just leave him a funny story to read later. <br />
<br />
/t Jon Omg i got a story for you<br />
/g im in the worst group ever.<br />
<br />
UH-OH<br />
<br />
/g ummm mistell<br />
<br />
Well they were not happy about this. so i thought id add this to my story to the friend<br />
<br />
/t jon oops i mistelled and told them they are the worst group ever<br />
/g they were not happy about it<br />
<br />
OOPS!<br />
<br />
randomguy: You think, just dont talk and do whatever you are doing so we can finish<br />
<br />
All in all i dont know how i could be so careless, or hilarious. We lost the adventure because of a wipe near the end. A runner pulled back 8+ becasue no one thought they should snare. <br />
<br />
Still the worst group ever. I think i talk to the druid every once in a while. He's cool with it, havnt seen the others on since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I have been following this thread the last few days and was kinda sad I couldn't think of a really good single instance where I had something happen like this.<br />
<br />
Then low and behold I get a group in PoV at the WW camp. We got a cleric, pally, bard, wizard, enchanter and me the shaman. The pally wasn't really tough enough to handle the mobs without fast slows and needed a CH atleast once a fight. So I am doing my best to Malo while the mob is inc and then hit it with slow as soon as possible. I tried slowing first a couple times but the few times it got bounced at first the pally almost died. because the cleric was, suprise suprise, melee'ing. Now I am not against cleric's melee'ing but she didn't seem to recognize that the tank needed heals till she had to do a fast heal to buy the time to cast a CH.. This in and of it's self I could handle cause  Iwould just slap the pally with a  1300hp heal real quick like if I didn't think she was gonna get him. At some point I had a slow bounce even after malo and I said something complaining about it to the group. The wizard commentedthat he was glad I was malo'ing cause the mobs were otherwise very resistant to him, and then asked if our chanter was tash'ing. To which the chanter answered &quot;i am not tashing no &quot; &lt;--- Just like that I am reading it from my screen shot! She then goes on to say &quot;tash is the devil i keep is on you, raises effective casting level&quot; I am pretty sure she was being funny at this point which is good cause  I like to laugh. After a longish pause she continued with this tidbit &quot;i never used tash lol... didn't even do the quest for the mid level one&quot; The wizard and I then did our politest to convince her that it was worth while to cast tash on a mob when grouped with magic nuking casters and such to make them more effective at their job. Kinda like al lthe clarity line spells and the haste spells for melee's. <br />
<br />
But all to no avail, she didn't have enough resists on them to worry about it and didn't want the extra agro even though the pally seemed to hold it pretty good. This all led to me and the wizard having a good tell conversation about DNG(do not group) lists and such. I was very carefull though to make sure I didn't make the mistake zensation did though it might have added some good humor to the evening.</div></div><hr />

I remember sitting there after I figured out someone that could cast it, then running around to each person trying to decide if their class looked like the same as that one person.  <br />
<br />
Heck, when I was level 3 on my warrior, there was a cleric who was standing in Freeport casting buffs on us lowbies.  They cast a few buffs on me and I had no clue what they did or anything, so the first thing that I did was left click on them to see what it did.  Buffs didn't last too long that way :(<br />
<br />
Ahh.. as a newb I also spent prob 12 hours my first day in the game trying to figure out how to get to the warrior guild in freeport.  I went everywhere and talked to everyone.  Someone showed me how to talk to people in /say so i was talking to people that way.  Then someone showed me how to use tells.  Finally after spending a good % of the night still running around and not getting anywhere, finally some soul felt pity for me, and took me to the warrior guild there, and then he was kind enough to take me to the clothing shop and buy me some leather.

Not all of us...some of us have Shaman Mains on our first account...  :D <br />

I do often have to have 'discussions' with shamans in group, though, because they think I should be healing them earlier\later than I am.<br />
<br />
shaman_01 tells you, &quot;I died! Why didn't you heal me?&quot;<br />
you tell shaman_01, &quot;Errrm, because you said you were healing yourself with Q...by the time I saw you weren't I was mid-CHeal on the MA. I'll go ahead and start healing you with everyone else again.&quot;<br />
<br />
10 minutes later, Shaman_01 is getting beat on again...toss a heal...<br />
shaman_01 tells you, &quot;YOu didn't need to heal me! I had it covered!&quot;<br />
you tell shaman_01, &quot;Okay, you got a choice...I never heal you again, or you **** and deal with my heals hitting you.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I don't mind the cleric healing me, though i normally state some 'HoT is active' to prevent that.<br />

What bugs me more are clerics (or druids), that just stay at the sideline and drool, while 3+ mobs are bashing away on me. Maybe, just maybe i have some problems over here and could use a hand /sigh. It's one of the sure signs for me to separate the good clerics from the bad ones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Sathak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">The battle clerics have got to go.  If they really think they are adding DPS by melee then they need to have their head examined.<br />
At level 56, with their summoned hammer, they can add quite a bit of DPS.  I can understand being upset with clerics that forget to heal because they think they're monks all of a sudden.  But in LDoN, for example, my cleric has no problems adding DPS via hammer procs (400 to 1000 damage per mob depending on how long they live and how many procs I get) and keeping the group healed.  If mana drops to a particular level, I'll stop to med, but with Yaulp 5 and KEI I can actually gain mana while meleeing as long as I don't need to cast a CH too often.<br />
<br />
And with a slower in the group, I may as well melee, there won't be much healing to do. :)<br />
<br />
More stupid players- was in an LDoN two days back, I am handling slows and heals and haste/buffs.  At one point, the 48 druid tells the group &quot;I have chloro on, don't heal me unless I get below 50%&quot;.  A few minutes later, as I'm busily canni'ing, he tells the group &quot;shaman I have KEI, want me to handle heals for a bit?&quot;  Yeah thanks, moron.<br />
<br />
So we get an overpull and he nukes a caster mob and gets manhandled so fast that I didn't even realize he was in trouble until I see a skeleton on the floor with &quot;Druid_01's Corpse&quot; over it.  We kill the mobs and the pally loads up his rez spell, and the druid tells the group &quot;okay I got a KEI, ready for rez now&quot;.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Appearantly he didn't like large, constant pulls and fast kills.  The moment we killed the last mob and won the adventure, he disbanded and ran out of dungeon without a word.  I tried to reinvite him but he rejected the invite hehe.<br />

It's especially funny because his mother was the cleric in the group.  She sent me a tell, in much improved English, apologizing for her son's behavior and saying that she'd group with me any time because &quot;you are a god shammy&quot;.

<br />
although most people I group with do not understand how it works, but the main reason for casting ToA on the group when you have a bard is because a Bard wont be able to keep warson of zek and muse up 100% of the time when mob is in the camp. Thus those few moments when he is either away pulling or doing whatever you have some form of haste. But when he gets back warsong of zek will overwrite it. Although trying to get a bard to sing their v2 haste song and muse is a different story.</div></div><hr />

So my guilds trying Griegs end for first time and notice a guild showed up after us so we speed our lost selfs though th dungeone to get the key for Grieg.  Well we come across the other guild all piled nicely in the corner.  We get our key and head to the locked door in hope of getting there before they get back.  Well we start go though the door and for the named behind it and the other guild asks us to back off.  Well we comply and go off down the hall to stay out the way.  They take thier time to kill the mob but allass they wipe again.  In the process their last member drags the mob on top of our raid so we kill it.  Well appearently they had necro tht FD.  So we are getting our dead rezzed and this necro comes out of no where and loots the whole mob's corpse.  (aka Int Item, Melee Sword, VT key part0  Stuff was not super great but was upgrade to alot of our members.  Necro tells us his guild told him to do it then commices to ask us the only other ones in the zone for a Essence Emerald. LOL The next day he comes up to me and asks me for buffs.  Then our cleric next to us.  For some dumb reason he just kept tell ing us it was game and we should buff him and not blam him.  Even after we told him we didnt have no proplem with just him it was his whole guild.</div></div><hr />

Exactly.  I don't know how many songs a bard will normally twist, but if he wants to work all that crazy bard mojo and just sing his overhaste song I'm all for helping him.</div></div><hr />

Most of the time I'm grouped with a bard they proc their epic (~5 min) then switch back to regular primary and twist overhaste in with it.<br />

That was kind of assinine of you.  I'm the first to jump on some cheesedick newbie when they start uber bashing, but there's a big difference between being uber and being elitist.  You could have handled it much better than just rubbing the warriors face in the fact that your gear is lightyears ahead of his, and being a dick.</div></div><hr />

We zone in, and what I always cast right when starting an adventure is: Dogdog, Bear form and shrink.<br />
The group is moving along smoothly, Keepn' everyone Hasted, buffed and everything, Slowing all the mobs, sending in the pet and whatnot, Canni'n away, so not really talking much. When all of a sudden I go LD...<br />
<br />
I Log back in, throw up bearform again, hail them to let them know I'm back, run right up to the Warrior to re-invite... nothings happening. The warrior is shifting around a bit (looking kinda lost)... Finally I get re-invited to the group (By the Cleric, who apparently is the new leader of the group). I was kinda confused as to what took so long when the Warrior says:<br />
<br />
Warrior_01: Zuk, what class are you?<br />

I'm going to have to agree with what Gwain has said.  This is the reason that people that have better gear than others get ridiculed because of showing an elistist attitude.  I personally have been using another of my guildees shaman to PL my beastlord in Valor and BoT and most of the time I find a place to go and build up a group there (or join an existing one).  When I do this I let everyone know that the shaman can easily tank mobs if needed.  People ask what his hps are and I tell them, but I don't make a spectacle of it.  In fact, in that entire week, he tanked prob 95% of the time in every group because his equipment and AAs made him a better tank.  But, I never tried to make anyone feel bad and if there was a tank that insisted on being the MA, than I let him and offtanked if needed.<br />
<br />
There's no reason to sport an attitude when you have a bit better equipment than others.  It's fine and dandy to spout out your shiny hp totals and mega stat equipment, just don't be an ass about it.</div></div><hr />

Then after a particulary nasty pull with 8 mobs in camp and me literally getting the tar smacked outta me and we were in a slight recovery mode, the rogue looter linked a +12 hit point augment to the party and the monk announces &quot;5k to the winner of the augment for looting rights&quot;...<br />
I won the roll and indeed did let him get the augment and sure enough soon as we were done, he plunked 5k into my trade window...quite literally the easiest plat I have ever made....I guess that people that loot time gear have no conception of reality.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>gin_juice68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">Was in a group last night in LDON and there was 2 shammys, Ranger ( tanking) Necro, ench, and rogue all 45 to 48 in lvl Me being the 46 shamy and the 48 the other shammy.  So i ask the shammy who wants to heal and who wants to slow and debuff. he says he wants to debuff and slow. So anyway we start to go thru mobs lke crazy and me having stoicism i cast it on the tank. I then get a tell from the other shammy saying please dont use stoicism because it removes haste and sow. Im like fine whatever. Needless to say ranger dies on bad pull....   Now maybe im a n00b to shammys but ive never had sow or haste removed when im playing my war.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>zithak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">Yeah sow and haste do not get taken off when stoic is on you. Was written somewhere ... fairly sure it was castersrealm that said this, but it is just not true</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">It doesn't remove them per se but stoi has a snare and slow component to it.  Had a shaman use it to heal my SK alt while fighting and there was a noticable difference, not to mention I was crawling along trying to keep up with the push.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">NEVER cast stoicism or torpor on a melee during combat. <br />
<br />
Stoicism: Increase Hitpoints v2 by 60 per tick<br />
             Decrease Movement by 100%<br />
             Decrease Attack Speed by 30%<br />
<br />
Torpor:   Increase Hitpoints v2 by 300 per tick<br />
             Decrease Movement by 100%<br />
             Decrease Attack Speed by 30%<br />
<br />
I repeat...don't use them on melee during fights. Quiessence is the only Shaman heal over time that doesn't have a negative effect to movement rate or Attack Speed. They may have phrased it wrong, but they were right in their own way. You should be thankful they didn't get really pissy about it.</div></div><hr />

It could be worse.  Someone walked up to me two days ago and sent me a tell &quot;Are you an enchanter?&quot;.  Barbarian.... Elder.... chain armor.... spear....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">I have a slight variation of this one: The favorite idiotic thing I have ever said in a group.<br />
<br />
This weekend in a LDoN adventure, I suddently discovered that all my buffs were gone - no icons at all. I hadn't noticed when they disappeared or what caused it, so I expected that I had hit a 'dispell everything' trap.<br />
I asked the group whether they were dispelled too, but none of them were. I don't have enough hp for CanniV without buffs, so I started casting Focus and Bear on me, and asked Druid for a hp buff too.<br />
Then I noticed that the buffs didnt stick - still no icons. And to complete the confusion, I noticed that I actually had around 1000 hp more than I usually have when I am unbuffed.<br />
<br />
At last I started thinking. I hadn't been dispelled - I had closed by buff window by accident. Reopened the window and found I had about 8 buffs.<br />
<br />
I told the group what had happened, and we all got a good laughter before slaughtering some more mobs.<br />

<br />
Most of the lv 50 newbs aint ebayers. I recently started a frog wizzie and leveling is SO DAMN FAST these days. LDON takes you to 50 + in like 1 week. So its prolly lack of knowledge, caused by leveling insanely fast.<br />
<br />
When i started EQ leveling was a HARD and long process, it took me like 1 week to get to level...5. And then i walked to NPC jeweler to buy a star rose ring (for the extra INT you know) but i didnt rightclick it, so i bout a useless ring for 20 pp...well life goes on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>atana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">When I first started playing I had an &quot;uber&quot; friend. He was already level 20 (not many of those around back then) and he told me STR was very important, so I put a &quot;few&quot; starting points into it  :D<br />
<br />
To this day I won't let him forget that.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">Hey Gukak I have done something similar to that, for the life of me, I could not get more than about 5 buffs on me, and I kept recasting VoB to get it to stick but it still wouldnt show. I accidentally shrank the window some hehe. Yesterday, got off a long night of work, decide to play a bit of EQ, was kinda drowsy and a group member said,&quot; Hey guys, I can get us VoQ&quot; I replied, sure and how bout some KEI to go with it? about a second later I realized he didnt say VoG, and said VoQ hehe, caught myself right as the guy was wondering *** I was talking about. No coffee + millions of EQ abbreviations don't mix too well hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He says yeah and tell us the direction so we start clearing...  I went sneak and hide to see where the name was, but i didnt see a name and it was a dead end...<br />
<br />
So we asked the name of the name and he says: Gobeker</div></div><hr />
