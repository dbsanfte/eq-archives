<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gagukuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just about to Ding 43 and wondered where I should start to update my equipment ?<br />
I am trying to save up for a JBB and therefore any upgrade suggestions should be made based on the fact that i wish to quest//camp the needed items. I am a member of a small guild and could perhaps gather together 2 groups of 45-50+ members but more often than not there will be 2/3 of us (inc a 50 cleric if that makes a difference).<br />
<br />
Any ideas would be great, thanks for your time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">See about getting some jaundice bone armor for the clicky buffs.  They will help you in groups until you are 49.  <br />
<br />
If you are interested in questing, see about getting an EB item from shissar organs.<br />
<br />
And/or get some acrylia armor from tradeskilling or the bazaar.  Its not bad for your level.<br />
<br />
Maybe questing for Thurg armor might be good for ya too.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts.</div></div><hr />
