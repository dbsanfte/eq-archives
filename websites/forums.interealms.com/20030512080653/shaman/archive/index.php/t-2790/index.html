<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakurae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need a little help. I dual box a Shaman and a Monk. Monk is now 51, Shaman is 49. I have been doing this since I created both chars. Needless to say, my Shaman is a lot lacking in defense, offense, and melee skills. Does anyone have any suggestions for raising these skills without deleveling to 20 where I should have been working on them in the first place? Thank you in advance. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">to get defense up, just train in it, if you can.  will cost a bit of pp, but if you have enough points, do that.  <br />
<br />
to get melee skills up, when you group is goin good, jus stand up there and melee. Also, once you raise your defense, you can slow/tank solo.  dont log on your monk, just solo for a bit w/ the shammy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shakurae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the suggestion of just training Defense. One question. Where? The Shaman Trainer in ShadowHaven didn't have Defense. Do I need to go home to Halas? I thought all trainers had the same set of skills. =/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You cannot just train offense and defense like you can the rest of the melee skills.  Those 2 must go up through combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can't train offense/defense. You're gonna have to just take the beatings to get defense to raise. If it's really low, you're gonna have a hard time at 49. :( You may have to invest in as much ac/hp gear as you can get in order to compensate. After you've raised your defense, then you can go back and swap out for gear that has whatever stats you want. I'd stick with ac/hp though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, you cant train it?  Hrmm, i didnt know that, i never had to ;(<br />
<br />
In that cause, jus artificially raise defense, and go take hits</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I  wish you could train defense. I have been stuck on 193 forever.</div></div><hr />

There is a fallen bookcase to the right of the Librarian. If you get too close, a skeletal hand will claw you. This is a non-targetable trap. Hits for 40 max. I have raised my defense here from 80 to 130 so far in about 4 hours. I buff up, put on my AC equip and stand on the bookcase. I heal myself until OOM, then back off, sit down and med. Rinse/repeat. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">are you sure Shakurae? I know this used to be a very nice trap, but then they nerfed it...when did you do this? Maybe they re-activated it, but last I knew that trap no longer gave defense skillups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shakurae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can confirm this is working, on Morell Thule at least. I went from 130 to 155 last night in about 2 hours.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think the idea with the trap is great and all, but personally I like to get some xp and loot as well..  Here is my recomendation:<br />
<br />
Sea Fury Island in Ocean of Tears.  It's a nice quaint little spot, with plenty of mobs to pull.  Seafuries will be blue to you at 52, xp is steady, and best of all, they don't hit too hard.  Pull with slow, dot, sic pet, tank.  On my original character, I raised defense and offense from mid 150 to 200 there in a couple of days.  I made a couple K plat and dinged to 53.  <br />

<br />
I did the forest giant arbor/verdant 3spawn camp in FV for exp.<br />
Works okay up to about 50, then slows down considerably.<br />
<br />
OOT Seafuries as mentioned finally finished off those last few points for me.  Excellent exp up to 54, slowing noticeably for me now.<br />
<br />
I was unaware of the TOFS trick, sounds like a nifty idea.<br />
A little more convenient is using a light-hitting NPC to attack.<br />
<br />
I used Ping Fuzzlecutter in WFP for this, and picked up a few points when I was in my upper 40's.  I don't know if he'd still be dark blue to you or not.  Root him (don't remember him resisting much) when you get low on health, heal and re-engage.  This has the advantage of also working your offense, and you won't kill him, so no bad faction hits.  When running lom&amp;loh, root and zone to ec.  Browse the auctions while cannidancing, re-zone and repeat.  The points ANY way you try are VERY slow, so I would highly recommend doing something that will net you exp or at least loot.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
