<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Genive</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a set of quested Newbie armor for my baby Barbie Shamperson?<br />
<br />
I haven't been able to find a reference to it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What level are you? Not sure what level people consider newbie anymore  :cool:<br />
<br />
As far as brand new newbie when you are still hunting in Everfrost I don't think there is anything specifically for shaman. You can do some quests for some patchwork armor or some other basic gear but it is all/all stuff. Check out this page on Allakhazam's for quests that start in Halas: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=11<br />
<br />
The only newbie quests just for shaman are for the Gavel of Justice and the Tribunal Initiate.<br />
<br />
Once you are a little higher level (in your twenties) you can do the Totemic Armor quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>schuleta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am assuming you are talking about the kind of quest that most race/class combos have. If so, then no there isn't. The following races don't have those quests:<br />
<br />
Barbarians (except Beastlords)<br />
Erudites (From Erudin, Paineel has them)<br />
Iksars (except Beastlords)<br />
Ogres (except Beastlords)<br />
Trolls (except Beastlords)<br />
<br />
Submit /feedback to SOE, maybe they will get to it eventually.<br />
