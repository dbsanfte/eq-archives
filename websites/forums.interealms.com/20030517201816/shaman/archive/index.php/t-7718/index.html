<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Northbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Cyclops mobs take waaay to much mana to kill.  Cynthia is a nice easy kill.  Get dogdog up, buff him with Tnarg/regen/str/dex/resist magic.  Med up...<br />
<br />
Sic dogdog.  3 Winter's Roar=1 dead gypsie.  Loot seems to mostly be 6 to 7 gold.  Sometimes a couple plat.  Rarely a gem like topaz or jade.  Approx 6 min spawn.  Plenty of time to med to full.  Really boring.  Even taking a swipe at the occasional Hill Giant  that is blue at 34 is yeilding poor return.  All of the higher lvls in the zone complaining that the HG's aren't dropping as much cash as in the past.  Was this a nerf?  Lol.  Looks like the elder shamen are correct......the best way to make cash is to farm tradeskill stuff(Thanks Harvyst).  The only MoBs I have found at 34 that are really worth killing is the Frogs in FV.  They drop FS weapons which you can vendor or make HQ ore from.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Heeoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I took my shaman from 35 to 39 with Cynthia and, when I had a partner, the troll sk and shaman around the corner.  Made a ton of money on her too.  The loot is usually a plat or two with the not so rare gems adding a bit more plat.  Easy kill.  My method.  Sic pet, toss two dots and sit back down.  She's done in seconds and I still have at least 80% of my mana in case I want to kill a clops or hg that wanders by.</div></div><hr />
