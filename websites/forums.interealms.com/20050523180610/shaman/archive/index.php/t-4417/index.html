<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, my guild is gearing up 18 level 60s in full SS rather quickly.  I've gotten two of the 3 symbols for the Buckler of Insight and just need a Tear from Doz and the last symbol to get it.  <br />
<br />
While I realize that it wil be a long time before I get this, my reason for asking about Dozekar is mainly because our guild hasn't done him yet, and I feel that we need to as one of our goals.<br />
<br />
So, if any of you could help me out with information on his difficulty, availability, forces needed, spawn time, etc. I would be most appreciative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He is tough. He has a dispell AE that does 400 damage unresistable I believe. He is slowable and hits for 750 or something like that, maybe quads, I'm not sure. He has a decent amount of hps, 100k or more. I think we have taken him down with 35ish or so but we are not uber like some guilds that are geared up in primal etc. Positioning is important, you must keep the casters out of the ae. If someone gets low on life he will turn and kill that person. Spawn time is a week I believe. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can't add much as how to take him, as we never have. But I can tell you hit hits for 900, and quads. Nasty mofo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How doe he stack up against Lady M in nTov?<br />
<br />
She flurries for 950 and AE's silence.. never done doze myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, the nasty thing about Doze is the 400 point damage/4 buff dispell.  It's very hard to keep a group alive with torpor with that kind of dispelling.<br />
<br />
He's a FAST fight if you want to win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the info guys. I appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">best way we've found to down Doz is to fight 'em in pit.  a few advantages of doing this include:<br />
<br />
1) minimal mobs to kill.  2 pit mobs + 4ish wanderers, and yer ready to fight Doz.<br />
<br />
2) great place to position him and casters so AE doesn't eat them alive<br />
<br />
3) we've fought him up top before closer to door and had some rather.... unenjoyable experience with n00bs opening door.  use yer imagination for the result of this one.  :(<br />
<br />
once you cleared those 6 or so mobs, rebuff and all that jazz, hop down in pit, and toss a shrink on yer MA/SA.  Doz has a large aggro radius so as soon as yer puller goes near/opens the door he'll charge, pull 'em as close to that 'room' between the pit stairs as you can, which is where your MA will be.  its only a single-shot dispell and 400ish AE, and you *will* get hit for a bit until atk. is called and Doz is pushed fully in the small room there, so expect the early pain, but its downhill from there.  early tash is a must, though he's not too terribly tough to land a slow on.<br />
<br />
though the 'short' fights are always the most desired, i'd agree Gloriana, most of our Doz fights are perdy darn long as of late due to him popping mid-day due to patches and our lower daytime 'population.'  Doz is highly sought after so i wish you luck in finding him up at a time advantageous to the numbers you have online.  i've done him with 30ish or so with my guild a number of times and helped kill him a while ago with 21 folks.  <br />
<br />
g'luck on that oogly bastage, especially on yer desired tear, i've yet to see my precious Ruby Tear drop (last piece i need for Silver Charm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In contrast, if no n00bs are openning doors, Doze is good to fight on the platform above the pit.  The advantage here is that the melee battle can occur on one side of the platform, while casters and healers can stay on the other side of the platform.  There is a nice wall for them to hide behind.  Casters can then come out of hiding and nuke between AoE's. <br />
<br />
High rate of damage dealing is necessary.  Slowing is also almost a necessity.  We typically have several shaman slowing after Malo+Tash+OOS+Malosini.  Usually at least one takes a dirt nap.  Doze usually lives long enough that a reslow is needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>zooilogical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We clear the front 2 wurms, all the wanderers , and the wurms in the side halls before we kill Doz. Strat for Doz , first off doz only dispells 1 buff , so clicky and 1-2 junks and then other buffs. When your ready have a 60 ranger lead the way with weaponshield and  tang Doz while shaman chanter and bard land debuffs , I've always got him slowed within 2 trys with malo on , always on first try with malosini. He is not very resistent. After he's slowed bring in the MA and call in the other melee when he has agro. Dozekar moves all over the place, he pushes very easy, and he can be pushed into walls np , so really have to make sure melee surround him from all sides for fight. Some cheap guilds will push Doz inside a wall so the AE doesn't hit them. My guild never had a problem killing him toe to toe tho , last time we did it with 22 ppl and 1 repop add wyvern. Oh , btw hehe just wanted to add HoT Door = Nonexistent to NPC's so it always cracks me up when ppl talk about the door ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gard: &quot;In contrast, if no n00bs are openning doors, Doze is good to fight on the platform above the pit.

<br />
Gard is right, this is a great spot. Pull him to the right side of the that center wall with the banner on it; keep casters to the left. Vice versa I guess works fine.<br />
<br />
I think he has 150k HP, and yes, he'll need to be reslowed unless you bring 50 people so time turgurs. I think we've done him with 30+, which is overkill.<br />
<br />
Few other thoughts.<br />
<br />
1) He slows very easy. Malo and a near-suicide tash is usually enuf for slow. Sometimes malosini. After he's slowed any CH cycle can keep the MA alive easy.<br />
<br />
2) The AE is the nasty part, but it tends to occur in regular intervals. As such, I assign one person to call AEs. &quot;Doz has AE'd, casters nuke quick.&quot; Wizzies come around wall, nuke once or twice quickly, and go hide again. This keeps you from healing casters. <br />
<br />
3) K, he's slowed and your healers and casters are safe. Now, you have to keep those melee alive for a long fight enduring a brutal AE. Pallies are great in melee groups for group heals. If a melee is hurt, have him go hide and wait for a heal. If he has aggro you all die~<br />
<br />
4) Bring mages. God rod is a big plus on this long fight and clerics can go oom easy without it. Have the mage grouped with a torpor shaman so he can make rod II's all fight if needed. Don't waste a cleric's attention healing the rodding mage who's making rods.<br />
<br />
5) Really then it's just whack a mob and reclicking your gobby earrings and coldian rings to mitigate the dispells.<br />
<br />
This, I realize, is a pretty conservative and obvious approach, but it works :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bar none best place to fight him is on the platform at HoT enterance. If you're on a server where pricks don't constantly train groups by opening the door then take advantage of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hiho,<br />
<br />
I think of Doze as a real shaman fight. It's all about getting slow on Doze and keep it there. If you fail this, you will probably die. Furthermore it is quite esential to get mana to clerics (Mod rod, Necros feeding).<br />
The rest is just applying damage.<br />
<br />
Use walls in HoT to your advantage to hide caster from AOE .. there are some spots which are quite useful.<br />

So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rekaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Send your tanks in, heal MT at ~ch every 4 secs (to be safe) til slow lands then assign a modrod team to your 3 remaining rotation clerics, have people low on health run out for heals, and beat him down wherever the hell you like.  Was easily doable with 4 groups half 2boxed back when we still did him with HoT level gear.<br />
<br />
Dragonbane owns him, certainly not necessary though (has about 400k hp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">400k hp?<br />
<br />
typo or this correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've slowed him long before Tash, just a Malo was needed.  He's way easy to slow.  The best place we found to fight him was in the pit with casters and healers in the center alcove between the stairs.  Everyone shrunk.  We positioned Doze in the corner between the stairs and the wall so his AE wouldn't hit the healers in the middle between the two staircases.  One MA gets pushed his butt into the corner with taunt aggro while all the other melees poke at Doze's butt.  <br />
<br />
Minimum we've done Doze with was 18.  That was right before we entered NToV tho and stopped doing him altogether.  It was just too much of a pain after that.  I wish I had that buckler tho.  I've never seen a better shaman shield.  I wear the Shield of Wurms now and it's ok, but that buckler would be godly.  I wanted to do the boots quest too since those boots have AoB.  I got the FKT tear but never got the other pieces.  <br />
/sigh<br />
Maybe one day we'll go back on dragon faction again.  Probably about the same time as NToV gets to be something we no longer do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">he has around 200-250k hp imo. definitely not a fast fight, he's got low melee output and you can kill him with very few...just takes a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>zooilogical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Doz has around 150k hps, with 3 DB wizards and 3 rogues never had a problem taking him out before warriors defensive discipline wore off. One more item of note for Dozekar , unlike most high end Luclin and Velious mobs, Bane and Pox DO land on Doz , so you can help out alot by slapping atleast Pox on him and killing his regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">He's a simple fight.<br />
<br />
And honestly, most of his loot is better then most of the loot you'll find in NToV, barring Vulak and some other individual items. He's a definite, if not much much slower and more random, source of insane loot for smaller guilds over NToV. Really is one of the easier ubermob fights in Everquest, too... probably Vindi/Statue/Zlandicar strength in my eyes. Once you get positioning, aggro, and DPS down... he's cake really.<br />
<br />
Catch is, you need Max Ally to do the quests with CoV. And of course, Telkoroner/Gozzrem/Lelandaria need to be up for the hand-ins.<br />
<br />
I'm honestly amazed he has not been buffed up yet. He's mind-numbingly easy for the rewards he grants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rekaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">it's been a long time since doz - 250k sounds about right, but it would indeed take a lot less time with 3 db wizards and 3 rogues...<br />
<br />
Guy is just starting on him, highly doubtful they have that kind of dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">dozekar quests require kindly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Heh Gloob yer being silly. Easy? I guess that's a matter of opinion, I have seen easier mobs in NTOV. Plus he's a 7 day spawn and drops zero loot besides tears which you cant do jack with unless you have faction and OTHER drops. Why the hell would they buff him up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yes, I admit that calling him an &quot;easy&quot; ubermob is subjective to your views. But when taking a look at the loot he drops, I can honestly say that he is a low-risk mob for the quality of reward he possesses. (I've heard of him being taken down easily with 18 people... less is debatably possible.) Consider equipping a guild with his loot a timesink... just a much easier one. :)<br />
<br />
Take a look at his quested loot tables, and then kill him a few times. You'll see what I mean. True, he's a long spawn who can be unpredictable in what he drops (he can refuse to drop the proper tears at times, etc... same with the week-spawn named drakes), but I still stand by my argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's an easy fight, but his quest is a timesink. Unless you're not sharing Dozekar with any other guilds on your server, it's not really worth the hassle. My guild shared Doze with one other guild, and we were completing maybe two items a month. Recently, three more guilds have joined the rotation. I think we've completed three items in three months since.<br />
<br />
Also, the fact that he's on a random pop timer as are all of his drakes can make ascertaining ownership of all potential symbol drops exceedingly difficult. Guilds who have no intent of ever doing Dozekar may pull and kill the named drakes simply because they either do no know, or because they have to kill them to get at more armor dropping drakes. While I like the random spawn timer, with Dozekar and the named drakes, it can make the whole thing more of a hassle than it needs to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">He did HoT for months, killing rares as they popper etc. We haven't completed a single quest. Huge timesink, massively random drops. <br />
<br />
Yes the items are great but getting them is far from just killing Doz since on Fennin 10-12 guilds hunt in HoT, and all kill rares hoping to kill Doz or because they kill Doz.</div></div><hr />
