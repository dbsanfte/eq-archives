<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Usually sebilis.  take something like d1/d2 and start pulling stuff unless the group is bad.  With good dmg output and a good enchanter can usually pull 5+ per pull.<br />
<br />
CT.  Best exp around and lots of fun. <br />
<br />
Chardok: Desereted great exp good loot.<br />
<br />
Where does everyne else get their exp from? i've heard of ppl with like 50+ alt points and i';m only at 16.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cazic Thule, Seb and HS is where I have been lately.  <br />
<br />
Cazic Thule is very hard, but very decent exp.  Working it with one group made HoT with one group look like a walk in the park.<br />
<br />
Seb... been pretty overcamped lately.  I ran from disco to CBA and didn't see one frog the other day.  I logged in 3 days ago to find 65 people in seb, camped check responded with (no joke) Exit, Discos, Dramp, Bugs, Crypt, Jail, CBA, Lower Exit/Jail, King and Juggs Bench and Juggs Lair all called.   <br />
<br />
HS mobs are so pitifully easy, in a strong melee group I was pulling nonstop and didn't even bother to slow most things because they die in like 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
I have almost 14 points now.<br />
run3, regen3, MC1, MC2....<br />

ME and The Deep are great exp as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">HS is a one way zone right?  I have only been there once, but I seem to remember that there isnt a way to zone out from the zone in - you need to collect keys and fight your way out.  Not a big deal if you have an evaccer type, but wouldn't it be hard to duo there with a non-porting class?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is frustrating that both KC and HS are on Venril Sathir faction as it rules it out for me - the convenience of being able to sell and bank in the outpost in conjunction with my OT gate hammer is just oo much to lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anyone find the hole very good exp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I been in chardok the last month, but since the velks and fungus grove nerfs all the rejects from there have been coming to chardok.  When me and my monk partner first started going there we were usually teh only 2 in the zone unless someone was raiding.  Now, every night there's at least 20, which for chardok is camped solid unless you have a full group.  Plus the amount of idiot newb trains has gone up by a landslide so if your duoing the fort it's a pain.  Lately we been clearing the upper tunnel though.  Bit safer from the level 60 gnoobs farming for AA exp.<br />
<br />
Personally I think AA exp really messed up the game.  Now you got level 60's moving in on mid and low 50's dungeons taking camps away from people legitamately trying to level up just so they can take the lowest, easiest blues possible with no risk.  Kinda pisses me off.  Liked it better when all the 60's freaks were off raiding or playing alt number 5 to 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah i've noticed a great increae in chardok.  That's why CT rules.  Not many can fight there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Hole is awesome exp if you are fighting the right stuff with a good group makeup. Was there with my warrior the other night sitting in the rock golem tower. Made 3 and a half blue in level 59 in a few hours there. Enchanter, Cleric, Druid, Warrior, and 2 rogues. Was great :)<br />
<br />
Will be even better to get in there with my shaman since aaxp flies in comparison to level 59 hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have so many twinks I find it hard to concentrate on AA.  My Roster contains a 60 Shaman with Run 3, 47 Warrior, 40 Rogue, 30 Druid, 24 Monk, 9 Bard, 8 Enchanter, and 5 ShadowKnight all twinked up and ready to level.<br />
<br />
I just can't make up my damn mind!  Having a lot more fun with my Rogue than I am my shaman though.  :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My experience in Seb is kind of limited for AA xp so far.  I was in the Crypt today.  We had me, a cleric, ranger, warrior, rogue, and druid.  The xp sucked.  I got about 1.5 yellow AA bubbles in 3 hours with a good pull rate, always having one mob parked on standby to be killed.  The good part about it though is I got to camp out in the Blood of Chottal room so I can farm Emperor.  He dropped an Emmissary of Thule today for the group.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule is great for xp.  It's not usually that busy.  It's also right next to a port in from the Ferrott.  I usually go here if I want some solo xp, or just a single partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah i want to go to HS badly. Are thr HTs annoying? <br />
<br />
Can be depends on where ya hunt. and who is pulling.<br />
<br />
<br />
HS is a one way zone right? <br />
<br />
No there are exits but you have to get to them. Sort of like seb. But by far the easiest way to do seb is if you have an evaker and a rogue for the doors.<br />
<br />
Lots or traps in HS. rule of thumb is just stay off the carpets and hug the walls if you not familiar with the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've done most of my AA exp in same place with similar groupage.<br />
Gone to Sebilis, to the hallway that leads down to Disco, and stop in the middle where the shaman frog spawns, just before the triple spawn a little lower. Stay here with a 60 warrior and 60 rogue, and make AA so fast that you would think you'd still be doing lvl 15. Pull everything from zone out to the disco bugs and sebilite golem. <br />
 The group setups have changed, somedays I've done it with a monk and a ranger, sometimes 2 rogues etc.. but never take more than 3, because otherwise the pulls can get slim and exp slows down. Best exp was with 60 rog and 60 tank. That was plain amazing. The rogue assasinated every 3rd mob and the tank had another mob ready when other was fleeing.<br />
 Maybe 2 lvl 60 rogues would be even better here because I have no problems tanking the slowed froggies, or keeping the aggro with Bane and root.<br />
 After I dinged 60 I've done maybe one regular 6 man group. The thing is, I dont need a cleric in most exp camps anymore when I can use torpor. I can haste tanks, slow mobs and CC in sebilis or chardok etc. without any problems, so ench is kinda useless, and torpor keeps me FM all the time anyway so no problem with that. <br />
 <br />
 I've also done a lot of trioing with a Paladin and Ranger friends of mine in chardok, and we actually rock. 2 of us can heal very decently, pally can res and has great buffs. Ranger has track, harmony, snare and limitless supply of very deadly arrows, so what else can you need?  <br />
  I used to hate paladin class, but 2 close Eq friends of mine have totally changed my mind on this one. They can do amazing things, at higher levels at least. They have become one of my favourite duoing class.<br />
  Also I cant understand why people bash rangers so much. My lvl 60 ranger friend controls his aggro amazingly, he never needs heals, he pulls like mad, and I love that he's so independant. He can heal himself, he can invis, buff, sow, levi, you name it. Plus he does tons of damage! They might not be too uber at lower levels, but with a little AA exp at 60, there's no class that I'd like to partner more at outdoor zones. I have been so impressed by the things they can do that the next twink I am going to make is a  Halfling ranger, as soon as I get my second Pc up and running.<br />
<br />
 So my recipe for good AA exping and lots of fun is instead of taking the holy trinity, cleric, chanter tank etc.   just grab 2 melees and crawl deep into chardok mines or other dangerous and desserted place and make better exp than any group can do. And that's a proven fact:) <br />
<br />
I love being 60 so much. For 2 years I read at these boards about the amazing things an oracle can do, and now that I've reached the level I am still in awe about the power we have at 60. I love being able to duo efficiently with just about any class in the game. I love being able to turn a disaster pull into mass exp blast with my slows and roots and heals. I love seeing people get disappointed when I need to leave the group because I have so much to offer for them. I love to have the best buffs in game, and I love being able to do things that other classes consider suicide or just impossible. I love this class so much that I dont know what else I could play, so maybe I'll just concentrate on getting AA exp for those nifty mass cannibalizations, channeling bonuses, quickbuffs and reinforcements. There's so much to do now at 60...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Slightly off topic: I think the people who bash rangers, are bad rangers. They complain that they are so weak, they can't seem to grasp that their lack of tankability (is that a word?) is a trade off for their awesome damage output. As you say, a ranger who can control their agro is a great thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Scryris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have about 40 AA points, most of it was done in FG. Pull with Slow, Pet attack, Epic and Jbb.  Rinse and Repeat.  Was pretty good exp, up until nerf.  <br />
<br />
Though last night I got together in FG with a Shaman Friend of mine.  Both of us had pets, hasted.  He pulled with slows, epic'd.  I used Pox.  Then we both JBB.  Ate through them before the epic or pox ever ran out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I had a great night last night deep in the East wing of HS.  We didn't have an evaccer (although I think we probably could have fought to an exit) so our ranger got out with his tolan's bp and our bard got out with his OT hammer, worked great!  The room was on a really fast respawn and the ranger was pulling from all over, c3 + bard song = non stop mana!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Fungus Grove Caller quests are good.<br />
You can set the pace with with the ale you buy, depending on how strong your group is.<br />
<br />
Chance of the odd nice loot too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A friend and I duo for an AA point/level every 3 hours of hardcore xping.<br />
<br />
Is this good?  Anyone hear of any faster xp spots even if you don't want to share :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jimoin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I solo FG after the change for a blue every 12 mins.<br />
<br />
Crashem what class are you duoing with and where to get an AA every 3 hours? :)<br />
<br />
Let us in :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Is 3 hour an AA point really good though?  I haven't found any faster XP out there.<br />
<br />
I would rather not post my duo strategy on the boards at the minute cause I don't know many spots to do it in.  Also, it is definitely a tricky strategy and cost me 20+ deaths to work it all out.  Email me and I can let you know.</div></div><hr />

ME and The Deep are great exp as well. <br />
<br />
Go to South HS. I get about a yellow a hour for 1 aa per 5 hours.  If you go east its better but not worth the trouble.  So far only CT (if you can get a decent group) has better exp that I have found.</div></div><hr />
