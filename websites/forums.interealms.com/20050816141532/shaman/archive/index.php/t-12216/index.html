<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Theo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all you crazy whacky Shammies<br />
<br />
I have been reading all this stuff your regurgitating and I have to say I AM IMPRESSED! A wealth of collective knowledge to be gained here. I started my Shammie because I was inspired by one who posts occasionally here, his name is Benorf. I really like my Shammie alot. He is  now a 39 Barb with decent gear. He is NOT however my first char. I also have a 51 Mage, 51 Druid (cough) and I 2 box with my 39 Ranger. And I just bought my JBB yesterday. Got a pretty decent price on it 15kp, seen them go for as high as 20kp on Nameless. Can't wait to get 45 to use it. Anyways thanks for your great input. Fascinating reading and fun in execution. :D <br />
<br />
On another note: I wanted to ask Sunmoon if he would say anything about Ranger's Glade site? Does it still exist? Why cant I log into it? Broken link or something? If this is out of place just bonk me keeps me straight!<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone ;) <br />
