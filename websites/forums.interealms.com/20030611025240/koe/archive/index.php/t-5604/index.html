<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there was once a thread about keys using XP? Just installed XP and am looking for those tips ... If there isnt a section and I am just on crack .. lol .. then can we start one?<br />
<br />
Laters all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ack Chad!  Dont do it!!!  My Dell came with that demonic XP and i cant stand it...  takes me 20+ times of clicking the play everquest at the server select screen beofre it will finally progress to the char select.  And within the past few days its developed another neat little trick... crashing to desktop when zoning.   Had Falla look at the debug text and it seems to be port related...  Seriously considering reformatting and using Win98 from the other computer.<br />
<br />
There is/was a thread... i'll see if i can find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Biggest issue I have had with XP is one of the &quot;help&quot; features.  If you hold down the shift key for 8 seconds or so it pops up a window.  To disable this feature hold down the shift key til it pops up and disable it...:)...I think you can  also do this from control panel: accessability options...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Infinate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To add to %T's post, there is a series of &quot;quick&quot; keys in XP. Best to disable all of them. Actually just disable the whole thing. <br />

Far as XP and EQ I'm quite happy with it. Most of the conserns when XP came out where EQ bugs IMO anyways and most of the deadly ones have been fixed I think. It's quite nice to be able to hit Ctrl-Al-Del to kill EQ when you just port-crashed in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xouqoa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No problems running EQ with XP here... but I don't play it a lot. :)<br />

XP has been a hell of a lot more stable for me than any other Windows OS, with maybe the exception of Win2K Pro, which I didn't get to test much cause the AO beta crashed my registry!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">most of my problems have been patch related as far as eq crashes. But i'd have to say its stable, if not faster, since it manages memory a hell of a lot better than win98, and I think a little better than 2kpro.<br />
<br />
But, everyone knows the real reason to use XP, it has really cool buttons and purdy lookin themes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love XP to death.  My machine has been more stable since running this OS than any flavor of windows i've ever put on here.  I now run weeks at a time and dont have to reset. I think the last time i've had to reset was a few weeks ago when  took my computer toa LAN party at work... hows that for stable?<br />
<br />
Oh, and it just rocks to be able to change network setting and not have to reboot.  damn i love that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've not found XP to be faster than 2k.  Matter of fact, XP is more resource intensive that 2k was.<br />

XP has two very bad issues, as far as EQ goes.  Number one, if you use a dial up connection, stay very,very far away from XP. As in garlic-wreaths-and-wooden-stakes far away.  XP has a problem with using ICS (Internet Connection Sharing) in a gaming environment.  Doesn't matter if you havve ICS turned on or not, it's part of the operating system.  Basically, XP opens a port for EQ on the first network device it finds, which 99% of the time is the network card, and not the modem.  You will get constant refusals of service from the game servers and horrid zoning times.<br />
<br />
<br />
The other issue just cropped up.  The &quot;optimization&quot; for sound that was done in the last patch has created serious issues with SB-based cards, especially SBLive! cards.  If you have an SB card of any flavor, XP or not, disable sound in the options screen before log-in and I guarantee your disconnects on zoning will be cut in half.</div></div><hr />
