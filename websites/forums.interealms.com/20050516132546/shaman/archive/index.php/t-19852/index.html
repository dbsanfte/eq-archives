<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Most of my game-time has been spent grouping or partnering. However now I am entering the high-end game I am finding difficultly competing for groups with Beastlords &amp; Chanters.<br />
<br />
I have therefore been looking into soloing.<br />
<br />
Up until now my mainstay solo technique had been to tank the mob in the face with Slow &amp; JBB, while healing myself with Torpor. This method works to a point up to Teir 1 zones.<br />
<br />
I have tried practicing root dotting in places like PoN, which although successful, are a huge drain on my mana pool.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any advice / tips they can provide?<br />

Its a great resource especialy if you change the display to show all form begining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Root, Rot(DoT)  works really really well also.    The biggest tip I can give to keep gate up.  If that soloing goes down south fast, better to gate  then to die and no rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Lit<br />
<br />
The two basic techniques are IN TEH FACE, which you are using now, and root/rot.  It's theoretically possible to melee the mob down with the pet and just heal the pet with Q, but it's slower than IN TEH FACE and uses more healing mana.  The pet won't hold aggro well at all.<br />
<br />
Check out http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19513 from the Hunting Grounds forum, I went into great detail about how I root/rot golems in POV.  Another poster commented that he uses the same technique in the elemental planes, so those techniques seem to hold up well.<br />
<br />
I never have gate up, I don't have room for it.  I do keep SOW on when possible :-) and gate mems and casts so fast that I can usually run ahead, mem gate, run ahead, cast gate, and get out... or just run to zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've actually had a great deal of success with the pet tank style in Inner Acrylia.  Summon dogdog, buff him and alpha him, then pull the first mob with slow.  Dot him while he hits you, and then once you've done all your dots with a dd component (BoS, BoN, BoU, etc.) root and back off.  Then cast all your other dots (epic, bane, etc.).  The mobs in IA are so wussy I only have to Q the pet every third mob as long as I /pet sit for 5-10 secs between pulls.  With CanV I can keep this up with very little downtime, outdoors on a mount you'd probably have no downtime at all.<br />
<br />
There are two main advantages of this strategy over in teh face style.  First, since your pet heals at the hightened npc rate, the damage can be cured quickly and without using mana by just waiting a few seconds between fights.  Second, since your pet is the one being beaten on and not you, you can cast spells easier, deal with adds better, and just generally feel less stressed since its not your neck on the line.  However this strategy won't work anywhere where the mobs do a whole lot of damage (golems in PoV).  You can do it, but you will waste way too much mana on Qs.  For them root rot is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My tip to you would be to start the fight out very conservatively.  Find out if you can maintain a steady or increasing mana pool while tanking the mob.  If you cannot, then see if you can do so with the mob rooted or pet tanked.  If neither of those work, then as a last resort try out full burn or potion assisted fighting.<br />
<br />
  Most fights can be won with patience enough to have the dogdog be your only DPS, tanking the mob yourself and running canni/Q/Tnarg non-stop.  It isn't efficient nor practical for exp, but if you are trying for trophy kills it'll win almost every time.</div></div><hr />
