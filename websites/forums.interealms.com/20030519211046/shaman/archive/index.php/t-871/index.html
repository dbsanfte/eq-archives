<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well heres a little story i got ta tell! a rogue friend o mine got all tha skulls for tha 7th cudgel and was gonna help me MQ it (since i dont have my HS key yet) so we spent some time for him to turn in tons of bonechips, then gave it a whirl. well the mob that pops on tha beach in FoB was MUCH tougher than we expected! (even with a lvl 60 rogue!) the darn thing has a HT, and i simply could not heal fast enough! AND it summons. i ended up taking aggro so my buddy could get away (needless to say it resisted everything i threw at it and i was a dead lizard, but at least my friend got away without being summoned again) looks like this thing hits about like tha black dire. while i was running back to my corpse, he assembled a team of 55+ (chanter, druid, &amp; cleric i think) but it despawned just before they could pull him, under 30 mins. i personally think if we had had a cleric or at least another healer on the first try we might have been ok, but im open to opinions. anyone who has done this part what do you think the minimum group needed would be? (lvls/classes etc) sure i know i shouldn't be doing this at lvl 42 but hey, help was offered so why not =P <br />
we're gonna try again soon as he gets another dusty skull from HS so i'd like to be just a little more prepared for next time (and have more than just 2 people to help!) any advice/info is much appreciated and thank you in advance =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Funny you should mention the monk/shaman combo, since I duo'd with my 60 monk partner, Knek, to take this guy out as well.  At the time, there was no info on this fight (I'm not sure if anyone had done it.. certainly nobody I knew), and it surprised us that day by being nontrivial--it's not like the two of us immediately had the guy under total control.I don't remember exactly now, but we tend to have tense moments with a single mainly when I get a slow resist on a hard-hitting MOB, get aggro, and start getting interrupted on recasts of anything. So by backward reasoning I'm betting that resists on this guy might be an issue.  For that reason, I'd suggest needing a person or persons who can regain aggro and take some damage while you're trying to stick a slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did the fob fight with a 60mnk, had a 60dru on the sidelines waving pom poms and cheering us on (I think he NT'd the monk once as monkies don't like Torpor, ungrateful sods).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did it with me(53 shaman at the time), 52 shaman for backup, and a 60sk to tank. the sk didnt even need 2 heals ~_~ one heal to heal past the HT and he was fine the rest of the fight. Slow landed after the second try, so hes not THAT bad. GOOD LUCK!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arsenak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Same here almost... did mine with a 60shm (me) 60 monk and 59 dru... went pretty smootly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hizzter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">60 SHM and 60 NEC (with 56 pet) did fine.<br />
<br />
Malo first, then Turgurs.  Pox would not land at all even AFTER Insidious Decay.  Summoning was a pain, I had to Torpor the necro once after he got summoned due to laying DOTs on.  All I did after slowing was drop 2 spear DOTs on.<br />
<br />
But the pets wore him down, easy fight other than having to heal the necro once.</div></div><hr />
