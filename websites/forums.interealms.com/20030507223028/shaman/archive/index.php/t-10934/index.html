<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sirx4playz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">sups i'm a new sham just hit 40...and i run into a prob i would say..i like to solo and stuff but it ain't working at the moment...i root and dot but the root seems to break and when it does &quot;bone the f out&quot; i was wondering if there is any equipment thats has insnare for the shaman...vah shir...i bout some crystilline silk nets 2 charges go pretty fast for bout 20pp and pop...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What are you trying to solo?<br />
<br />
Shaman can own melee based mobs but casters will always be a problem.  I can solo two yellow Sonic Wolves in a row but one  green Goblin Neophyte gives me fits because Vah Shir Shaman can't interrupt spells.<br />
<br />
Your equipment might be an issue too. <br />
<br />
If you could tell us what you are wearing or post a Magelo profile we could see if you have any reall issues there.  A lot of young Shaman (me included) make mistakes on equipment.<br />
<br />
As far as you're main question the Grimling Fishermen in Hollowshade Moor drop a net almost identical to the crystaline net but it's uncommon.  Troll Shaman get a snare necklace but other races can't use it (which sucks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">as far as i'm aware there is no right click infinite charge snare, other then for trolls.<br />
<br />
And for trolls it's really not a great snare either as far as I know, the lowest level one which isn't really too snarey.<br />
<br />
Are you slowing?<br />
And you mentioned you were root - rotting. Is your defense maxed? If not you should probably be tanking with dogdog for defense.<br />
Post a magelo..if you're a wis based shaman your game is gonna be a lot different then if you are like most people around here, who go HP &gt; AC &gt; WIS, though up to 50 maybe ac &gt; hp &gt; wis.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kill Prince in Warrens, loot a bag of Dice, hand it in to the children kitties in Stonebrunt, get a ball of yarn :)   4 charges of Snare, NOT lore, and I am pretty sure it is easily vendor recharged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a spear that procs snare but it is in VT or some high lvl zone like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm if you're root-rotting and getting your butt handed to you, you should consider trying a different strategy.  I've been able to slow/tank/dot/puppy any mob that is a &quot;reasonable kill,&quot; that is, it gives me exp and is at the sweet spot of the &quot;time spent/exp gained&quot; graph.  I would only root-rot if I had no puppy up, or if the puppy could handle a slowed mob while I med.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents, I won't dictate your playstyle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Berakka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">did the fuzzy dice for the ball of yarn ez at 29 and always useful in a pinch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unless you are a troll and have the snare necklace or snag the shaman useable weapon that procs ensare that Tunare drops you have to use root as a shaman to prevent runners from getting away. It means the mob will fight back till it dies but it's better than it getting away and causing a train.<br />
<br />
In situations where I can't afford a mob to run like soloing in Seb or PoG I always malosini it and keep one finger over my root hotkey when the mob's life is nearing one bub. Even if it's a light blue I still malosini it. Nothing worse than a sowed mob breaking root because you were too lazy to malosini... say hello to a big assed train :)<br />
<br />
You just have to learn to live without snare(unless you are a troll *envious*) as a shaman. If we had a long lasting snare like druid's it would make the class way too easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can also buy Serrated Bone Dirks from the bazaar fairly cheap. (15 to 75pp) and give them to pet. This works very effectively if you have stable connection and can keep dog alive for the long duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Doh forgot about pet. I always try to pickup some gnoll hide lariats when I can and save them for the hard stuff since they proc a stun. But I'm lucky to find 1-2 a night in the bazaar so usually have to live without them.<br />
<br />
I need to start keeping an eye out for the SBDs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe im asking this in the wrong place.. But vendor recharging a charged item?.. Can you explain?</div></div><hr />
