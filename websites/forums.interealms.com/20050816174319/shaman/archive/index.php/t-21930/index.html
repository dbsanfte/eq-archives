<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mojoejojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have some tips for items that are relatively easy to get, or buy in the bazaar, that give good tribute points?  Here are a couple that I've found just turning in old junk.<br />
<br />
Runed mythril bracer        315<br />
Tae Ew Shield                 4200<br />
Crypt Robbers Chestplate 2280<br />
<br />
Please post some items that you've found that give good tribute points, and maybe we can get a decent list going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LachdanonColdpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The problem with creating a list is that if good cheap tribute items are found, the everyone will use them, and in turn, Sony will nerf em. Kinda the same reason people don't like to give up their favorite farm spots. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just a couple of common items with good tribute value:<br />
<br />
- Tactician's Bulwork (sp?) Shield - can buy in bazaar for 6-8k, worth 27k tribute pts.<br />
<br />
- Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic - can buy for 5-10k, worth 24k tribute pts.<br />
<br />
Also, there is a type of pick that can be made with around 46 skill in Blacksmithing that gives very good value, 100 or so will get you almost 200k pts (max).<br />
<br />
Seems that most LDoN items have high tribute value.<br />
<br />
Look for an article on RPGexpert.com on this subject.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually its about 625 forged picks :P  But at just over 2p each, not too bad to get max tribute for around 2k pp!<br />
<br />
  Not sure on other cities, but in Cabilis, get a ton of waterflasks in West Cabilis, zone to East, the rest is sold there, make them, gate to the tribute guy, hand in and repeat!  Ive had FT1 to get my 15 cap, 150hp tributes going forever, and Im still at 198k...</div></div><hr />
