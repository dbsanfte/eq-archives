<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is my UI. Thanks to everyone that I borrowed code from. Thanks Aruman, Patito. Robert Babiak, and others. I borrowed most of the code, but some of it is mine, pretty much all the graphic changes are mine.<br />
<br />
&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.starpixel.com/eq/ss.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.starpixel.com/eq/ss-t.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt; PREVIEW&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starpixel.com/eq/iceyblue.zip&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.starpixel.com/eq/icyblue.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt; UI FILES&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Graphics:<br />
---------<br />
-- I changed all the graphics to a cool iCEy blue color. <br />
-- All the buttons are roundish and clean. <br />
-- I redid the inventory item backgrounds. Included in the screenshot is an empty inventory window so you can see the changes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Here is some notable mod features:<br />
----------------------------------<br />
-- Target window display the current target with a unique number, (i.e., froglok_bok_knight13), the percent of target. The casting bar is to the right of the target bar.<br />
-- Player window shows HP, MaxHP, AC and WIS. There are also bars for hps (red), mana (blue), pet (green), exp and aa exp. All with percents.<br />
-- Group window shows percents<br />
-- Compact spell book<br />
-- Compact Inventory<br />
-- Horizontal spell gems<br />
-- Compact, horizontal buff window -- to move this window you have resize the window.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To Install:<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
1. Go to the uifiles directory in your Everquest folder, Right-Click on the DEFAULT folder there, and select &quot;Copy&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Then Right-Click in the same folder as default (beside it) and select &quot;Paste&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Re-name &quot;Copy of  Default&quot; a new name, keeping it short <br />
<br />
4. Download the file you want and un-zip them.<br />
<br />
5. Drag all the items in your un-zipped file folder into your new folder, (you just named a short name)  it will ask you &quot;do you want to copy over....&quot; select &quot;YES TO ALL&quot;.<br />
<br />
6. Log into Everquest<br />
<br />
6. use /loadskin &lt;folder name&gt; (this is why you keep it short)<br />
<br />
****If your using a SKIN Mod, you must then camp out and back into the game to see it****<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to install selected mods from this interface, just copy over the &quot;.tga&quot; files that you want. (i.e., copying over only EQUI_Inventory.xml will only change the inventory mod).<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To ONLY Install graphics, copy these files only:<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
window_pieces01.tga<br />
window_pieces02.tga<br />
window_pieces03.tga<br />
window_pieces04.tga<br />

wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga<br />
wnd_bg_light_rock.tga<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Also note: I made a few changes to the spell icons which are mainly tailored to shaman spells, here are the files:<br />

However, from the sci-fi-esque design of that UI and some of the others I've seen, I worry. How long is it until someone keys into the idea of a UI that mimics star ship panels on Star Trek? ;(</div></div><hr />

However, It's not working right. I've loaded the skin, the whole thing, but I'm not seeing the blue buttons and skins. I've camped, relogged and all but is all I get of the skins are the blue inventory boxes. I don't get any of the blue buttons or textures that I like from the picture above.<br />

Why do you think its not working for me  ?</div></div><hr />

What's the problem with that? You can use ye olde viking stylee if it suits you more.<br />

Good job Leoice. I like the spell book a lot and the bear graf is neat :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like the look.<br />
There's a few things that IMO should change.<br />
1.  Spell icons go vertical.  No need for the change.  It looks unnatural.<br />
2.  Putting the destroy button there in your inventory is a bad thing.  I've had my destroy button autodestroy stuff without confirmation for about 2 years now.  I'd probably destroy something important with your UI.<br />
3.  Put the spell casting time left gauge in the player window that has the xp guages and hp and mana and pet health.  I've been using a UI that has it put there, and I love it there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Looks good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gytmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Heckuva job with the UI!!!  Very impressive - I just downloaded it all, except for the spellbook.  The only reason I didn't load the spellbook is cause I am nervous about having to reorganize my whole spell book again.  Will my spells stay in the same order as they are now in my book?  And are the number of spells on a page the same (haven't counted yet)?<br />
<br />
I also don't get the icy blue graphics with this, one of the cooler features.  In addition, I downloaded the new spell gem icons, and they didn't change either.  Know how I can fix this, or what I did wrong?  You help would be appreciated.  Thanks again for your hard work, and for sharing it with us!!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I got the same thing (no blue, textures instead) and figured it was just me so I started poking around...<br />
<br />
Go into your eqclient.ini and find the the line SKIN=default and change it to SKIN=blue (or whatever you called it), then restart.  Should fix it.  Worked for me.  :)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

I think your right Bigguess, I have that line changed in my eqclient.ini. Didn't really think about that. I hope everyone gets it working!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It took a day or so to get used to horizontal spell gems, but I like it because it seems to be easier access to memming spells from the spell book that pops up right above it.<br />
<br />
I do agree the destroy button is kinda big and close to other stuff. I have confirmation on my destroys.... but I may end up changing that.<br />
<br />
I'm always looking at the casting bar, having it right in the middle of the screen seems natural to me. It would be easy enough to move it to the player window though.</div></div><hr />

Yes, its kind of a pain in the asz but to resize it you have to resize... say the top left corner and move that corner to where you want to to go... then resize and move the button right corner to where you want it to go.<br />
<br />
Its the only work around I know of... kind of a pain.. but once you get it where you want it its not a big deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There shouldn't be any reorganizing of your spells. This spell book has the same amount of spells per page as the default.</div></div><hr />

also i Alt-cast so i dont like the horizontal spell icons, anyone know how to change just that? <br />
<br />
other then those 2 things, i like the UI and that's what i plan on using.<br />

Any chance you can post a modified...vertical spell window for you UI?  I will work on merging your code with the vertical  spellwindow I am already using, but I can barely spell XML, and you did some pretty fancy stuff here.</div></div><hr />

Actually just head over to www.eqinterface.com and browse their the spellbook mods there and find one you like, download it and copy it over to your ui directory. The graphics SHOULD stay the same even with a different mod.</div></div><hr />

Here are the steps...<br />
<br />
1) Recopy default into the directory containing this mod... I call it blue.  Say yes to overwrite all.<br />
<br />
2) Redownload the original mod. Unzip and copy into the &quot;blue&quot; directory.  Say yes to overwrite all.<br />
<br />
3) download the zipfile below, unzip and then copy the files into &quot;blue&quot;.  Say yes to overwrite all.<br />
<br />
Should work.<br />

That said I was wondering if you can do me a favor if possible, dont know its difficulty as I know nothing about Xml stuff etc..<br />
<br />
Is it possible for you to add a Stamina bar and change the wisdom icon to Intellect so I can use this mod for my SK and other melee alts?  Mainly add just a stamina bar, Int thing not important.<br />

If you can I would really appreciate it and if not I understand.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Impossible.  Verant said in the patch message that old skins were still going to work.<br />

You and I must be seeing things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Would it be possible to add a few different player windows to the zip?  One for wis casters (current), one for int casters (int instead of wis), and one for melee (atk instead of wis + fatigue bar).  I looked at the code to try and mod it myself, but it brought great confusion to me.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Mysticow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I followed the instructions in the download on how to install the files and I log into EQ and do the /loadskin &lt;skindir&gt; ( that being the dir i named) I get crashed to the desktop.  I reload EQ and select my shaman and get kicked to the desktop again.  Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Mysticow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I have found that 2 of the files are not loading correctly. The EQUI.xml will cause this to crash to the Desktop and the targetwnd.xml (sp) will cause a load error.  I dont know much about this (still kinda new) but it seems that you can load everything else.  If there is some way that you can fix this let me know and ill do it I would like to see this all working together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I just downloaded this and follow perfect instructions, and it just crashed to desktop for me. ANd now whenever I try to log in it keeps crashing to the desktop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Mysticow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Divinator scroll up a few messages and you will find a fix for the EQUI and a couple other files, download that and copy those files into your new dir.  I also copied the targetwindow file from the default dir to replace the one that this skin uses and that seemed to fix my problems.<br />
<br />
The post I talk about was made by Hrothgar.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Yep I saw it thanx a lot for your help everyone this UI is hella cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Okay, tonight is my first attempt at using a new UI.  So far I really like everything I've gotten working, but I have a few questions and requests:<br />
<br />
1.  I assume I get no mob hps % reading on this UI because I had to replace the targetwindow file because of the error it was causing.  If this is the case, does anyone have a link to a new target window that will work with this UI that includes this feature?  <br />
<br />
2.  Also, when I cast a spell, the little bar that shows the dwindling casting times doesn't appear for me when I use this UI.  Am I missing something, or is there a way that I can restore this feature using the default files?  This will really drive me crazy if I can't use this.  <br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Thanks for the Great UI Leoice, and the great fix Hrothgar!<br />
<br />
I really like it but the occasional crash/failure to boot, was bugging me a lil, now everything is peachy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Bodabag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Will there be another update to this UI?  After the last patch I was getting a message that some of my XML files aren't compatible.  Any idea what needs to change?  Love this UI and hate to switch back to the old one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Lokeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Yeah I get the same. Although, it all seems to work fine still. The only thing missing that I can tell is the new display options, opacity etc.<br />
<br />
To change those I just used the default skin and then switched back to my nice icey blue ui.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Bodabag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Thanks Lokeye.  Do you know the name of the file for the display options?</div></div><hr />
