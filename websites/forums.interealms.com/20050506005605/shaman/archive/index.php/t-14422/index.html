<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do you manage to get a magelo that does not name your charachter, or hides the server? I keep seeing these and frankly, I question their authenticity..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I need to know what race I should pick, how I should spend my aa, complete spell descriptions, advice on what spells are important to obtain, information on all the best grinding zones and how to level fast whilst simultaneously making a butt-load of plat. <br />
<br />
<br />
Board pollution pwnz. Holy....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">NOBODY knows? (about the magelos)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am still trying to figure out how a Shaman has an unbuffed AC of 1942 though.<br />
<br />
Seems a bit far fetched to me, so I am trying to see how they did it.<br />
<br />
From what I figured this shaman would have to have a naked AC in the neighborhood of 1080.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">alot of people like to stay unnamed, like people on the zeks where it might be unadvantages to let people know what you have other than people close to u.  Also, PlayerAuction'ers also use it to show their items but don't want Sony to delete their characters by finding out the name (not sure if Sony would actually do that though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unbuffed 2k? Even with maxed Elemental gear, that sounds...flimsy at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If it's in Magelo, it's POSSIBLE<br />
<br />
And while it's possible that a flaming frog will burst from my butt singing &quot;Swanee,&quot; it's not LIKELY (thank God!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Final, this is your last warning. If I get fired from work for laughing out loud like a maniac for no apparent reason, you and I are gona go round and around. <br />
<br />
I could have handled the frog part..but flaming frog...it was too much!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with Kkrush...I just got some strange looks when I burst out laughing a few seconds ago... :p   (luckily I work in software development and we're all a bit 'touched')</div></div><hr />
