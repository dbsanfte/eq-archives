<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korkrest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This very evening Rallos Zek was taking down by a short reuniting alliance, AKA  BFA(Big Fat Alliance) the first Rallos Zek Killing on Caziz Thule server.<br />
The Relentless and Element of Darkness decided that the best means of defeating this guy was to do a combined beat down on him.<br />
We drop Rallos pretty smoothly where after i hailed the flagger guy got my flag, the problem was that the raid was bugged, out of the 95 people present about 30 get flagged total (might be abit lower then that). Do i consider myself lucky i got the flag? not really, what are the few flagged guildies and i gonna do in the elemental planes?<br />
<br />
I could think of a number of things to call verant, but momma said not to badmouth people :P.A thanks to Element of Darkness for helping us complete this awesome encounter.<br />
<br />
My question to you guys is, is this a common occurance? have you ever been assisted by a GM after a raid bug that cost you alot of flags? its not hard for a GM to check the zone at the time of the RZ killing, do a listing of the corpses and players present and give them their well deserved flags.<br />

I dont understand why.. and I'm activly waiting to hear back from a GM.. I do think its BS you spend all the time killing them due to a bug that should of been fixed upon launch some unlucky fellows can not advance.. I really hope a GM can help me I took SS of the message to back my story up =\<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Althalonas Cazicbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Errr Cas you don't recive a flag for killing Aerin'Dar you get the flag when you zone into the HoH. You hail the projection and all he says is &quot;you may now enter the Halls of Honor&quot; or something like that. But you then have to go down the trap door behind AD's Lair and zone into HoH from there. and when you zone in you get the Character Flag. I know because I did it myself this week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anlashok Entilzha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's pretty cheesy of TR and EoD to separately agree to a Rallos rotation and then team up so together you have two out of four rotation slots. Then again that's just my opinion and no one cares about server specific politics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casanova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well I did kill AD and I went and Hailed the Planar Projection ... he should of said I can enter but he didnt.. I even tried to click on it to port over and it didnt work<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>decairn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Korkrest, Cybsled had similar issues with Mith Marr flag entry.  The GMs couldn't/didn't tell him which flags the system thought he had and would not flag him for MM entry even though we know he's got it all done.  Cyb went through several GMs in attempt to solve it.<br />
<br />
It's easier to redo the flags then to get a straight answer, or hell even a result maybe, out of a GM on flag issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KaabaCloudberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For those that don't know, most of the flagging events you need to be in a raid, we had this issue last night killing Terris Thule.  If you are not in the main raiding group that got the xp you cannot get flagged by hailing the projection, so what you need to do is swap the people that are not raid grouped into the raid after the people in the raid are flagged.  It's quite easy to do and it's there to prevent other guilds from ninja flagging behind you which I think is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>decairn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">CT politics rule, don't knock it.  I am sure it is the same on every server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually dec it's worse on some servers :)<br />
<br />
The flag system is buggy and has been since day one, fact of life with verant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cas, you get the flag for HoH by zoning in thru the entrance in the cave below AD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Casanova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tried... after I hailed the Planar projectal and received the message &quot;You have done well, but you cannot enter the halls of honor on your own until you have demonstrated your sense of justice as well as honor.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was after I killed AD... hailed the projectal and tried to zone in threw the valley.. I also tried to zone in threw the stones out side...<br />

Similar thing happened for my guild, cept the non-raided people received flags.<br />
<br />
They had to go off to see the Seer in PoK and have her serach for other memories (Whatever the last option is).  He then received the TT kill flag and could continue back to hail Thelin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>decairn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For the specifics of last night, people in the raid when the kill was made ended up not being flagged because the raid was bugged.  The only thing that worked, albeit a bit late for most people, was to get a raid invite in Tranquility, zone in and run to get the flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Korkrest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well, atleast we downed him again, still a shame for those there at the first kill but not there at the 2nd :(</div></div><hr />

dunno, just the way this is worded seems to mean that maybe you missed out on something earlier.  Did you find some other way to get into PoV/PoS or something? almost seems like it has something to do with the PoJ trials</div></div><hr />
