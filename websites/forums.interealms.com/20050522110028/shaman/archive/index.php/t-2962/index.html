<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PolarAxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's the low down on horses?  If you're sitting on one, do you med?  Can you cast while sitting on one of these?  What about SoW?  How is that effected?<br />
<br />
Any info would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While on a horse, you are meditating if you are not moving and not auto-attacking.  Therefore, you can meditate while casting, right-click (JBB)'ing, or just standing around.  This remains the same whether you turn the horse model on or off.  <br />
<br />
This is great for a few reasons- one, you don't need to sit (and draw aggro from monsters)... two, you're getting mana back while just standing around or casting or JBB'ing... three, no more cannidance!<br />
<br />
Turning the horse model off has certain benefits- I recommend turning the models off if you decide to buy a horse:<br />
<br />
You can keep your sow speed instead of the horse speed (the speed of the cheapest horse is slower than SoW- turning off the model removes the horse speed effect... so you can cast SoW on yourself, click your epic boots, get snared by the fungi staff, etc.) <br />
<br />
You can duck (to interrupt spells) - you can't duck if you can see the horse models<br />
<br />
You don't have the acceleration effect <br />
<br />
You don't have to see the horse head all the time <br />
<br />
You also keep the automed feature.  One quirk, I've noticed that sometimes the mana bar doesn't update from automed until you do something to trigger it. For example, I'll stand still for a minute and the mana bar won't move. I'll refresh my SoW, and my mana will go UP two bubbles (because it's just now refreshing from the past few minutes.) <br />
<br />
By turning off the model you lose the safe fall bonus that comes with the horse <br />
<br />
Whether the model is on or off, you'll go through a lot more food wihle on a horse than while not riding one. They eat a ton. <br />
<br />
The cheapest horse (the one you should get if you're not going to use it for run speed- e.g. turning the models off) costs 8399 pp and sells back for 7619 pp (in case you ever change your mind) - that's just over 90% of the price paid.  Get your CHA to 115 to get the best possible price.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
