<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I found some interesting things involving pet aggro today.<br />
<br />
I am a level 54 shaman using the level 49 pet.  He cons light blue to me every time.<br />
I partnered with a level 58 mage.  His pet conned dark blue to him.  At first he was using earth pet.  He would pull a mob with some spell or another, and then I would slow it.  He would sic his earth pet on it and then I would sic my pet.  My pet would take aggro over the mage pet, which i thought was odd.  I turned off his taunt thinking that would fix it....<br />
<br />
nope.  my level 49 pet was outtaunting a 58 mage's earth pet.  every single time my pet would take and hold aggro.  I let his haste buffs wear off.  No effect.  He still took aggro over the mage hasted and buffed mage pet.<br />
<br />
The mage came  up with a solution:  when a mob is rooted (they were constantly rooted thanks to the earth pet) it attacks the enemy nearest to it, which was my pet.  Seemed logical... so he reclaimed his earth pet and summoned a water pet and gave it two daggers.  at this time i turned on others hits so that I could watch their damage.<br />
<br />
It was absurd.  My pet was hitting for like 15-30 every now and then, while the water pet was constantly doubling for 40 or even 50+ and BACKSTABBING FOR 130+.   And guess what?  yup, my little pathetic dog with taunt turned off was OUTTAUNTING IT.<br />
<br />
WHY?!?!?!?!  im so confused :(  I think its really stupid that our dinky pets can take aggro over the mage earth pet, which was meant to be a tank.  I can't believe this is how its supposed to work.  is this a bug or some dumb taunt factors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Must be a bug. I noticed last night in OT partnered with a Beastload that his pet never, ever got agro over my dog. I turned taunt off, I waited on sending dogdog in til the warder generated 20% damage. No good. As soon as my pet joined in the mb would agro on it. His warder was blue to me at 38 and my pet was green to me. Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">MOBs always attack the weakest pet. It doesn't have anything to do with the wolf pet gaining aggro. This is very, very annoying in pet-based groups that lack a PC melee character, as the weakest pet is forced to be the tank, and effectively means you can't use the Shaman pet when duoed with a Magician or Necromancer. I've written several times to Verant asking them to please fix this, so if you care strongly about it perhaps you should as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
god what a stupid idea =\  thats like having the mobs ignore the hate list and go immediately for the meditating chanter.<br />
<br />
btw, can you define &quot;weakest&quot;?  does it mean the mob with the lowest hp, the lowest level, originating from the lowest level player, or is there an established heirarchy of pussiness among pets?</div></div><hr />

You just made my afternoon. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I couldn't tell you for sure, though it's definitely not &quot;originating from the lowest level player.&quot; If characters are of similar level, MOBs will always attack a Shaman pet over a Necromancer or Magician pet, and a Necromancer pet over a Magician pet. Shadow Knight pets I don't know about as there's almost always a Shadow Knight PC that comes along with them, and so the MOBs go for the PC. I don't have enough experience with Beastlord warders side-by-side with Magician and Necromancer pets, but I do know (as Grotte said) that MOBs will attack the Shaman pet over the warder.<br />
<br />
If I had to guess (and I'm just guessing) I'd say it's probably based on the level of the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail All,<br />
<br />
MOBs &quot;DO&quot; attack the weakest in the Party 1st!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Weakest being lowest in level or lowest in health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">level.  if a mob pops in the middle of a group, it goes for the lowest level or the sitting person first.  lower levels also have larger aggro ranges, and other side effects.  this is why I can walk from FV to LOIO unmolested by spiders, but someone that's level 10 will die die die die die (as I discovered the hard way, way back in the day :))  also, if someone is low on health (less than 30% i think) mobs start to flock to them to finish them off.  We had a pull go wrong in fear the other night and I had an amydgsomething knight on me and was oom.   chanter dead.  clerics dying.  lots of mobs all around.  my health slowly but surely dropped.  when it got to 30% other mobs started joining in to finish me off.  somehow, i survived for a good minute :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's true that, everything else being equal, MOBs will aggro on a lower-level PC. But they don't then mercilessly beat on that lower-level PC for the duration of the fight, regardless of how much other PCs try to take aggro away. With pets, however, they always attack the lowest-level pet in range.<br />
<br />
Try this: send in a Magician or Necromancer pet and have it beat down a MOB to 50% health. Now send it the wolf pet. The MOB will immediately turn to the wolf pet and attack it for the remainder of the fight. That doesn't happen with PCs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think part of it too is that Mage pets don't get as close to attack and mobs will attack the closest... try grouping with a necro, shrink his pet and grow yours.  Theoretically the necro pet would have to get closer than your pet to attack.  If it still hits the puppy, then it goes after the lowest, if it goes after the necro, its because mage pet attack range is messed up.<br />
<br />
Example, me with my earth pet as a mage...<br />
<br />
Me   --- Earth Pet ---- MOB<br />
<br />
Even rooted, when the mob should attack the closest enemy including pets it still hits me. Even with the pet between me and the mob, attacks me... Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Spraggon-Test, unfortunately pets cannot be shrunk to test that, but you might have a point regarding range. I suppose a much better test would be two pets of the same type, but of different levels (i.e., a Necromancer and a Shadow Knight pet from PCs of similar levels).<br />
<br />
MOBs always attack a PC that is within range over a pet, regardless of which is closer, so I don't think your example necessarily shows that Magician pet melee ranges are messed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I thought you could shrink others pets, I know I shrink mine.  I like having a spirit puppy...  (only in dungeons or allowed shrink places of course)<br />
<br />
Tho a point brought up to me is that size doesn't seem to affect attack radius, monk friend I duo with says he doesn't notice a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Pets can be shrunk, unless that was broken last patch :)<br />
<br />
I've shrunk many a Necro pet and the Mage ones are so cute when they're teeny :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah, I just remembered I have a screenshot somewhere of a shrunk undead froglok.  Mini frog with a human monk picking on it.<br />
<br />
Chanter Charmed, shaman shrunk, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Really? I must be doing something wrong, as I've tried both Shrink and Grow on my pet and a Magician pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think pet aggro may have something to do with the aggro the owner has created.  I wonder if you do not slow the mob and just send the pet in if our doggy will still get beat on.  I know that if someone pulls a mob and i send my pet the mob decides to come after me.  The only explanition i can think of is the players aggro is tied into the pet aggro.<br />
<br />
and yeah you can shrink pets, mini mage pets rock.</div></div><hr />

OK, here's what's really going on here fellas.  (FYI had a high level magician and most magicians understand this phenomenon quite well since they spend considerable amount of time learning to &quot;pet tank&quot; - more on this later)<br />
<br />
Pets do not hold aggro like a player does.  It's very hard for a pet to actually taunt a mob off of another pet.  Basically, in 99.9999% of sitiuations, the mob can be considered to have equal amounts of aggro for all pets currently attacking it.  <br />
<br />
When a mob has this &quot;equal aggro&quot; for the pets, there is a very predictible way to tell which pet is going to take the hits.  It's ALWAYS the pet CLOSEST to the mob - JUST LIKE A ROOTED mob behaves toward players.  So what you say?  Well, when you consider that the five pet types all have FIXED attack distances (not sure about shrink or grow) and that they differ from each other, you can see why one pet always takes all the hits.<br />
<br />
The order from shortest attack distance to longest distance from mob is:<br />
<br />
Enchanter, Shadowknight, Shaman, Necromancer, Magician.<br />
<br />
Pull mob (no tank), sick mage pet and necro pet - necro pet will take all the hits and die first.<br />
<br />
Pull mob (no tank), sick shadowknight pet and shaman pet - SK pet dies first.<br />
<br />
Etc....<br />
<br />
The only time taunting and aggro comes into play is when you send equal pets at a mob.  Two mage pets?  Whichever one taunts and hits the best is gonna take the hits.<br />
<br />
This makes sense to me and i believe it was intended.  If you were fighting 4 mobs - all attacking you roughly the same - wouldn't you kill the easiest one first to reduce your damage taken?  <br />
<br />
The toughest pets attack from way out, while the weakest pets attack at a much closer range - thus mobs always go after the weakest pet first (assuming no large aggro difference has occured)<br />
<br />
When using pets as tanks this can be very tricky to manage which pet takes the hits.<br />
<br />
- Drum Roll....  Pet tanking<br />
<br />
Pet tanking is a fairly difficult tactic to learn, but once mastered you can assure that dog dog will live to see another day while that hitpoint having mage pet can take the beating.<br />
<br />
Basically you park your pets - preferably have the mage pet (or your toughest pet) away from the other pets.  Go pull a mob.  Run back to camp.  Now pull the mob RIGHT OVER THE MAGE PET.  Stop running at just the right spot so your mob is standing ON the mage pet.  Then you have the mage /pet attack FIRST.  Then everyone else /pet attacks.  What happens is that the mage pet will attack the mob from the spot it was guarding.  All the other pets then engage from their normal attacking distance (which is farther away then what the mage pet is currently attacking from)  If the mob moves out of melee distance from your mage pet, the mage pet will move, and then rengage at his normal attack distance (which is far away)  Then dog dog dies.  But if you get that mob ON the mage pet and keep him there (by not aggroing him), the mage pet will NOT move, and all the other pets will be farther away - thus not taking any hits.<br />
<br />
Of course when doing this you have to be careful about not aggroing the mob sicne as soon as he moves to come after you, you'll have zero chance of getting that mage pet on top of the mob again.  <br />
<br />
It sounds difficult, but you'll find that after 4 or 5 pulls you'll figure it out.  It's really not that hard to do, and VERY few people actually do this.  I've personally duo'ed with a warrior using this tactic, and since the warrior had a clue, and watched his attack distance (careful not to move the mob) he NEVER TOOK A SINGLE HIT.  He'd just pull on top of the pet, make sure he was attacking the mob from as far away as possible, and he NEVER EVER hit the taunt button.  Then we'd let the mage pet's regen kick in (with some heals from his master) and then the warrior would go pull another - boom - group without a cleric :)<br />
<br />
The problem with this tactic however, is that it's nearly imposible to explain to somebody in-game (look how long this post is) so it's just easier to shout for a healer.  But tell your friends and most of all TRY IT OUT, and you'll see that i'm not full of BS :)<br />
<br />
Hope that expains the shaman pet taking all the damage phenomenon, and I hope this was clear as it's difficult to explain to somebody without diagrams and the such (if you're confused and really want to learn more, go do a search at the mage compendium on &quot;pet tanking&quot;)<br />
