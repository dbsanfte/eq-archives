<br />
We were trying them tonight and noticed an interesting problem.  Our slows were not overwriting beast slows.  Even after 4 of us slowed one of them the beasts could still cast their slow (which normally bounces off of anything with turgur's on it) over and over and over.  It wasn't on all of them, but for some of them, we were not able to overwrite. <br />
<br />
Both spells would stick, and we can only hope that the better was working, but I'm thinking that neither of them was actually better in this case.  My only thought on how both could stick is if they're coded to reduce any slow over a certain percent is simply cut off at that percent.  So... if they were coded to cut slows off at say... 60% both beast and shammy slow would stick as neither would be better than the other.  <br />
<br />
Have any of you noticed anything similar?  I didn't have my logs on but I'll talk to my guildies and see if I can get some of theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Slow Mitigation used to be hard capped for a few. However this changed long ago and I have no explanation for your observations. <br />
Unless, somebody was slacking and not slowing every mob. Could he(the Shaman or Beastlord) have mistargeted a Councilman considering they all have the same name?<br />
Or the Beastlord was slowing another mob than you 4(one that had been left unslowed)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">several of us /assisted a beastie, slowed it, and he and another beastlord said they could still cast their slow without getting a cannot take hold message.  It was further clarified they were talking about the one at 10%, which there was only one of<br />
<br />
<br />
They said that the highest % slow will always be at least somewhat better than the others, but they've lied to us many many times before</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do the pulling for our rathe, so they come in with shaman slows/cripples/sinia.  Maybe helping with the pulling (coh style) might be the remedy.  With just malos, slow should stick with no other debuffs on.  And if they are snared (dumb not to be), it's real easy to just run them around the edge debuffing them fully before bringing them to camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Getting them debuffed isn't the problem.  This was one of the mezzables that we had under control.  The chanter slipped up and it broke and the beasts jumped on slow to make sure it was done, and it was, and their slow was sticking too, and so was the slow of every shaman there.<br />
<br />
It was a very odd moment when they were yelling at us to assist them and get the good slow on, and we were yelling back that we had already several times over.  I really wish I knew why it happened, and the only reasons I can think of are some completely randomly bugged spawn, or that some of that have hardcoded slow mitigation caps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think they just stack, and the highest slow is used.  I bet you can test it easily- just have BL slow a mob, then you slow a mob, then have a chanter charm it and see what debuffs are on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They don't stack...usually. No idea what the issue is/was, Drinnar.</div></div><hr />
