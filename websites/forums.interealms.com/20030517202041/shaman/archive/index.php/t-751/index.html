<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Varga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm wonder if this PoM Quest is actually possible to fully complete, the quest items seem to rarely ever drop and I hear some servers only had like 3 of the items for certain classes?  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, it's not nowadays.  When PoM was first released things dropped a lot more commonly, and you might have been able to then.  Right now it probably takes months to complete 1 piece.</div></div><hr />

Been down to only needing 2 cards for my boots, got the doll and such...<br />
<br />
Cleared AiW 40+ times and got 0 Throne cards, killed white satillion and puppets alot... not any throne cards. The zone is beyond broken, and now not even puppets are up.<br />
<br />
also read VI fired PoM cure, so I dont think they will be fixing it anytime soon.<br />
<br />
The one throne card I did get was givin to me. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">at this point with drop rates, id say to get a full or near full set of PoM is just a rediculous time requirement. even if you lived in the zone it would take months on end. its really retarded. i think there are under 10 sets of full shenannigan serverwide. i was lucky enough to do pom last year before the big nerfs (i have 5 pieces). also helps being a class that could solo the throne mobs so i could do them whenever i saw em and not wait for other people to get there. was some pretty intense competition last summer on my server for the AiW mobs.</div></div><hr />
