<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The item links thread that is back on the front page reminded me of this and thought I'd share.<br />
<br />
You can get yourself a unique last name with a little ini editing also.<br />
<br />
My current name on tunare looks like this in game:<br />
&quot;Monjay &#1046;&quot; <br />
<br />
Using the same method described in the item-links thread, edit one of your hotkeys with the /surname command, then use the Character Map program (comes with windows) to select some untypeable characters to put in your last name.<br />
<br />
my hotkey simply looked like this:<br />
<br />
/surname &#1046;<br />
<br />
Since I petitioned to have my surname removed a long time ago I had no last name and just pressed my hotkey button to set my new one.<br />
<br />
If you do this, be prepared to get bombarded with tells about your new last name. I've had mine for nearly a year now and still get constant tells about it.<br />
<br />
have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">omg... has anybody tried setting their surename to an item link?<br />
<br />
I've never used a surname... but this is really tempting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, it's not like they can click on your name, so how would they know it was a link? Surnames don't show in a /who or in guild/raid windows...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can't seem to get the server to accept my surname hehe.<br />
<br />
Tried alot, like this for instance:<br />
<br />
&#356;&#342;&#937;&#321;&#330;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Question Monjay, what font page did you select your symbol from in character map, or should any of them work? Wingdings has some prety far out stuff. :) Also do you have to have to have the character fonts in game set for the same font as what the symbol came from to be able to see it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm guessing you would save as UTF-8, just like Gangaskan's instructions.<br />
<br />
For display fonts, you can never tell what the other people in the group or zone are using. Some special characters will be represented in most fonts, and some will only be in a few. Tool around in charmap to see if the ones you like are in multiple fonts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">server woulndt take any of a dozen attempts and I have plenty of experience at this, <br />
<br />
you should see my sigs with links in them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used the arial font (its the default, and i didnt change it)<br />
<br />
And obviously in my case I picked a surname of just one single greek character and it accepted it. Im not sure of what checks they have in place for surnames, but I only tried this once and it worked and i was happy with what i eneded up with, so i never tried any other combinations. <br />
<br />
It's also possible that they implemented something to block this now, it was a while back that i submitted mine. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You have to remember that GM's (maybe guides) get to approve surnames if they are on.<br />
<br />
So if you request a surname and get a grumpy GM it is not going to go through, if you wait until 3 in the morning you will probably have a better chance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Worked last night!<br />
<br />
Grim</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">GM nerfed my omega symbol today &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well I posted the solution to this a few days ago...apperantly my post was eaten!<br />
<br />
you can make crazy surnames sort of with this trick.<br />
<br />
<br />
follow the above advice.<br />
log in<br />
open the hotkey and<br />
after your crazy letter, add more <br />
my shaman is now <br />
Diabalein Ãvidyia.<br />
my chanter<br />
Iforgetwhat &#926;ightisfor.<br />
(edit) you can only make the FIRST letter a crazy one, and not all of them work.<br />
as for the GM who nerfed your surname.<br />
you cant get into trouble for modifying your .ini files...they TELL US TO MODIFY THEM!<br />
<br />
seriously ***.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tormidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A guildie of mine got nerfed by a GM so that he can no longer change his own surname without GM approval as a result of doing this...just a warning</div></div><hr />
