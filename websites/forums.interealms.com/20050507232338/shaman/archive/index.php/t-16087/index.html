You will no longer be able to bind there. When the zone goes live from legends next month it will be completely KoS so they eliminated binding now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did they change the zone in ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WHen they put it live on legends they just moved all people from being bound in PoM to being bound in GD (new zone in location).   I guess they just ASSUME we will all have read about this and change our bind points?   That is jacked :\   should offer us the ability to treat zone as normal till it changes, and move binds the same way they did for legends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm sure it was just an error they don't feel like fixing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's an unhuntable zone without bind ability.  Just ridiculous.<br />
What are you supposed to do if you die there and there's no cleric about?  <br />
Are you supposed to clear NToV every dam time you wish to hunt there?  <br />
<br />
Ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure, but the poster about 3 posts up, when mentioning where they move the bind points too (great divide), mentioned the new zone in location being there as well?<br />
<br />
I could be wrong, but thats what I got when I read his post.</div></div><hr />
