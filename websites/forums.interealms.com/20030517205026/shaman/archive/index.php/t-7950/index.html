<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">FINALLY got my RL partner's new toon (he got disgusted with the warr at level 60, go figure) up to 40 so we can group up for faster kills and (hopefully) faster leveling on his part.  (have you ever SEEN a level 1 mage pet with focus and celerity?  the level limit to buffs does NOT apply to pets, in case I'm the only one who didn't figure that out right away)  Now the question is, where to go?<br />
<br />
Planning an expedition to kedge, since everything seems to be 38 and up, and we both have eb items.  If I remember right, that's the best ZEM in the game, or it was, before luclin...<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, going to try the Grey.   Wondering if anybody had some good suggestions if those don't pan out - or even if they do, it's been surprisingly fun going places that the shm/warr couldn't do when they were level-appropriate (such as tofs 4th floor).  Sadly, Droga was just bleh exp, much as it would've been nice to get some exp with that faction, for once.<br />
<br />
Really not concerned about loot or exp for my shm until his mage is at LEAST planar (at which point PoG should be a hoot) - focusing strictly on the best exp for the mage at this point.  Hell, I'll even go back to FG if I have to /shudder -- but I'm guessing faster kills of even cons to him is worth more than slower kills of red cons.  Until he hits 50, of course.<br />
<br />
I'm also thinking that staying grouped is the best way to do this since it's easier to watch his and pet's health, and dogdog is lower level, but still outdamaging his pet by a good amount.  <br />
<br />
I could be wrong tho - often am, please advise.    :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sobriety</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Take the mage to echo caverns. The ones that lead to the deep. Set-up up top near the deep zone. Do not group but let the mage solo the buggs and Fungal Feinds. Watch the exp fly. If you want to group with the mage but do not want to suck up his exp, zone out to the deep just as fight is coming to an end. All the mobs in this zone are runners so you have to take this into account. I have not tried this place since PoP came out and the exp nerfes that went along with it but it used to be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The answer is .... City of Mists. Summon a fire pet. Give it weapons/armor. Have shaman pull stuff UNSLOWED. Sic fire pet. Throw Torpor on fire pet every once in a while. Rinse and repeat. <br />
<br />
I preffered temple camp when I did this. The great thing about CoM is nothing runs, so they keep banging on the awesome DS of the fire pet. ZEM is very good. Lots of MOBs. Good for PLing through 49. At 49, mage is too powerful for CoM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The other good thing about CoM is that it will all be green to you so you can stay grouped and he will get all the xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wish it worked that way, but I still take half (or more) of the exp when grouped on greens.<br />
<br />
Wanted to try echo, but it's packed every time we're on.  Won't have that problem with CoM, I daresay.  ;)  Thankya thankya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dankonia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kaesora is nice. Best ZEM outa 3. The undead dont run (mostly whats in dungeon). Best outa the 3 I listed for its level. (nice thing about kaesora is easy to get a good camp being hardly any ppl there).<br />
<br />
Droga is better then City of mist for exp imo, but not as good as kaesora. Second best for its levels imo. (another nice thing about droga is all the monsters you can wanna kill will be around).<br />
<br />
City of mist personally I found just so so, ZEM isnt as good from my experience. City of mist is also camped the most outa the 3 (I think because its the easiest for ppl of apropiate level to solo), Im almost sure it has the worse ZEM outa the 3.<br />
<br />
Cant say for sure on kedge, but  I went there to powerlevel a friend and the exp really just seems to be horrible, even city of mist seemed faster gain. (mobs are quite spread out in kedge overall compaired to other dungeons). I think its mainly due to on avg in other dungeons you will kill alot more stuff in any given period of time.<br />
<br />
Kaesora isnt that great past 44 stuff starts getting light blue.<br />
Droga stuff will start getting light blue at 46 (in deeper part).<br />
City of mist again 46 stuff will start getting blue at entrance but there are also harder things in city. Kedge basically only entrance gets light blue early rest should be exp into 50.<br />
<br />
I dont hunt velious really, or Luclin so there maybe better spots there (heard echo caverns was the place to exp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I LOVED kaesora way back when.  Mage being a DE, though, he won't set foot inside.  Prissy faction-conscious mages.  ;)<br />
<br />
Got him to 47 on ME toilers (he got a horse to help with low-level plus sitting aggro and suddenly working on baking sounds fun, heh), but the dr00d factor was just WAY too much.<br />
<br />
FG is 1 or 2% per kill for him, and we can kill em nonstop, but gads, that place is just unbelievably dull.  And it's not like we can pass the time cybering, we're in the same room.   <br />
<br />
Kedge... had a hard time with the casters in there.  Probably just a learning curve issue, but it's not a very forgiving zone.  Not sure if I want to learn that place too well without a cleric bot somewhere near to hand.<br />
<br />
I suppose once he hits 50 it'll be practical to take him to PoJ, PoN, PoD to duo?  We tried it at 46, but the kills take too long to be better than even-conning mobs for him, even at 2-3% a pop.</div></div><hr />
