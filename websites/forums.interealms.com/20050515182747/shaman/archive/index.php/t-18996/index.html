<br />
What I am seeing at this moment is a slap in the face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not worth the money so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The hp/mana-ratio isn't so much the issue in my opinion.<br />
<br />
It's just an annoyance and speaks volumes, how SoE views the shaman class actually. Would it really kill them to leave the hp/mana-ratio alone?<br />
<br />
I would much prefer a Canni with a larger chunk of lost hp and gained mana and a longer recast time. Personally at 65 i very rarely chain canni anymore. Just when i have time in fights or between i fire one or two Canni IV and let regen do it's thing. So a substantial increase in gained mana per cast (balanced with a reasonable recast time) would be an improvement. The time i loose today for the second cast, i could spent on more useful and fun things (maybe even *gasp* cast something for the group ...).<br />
<br />
Personal preference:<br />
- double hp loss (to keep things easy)<br />
- double mana gain<br />
- increase recast time (let's say something around factor 1.6 - 1.8).<br />
<br />
That would do following things:<br />
- reduce number of annoying click/click/click (if i wanted carpal tunnel, i would roll up a bard)<br />
- give shaman more time to contribute to group/raid<br />
- increase manaregen slightly (only when casted non-stop) to help counter higher mana costs with PoP.<br />
<br />
As i said i do not chain canni, so the raw hp/mana-ratio is a secondary point for me.<br />
<br />
Those 8 (not 10 :) ) more mana are 'a slap in the face'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think SOE is just playing around with the test server data files to throw the playerbase into convulsions every time a change is made. I swear, it's like they have a manic depressive running the spell/AA design team.<br />
<br />
At least I wish I believed that was true. What is more likely is that the dev team lacks a consistent vision with regard to the shaman class, and thus flipflops like crazy with regard to design decisions. It's not as if these changes are up very long, how can they possibly be getting adequate testing? (Not that I think Sony really tests anything, but theoretically that's what the beta is for.)<br />
<br />
And if they were going to drop a spell, it should have been that wretched disease DoT. After all the trouble they went to to make grouping &gt;&gt; soloing, you'd think they would STOP GIVING US SPELLS THAT ARE ONLY GOOD FOR SOLOING.<br />
<br />
The Canni &quot;upgrade&quot; sucks too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Zero improvements so far.  A sad excuse for a bard slow, the most inefficient canny yet, another useless disease dot, and some weird ward that regens an attribute that melee's have yet to be able to use up.   Endurance regen is worthless until they add some non-timered endurance based abilities.  I have not found my monk OOE on a single occasion so far.  Maybe the new Q will be available to buy in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't play anymore but isn't it time for canni to become passive LOL</div></div><hr />

      they should understand a group Q is not overpowered .Or even a superior version of Q. 3 year ago yeah , but now  ,how  even a heal over time which heal 2k in 48 secondes can be powerfull against mob who hit , at least for 800/1k.<br />

I hope you are kidding, because that is obviously an NPC ability.<br />

They have less than a month to change those spells and AA's and make them worthwhile. I am gonna bitch and moan till they get it done. If they don't get it right, they'll just not get my money(and probably quitea few more people).<br />
<br />
We have made plenty of suggestions and I am ****ing sick of waiting expansion after expansion to bring me back where I belong balance wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
make canni passive? could do not sure what necro would say, they best seems to be 50mana for 63 hp with ultra vison and stuff. mayb make acumen soming like 70 h 50 mana a tick and ultravision:) <br />
<br />
certain give us a interesting spell line up.. or group acumen , takes 150 hp gives 75 mana to whole group?<br />
<br />
dot sucks amazing give us new pet:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">They need to get a clue on disease DOTs. Now that I have Bane/Anathema, why would I ever use a silly disease DOT? And the Cannibilize needs to be a lot better. Double those values and it would look okay.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I have to agree, the shaman spell line up is ass.  <br />
<br />
A less efficient canna, a new 'heal' that does 60 more hp a TIC (do they not understand that we REALLY need a better single target heal?!?), a slow none of the shaman want, and a new disease DoT (ie slow as hell) that none of the shaman will use in a group--not exactly stellar work from Sony.  Not to mention no new nuke.  Give it 6 more months and rangers will out nuke us.<br />
<br />
The paladins are getting a new single target heal that's almost 1k.  I dunno about the rest of you, but I think it would be nice if we had at least ONE group heal (and to any sony developers reading this, that doesn't mean a heal for 30hp!--some useful amount).  With cast times, paladins are actually far better healers than shaman--and we're a fricking priest class.<br />
<br />
So . . . we can't heal, we can't nuke, at least 2 other classes slow as well as we do, and we get to DoT with low damage, high duration spells.  Tell me again why people will want to group with shaman?<br />

The worst part is they got so close to getting it right, but screwed up the numbers so damned badly.  That Cann is useless, the slow ... , well I will use it for the MR check in some zones, but a 7 tick duration makes me want to puke.  Lastly another DR dot, well they might as well have given us a find summoned spell or something to that effect as another long acting DR DoT is only good for soloing and only marginally then.  I don't have enough open spell gems to stack that many frigging DoTs.  I will not pre order this dung heap and the only way I'll buy the bloody thing is if it interfere's with my grouping.  I will wait till WoW comes out and I'll play a real game rather than invest in another SoE lacklustre moneysink.

I already am freaking out that our new warder is gonna cost 50AApoints, and only last this measly 300 seconds with a recast of like an hour.  That way we need to bot about 12 shaman for a raid in order to have a complete endurance chain.<br />

<br />
Personal opinion, <br />
<br />
disease dot : Haven't used one in 10 levels due to fast paced grouping and little soloing. <br />
<br />
Preslow : jury is still out but I'm already strapped for spell slots. Fitting an extra slow in is gonna be rough.<br />
<br />
New Quiesc : Has potential, however a 60 hp/tick difference is amazingly Blah.  as is 300 hp/tick hardly shows once you're in elementals. Either make it a group Hot or take regular quiesc mana/heal and multiply by 1.5 or more.<br />
<br />
The Ward. If they're smart enough to make it something we can use regularly like puppygun, it might be worth it. Hour long refreshes don't float my boat.<br />
<br />
The new Canni : If they make it less efficient for such a small mana difference, that would simply be stupid.<br />
<br />
And I still Wanna know what happened to enhanced rabidity</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">These are the same people that nerfed monks because they were Rampage tanking on raids, which pissed off the tank classes.  The very next week (PoP release) they put in spells that effectively turned Enchanter pets into the new rampage tanks (they had to nerf the spells once to keep them from being the main tanks too).  <br />
<br />
All the shaman additions so far look like bad last minute garbage.  Some intern or co-op was tasked to look at the existing spell line-up and add a couple of carbon copy &quot;upgrades.&quot;  I don't think anyone involved could have ever actually played a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">or certainly, none of them have played a high level shaman. <br />
 Give it 6 more months and rangers will out nuke us   With the new ranger AA &quot;explosive arrows&quot; or whatever it's called, activated by hotkey (and deactivated same way) arrows will take a bit of mana from the ranger and &quot;explode&quot; on contact causing &quot;devastating damage&quot; to the target. <br />
<br />
Sounds like they'll outnuke us in THIS expansion.  But . . it's not really nukes . . . right? <br />
<br />
I think the ONLY classes that doesn't outnuke us at this time are paladin (very very stingy on nukes), beastlords (Sony has kept their nukes JUST below shaman ones for appearances), and bards (but you can't really call what they do &quot;nuking&quot;.)  So that's it, three classes in all of EQ that can cast spells don't outnuke us.  Pretty fuggin sad. <br />
<br />
Oh, but we heal good . . right?  Let's recap:<br />
1) Cleric (undeniably the best healer)<br />
2) Druid (getting almost as good as a cleric)<br />
3) Paladin (excellent group heals, faster direct heals almost as powerful as shaman direct heals,  and passable heals over time  make them number 3 healers).  <br />
4) Shaman (we're number four! (are we still priests?)<br />
5) Rangers and Beastlords (effectively identical with Chloroblast and Regrowth)<br />
6) Bards<br />
<br />
Ok, it irks me that paladins undeniably are better healers, since they can also stun so well, Rez so well, tank so well, and melee so well.  All things that shamans can not do, and that are extremely important to gameplay in general.  All we got that is significant to groups these days is slow.  Everything else is better taken care of by another class.  And if we're not available, or people want to visit a rather difficult dungeon, it would be better for them to drop us and get an enchanter who can both slow AND mez.  <br />
<br />
We're starting to suck hind tit once again.  We've been fine for a while, but if these spells do not change, and set us apart from other classes once again, the shaman class will piddle off into being inconsequential.</div></div><hr />

1)  They arent going to give shaman a healing upgrade without giving druids one thats AT LEAST as good.<br />
<br />
2) Q should have been an improved Torpor, not just Torpor without the annoying side-effect.  350 hp per tick for the same amount of mana as Torpor is a small enough upgrade for it not to seem unbalancing, but large enough for me to accept.  And I like the sound of '350' better then '360'.  /shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>smaaltz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">When I initially viewed our AAs for the expansion I felt a little sick to my stomach.  I've been playing a mainly raid-shammy in this game for a good number of years now, and it's pretty sad when we seem to suck worse and worse with every new release.  This looks like the breaking point to me if it goes live like this. <br />
<br />
Seeing these new spells makes me feel a lot sick to my stomach.  A piddly ass -30 MR slow for a few ticks.  That will be fantastic for ldon normal adventures, yippy.  How about making this an AA with a refresh of about an hour..    with a -300 MR check or just unresistable..  and make it last 4-5 ticks?   That way if we have 5 or 6 shaman on a raid we can actually all make an impact on a tough encounter?  Naaaah just let us all summon our stamina-refreshing stationary wards..  that will be grrrrreat!<br />
<br />
Still no group heal.   The new canni sucks.   Nothing interesting on the nuke front... I don't need a massive increase in max damage.. but it would be nice to have a 1k nuke that didn't take half an hour to cast?  How about a few AAs to trim nuke-cast time down a few seconds?  How about a few AAs to make our rains -10PR, -20PR, -30PR checks?   Nahhhh let me spend a bunch of AA to give my crappy dog a rabid bite that will be resisted 90% of the time and do 20 damage a tick for 3 ticks when it actually lands. Thanks Mr. Sony!<br />
<br />
Also I want to send out my heartfelt thanks for the improved disease dot.  The entire game engine is built around the 6-players in a group paradigm, hell a whole recent expansion is devoted to that idea.  But thanks for the new 2+ minute dot... that will come in very handy mmmm NEVER.  Really..  you are too kind to us.<br />
<br />
Why do I play a shaman?  Do you actually think there's anything in this expansion to justify an old-school shaman buying it.. aside from devotion to one's guild etc?  I really think they need to take one of the good game designers from EQ2 and have them go to a couple meetings back in EQ1 land. Then have a couple of the EQ1 interns making these decisions and have them play a shaman in a raid with 3 other shamans for one night...  so they can see how poorly we stack.  Or maybe one of them could read our messageboard and steal 1 of the couple hundred original/fun/useful ideas posted here.  Naaaaaaaaaah give me more swarm pets!  More more more!   Swaaaaaaaaaaaarm pets yees!<br />
<br />
They need to sell a For-Shamans-Only G.O.D. box-set so they can at least provide the necessary lube.<br />

1)  We need a new heal...either in the form of a AA HoT or grp heal...upgrade to tnargs...upgrade to Q..something...our label as priests is slowly but surely a thing of the past...sure i can heal fine as main healer in a LDoN grp...but my spam heals on ele encounters pale in comparison to what others are able to do....I don't want to be a cleric...I don't even want to be as good as a healer as a druid...but throw us a bone and give us back our label of priest<br />
<br />
2) we need a friggin DD upgrade...giving us all these DoT upgrades are useless on anything besides soloing...because casting DoT's to be able to do anytype of DPS will get the mob on you fast.<br />

even in LDoN...our shortest DoT's never run to completion on any mob..and are a waste of mana<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">In general, I agree with the &quot;why buy GoD&quot; posts - and I think that applies to all classes (from what I've seen on other message boards.)  If I do buy it, it won't be for the spells and abilities I've seen mentioned, it will be for the new zones.<br />
<br />
That being said...<br />
Endurance regen is worthless until they add some non-timered endurance based abilities.  I have not found my monk OOE on a single occasion so far.  <br />
<br />
My main is a 65 warrior (46 AA's and able to reach 280 cap on meleee skills with buffs), and I like the idea of endurance regen boosts.  I rarely go OOE but that's not because I have unlimited endurance...it's because I limit the ability usage.  (note:  I have no idea how much endurance monk abilities use, so it may be completely different for them)<br />
<br />
In regular xp groups, if I make full use of the new abilities, I will run out of endurance.  Specifically, if I use Incite once per mob, then an offensive AA when it refreshes, I often won't have the endurance to use defensive/evasive for it's full duration.  If I also use Furious/Fortitude I have to be very careful.  <br />
<br />
If I'm on a raid, that's a different story.  The mobs are normally placed far enough apart (or someone else can MA for a bit while I regen endurance), so it's not a problem.<br />
<br />
Of course, the concept of an endurance regen spell goes against Sony's statements of last month when they said they didn't want to make warriors any more dependent on other classes so they weren't adding endurance boosting spells...but I'll leave that discussion for the steel warrior board.  :p</div></div><hr />

/sigh why, oh why is it always the same.  I have played EQ for 3 years now and our shammy class gets less with each expansion.  I mean really, Ldon .... *** was that ? sure I did / do adventures but ..... I have yet to see one spell other than pack shrew that doesnt suck.  <br />
<br />
Being a raid oriented shammy......  lets see what I get:  <br />
An awsome dot, ... oh resisted you say? well I'll just wait 3 mins  to try again, ohh look it landed, oh wait, the mob died after 2 ticks ...... wow that 200 hp was a great help<br />
<br />
Oh boy Time to heal, ill just use my group heal and ...... oh, nevermind I can chain tnargs ..... Oh the tank I was assigned to died? hmm well ....<br />
<br />
wow new canni??!?!?  oooh 8 more mana, maybe they can make it even 2 more mana so  i can minor heal myself!!!! that would rock so much.<br />
<br />
OMG .... 60% slow,   where do i sign up!?????!??!!??  with -30mr oh so uber, eat that bard, yes ... for the next 35 seconds i own all, oh wait, it was still resisted, I got summoned?   whats this pain?  Im dead??? but I slowed it..... well .... next time ill get it for sure.<br />
<br />
..... the list goes on.<br />
<br />
The state of the raid shaman is pitiful.  Slow nukes ..... 10 seconds for 925 dd ? um .......<br />
<br />
Low heals, why a druid can heal 2k+ in the same time I can do 1300 ...... <br />
<br />
Rabid bear ..... I wont touch that with a 50 foot pole. <br />
<br />
The day I was told &quot;we dont need a shammy for group, the BARD can slow&quot;  ..... that was the day I died.  My rez timer is running down, if I dont get help soon we as a class are going to rot away.  <br />

Makes me sick. I have never before complained about expansion stuff, but I cant stand it anymore.  I love my shaman but when I look around and see other classes doing my jobs better than me ....... <br />
<br />
Im done , im not going to bend over and take it.  no GoD for me, not unless its better than this.  If i want a better canni dont hand me a freaking mod rod, ill show ya where to stick that mod rod .....<br />
