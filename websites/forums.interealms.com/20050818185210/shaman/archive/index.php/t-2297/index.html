<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Rant ON<br />
Overpowerd now!!<br />
<br />
The new NPC casters are totaly to powerfull<br />
thay need to make them hit for less and have the same restrictions we do. for example i was in CC to day haveing some fun and i puld a shm orc now most of the time i can kill them pritty quick but the second i pull him he blinded me now that didnt bother me much, but when i could see agen he had 9 spells on me, Malise, insidious fever, tagar's insects, envenomed breath,<br />
root, disempower, tainted breath, sicken. and <br />
infectous cloud !!!!!!!!!<br />
I was like *** not only did he debuff me ferst but he stacked like every single dot we have on me. needless to say i died from about 1500 hp worht of dot's and he was still Dubble hitting me for 60 dmg :mad: <br />
<br />
Now i dont mind that there smarter i find it refreshing and more chalnging in fact i have wanted  this happen fo some time now but thay rilly need to scale down there mele dmg, and the thing that rilly pissed me off is the facted that he cast 10 spells on me that means thay can mem 10 spells or more or probably dont even need to mem spells at all so wall we are restriked to 8 spelll that we can cast ure NPC conter parts can cast every spell thay have any time thay want<br />
<br />
This needs to be fixed i cant even amagen what the higher lvl npc are doing (<br />
<br />
Rant off<br />
<br />
Ok i feel much better</div></div><hr />

Got the message about looking like myself soon, and then noticed I was rather taller than a bear - the Revenant we were fighting had burned me with Ignite Bones, and changed me to skelly form.  Another tried chain casting root on me.<br />
<br />
Will definately make things different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Amen to that ! <br />
<br />
I wish Verant would make up their mind about caster NPC's are they wizard or warrior...which is it ? <br />
<br />
<br />
No fun getting physically beat up by a naked mage with no pet ! <br />
<br />
I don't mind NPC casters being smarter but why is it that they are melee supremacists as well ?</div></div><hr />

at least they haven't done that yet :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As a SHM, this totally sucks as casters were bad enough.  Wizards especially.  I don't have 3000 hps to be chain nuked within 4 seconds a total of 2800 damage from force strike or whatever it was.<br />
<br />
I was able to cast root before I was dead. /gesture<br />
<br />
OS frogs are a good example of the warrior wiz.  Quading for 50+ and casting at same time - LOVE IT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">maybe they want us to /gasp, grp more! :)<br />
really, casting npc's used to be a joke compared to melee mobs.<br />
they might have overdone it abit tho  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I guess those of those with example have not been to the new CT. Lizards hitting for 220+ casting AE poison rains for 350x's 3 ....150+ poison resist L60 you are still taking full dmg each rain. This is pre patch.. don't see how they could get any smarter. But ya NPC's don't follow the same rules as PC just start /feedback /bug'ing and hopefully it will get tuned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Caster NPC's certainly don't follow the same rules as PC's. Nothing I like more than being punched by a naked Burynai Cleric or a tiny Brownie Scout for 80-90 of damage then being chain blasted for 200+. Never running out of mana or fizzling......smarter I don't mind. Ridiculously out of whack I do mind ! <br />
<br />
<br />
At least give them a weapon, armor, gear capable of doing that kind of damage when you fight them. Or give pure caster NPC's significantly less HP's.......how many necros in their 30's have 1000+ HP's unbuffed ? My SK didn't have that many until his late 30's. <br />
<br />
I don't mind grouping, but to be forced to group to kill a mob several levels below you because Verant decides to make the NPC caster a hybrid class not available in the game is absurd ! I like going toe to toe with this naked, unarmed Goblin Warrior/Monk/Mage hybrid with unlimited mana and hits like a Mack truck ! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I remember seeing a similar horror in Anarchy Online when they made the NPC spellcasters &quot;smarter&quot;. One would walk into a mission and be blinded by all the spell casting disco effects. You would see the three &quot;welcoming committe&quot; mobs all casting buffs on themselves all the time. When they walk past a door with a mob on the other side, they would buff each other. It was a deathtrap until they toned it down alot. Most players would simply leave the mission then waste their time in mission where 99% mobs were spellcasters.</div></div><hr />

I didn't think of /feedback last night but I definately will today. The changes are interesting but they definately need to tone down the melee.</div></div><hr />

The frog actually moved around outside of melee range and was chain casting you guys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Mobs in tov dont seem much worse.  A few glimmers cast moonfire, the blue drakes cast that 950 cleric DD a few times.  Still mostly weak nukes and roots.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lady Nev has cast AE tash in the past I'm pretty sure. I remember our melee complaining about it. Fortunately it's poison based, so we can cure it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The Monks are pretty vocal about this; but then, they've always hated good spell casting mobs.<br />
<br />
Some examples I've heard;<br />
<br />
Froggies in Seb are now casting Ice Comet<br />
<br />
HoT Wurms were casting Judgement (915pt Cleric Nuke), Rooting with Engorging Roots and Cascading Darkness (800damage snare dot).<br />
<br />
Kor Ghoul Wizards in LGuk are chain nuking for 400+ (used to do 200-300)<br />
<br />
ST mobs cast Solists Spear of Ice and Garrisons Superior Sundering<br />
<br />
<br />
The main issue seems to be the Green Aggro change (missed this one), where people are getting swarmed by greenies that were scowling, but didn't used to attack.  And the fact that Mobs are casting spells above their level, or very very rare ones, as well as having a HUGE mana pool and fighting like a melee.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sordar Spiritrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Jeez no kidding, getting nuked for 1067 by a krup wizard quite sucked. Also, when one mob can obliterate your enchanter (if not buffed properly) it kinda sucks. Kinda funny when they tried to chain immobilize me for almost a full minute /laugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">From the Verant mouthpiece:<br />
<br />
Developer's Corner: NPC casters (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000601.html)<br />
<br />
Obviously the recent change to the way NPCs choose their spells has been receiving some attention from players. I think it’s one of the best changes we’ve seen in a while (sure, I like the pet thing too  ).<br />
I just wanted to pop in and let you all know that the intent of these changes is to make things a little more… (I would normally use the word “realistic” here, but that usually causes me trouble…) internally consistent. Basically, the tuning stopped when the NPCs were picking spells that were similar to those that PCs pick.<br />
<br />
But the spell selections aren’t the only things we’re changing.<br />
<br />
For example, and I didn’t even know this happened, Enchanter NPCs used to get an automatic chance to hit with their spells, regardless of the resistances of their target. We took that ability away from them. Now if they want to have a better chance to land spells they are going to have to cast a Tash spell.<br />
<br />
The goal here is to make things fairer when it comes to NPC spell casters, and it applies to both sides.<br />
<br />
We hope to be examining other aspects of this whole fairness thing as time goes on.<br />

LoL  dat be a bunch or horse *****<br />

How about spells word da same way in all zones.... dat be internally consistant ( CoH, SoW, Levitate, Shrink, Grow).<br />
<br />
Mez like to set goals and work hard to acheive dem.  Kind of stinks when the target keeps moving.<br />
<br />
I can understand how monks would be pissed at this.  Casters are a pain in da back when FD splitting.<br />

<br />
The frog actually moved around outside of melee range and was chain casting you guys? <br />
<br />
The rogue in the group was rooted three times, and each time the frog ran down the hallway and started to nuke him.  When root broke, he ran away again, rooted him again, and then started it all over again.  He did the whole &quot;run down the hallway to nuke&quot; three times total in the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">&lt;b&gt;I like the changes&lt;/b&gt;.<br />
<br />
First of all, from the selfish Shaman perspectice, it makes our resist buffs desirable in a group.<br />
<br />
Second of all from my perspectice as a former denizen of Rallos Zek -- It's about time the bluebies started to view resists as important on non-uber encounters. I always thought it ridiculous that level 49 wizard frogs did NOT cast ice comet and that the shaman in Crystal Caverns didn't use all their great dots.<br />
<br />
Next time you go up against a shaman in CC, you'll think about buffing your MR, PR and DR.  It's cool that resists have come back into play on non-dragon encounters, but I tell ya what, Droga must be one mean mufu'ckin dungeon now. ;) It was mean before, it must be truly evil now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This is going to push people to go level off mobs that don't cast.<br />
<br />
Giving PC comparable casting skills to mobs that are already melee heavy is like giving me about 2K more hp, 200 more attack, and 50 points of AA.  I am damn happy I have kept my resists a priority and all I want from Verant now is 4 more frikkin spell slots to mem extra heal/cure spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I like the changes, I would like to see the casters melee damage output reduced though and I would LOVE to see NPC bards actually use bard songs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If they want 'internal consistency', then;<br />
<br />
NPC casters need mana pools. If they run out of mana, they run out of spells. Just like when melee NPCs run out of HP, this should result in the NPC running like a biz. Now, if they want to give the NPC caster higher mana to scale it with the idea of groups fighting them, that's fine. However, endlessly casting mobs aren't fun, they're annoying.<br />
<br />
NPC casters should hit like PC casters. Sorry, but lizard shamans who double-hit for 250 when I can barely single hit for 70 are kind of silly. Obviously, this doesn't apply to 'big mob' mobs, such as dragons or giants. However, a froglok wizard shouldn't be busting out some of that crazy Bruce Lee **** when he doesn't feel like popping off five Ice Comets in a row.<br />
<br />
NPC casters should only be able to use spells that are equal to or below their own level. This just seems obvious to me. Ssra shows that this never has been a concern.<br />
<br />
NPC casters should have to stick to the 'physics' of casting. No casting while running. Casting a spell takes time and mana. Now and again, you fizzle a spell. I've never seen 'Velkator the Sorcerer fizzles' much less 'an Icepaw Kobold fizzles.'<br />
<br />
NPC casters should be limited in the amount of spells they can memorize. I recognize that NPCs don't all have 'sit' animations, but when aggro or engaged in combat, they shouldn't have the ability to just sit down and start memming up new spells. And the memming of these spells should be as long as it takes us. A level 30 lizard should take forever and a day to mem up his latest nukes or buffs.<br />
<br />
Make it a challenge, Verant, but don't make it ridiculous. Alan just said that you wanted 'internal consistency'. There you go. Be consistant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wouldnt it be gross to see crit hits from a mob? let alone using the auto crit disc on you..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">There are a few MAJOR flaws to this retuning of NPC casters.<br />
<br />
The first major flaw is that the NPC's are not constrained by the same false limits that we are as players. A caster that starts casting on you will continue to cast that spell and can hit you no matter where you go. They don't get the &quot;you cant see your target from here&quot; bullstuff that we get, sometimes even when mobs are standing right in front of you even. They have AE spells that are not limited in number of players they can hit (look at tigirs insects being cast by a player versus tigirs being cast by a mob. The mobs is PB. Look at caster NPC's that use rain spells. If you have 30 people in the area of effect, all 30 people get all waves of the rain. If you are a player, then you get like a maximum 4 hits if more than one mob there, or 3 waves if only one mob there. If there are 4 mobs there, each takes only a single wave. More than 4 mobs? That means some of them will be unaffected.  Either our restrictions need to be removed, or they need to be enforced upon the mobs as well. <br />
<br />
The second major flaw is that it is significantly more difficult to interrupt the casting of an NPC than it is a PC. We can be interrupted just as easily from normal melee as anything else. An npc typically will not be interrupted by melee, only by special attacks, stuns, bashes, kicks from right people, etc. Some NPC mobs cannot be interrupted at all in even these manners. <br />
<br />
Third major flaw is that NPC casters typically have nearly as many HP as melee mobs of their same type, and can dish out as much melee damage as the melee mobs of their same type. The mobs should have their melee reduced for the caster versions, and their HP reduced as well. <br />
<br />
Fourth major flaw is that the game was balanced based on the way that caster npc's USED to behave. The HP that players have, the gear that exists, the skills that are around, the spells that are in existence...these are all balanced and based on the way that mobs used to behave, including the caster mobs. <br />
<br />
Fifth major flaw that I can see is that from what others are posting, mobs are spending a lot more time dispelling people as well. I can tell you that from my point of view that means me having to rebuff people more and more over and over again during the course of a night, even more than before. That is a Bad Thing (tm) and will certainly not add any fun to the evening. Having to rebuff constantly from this sort of thing ( if the reports are true) will mean that there will be a whole lot of sucking going on for normal exp groups. <br />
<br />
Finally, the biggest flaw that I can see is that Verant is trying their damndest to force us back towards the &quot;holy trinity&quot; version of having the perfect group. If you are in a caster heavy dungeon, you are going to HAVE to have a cleric and a enchanter / bard to cope with these new changes to caster mobs. They are probably not even thinking about this sort of consequence though. I have had lots of fun with unconventional groups before. Two shamans, a warrior, 2 rogues, and a monk going through Dragon Necropolis. Juggernaut groups with no cleric or enchanter. Root parking was a viable alternative to mezzing mobs, and gave other class types such as shaman and druid a way that they could fill in if an enchanter wasn't around, or maybe even that is their normal job because they have regular groups that don't include enchanters. But now, if you go to a dungeon for high end folks, you really lose alot of these options. Get 3 wizard mobs in camp? used to be able to root park them and not have to worry a whole lot about them killing someone before you even know it is happening. Now? 3 wizard mobs around the camp could feasibly drop some chained ice comets or worse on a person and kill them. To keep up with the healing you almost will assuredly need a cleric. Or to keep the damage down, you will almost assuredly need a enchanter to mez any casters. I personally think that ANY change that forces people to make the choice of having to go the route of the holy trinity group (warrior, enchanter, cleric for those that dont remember hehe) or to go to gimp spots like maidens eye is a horrible change. And in the past verant has basically said that they want to get more people into the dungeons....this certainly wont do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Very well said Aktunka! It would be interesting to see what that silly man Alan would say to this :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Xequecal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">NPC casters still have, and have always had, a limited mana pool. In fact, they have less mana than players. It only SEEMS like they have more because they can burn their entire mana bar away in one fight, while players generally don't do that. If NPC casters had unlimited mana, then how do you explain the commonly used tactic of mana sieveing MOBs to keep them from Gating or CHealing working?<br />
<br />
The only &quot;unfair&quot; aspect of the mana pools of MOBs is that they regenerate to full mana INSTANTLY if their hate list is cleared. You used to be able to easily demonstrate this with the lizzie clerics in CT before the upgrade. After casting a lot of nukes, the lizzies would stop casting and start meleeing. If you memblurred them at this point, they would immediately start casting again after reaggroing the group.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the entire reason NPC casters were so hard to interrupt was BECAUSE they were casting lower level spells. Try it sometime. If you're level 60, try this: Let a MOB beat on you, then cast a level 20 spell. You'll channel it almost every time. Lower level spells get channeling bonuses as the player goes up in level. Ask a high level Druid when the last time was that their Snare got interrupted. It almost never happens unless the druid got stunned. Sure, some MOBs, generally raid level MOBs, have huge channeling bonuses to make up for the fact that there will be fifty players attacking them at once. However, krup wizards in Sebillis are not part of this group. You should be able to easily interrupt a krup wizard from casting Ice Comet just by meleeing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">It isnt the mob that the group is beating on that  concerns me the most, it is the other mobs that are there that force me to bring a group consisting of a mezzer and a cleric. Get into a caster heavy area and you have trouble. I know that doing different camps in sebilis I have been able to root mez a bad pull before and save the group by getting them aggroed on me and rooted out of the way with poor mans mez. This becomes not viable as a tactic with mobs casting these sorts of spells. I think what someone said higher up is probably correct. These spells that players cast were never intended to be used by mobs against players except in special encounters. Having every general mob casting like that is detrimental to the game overall. Remember way back when? In pvp, casters owned hard in the early days since their spells did full damage. This is why for PVP purposes the spells damage was halved (or whatever it was...i know it was ssignificantly reduced). The game was built around PvE and was balanced with PvE in mind. What this has been a case of is verant changing too much too fast. Here they are working on balancing classes based on what the mobs behavior used to be like, and now they change mobs behavior so dramatically? <br />
<br />
Think about stuff that isnt even raid level encounters. Lets say you are in sebilis fighting in the shrooms. you get one of the priest mobs that cannot be stunned or whatever. Having one of those used to suck enough as it was. Add into the fact that now he not only can CH himself, but he is going to be nuking you for around 1k damage as well. And there is nothing you can do to stop him unless you bring the holy trinity to the group with you. Again, that is my biggest problem with this. I think overall it sucks, but add into that that I have to bring a mezzer, no matter HOW good I am, and it ticks me off =/</div></div><hr />

Can you name 1 focus effect that gives you even remotely as huge a jump in power as that ALL caster NPC just received?<br />
<br />
At first when I read the patch message I thought it sounded cool because some of those NPC casters certainly werent too clever but after having experienced how extremely much more annoying casters are in a dungeon like Sebilis its pretty clear to me that VI again messed up completely.<br />
<br />
The way it is now is not acceptable and it will only make people leave certain dungeons because risk vs reward is totally screwed.<br />
<br />
Spells are made primarily for PC use against NPCs and the NPCs amount of hitpoints have been assigned with those spells in mind. When you let NPCs use them against PCs its a disaster. And the fact that NPCs ignore all the limitations that PCs have to live with makes it even more a disaster.<br />
<br />

Firstly, a bug report: some npc casters are casting spells above their levels (blue to 60 casters casting level 60 spells for example). Please look into this.<br />
<br />
Secondly, please recall that most damaging spells are balanced with a player harming an npc with npc level hps in mind. An npc casting these spells on a player is doing damage that is a much larger percentage of the target's hps than when a player is casting on an npc. There is a reason that spells are &quot;nerfed&quot; in pvp combat. Please consider reducing the damage that npc spells do to players in a manner similar to the way they are balanced in pvp.<br />
<br />
Third, the price that players pay for being able to cast spells is in hitpoints, armor class, lack of melee ability, and a limited mana pool. While npc casters have a somewhat limited manapool, most don't seem to have any of the other disadvantages that pcs pay to be casters, thus making them essentially warriors who cast. I would ask that you consider scaling down the hitpoints or melee ability of casting mobs, as an npc who can cast for 1200dmg and hits for 250 just like the non-casting warrior npcs in the same dungeon, is over-powered.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, that’s a ‘sort-of-a-bug’ thing… Because NPCs were so stupid about casting spells before, some of them were given improved spell casting abilities to make them relatively better casters. Some of those casters might be too good now, and the team will be looking at those on a case-by-case basis.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, though, that NPCs can be weak or strong for their ‘level’, and special NPCs can certainly be tougher or weaker than their /con might indicate. Having some of them cast higher level spells is just another tool, just like giving them procs or breath weapons or other innate abilities.<br />
<br />
We’re not forgetting any of those things: we know NPCs have relatively more hit points than PCs, we know they do more damage… we know that stuff.<br />
<br />
You have to keep in mind that these NPCs, though smarter, still don’t have the advantages of being played by human beings. The players get to pick the odds for the most part, they get to pick the timing of the fight and they get to choose from a wide arsenal of classes, spells, items, abilities etc. And a human can put all that stuff together in ways that even our AI code can’t (though I’d love to see NPCs splitting PC spawns.  ).<br />
<br />
That’s the price that NPCs pay, and it’s a pretty big one.<br />
<br />
But we’re keeping our eyes on it, playing against these nifty NPCs ourselves and all that. We’ll make further changes as needed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I can only assume that every one of these people yapping about how this is such a great change must be one of these people that always walks around with a cleric and enchanter to hold their hand and keep them safe. This change makes it a neccessity to have a real mezzer with your group if you are pulling mobs in places with lots of casters. Or, forces you to have monks pull to split things into single pulls if you have an unconventional group not including the holy trinity. <br />
<br />
For those talking about how &quot;good&quot; of a change this is, lets talk about facts.<br />
<br />
The game was formed around the idea of PvE and the HP level, spell effects, etc were tuned around the way that NPC's used to behave. We have much fewer HP than mobs of similar levels as part of this. Am i correct here?<br />
<br />
Second, all of the spells in the spell book are not designed at all for use on player characters, except for in some cases on special encounters. This was stated back when verant was doing their balancing for PvP. PvP spell damage was cut in half because of this issue. Do you people not remember that? Or maybe you are just graduates of Velks University and have no clue of what happened in the past? It was found that people being able to whack players for full damage of the higher level spells was unbalanced and that is why they cut the damage way down in PvP. If the changes to the spells for NPC's remain live, I fully expect that verant will remove the damage reduction for PvP, and if they don't they should. <br />
<br />
Third, Verant wants people to go to these less used places like many of the dungeons around. This change is NOT going to help make that a reality and is going to discourage people even more from goin there. And for the average group, it will mean that you wont ever find them there without a enchanter and cleric. I mean seriously...have the people saying this is good ever fought in a dungeon in the first place? If you have, have you ever done it without an enchanter/bard to mezz mobs for you&gt;? If yes, then since you know what root-mezzing mobs is, tell me how effective of a strategy that is with casters in dungeons now. <br />
<br />
Fourth, from all accounts, mobs are dispell crazy now. Have unmezzed mobs dispelling your group. Welcome in the fun! Casting buffs all day in your EXP group now too woohoo! No longer is needing to rebuff the dispelled / dead every 5 minutes a task reserved for the raiding shaman / cleric! Now you can get to do it in your exp group at every turn of the corner as well! Shaman rejoice for this great addition to your gameplay!<br />
<br />
On the surface yes it sounds like mobs being able to use all spells up to their level would be a smart change. However, when you look at it in depth, you can easily see why it is the wrong change to make. Characters were balanced based on the way they used to act. People dont have as many hp as these mobs, and that is why spells such as ice comet or whatever were never designed with the idea of them being cast on players. It is crazy, and in its current form it forces people to go back to needing specific classes to accomplish anything, and forcing that on people is a bad thing. Can anyone argue that forcing the need for mezzers in group is a good thing? I mean come on...seriously...anyone think that is a good thing?</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you need to take refresher course 101? :p<br />
<br />
Spell dmg was reduced to 66% that of NPC targets... however debuffs were made more effective.</div></div><hr />

I do love this part, it made me giggle. XP mobs being compared to raid level critters? Okay...<br />
<br />
I tend to duo when I play EQ. This change has hampered that. I cannot sufficiently heal myself and that of my playing partner when we're being chain nuked by a mob that then is going to CH itself. Not because my resists suck but because NPC spells do not check the same way that PC spells do. When I can't resist Tainted Breath with PR over 200 something is very, very wrong. <br />
<br />
Which means we're going to be fighting only those things that don't cast. I can handle being top of the hate list and being hit for 180, I don't have the HP to be hit for 180 and nuked for 1800.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">This is total BS !<br />
NPC's were given HP's and melee ability to counter balance spells used by PC's. That made sense, it made sense to give a caster good melee skills, HP's, but limited spell use. That balanced PC's and NPC's. After thinking about it I understood why caster NPC's were given the HP's and Melee skills they have.<br />
Making them smarter (as they put it) made things a bit unbalanced. Warrior/Wizard hybrid frogs in Seb meleeing for 100+ and casting Ice Comet is ridiculous. How many 60 Wizards can melee for 100+ and have 6000 HP's ? How many Warriors can cast Ice Comet ? <br />
This is BS ! <br />
<br />
If they are going to make things this way I want to change my main from a Iksar Shaman to a Shissar Shaman/Warrior hybrid or a Froglok Krup Wizard. <br />

<br />
When Verant said spell rates drops were increasing, I did not realize the mobs got first crack at them.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I dont mind a moderate or even a sizeable increase in their abilities terribly but please correspondingly scale back their hp's, melee rates and make them interruptable.  3 melees pounding on a Krug Wizard should be able to interrupt it.  And alot more items with resists should start pouring into the game.  Instead of retroactively giving focus abilities, give us credible resists if everything is going to cast this hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Reducing their hps, etc would be entirely too difficult to balance becuase it would make it easy for PC casters to one or two-shot blues.  Better to undo the whole damn thing.  I agree that things were getting a little too easy in some places, but the answer is NOT to make things 50x harder in some of those places and leave others untouched.  <br />
<br />
I have no problem with this in level 60 zones.  This does not really affect me at all.  <br />
<br />
But caster mobs are simply massacring level-appropriate players in many xp zones.  Sebilis is a killing field for non-twinked low-50's characters.  Couple Krup wizzies chain-casting Ice Comet and you're done.  Lower Guk is an absolute slaughterhouse for the average mid-40s xp group.  Most caster-heavy xp dungeons were at or below the critical population mass for effective pick-up grouping already.  Now they will all drop below that.  That will make CRs, much less getting a res, pretty much impossible for the average player there. <br />
<br />
As usual, anyone who explores or deviates from the EverCamp Vision will be brutally punished with xp and time loss until they learn that Verant wants you to safely process mobs in Dreadlands.  This is not a surprise for a game whose leading developers come out and say that it is a &quot;great challenge&quot; and an &quot;accomplishment&quot; they are &quot;proud of&quot; when they sit in the same spot and slaughter the same hapless mobs over and over again for weeks on end to get a rare drop (SEE: Hartsman on spell drops). <br />
<br />
Verant might as well delete every single non-raid zone in the game and replace them with 20 copies each of the Oasis-LoIO-Dreadlands-Karnors-Velks-FG moron cycle.  The risk/reward ratio in those places was already outrageously better there than anywhere else.  Now, going anywhere else is pure masochism.<br />
<br />
It also has far-reaching class-and-race balance effects, that I am sure Verant carefully weighed during their extensive testing of this change.  Enchanters and Clerics have just become VASTLY more powerful in xp groups.  Did Verant really sit down and think, &quot;gee, enchanters and clerics are getting left out of Sebilis xp groups too much, lets triple their power overnight?&quot;  Necro, bards, and Paladins have been bumped up as well.  Also a pretty big bump for large-race warriors vs their small-race counterparts because of slam.  I would expect to see a lot of small race warriors being forced to switch to 1handers and shields to get some interrupts in in these places...oh, wait...they'll never go to them.<br />
<br />
All in all, typical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Yeah I pretty much agree with Uggok and others that say this is change that will continue to push people into the outdoor zones and away from dungeons with casters.<br />
<br />
Think about places like Sebilis.  We all agree that 51 is the level for shaman to try to go there eh?  New turgurs and heal, on your way young shaman.   The uber froglok kor wizard is pulled up the zone-in ramp by people sitting around LFG.  Newbie shaman begins to cast turgurs insects!  A froglok kor wizard yawns.  Boom!  Wizard drops 2 ice comets and baby shaman is dead.<br />
<br />
For many of us on this board, we are already 60, level gives us advantage.  Many of us have the advantage of good gear with high hitpoints and resists built in.   You don't have these things when you are fighting in Guk or just getting to Seb level.  <br />
<br />
This isn't even taking into consideration that NPCs get a bonus to land against us.  I can't land turgurs on a level 60 person with over like 50MR.   These mobs can slow people with 150MR.   <br />
<br />

Because of this I primarily solo, this type of &quot;NPC casting enhancement&quot; severely limits where I can hunt now. To me this wasn't anything but caster im-balance because NPC's didn't follow the same restrictions as PC's already. Such as casting while running, unlimited mana, unlimited spell range, casting thru walls.......now give them more spell power. Gimme a break, Verant ! You're ruining the game with this nonsense ! It seriously hurts the casual solo player such as myself as well...who may not have time to logon and look for a group. <br />

Seriously, this is silly.  The whole argument for the NPCs not following PC caster rules was they were drooling morons.  Now thier actually casting appropriate spells and still have rediculously powerful melee abilities and HPs.  Great, thats &quot;internally consistant&quot; allright.<br />
<br />
I love the idea of smarter casters, heck, better AI in general is a good thing for the game.  But better AI with rediculously biased rules is just a big game breaker. <br />
<br />
As for NPCs breaking spawns, if THAT crock of *%&amp;*$ ever happens I'll find Alan and make him regret it.  Is an Atomic Wedgie sufficent?  Hell it was bad enough having my corpse camped in ME outside of Akheva by Xi and his cronies late Thurday night.  Without having a gutsy Rogue along I'd never gotten it back.<br />

     Yeah in PvP...but it's not pvp now isn't it ? Casting a  1120 nuke in 7 second is worst than 5 double at 200 ? In seb yes because these melee are weak.And because we can slow their melee.<br />

There is a huge difference between a level 60 with very good gear with resists and a level 50+ that is trying to level up.<br />
<br />
If you are in a big guild with mostly level 60s where you can always get a 96 % res when you die this change might not be so bad. But if you are in a small guild with most people from 50 - 60 without very good gear then this change sucks bigtime.<br />

This change more than any other change before it widens the gap between the haves and the have-nots.<br />

'Lets make this change, it will be really cool if caster mobs start using spells that make sense.  Ok, sounds good, lets put it live and test it.'<br />
<br />
Its a great idea, unfortunately it doesn't work with the way the game is balanced and VI obviously didn't bother to test it internally.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we’re keeping our eyes on it, playing against these nifty NPCs ourselves and all that. We’ll make further changes as needed. &quot; - Alan<br />
<br />
Shouldn't this have been done on test... As far as I can tell, just like focus items it was on test for two or three days before it was patched.  (I noticed focus items two days before they patched live)<br />
<br />
Anyone who posts saying we should revert mobs to orc pawns is just trying to start a flame going.  Drop the sarcasm, kk thx.  :mad: <br />
<br />
Its not that hard to figure out a 49th NPC wizard vs a 49th PC wizard will rock him every time because the PC will not resist, is likely to fizzle, and be dead in one nuke where the NPC can probably take 2 or 3 of them.  Its pretty simple math, saying otherwise is just assanine.  <br />
<br />
When was the last time anyone landed a spell on a mob more than 6 levels higher?  Think it was a couple of years ago Necro's could with lifetaps...<br />
<br />
Sure having an uber mob use more efficient spells in an encounter where he's being ganked by 20+ PCs makes sense.  This doesn't in normal grind situtations.<br />
<br />
A side note:  I do like seeing the mobs being smarter, shaman mobs rooting from a distance, maloxxx my monk partner then start to slow/nuke before its dead is kinda fun.  <br />
<br />
But I won't go anywhere there is a wizard, whats the point, you're just going to die anyway unless you have a group an the odds are 6 to 1.<br />

I guess it is in the Test communities favor however that it went Live for testing, at least it will be toned down sooner. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Salach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I think we should be discussing the whys of the change more than the results.<br />
<br />
Why would the design engineers change these creatures?  <br />
<br />
For me there is only one reality for game designers to change things in Everquest (which is unfair in many ways),  and that is to increase or keep subscribers high.  That is why they design the game in the first place - to make money.   I guess that their thinking is that people were becoming bored and that these changes would renew that diminishing interest in the game. <br />
<br />
For me this is the last straw.  Already growing bored and frustrated more and more with playing I believe this will actually cause me to cancel my account versus me keeping it to play that few hours that i do now on the weekends.   I was going to wait till Plains of Power came out to make that descision but with this there is no need.  With the possible level limit increase I would not play anymore.  I cannot go through another experience grind anymore - I just do not hold the fascination or patience in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
So - I am not quiting because I am set in my ways and cannot change my strategies.  When the game fails to provide you with entertainment and make you happy while playing it is just time to quit.<br />
<br />
I just wish that I had delved into more of the end-game experience and had the chance to finish my spell book.<br />

<br />
Young Shardwurms nuking for 925 is insanely wrong.  A lvl 35 mob simply should not have the same power as a lvl 54 PC.  Good lord . . . this has got to be the worst **** up Verant has made in the last two years or more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Basically my partner monk and I tried out Sol B last night.  Sure its doable, and we have about triple the downtime.  Everytime we pull a shaman its not a matter of if we can kill it, but how fast.  Now with it sticking dots/malisement/rooting/cancel magic like a madman, I have to rebuff after every fight, or we have to wait for it to wear off.<br />
<br />
Rebuffing after every fight, ooh, thats fun.<br />
Waiting for spells to wear off your tank, again, soo fun.<br />
Having to use more mana each fight to burn down those shaman faster, thus more time to get mana back, inefficientcy is soo fun too. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Basically I did a /feedback last night.  I would recommend if you don't like the change, and you haven't done so already, to /feedback also.  Make sure you are clear in what you are talking about and also that you are unhappy/disappointed/pissed off at the change.<br />
<br />
So people say, 'come up with a new strategy', I have its called outdoor zones.<br />
<br />
Others say, 'good time to work on resist gear', well if the mobs played by the same rules resist gear would help.  However we know that they don't and that even with high resists they get spells off much more regularly than PCs do.<br />
<br />
The idea is good, messing up game balance is bad.  I think the place for this change is high end mobs, not everyday grind zones.<br />
<br />
I'll be hunting outdoors from now on, unless they fix the balance issue.  Unless I HAVE to camp something in a dungeon zone for a quest.<br />

Insta-death... the ultimate game balance.<br />

Oh, and I had my first &quot;New caster NPC&quot; death last night- even with my magic resist close to 100 I got torn apart by a dark blue add I could have easily handled before.  &quot;/auc Paying 100 pp for a 49+ res&quot;.  :(  Later I was in Great Divide, but instead of having some fun whacking shardwurms while waiting for friends- I cowered in a corner and hid.  925 nukes from the (super green) Young Shardwurms?  Heh- two of those and I'm dead!<br />
<br />
Solo'ing (I guess I should clarify and say &quot;non-uber solo'ing&quot;) just got a lot less fun.  <br />
<br />
Maybe they ought to make a CEM - Caster Experience Modifier, an extra 20% experience if they're a caster, another extra 10% if they have spells above their level, another 10% if have AA skills (manaburn, etc.), another 10% if they have ancient or super-rare spells.  Of course, even with a 50% experience bump, I still wouldn't want to touch these mobs!!!  Downtime is not fun, and these new changes are all about increasing downtime.<br />
<br />
Until this is changed, the increase in downtime and risk (for absolutely no gain over equivalent warrior mobs) basically makes caster mobs off limits to me.<br />
<br />
So far this whole caster balance thing has meant a 10-15% increase in my power (estimated) at the cost of stats while caster mobs get a 100%+ increase in power.  I honestly was better off before the balance thing happened at all.  This is VI's answer to melee damage output tripling and absorbtion doubling over the past three expansions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Ok i dont understand something. Sure i agree with the idea of the smarter caster. But didnt verant admit they screwed up melee balancing by maybe too much to fast or something along those line? So now they are taking their time with caster balancing to make it &quot;right&quot; ...Yet the throw all this focus stuff out and had some of it wrong the first patch and maybe even now. At the same time they put the smarter caster stuff  all into effect at the same time???<br />
<br />
  Was there any testing on the new smarter npc caster or was this just something they were so giddy about they had to just surprise us with it? Thats what i dont get they say they are taking their times about some things than other stuff they just seem to throw out there and alot of times with mistakes. <br />
<br />
     Than whats with the cop out of (paraprhasing here) mobs getting higher lvl spells than their's as a tool like a proc or breath weapon etc....what special proc/breathweapon should a lower 20's lvl recluse have in Men seru? Was under lvl 24 healer so figured have same spells as my lvl 21 cleric at most than he starts nuking me for 2x the damage my cleric can nuke and healing better.*** is it that my lvl 19 heal is cel remedy which is heal over time or i can go with heal which does what 80-90 hps?His heal was doing instant type healing and he was meleeing like the warriors. I point this out for those of you high lvl with your reisist gear who think this is no big deal and people who dont like the change are whining. Your first char had a full set of resist gear at lvl 22-24 range? My wife was playing her shammy we had one of these uber lvl 22-23 healers and a regular recluse and he nuked the hell out of us and sent us running. (btw we had our resist buffs on too and i had a little bit of reisist gear and not one partial nuke or resist from HIS spells but he resisted ours) thank god we were somewhat twinked or we both would of been dead. <br />
<br />
   Anyway it ticks me off they didnt test it at all and just threw it out there AGAIN. Why should i bother with these mobs when i can just go fight melee mobs? Why should an actual newer player bother with the other zones and learn and explore if he is just going to die to some &quot;i have spells above my lvl&quot; casters. Its one thing to know in an exp situation that you are facing lvl 20-24ish cleric /wizard type mob. If i dont play that class will make me learn what they cast and how to deal with it but if this mob is casting from lvls higher than them and i am not a twinked/resist gear uber lvl 20something whats the point of even leaving lake of ill omen? <br />
<br />
Anyway like i said i like the idea of smarter npc casters , but why throw it out there with no testing and no tweaking the abilities they already had? We testing this stuff?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, one thing I've always disliked is the way the game forces you to have so much downtime while forming groups, and I do believe that's same with many folks (or how you explain people running through so popular LOIO/OT/DL/KC/Velks pickup zones where groups dont require this and that to be operation). Minimal down time. This is huge step back. Either do mobs that don't cast or get that cleric. Get that ench. Get this get that, instead of playing wait and wait till you have what it takes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Katnyp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Originally posted by Xequecal <br />
NPC casters still have, and have always had, a limited mana pool. In fact, they have less mana than players.<br />
<br />
This may be true of uber encounters, but I beg to differ when it comes to run-of-the-mill players and mobs (read: the rest of us). I had a run-in with a Shaman frog in Trak Teeth that /conned blue to a 43 warrior. During the long pull and unsuing battle, the froglok shaman cast:<br />
<br />
- Togor's Insects 4 x 125mana<br />
- Envenomed Breath 4 x 100mana<br />
- Winter's Roar 6x 150 mana<br />
<br />
Thats 1900 mana used before I killed it. It was casting and meleeing until it turned to run from low HP. How many low 40's Shaman are out there with 1900mana? It seems to me that this is a huge mana pool when compared to a non-uber shaman.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, the developers have taken mobs who have more hp than our tanks, who dish out more dps than an everage melee, who seemingly have huge mana pools, who have much larger casting ranges, and now gave them the ability to pick their best spells and cast them at a burnout pace. Where is the balance here? These mobs are now a master of all trades. A PC would have to sacrifice mana to go for more hp. Why shouldn't the NPCs be balanced accordingly?<br />
<br />
Take for example a full group crawling through a dungeon. The group clears the spawns and stops to rest a few minutes each time before moving on. However, the PC casters never reach FM and the melees are rarely full HP. PC casters try to match their mana usage with their mana regen and the pull rate, so they don't go OOM. Now, each new mob the party encounter opens the floodgates on the main tank. This type of burnout casting isn't what PC casters do. The NPC casters didn't always use all of their mana or use their best and most mana costly spells every time. This, I feel, was more on par with the way a PC caster plays.<br />
<br />
I read a long time ago that caster mobs had a small experience bonus. Was this bonus increased? What I'm getting at here is risk vs. reward - where is it? Caster mobs are now stunningly more powerful. They NPCs now cast at a burnout rate and are noticeably more difficult than before. So, are we now getting a similarly increased experience bonus for killing them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">I feared casters before this Gart. But I'm not 60 and I don't have nice gear on my Shaman. Get me alone with two of them, particularly if they were still light blue? I gated. I don't have a JBB to nuke 'em, a spear to dot them or the mana to keep my pet alive while killing casters with 3 times my hp. They were too dangerous. Duo'ing casters in Chardok was a mana nightmare for me.<br />
<br />
Apparently this &quot;change&quot; affects a select portion of the EQ population little so, in their minds, it's &quot;good&quot;. And if you disagree, you're complaining. Because, of course, everyone is 60 and everyone has nice gear. Pardon me if I'm just a bit sick of seeing comments like Gart's from level 60's who apparently are forgetting that there is a whole entire other 59 levels to get through for a lot of people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Wyntol12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Try and remember your younger days if you are one of the 58-60's who think this the GREAT!!!! You are at the end of your EQ growing, losing levels isn't really a worry. You aren't giving up tons of AC, wisdom, ac, mana and hps to get most your resists to 100+. Nearly every item you are wearing has mutliple resists and damn nice class stats, hps and mana, along with the best AC for your class in the game. Hell your bracer with great resists may have more ac than most 53 shamans tunics! You are bored to tears doing AA's, it probally is great to see some cool new AI and occasionally feel a rush when you don't resist a nuke or big dot. Downtime simply means your AA's will come a bit slower, no biggie you're prolly done getting all the good ones anyway.<br />
<br />
Now picture the average guy around level 51 in Sebilis. He's scraped to find a find balance between AC, hps and enough wis/mana to have a decent mana pool. Maybe wearing 65hp rings, the common jaudiced pieces, at best a few peices of thurg armor that have like +1 to resists or something like that.  Even if these folks put on the odd cold resist cloak, blue diamond gear, etc, they likely won't resist enough anyway, they don't have the levels to contend with mob ability to land on player better than expected. So they'll be giving up tons of +ac, hp, mana and stats which make them less effective, for the off chance resist might actually work.<br />
<br />
<br />
I check out the profiles of most the folks cheering this change and looking down upon those who dislike it. From the levels and equipment you are at the end of EQ with little to look forward to but PoP or an odd drop here and there. Of course you don't care if normal xp fodder is nuking for more hps than than low 50 groups casters or rogues have. Of course you don't care if they are dispelling far more. At this point you've got ft5+, cool group buffs, AA mana, and all the tools to let some dispells slide and recoup mana faster. <br />
<br />
You guys are looking at it from the level 60 pov. These mobs like in Seb are nothing more than vermin to you that maybe bite a little harder than they did before. To you they are nothing but pesky obstacles in your way of the next AA point. To many low 50's folks they were already a great challenge. In fact the encounters were tuned for years around them being challenging as is. Try stepping back 10 levels, a few equipment downgrades, back before every cleric you knew had a click stick 96% rez. Even with 90% rez's people could lose a weeks xps on a bad night before these changes. Now death will likely be more common and downtime much longer. It sure don't sound like a fun change for all the folks just starting their 50+ climb. You've forgotten what its like to commonly fight yellow+ in normal xp groups. No average equipped or even somewhat twinked 53 is gonna be resisting yellows much:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">These changes are a mess.  The class you need most in dungeons now is enchanter.  Unfortunately, enchanters will now drop like a sack of potatoes in 1 or 2 ultrafast casting nukes from wiz/shammy_01.  They will die so much that they can't get any exp in these dungeons where their presence is now a requirement.   <br />

Verant Interactive is only interested in increasing your downtime so you will play and pay longer.  <br />

Zorlac, nobody is talking about NToV mobs here.  Sure, raid level caster mobs needed buffing.  It was absurd that you cheered every time Velk cast.<br />
<br />
Your average, untwinked, level-appropriate Mistmoore, Sol A, Lower Guk, Sol B or Sebilis group just got brutally pounded. <br />
<br />
Caster-heavy dungeons were ALREADY underpopulated.  When I was in my low/mid 40's, ghoul wizards ALREADY scared us much more than the melee mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">This patch has taken the place of last month's patch for the title of &quot;biggest schmuckery in all of my EQ memory.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is disgusting the way changes to this game are made.  Making NPC's smarter sounded like an AWESOME idea when I read the patch message, but in implimentation they really screwed it up.  The day of and the day after the patch I played my friend's 58 monk a bit.  Attempting to split or pull any spawn with casters in it is a nightmare.  You can't feign because you will get casted on from around the corner.  If there is just one mob casting on you, its hard enough to time your feign to be in between casts, and with two it is damn near impossible.  If there are three or more, don't even bother feigning death, because the real thing isnt far away.<br />
<br />
What I think they should do (maybe not the final fixes, but would definately help):<br />
<br />
1 - fix NPC caster rules to be the same as PC caster rules (no more casting through walls).  This will make pulling much less painful.<br />
2 - Make NPC mana pool smaller.  Chain casting 5 ice comets is ridiculous.  I don't mind them having access to ice comets, but they shouldn't just drain their mana pool on the puller.  That sucks.<br />
3 - Reduce their HP and melee damage and ATK to about 60-70% of what it is now.  They will still be quite dangerous, without being overly cheesy and deadly like they are now.<br />
<br />
Seb last night really sucked.  Some moron trained ENTRANCE.  He brought just about every mob between entrance and disco down on top of us.  We all died =(  Let me tell you... a pickup CR like that is not fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">&quot;These are good changes.&quot; <br />
<br />
The idea of the changes is good<br />
<br />
&quot;Change itself is good, and these changes more specifically are good. When you have no fear of level 50 wiz mob (resist force shock, resist force shock), it's time for VI to change that level 50 mob.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with change but not just for the sake of changing. If they are going to change do it right. That wizard gets his spells he loses his highlvl melee skill. He is now a caster and should &quot;cast&quot; He should have less hps than his warrior npc counterpart. Should still have more hps than pc's but less than the warrior mobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fear is back! And it should be.&quot; <br />
<br />
There is a line between having fear and having no chance and alot of wasted exp/time becuase of untested changes. <br />
<br />
Too much complaining over a good thing.<br />
Start a newbie without twinking it and see how much you like the changes as is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Another near-death caster experience last night.  Blue sarnak in BW... I dropped Ebolt, Plague, and VoS on him, then nuked like crazy (once I realized he was a caster, and thought &quot;Oh Sh!t !!&quot;, I knew I had to kill him qiuck) - got him down to one bubble... and within five seconds he's full health again.  *** !?!?  I look at my own state- he's got Togors and three DoTs on me, I'm down to two bubbles of health, and he is nuking.  <br />
<br />
I immediately gated out - made it with around a half bubble of health and had to scramble to get things cured before the DoTs killed me.<br />
<br />
Basically, I was owned.  I've got a fungi tunic, fungi staff, horse, JBB, and decent other gear, and I was owned from full mana/health by a single blue caster.  Oh, and my resists were all buffed to around 100- as if it mattered.   I can do equivalent level melees losing no health and a single bubble of mana with just about no risk.  One caster mob is (to me) now more powerful than 5 equivalent level melees.  But this is a good change, right?  <br />
<br />
One more effect of the change- I now have to keep Gate memmed at all times.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Changes like this are so long overdue it's not even funny.  Caster NPCs used to be a joke to kill, they'd simply sit there and chain cast worthless lvl 9 spells that you'd resist over and over again anyway.  They needed to cast spells that PCs cast.  It made me embarassed to fight high level Shaman NPCs that would cast Infectuous Cloud and Walking Sleep, that's just absolutely absurd.  Have they gone too far with it?  Eh, maybe.  I personally don't think so, I think it just need a little fine tuning now but not more of an overhaul.  Someone pointed out in an earlier post a very big point though, PCs just got a HUGE jump in power from all of the added focus effects.  Yes, I do think they're huge jumps, for free.   Although I don't think you can balance the game through items, they do have an effect that has to be taken into account.  (You don't know how much I was hoping the JBB would get some sort of focus effect, man that would put the Iksar into an uproar.)<br />
<br />
Things do need to be touched up a bit, I'll never believe an NPC should be able to cast higher than it's level, for example.  But the idea of the change is a needed one, and a long overdue one.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I always keep Gate mem'd at all times.  No matter what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Oh, and I always keep Gate mem'd at all times. No matter what.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Eh, I'd avoid dungeons now if I was a noob comin up.  I'd stay the hell outta seb for the most part, and chardok . . . well just dont go past the fort unless you got a lvl 60 puller and a solid group.  <br />
<br />
As for me, I realize that these changes haven't impacted me that much.  My resists in normal gear are rather high, mostly around 100 or above.  I'll still resist most of the stuff NPC casters throw at me.  <br />
<br />
But I do agree that this is gonna make the old LOIO/FM/OT/DL cycle goddam MANDATORY for anyone leveling up.  Gonna make those zones more overcrowded than ever.  Want to kill a drolvarg rager in DL?  Get in line. <br />
<br />
Solb is still a good place to exp, primarily cause of the lack of casters in general.  My 52 monk does well there solo, but then again the caster shamans die fast, and he resists their slows with a couple Velium Jacinth rings equipped.  <br />
<br />
Gonna be hell on the true noobs tho.  Just hell.  <br />
<br />
The whole NPC caster casting spells well above their level thing is total bull**** tho, and totally uncalled for.  Making AI smarter is one thing.  Making NPCs THAT much more powerful than the level of PC required to still gain exp from them is INSANE.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but a level 35 young shardwurm in GD would be killable for exp only up to about lvl 41 or 42 before it goes light blue.  At that point most casters are lucky to have 600-700 hps self buffed.  A 925 dmg nuke will STILL kill them in one shot if they dont have resist gear equipped.  Most melees of that level only have about 1500 hps if they are a warrior/pally/sk, 1k if a monk/ranger/bard.  So two nukes for those guys.  <br />
<br />
The sheer fact that a green mob can OWN a PC is bogus.  If this change stays, all caster mobs need to be able to gain GOOD exp from them at well beyond the normal level restrictions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Hey, Lan, don't forget, now that you're an Oracle on the Crucible you can set the little tag under your name to the witty comment of your choice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">My problem with this whole thing is it appears that the &quot;Across the Board - Lvl 1 ~ lvl 60+&quot; NPC Caster Balancing came at the price of Focus items.   So the 150 items spread across three classes of Focus items means that 3 plus years of NPC rollouts of Casters got updated overnight into Killing machines.  Just think &quot;Focus items&quot;.<br />
<br />
Was a NPC Caster retune neccessary ... HECK yes ... and it should have been done years ago.   The gear, spells, effects, even new classes have rolled out of EQ Dev's head's ... but the NPC's from every level were lefted as is.    BUT ... some of these NPC's have been in the game for at least 3 years with Beta testing.   Dev's, GM, even guides have tested, watched players, ghosted during encounters on the effects of these spell classing classes.    So why after all this time ... over-night retune NPC's ... without adjusting,rethinking, or true testing concerning the results of the new changes?    Just think &quot;Focus items&quot;.   <br />
<br />
So the next time a Green NPC Shaman whacks you with Malosi (sticks) - Togur's (Sticks on you and pet) - Blast of Poison (hits) - Plague (Sticks) - Blizzard's Blast (hits) - Melee for 101, 101, 101 ... remember to offer your Thanks for your UBER Reed belt - or - Savant's Cap.  Then go out and make a try for a Super Red NPC to return the favour ... whoops wait that didnt' stick - try again - didn't resisted - ackk - I'll melee - 1 - 7 - 11 ... casting Gate ~ ACK interupted (hmmm why can't I do that to NPC's you think as the following message flashes)  returning you to your bind point.   Remember ... just think &quot;Focus items&quot;.<br />
<br />
Balanced even handed approach ... based on testing ... player feedback ... research ... and fast response times on problem issues would earn VI so much more than just throwing 4-5 things out on a patch and waiting to see if anyone roars over it.<br />
<br />
So remember new &quot;Focus Items&quot; are going to make this all better.  Next round of them may even offer modest Resist increases to make up for NPC caster effects ... but then NPC melee's will have to be upgraded as well ... hmmm lets give them  the ability to summon from lvl 1 on ... <br />
<br />
Just think &quot;Focus Items&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">well, on the plus side, castersrealm has info saying that the line of sight rule for PC's will be in effect for NPC's, same w/ basicly all casting restrictions.<br />
<br />
Also it was stated that NPCs will cast appropriate level spells now, and melee tuned down abit.<br />
<br />
In other words, its optimistic to think that the casters will now hit for 100 instead of 110, and shadwurms will cast 800damage nukes instead of 925 =-x<br />
-<br />
<br />
i actually sincerly hope VI lives up to this statement.  If those SOLB shamans hit me for 30 tops, id be happy, cause thats the most i ever hit THEM for(unless i go 2hb).  Its pretty 'intresting' now though, i kinda like having tagars cast on me instead of drowsy by these guys...kinda keeps us in line to what we give them, cept for the fact they burn their whole mana bar, but im sure every one of us has done that sometime to ensure that you win the fight(ie chain healing, or even throwing out those nukes to save the day).  As long as i cant be rooted from half the zone away ill be happy, as i died 2 times yesterday cause of that.  I have yet to be killed by a nuke much higher then the level of the caster, but i hope that is taken care of aswell.  Now that casters are smart, they dont need that to balance em</div></div><hr />

Didnt get my first rez in the game till in my 50's.  If I died I looted my corpse and went back to get some revenge and my xp back.

<br />
Ok i feel much better <br />
<br />
This is a feature and works as-is.<br />
<br />
NPC's have always been this way.. NPC's 25+ levels below you can own you.. they always have inherent resistances and abilities that make them close to your level no matter what your level is.<br />
<br />
Marketing and management have something to do with design.. they must... for such insanity to be the core of the game...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">At 60, while fighting your everyday XP giving mob, you will resist more then someone at 55. It is part of the game design, we all accept it and deal with it. <br />
<br />
Which is why having someone level 60 saying that the new spells froggies in Sebilis are casting aren't that bad is annoying. For you, probably, it isn't that bad. Not because you are uber but because of your level. For people at 53, just heading into Sebilis it is a nightmare. Their level is a severe disadvantage when it comes to resisting these &quot;not so bad&quot; spells even partially. <br />
<br />
It was never about being wimpy, it was about having fun. Wizards on steroids nuking for more HP then I can self buff to isn't fun. Not because I die, I do that all the time, but because I don't even have a shot. That's all I ask for in EQ, give me a chance. I don't think anyone wants to play EQ on god mode, they just want to play. <br />
<br />
Apparently there were enough people saying the same thing and Verant is reacting. Whether they can tune things to make them better without dumbing down the game remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">Let me just say that their mana pool isn't endless but it is rather large.<br />
<br />
Castle Mistmoore<br />
Graveyard cleric<br />
Cast CH on himself 7 times over the course of the fight and he was the only mob we were attacking.  Not like they ever sit to med anyway, but it would seem that either their mana pool is much larger than that of my Cleric 25 levels higher, or they have constant KEI and 15 points of Flowing Thought items along with medding at a rate as fast as I can when I am sitting.<br />
<br />
In Sebilis we got to experience the fun first hand of a SUB level 49 Casting Ice Comet.<br />
<br />
What I love is that typically a caster will melee the melee up front and cast an ocassional spell back towards the casters and healers.  Well when they are up front meleeing for 150point doubles and casting an ocassional 1400 point Ice Comet on the cleric things go south fast.<br />
<br />
Lost our cleric 6 times the other night due to this.  Take note that with a bard in our group the resists on the cleric were at 255 and Ice Comet was still landing for near full damage every time.  Cleric was a level 58 cleric as well.  I can also vouch for a Wiz in Seb casting root then backing up and casting Ice Comet or an AoE spell.  It is maddening.  They channel though however many melees beating on him and a Paladin stunning (note resisted often) and continue to chain cast ice comet on the cleric only.  Not to mention it seems they get the hybrid cast/melee bonus.  Not half a second after finishing the cleric off with the second Ice Comet in a row he is hitting the tank for double 150s.<br />
<br />
I really think Verant had a good idea to make things more interesting, but interesting is one thing and driving me to attack only melee targets because they are so much easier, is completely different.  Why deal with excess deaths when there are so many melee mobs out there that do the same damage as a caster without the added thrill value and give the same exp?</div></div><hr />
