<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diabalein Avidyia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">my question is this.<br />
<br />
do you have to be 50th lvl or higher to get all 3 epic pieces or just the spear?<br />
<br />
as in can i get the shield and the boots pre 50?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">to my knowledge u can get all 3 .<br />
 I got my boots and shield at lvl 45<br />
And i have seen a twinky lvl 47 shaman  running around with the spear of fate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can get all at lvl 1 if ya MQ the fear tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein Avidyia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you have got to be kidding?<br />
<br />
the rogue (my old Main) questers wont even talk to you til 50...<br />
<br />
<br />
can you actually USE the click effects? I am guessing yes but thats just bonkers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can't use the effect on the spear until level 50. I'm not sure if there's a limit on the boots.<br />
<br />
I think epics that you can't start until level 50 are kind of silly - I started my shaman epic at 35, and I'm about to finish it at 54. Epic quests should start easy and get progressively harder, ok maybe the shaman one is easy compared to most, but it's a good quest. Unlike the shadowknight epic which starts very hard and gets very harder :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah but in the process of padding the faction you will prolly level some ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At level 44, you can easily solo the parts needed to get the shield. If you have some friends willing to help you, and willing to wait around at the bottom of Erud's Crossing, that may be nice, as some people have problems with the killer sharks seeing through Invis vs. Animals. I did. I had invis to animals up the entire time and never sat to med, but got attacked twice and had to retreat. By the time I got back, the spirits were gone. :( Fortunately, on my return trip I had some friends come along and we took care of the dumb fish. ;) The Paladin and Shadow Knight in Rathe Mountains will be trivial. Two shots of blizzard blast with the pet nipping on them was enough to send 'em running when I fought them (at level 44 -- not too long ago). I haven't visited Black Dire yet, so I don't know how hard he'll be. I hope to find out soon, though. Good luck to you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Diabalein Avidyia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">got the shield and the boots,<br />
<br />
just an fyi the black dire is one bad mofo.<br />
<br />
<br />
hes a very very resistant sk with a surpluss of hitpoints and hits for 220 with plenty of doubles to go around.<br />
<br />
<br />
so bring a tank or 3 and some serious healing power.<br />
<br />
<br />
other than that hes gravy. yank him to the zone and keep him hailed til youre ready to fight, hes not kos to anyone so you have lots of time to prepare without worring about a buncha newbies dying.<br />
<br />
<br />
damn those boots are SWEET.  and the effect is cool ass hell.<br />
<br />
spam it while you spin in circles while going up and down on the lifts in kelethin and make sure you hit f9 a fwe times to get a far out camera angle.<br />
<br />
or dont, I was bored while selling stuff.</div></div><hr />
