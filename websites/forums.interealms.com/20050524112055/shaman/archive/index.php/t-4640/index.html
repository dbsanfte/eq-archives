<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking of trying Stormhammer for giggles and grins, but being (almost) 58 I am wondering if I am too low to join any guilds there.<br />
<br />
I am seeing things like 60+18aa for recrutiment, no shamans at this time, etc....<br />
<br />
Will I just be soloing there (kinda like I do now)?<br />
<br />
Also, does faction transfer with you?  I have 2 pieces of SS to turn in, but noboby has been up for Kael lately.  I am almost ally and would hate to start with base faction again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Faction does transfer with you.<br />
<br />
There are a few guilds that are recruiting at your level and would probably love to have you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonestorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are there any European guilds on Stormhammer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sindaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, Avalon is a european guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Guide-01 tells you, &quot;Welcome to Stormhammer, here are your Malo and Torpor spells. When you ding 60 'Ancient Bane of Nife' will be in your bank waiting for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey Vova, you never answer my xserver tells. Are you coming back to RZ with all your phat lewt? If you are, wasn't that a cop-out way to make 60 and get some uber items and your spells?<br />
<br />
The Flowers all died without your rays of sunshine to keep them healthy. Hope that blue server hasn't rusted your skills. Hope MB is nerfed in PvP before you get back because I know a lot of wizards that would love to try it on you.<br />
<br />
Yawgmothe sends his love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh -- no, iI won't ever be going back to RZ. Luclin ruined pvp, what with manaburn, lifeburn, AM3 + EQ, etc. PVP in EQ is good to about 50 but that's it.<br />
<br />
I think I did respond to your tells... just repeat 'em if i don't respond... sometimes I'm afk trading in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Would hate to fight you now that you have gone and went uber. I am only 57 still fighting the system and the pks. I was thinking about hitting Legends for a couple of months so I could get my Torpor and Malo handed to me at the door.<br />
<br />
/petition I just hit 60. Could Malo and Torpor be delivered to me ehre in Katta while I start grinding for AA? k thx la~<br />
<br />
I miss fighting you. Maybe I will see you at the shaman BotB.   =D<br />
<br />
Beat Yawgmothe in a 1 on 1. He wasn't happy. &quot;Lag hit me. That's why you got epic off&quot;  blah blah blah<br />
<br />
/wave</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Vova,<br />
<br />
  Shoot me an email at torelorm@hotmail.com if you have some spare time and wouldn't mind answering a few questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Torelorm -- I just sent you a private message using the board software. Check your inbox.<br />
<br />
Meku... you'd need torpor / malo to begin to touch this. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah I know. Whorenaire and Trak arent giving it up. And there are two shaman ahead of me in the guild.  /sigh<br />
<br />
I should just go pk. They all get their epics and have great gear to boot. Shame on the bluebie RZ'ers for telling me different.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Meku, it is bad to pvp. Taking someone else's loot is wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I just got ganked. Can someone help me to kill this guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... er... We are all xp grinding. Didn't you bag in time?&quot;<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />
