<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So what, I'm level 9 with an uncertain playing future...but I like this board, so I'll ask!<br />
<br />
When I get to the upper echelons of the game, and it's time to go raiding, I've always been curious about a coplue things.<br />
<br />
1)  Where do you go to schedule your guild/yourself for raids?  I mean, hell, I read all the time about the uber guilds camping, scheduling.  It makes me thin of a bunch of kids that play 10-20 hours a day, maintaining a network of uber guild leaders, politicking for the raid schedule :)<br />
<br />
2)  How does one get in good guilds.  Is it simply friendship, penis size (breast size), or do ya need to lobby, bribe, or beg for entrance?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
I'll go back to killing beetles now in FoB!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizzli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) Depends on server, some of the mid-low level mobs are on a schedule(at least on luclin), but nearly all high level mobs are first come, first serve.<br />
Usually people will respect first there with enough people, but the actual GM rule is first damage.<br />
<br />
2) Depends on the guild, some depends on friends, others depend on your equipment. As you level up, just watch the guildtags of the people you're playing with. If you find someone that's pretty cool, send him a tell and ask to group again. Same as making friend in RL really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We don't schedule anything. We log in and see what fun things are up and we kill them unless someone else beats us to it. I think that's how it is on most servers. My server does not respect any sort of reservation system, and I'm glad we don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not so much that there is ever a dumb question, but the ones that bug us the most are the uninformed lazy who cant use a search button.... Then again, there are those that open their mouthes before even thinking....(A strong male trait that requires alot of self disciplne... proof- All those men with significant other that walk around with their foot, sometimes 2, in their mouths)<br />
<br />
Anyhow... back to your questions...<br />
<br />
There are alot of guilds that have a pretty diverse makeup and then there are the &quot;uber&quot; guilds.... Guilds are typical to life, like a club.... Most are pretty easy going, but its those that are in &quot;power&quot; that set a tone, a philosophy, and the goals of the guild.. Just like a club... If the &quot;owners&quot; appear to suck(loosely used term), then the guild will suck... All guilds have some sort of problem... Its natural.... You try and find a guild that matches your goals and personality.. ie if your a skater, dont go and join the cheerleader squad.... As for &quot;uber&quot; guilds, well they are more like an exclusive club. Hard to get in, expect a high level of dedication, and don't have time for whiners.... <br />
<br />
There are many ways to get in... but some guilds, usually the higher level ones, will place restrictions, ie certain level, equipment, resist gear, keys obtain.. This is done to make sure new recruits have at least attained a minimum level... ie . if its a 50+ guild, dont expect to be 20 and all the members to PL you...<br />
<br />
As for raid schedules... Most guilds post a minimal raid schedule, and the rest are ad-hoc on a daily basis.... As for pick-ups, my best success is to sit around NFP and watch for one.... Some pickups are by invite, so if you made alot of friends, they will remember you.  Then again, I've had invites to PoG while I was sitting in Troll town working on potions... They simply did a /who all shaman &lt;level&gt; and I was the first to respond to a tell...<br />
<br />
As a tip, not only this game, but for life.... Attitude is everything..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gaef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would just like to add that Wildaar is really bad at cyb0r too :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1. We have a website, just post when we need something and people will try to be there.  Or on the spot thing.<br />
<br />
2. Penis Size.  Angle length kilts anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1) Some are scheduled in advance, usually on our message board, some happen when theres a mob up. How do you know something is up? You have a good idea of when it's due to spawn and then you go and check on it. If someone kills it before you get a chance to, go do something else.<br />
<br />
2) Depends on the guild, once upon a time you had to be a paid up member of a larger gaming clan to be in mine :) Most midsize to larger guilds will have some guildlines as to their process on their sites/boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1) some are scheduled ... I play on BB and its buggered.  FCFS, ragefire is a freaking mess.<br />
2) one hint here, any guild that advertises that its now accepting members in zonewide shout is likely not worth your time.  Different guilds have different requirements.  Keep that in mind what you want from a guild when applying.  If you want to be uber and are prepared to let someone else dictate your online time, look for a guild that is interested in your gear/lvl/class.  If you're looking for something more intimate, get to know folks in that guild, play with them, cyber them ... well thats the fun part, and then they'll likely let you in.  Keep time zones in mind before you apply.</div></div><hr />
