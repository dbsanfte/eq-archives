<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bards....love them...embrace them....stand by them.  Everyon just sits and chews up the mob and resists the ae.  Ranges are too big for the recast to make dodging worth while (plus you couldnt heal from 300 range or whatever it is).  The mana zaps from tt/saryrn can be easily dispelled if buffs/insta clicks are set up correctly, same with planeshift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rigina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for tip !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Okay let's have a look at the 4 Gods in phase 4. All these informations are based off my memory of raiding time XXX times, whether drunk or stoned I cannot say, so infos might not be all that accurate:p<br />
<br />
General rules:<br />
Use Bards:<br />
2 at least: 1 at meeles and 1 at clerics/healers. This will be the BEST option to get rid off the Ae's. You need 500 to resist em good. Use shaman potions if all depends on em.<br />
<br />
Radiant cure 3:<br />
Have your priests get this AA ( shms and druids) as it will cure most of the Ae's.<br />
<br />
cazic-Thule<br />
Hmm think this is the poison one. use desinfect aura or radiant cure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek<br />
His ae won't be a problem at all, just buff fire and/or mr. not sure anymore. Might want to have a curer assigned for the MT.<br />
<br />
Bertoxxolous<br />
Radiant cure again. Oh and Bards. Did I say Bards?p<br />
<br />
Innoruk<br />
Don't waste on curing this ae. just heal and root the adds away..<br />
<br />

How ya doin?<br />
<br />
I haven't been to time yet, so I have absolutely no experience with the zone.. but in response to cazic AE/cure, disenfecting aura was changed to a bigger version of abolish disease, so it don't get rid of poison anymore.. /rude verant, that was our only good poison cure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">[...]disenfecting aura was changed to a bigger version of abolish disease, so it don't get rid of poison anymore.. /rude verant, that was our only good poison cure<br />
<br />
While that did happen (briefly and only on test, right after LoY introduced Pure Blood), that augmented abolish Disease version of Disinfecting Aura never made it to Live that I recall. <br />
<br />
Rather, Disinfecting Aura (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2526&amp;source=Live) remains a 10+10 Disease and 10+10 Poison counters cure (vs. 9+9/9+9 for Pure Blood). And the Pure Blood quest results, for shaman, in a version of group Pure Blood, Blood of Nadox (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3842&amp;source=Test)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is wrong. No ae in PoTime with counters will be removed by RC3 (not counting RZ ae since it's the same as in potactics and if you don't resist it you suck).<br />
<br />
cazic-Thule<br />
Hmm think this is the poison one. use desinfect aura or radiant cure.<br />
<br />
Wrong again, CT's ae have no counters at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek<br />
His ae won't be a problem at all, just buff fire and/or mr. not sure anymore. Might want to have a curer assigned for the MT.<br />
<br />
Wrong once again, RZ does not proc anything curable on MT. Also, his mr based stun is single target<br />
<br />
Bertoxxolous<br />
Radiant cure again. Oh and Bards. Did I say Bards?p<br />
<br />
Wrong, black plague is 18 counters. Radiant cure 3 cures 16 counters.<br />
<br />

<br />
Inny ae cannot be cured.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, RC3 gets rid of a lot of things via the &quot;chance of removal of detrimental spells&quot;, not because you removed all counters.  I know I cured 2 of 3 black plagues in my group after Bert last night.  It also is rather usefull in the quarm fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">RC doesn't work like that.<br />
<br />
The Remove Detrimental(6) line on RC3 gives it a chance of removing one detrimental effect without counters.<br />
<br />
Only one cast of RC3 (removes 16 counters) would never remove black plague (18 disease counters) unless someone else casted RC1, 2 or 3 just before you did which would cause your RC3 to cure the remaining counters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't know about you, but I cure black plague with one cast of blood of nadox. BoN removes 2*9 poison counters and 2*9 Disease counters.<br />
IIRC Quarm needs 2 BoN - throw in GRC and RC3 where needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh aye, I am well aware that my infos are way off, I have to blame the<br />
shaman herbs in that case:p<br />
<br />
Seriously though for Quarm you'd want the Fire necklace and the Backflame sphere. plus RC3 makes it very easy to have a full group cured of what can't be avoided:)<br />
<br />
/wave Einnod<br />
Haven't seen you in a while bud, how are you doing? I hear great progress with SoD.. see you soon!<br />

<br />
Quarm-2 casts of Blood of Nadox will cure Plagued Earth.  GRC to cure Epoch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you want to single target cure the plague of earth from big Q. I find the fire necklace prove very useful. Or the spell abolish disease.<br />

I find BoN a waste of time on Quarm.  I use single shots of Abolish Disease and Disinfecting Aura to cure the dr and pr AEs. <br />

I agree with Kradek on that. Use your saved casting time to crit nuke for 2133 or such evil things:P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">God's AEs in Phase 4?<br />
<br />
To answer the original question of phase 4 gods, you stand there and take the AE.  Spread the bards around where people will be standing.  <br />
<br />
Another trick is:<br />
Have VoQ on the top buff slot.  Throw another 2 junk buffs below it.  I use the clicky sow boots &amp; sta.  Then toss on the rest of your buffs.  The mana drain AE will overwrite VoQ and take over that slot.  Use annul magic to dispell it (annul removes 2 buffs).  Just keep two buff slots open up top and dispell &amp; clicky as needed.  This works well for Saryn &amp; Theris.  Watch out for MGBs cause it can easily take over a top buff slot, forcing the next mana drain AE onto the bottom buff slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ermm, well we tend to put shamans in caster groups, so I might be cured a bit slower myself, but I get the rest of the group cured fast.</div></div><hr />
