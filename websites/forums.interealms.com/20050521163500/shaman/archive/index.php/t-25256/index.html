<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Catabrie Fatewielder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello there. If possible id appreciate it if a Mod was willing to sticky this thread for a couple of weeks while information is gathered :)<br />
<br />
Thankyou to everyone who takes a moment to read this. The reason for my post today is simple. Ive been playing Everquest since beta3 and have seen a lot of changes in the game, some good, some bad, some great and some downright awful. However, like everyone here no doubt, I am still playing the game and enjoying myself.<br />
<br />
It has become apparent however in recent months, with the introduction of WoW and Everquest2 etc that the player base of ALL servers has gone from a state of slow decline to a rapid decline. As an example: 4 Months ago you could zone into the Bazaar on Cazic Thule and struggle to get a free trader spot. Now it is rare that the number of traders gets even close to 300 and usually sits around the 250 mark.<br />
This indicates to me that we have lost(as im sure is the case on most servers) nearly 50% of our playerbase in the last 6 months.<br />
<br />
What this means to us as committed players... Less choice of guild, less ability to raid, huge wait times LFG to find a group, no new faces or friends... the list goes on.<br />
If you consider that these problems alone will encourage yet more people to leave Everquest further increasing the problem.<br />
<br />
SOE's and Verants solution to overcrowding was server splits. Now its time to look at server merges. By combining servers the player base will go back to successful levels. Guilds can continue to thrive, players wont be sat around for hours hoping to find the group that just isnt going to happen. And most importantly I think, they'll be an influx of new people. New friends to make. New people to group with, talk with and have fun with. The thing that made Everquest great at the start.<br />
<br />
I will be posting this petition on as many sites as I can get access to. If you agree with me and would like to support this effort other than just posting your name etc, please feel free to cut and paste this into any other EQ related site that I havent visited. I will collect the results in a few weeks time and ensure they goto as many people at SOE as possible.<br />
<br />
The text of the petition is below.<br />
**************************************************<br />
If you wish to sign this petition, please add a reply under this post along with your Character Name, Class, Level, Server name and guild (if you wish) <br />
<br />
After considering the continued decline in numbers on ALL Everquest servers, we the undersigned request that Server Merges are strongly considered as a way of revitalising the game for its committed player base. We feel that Server Merges will give the chance for Everquest players to meet new people and make new friends and in addition allow players, guilds and continued game play to flourish rather than continue with its current decline.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Magni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I still think people are getting way to excited because the number of active players has declined.  At least wait till February to allow people to return from the holiday break as well as allow time for people to get burned out on other games.  This whole &quot;The sky is falling&quot; attitude that seems to have developed is silly, and I beleive SOE will see it the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes people are going way over the top at the moment.<br />
Give it another 3 or 4 months if its still the same then do something like this.<br />
Although i would think if it is still the same in 3 or 4 months then SoE will be doing something unprompted anyway.<br />
Now im sorry but personally i cannot get too upset over the fact a lot of the upper tier guilds are falling apart as to me this makes not one iota of difference.<br />
Lot less players on BB but this has with the release of OoW made it a lot easier to get groups.<br />
If a lot of people from high end guilds hadnt left do you think these high end guilds would ask me when im LFG if i want a group in MPG being only level  67 etc.No it would be back to the old days when i would have  to form the groups myself etc.<br />
I can now go to zones and get hunting spots etc (been to Tactics lately ?).<br />
BB has always been the most populated server (overpopulated really) so perhaps with the decline of people online it is not as dead as some other servers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it's good to start thinking about possible solutions for a perceived problem, but yeah, a bit early to worry about actual implementation. The first small wave of people are starting to return from EQ2 for various reasons. <br />
<br />
February is probably a good time to get a feel for who is and isn't coming back from other games or holiday breaks.<br />
<br />
I'm actually happy with the current population on MM. It seems like many of those who have left were... shall we say 'less skilled' than most of those who have stayed, and my MPG groups especially seem to work much more smoothly lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like the current state.  The competition for top raid targets is minimal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you can't see there has been a seismic realignment of players away from EQ, then you are deliberately blind.  <br />
<br />
I watched all the other games come and go without a blip on what I saw in EQ.  But EQ has been hemorrhaging in a truly remarkable way over the past few months.  The departures now are in fact different now that they were before.  <br />
<br />
Of current accounts for EQ, I wonder what number haven't logged in for the past couple of months?  What number have cancelled, but have time left on their subscription?  <br />
<br />
EQ will be around and folks will continue to play because it's got a lot of great things about it.  But they fugged up certain design elements so badly.  <br />
<br />
For me, the thing that really pissed me off was the continual effort to get spells.  After nearly 6 years, I've had it with that.  I loved the ritual of returning to Halas to get my spells and hanging out a bit.  <br />
<br />
PoP had too many crappy design elements and I think when all is said and done, did way more to hurt EQ's population than any other expansion - including Gates.  Gates was a nail in the coffin that is EQ's decline (but not demise), but PoP built it.  <br />
<br />
PoP was large and ambitious, and had a lot of great things about it, but the progression scheme/locked zone issue was always crap and the spell acquisition issue was always crap.  Ironically, I had fun in PoP eventually, but I think I'm objective enough to see that it splintered the player base in a really unhealthy way and essentially gave the finger to a lot of different play styles.  That's dumb, and it was apparent to me then, and it's even more apparent to me now.  Given this patch, it looks like SOE finally got the message too, sorta.<br />
<br />
Getting spells should not require raids or buying items from raiders.  It's that simple.  Even in a game with as large a raid focus as EQ developed as it went along.  <br />
<br />
By doing so, it told a significant percent of the population, &quot;this is not for you&quot;.  They got the message and they left.  <br />
<br />
It did not have to be that.  Old EQ/Kunark EQ wasn't really like that.  I remember screaming about this on these boards and getting called a &quot;whiner&quot; &quot;loser&quot; and all kind of other perjoratives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">People who succumb to the &quot;teh sky r falling!!11!!1!!!&quot; syndrome need to just take a step back and relax. A major holiday is coming in less than two weeks, not to mention a host of other online games have just come out. Wait for the dust to settle and things to calm down before you start passing around petitions about server merges. Besides, lower populations aren't necessarily a bad thing.<br />

Interesting this.<br />
Would SoE really care if they lost their entire playerbase to EQ2.Theyd still be making the same $ but upkeep etc would be a lot less.<br />
<br />
Have a few friends who have returned to EQ1 from EQ2 but have yet had none return to EQ1 from WoW which would really be Sonys target players.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Catabrie Fatewielder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This whole 'looks its the xmas season' its gonna be quiet thing is rediculous. If anything more people are on during winter than at any other time during the year. Attendance doesnt improve by february, if you havent got the players on now, when its cold, damp and miserable outside you certainly arent going to have them on when the weather improves and then heading into summer when most would rather be sat in their back gardens than in their back rooms.<br />
<br />
This decline has been happening for months. Its not scare mongering, its not jumping the gun and its not irrational or running around like a headless chicken. It is pure and simple fact.<br />
Walk into your server bazaar. See the amount of traders vs what there was even in the middle of summer(the quietest time) and then come and tell me your server doesnt have problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">raid attendance around the holidays has always been sporadic.  One night you might get a full raid, the next night you have only 40 there.  This has always happened around this time of the year and this year will be no exception.  We already have people posting about how much time that they will probably be missing.<br />
<br />
Think that we will just go full exp mode this holiday season for most of the holidays, maybe spend a few days in the middle raiding, but for the most part just letting people exp if they want.  No pressure and relaxation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Do we play the same game? Summer on Karana is one of the busiest times for the server, since the kids are out of school and playing more often. When kids went back to school in August/September, things really quieted down for us. (That was a blessing and a curse, lol -- fewer folks to contend with, but fewer open raids.) The time between Thanksgiving and New Year's is one of the quiet times, when folks are out with family and such. The holiday season most certainly does have a rather large impact on the size of the playerbase. That cannot be ignored, and it is not &quot;rediculous&quot; (sic). <br />
<br />
Our server's bazaar usually runs between 300 and 350 traders. It fluctuates, of course, but that's about average. It seems irresponsible to use bazaar trader population as your sole reason (your initial post) for insisting there are population problems. To be sure, there are fewer players now than there were pre-GOD/WOW/EQ2, but Karana hardly resembles a ghost town in need of a server merge.<br />
<br />
When folks come back after the holiday season and things have calmed down from the new games that are out (you know, the whole the-pixels-are-greener thing ... folks rush out to try the new thing, some don't like it as well as the old, and come back to the old or go find something else to do), then folks can take a look at the playerbase size and determine if it's time to pester SOE for server merges.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Your an idiot and a lier EQ has not been out for 6 years. EQ camp out in March of 1999. Go Troll some other board WoW fool. Good riddens many things in EQ still way to contested for.<br />

Heh, more &quot;feedback&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This waiting a few months to try to fix problems thing that some of you are pushing is the same tactic that a lot of people are pissed at SOE for using to begin with.<br />
<br />
This isn't a holiday lull that is happening.  People have moved on, and not enough are filling in behind.  Virtually my whole guild QUIT EQ.  They aren't taking a break, or going on vacation to grandma's house.  They LEFT EQ.  /cancel  Thats about 40 people.  And I highly doubt its an isolated event.<br />
<br />
Will they go back to EQ?  Maybe, maybe not.  In the meantime, the people who are still playing EQ will get more and more frusterated.<br />
<br />
Yes, wait 2-4 months.  SOE is good at not doing anything for months, so this shouldn't be a problem for them.  But its not what will help the health of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm on the BB server, and yea, I've noticed a drop in population.  But I've also noticed that recently, I'm suddenly getting tells for groups when I'm not even /lfg ON.   Last night, in the space of 30 minutes, I had 6 tells, (I was already in a group)  Yes, I've noticed that the bazaar has dropped in population.  That there are more open spots in PoP zones.  ALot of it is to the good.  I'm in a very casual friendly guild on BB.  It's been around since almost the beginning of EQ. Those of you on BB, might recognize Clan Mackintosh.  Recently, we've experienced an upsurge in applications for those wanting to return to just playing for fun, and the occaisional raid.  We don't want to become one of the Uber raiding guilds.  We have too much fun just grouping with guildmates and friends to really worry, but we are still getting decent upgrades.  We are getting some LDoN's done.  We've gone into OoW.  Gates? eh.. so so on them.  Our level range from lowbies that are just for fun, to level 70 Time equipped players.  No one is complaining about the lack of anything to do.  Almost every place we go to, whether it is in PoP, OoW, or old world, we have our pick of camps.<br />
<br />
I agree with those that say hang on to yer horses.  January/Febuary may see an uprise in the population.  I myself tried the beta of WoW, and others, and always came back to EQ.  Not everyone that left will return.  So be it.  Come next year, SOE just might do something and start merging some of the lower populated servers.  There are plenty still on BB though, so I doubt that it will be one of the first to be merged.<br />
<br />
Only time will really tell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hmm 250 traders was normal on VS, so it doesn't necessarily illustrate a necessity at this stage of having to merge servers. Although I think VS probably has like 100 traders now and may need merging soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sure there is a small drop in population on Emarr but I personally think it was needed.  Was getting a bit crowded...and we still have a fair amount that will come back in about 5 months.  This is really hammering the panic button too early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">He is right. His spelling and grammar maybe wrong. But EQ was release in March of 1999. You are lying. And regretfully your trolling the broad. By the way camps ARE too congested still in EQ.<br />
<br />
Dang, what's with people?  <br />
<br />
I said I've been playing &quot;nearly 6 years.&quot;  I started in April 1999, although Gart was born a month later.  Isn't that close enough to warrant saying &quot;nearly 6 years&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've only noticed a big hit of high lvl players on Fennin...we have 1-50ish chars coming out of the woodwork lately.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">5 years 9 months.  If you were going to round to the nearest year it would be 6 years so &quot;Nearly&quot; seems good to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">No Gart, you have been playing almost 6 years, not nearly 6 years.  Theres a fine line but it looks like indeed you are technically a liar!  If only you have made that post tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just my 2 cents, but I felt the servers were always WAY overpopulated anyway. I have a bias though, because I am on bertoxx, and I was burdened with being the &quot;first server alphabetically&quot; for a LONG LONG time. We have always had a big population. <br />
<br />
I think most people are seeing this as &quot;the twenty 60+ guilds on my server are WAY down&quot; instead of &quot;we sure dont need 20 guilds now, 10 will be plenty&quot;. <br />
<br />
More are going to leak, thats for sure, but anyone who says they havent seen this type of thing in the past must not have been playing in an active guild. I saw it with DAoC, with Diablo 2, with SWG. Granted, this is the BIGGEST hit I have seen EQ take, and I agree with Gart that the Gates debacle was a huge factor in the decision of a lot of people to just /cancel and head to another game forever. But OoW certainly helped re-establish EQ as a solid contender in the overall scheme of the MMORPG market, despite its datedness. <br />
<br />
I am giving it til Feb-March til I worry about what SOE is going to do about servers, but honestly, at least speaking for Bertoxx, we dont NEED to add more people from another serrver, we just need to re-align the people who are still playing a bit. Two of the top 4 guilds on Bert are already discussing a merge. People from guilds that had borderline raid attendance in the past are trickling into the guilds that have been able to maintain a semi-regular schedule. When the smoke clears, I can see Bert as having 2-3 UBER High end guilds (instead of 4), 2-3 Time-Ikky guilds (instead of 4) and 2-3 EPish guilds (instead of 4). But theres certainly enough people playing to keep moving along just fine, at least on Bert.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Personally I'm on the same server as Catabrie and I'd sign a petition NOT to have merges. Yeah we lost 2 of the top 4 guilds and some of the other guilds are having to recruit some but i don't think the server is anywhere near being fataly underpopulated. No way would I want to see a server merger. If they did have to do something I'd much rather see them do a free transfer off server x to any other server because that server is gonna be closed down. Allow people to go where they want to.</div></div><hr />

A server merge is not going to happen in the near future. The water is fine here, c'mon in!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">This whole 'looks its the xmas season' its gonna be quiet thing is rediculous.

<br />
Wow, what a narrow view.  You do realize that its not &quot;cold, damp and miserable outside&quot; everywhere in the world.  Just because it may be that way where you live, doesn't mean its that way for everyone.   If you didn't know, its now summer in the southern hemisphere.  Australia, New Zealand, all of South America, etc... its all summer right now, not winter.   And while you may not like to go outside right now, lots of people do enjoy winter.  For one, in many area's its hunting season, so a lot of people are outside.  <br />
<br />
But the fact is, its the holiday season as well as end of the semester for anyone in college, that means projects and papers to finish up, finals to study for, moving back home for those that live in the dorms, etc.  Its also time for those of us that work to have crazy schedules trying to deal with the holiday season. Sure, WoW/EQ2 have played part in it, but they've also only been out for a month or so, no one has a clue how many will cancel their WOW/EQ2 account after the free month is up.<br />
<br />
You can say whatever you want to try rationalize your opinion, but I'll stick to the numbers that I've seen over the last 4 years in my guild:<br />
<br />
Raiding nights for the following months:<br />
<br />
Dec 2001: 18 (4 nights a week average)<br />
Jan 2002: 23 (5.2 nights a week average)<br />
<br />
Dec 2002: 16 (3.6 n/wk)<br />
Jan 2003: 23 (5.2 n/wk)<br />
<br />
Dec 2003: 19 (4.3 n/wk)<br />
Jan 2004: 29 (6.6 n/wk)<br />
<br />
As you can see, our turn out in Dec has always been poor such that we couldn't raid much, and every January we came back strong.   Finals, Holidays, work etc all caused it, and every year in January numbers picked right back up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've been thinking the same thing.  Alot of people will start to trickle in around january.  This is a busy time of year, this happens every year.   No doubt WoW and EQ2 had an impact, but i still fail to see an EQ Killer on the market.<br />
<br />
Just to note:cabe is retired, but i am still playing on another server, had to switch.( VS was dead long before all this, pull the plug already ubi, haha )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just say no to premature server mergers.<br />
<br />
WoW and EQ2 probably won't kill EQ1 for a simple reason: EQ1 is chat-centric, it puts the talking and communicating part of the game front and center as the main course. The other two games, the new ones, are mostly about graphics, which are great, and arefun, but it is building relationships with online friends that really made eq1 last so long and I don't see the new games as being as condusive to that as the first eq is and was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">What is he average number of Time/Qvic flagged Guilds per server?<br />
<br />
Green servers only.  Exclude Stormhammer and the PvP's.<br />
<br />
I would bet SOE's biggest worry about having to even consider merging servers would be the sudden increase in demand for high end content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Even if a server merge is required, the population right now is not stable.  People are still leaving, and there's a good chance some folks who left will be back.  The time to do the merge is after the server population stabilizes, so you can tell whether to merge 2 servers into 1, or 3 into 1, or whatever.<br />
<br />
The only thing the current reduced population is hurting is high end raiders.  It's a boon for those people who don't raid high-end targets, don't have the uber gear, don't play six nights a week or eight hours at a time, etc. etc.  So the need to merge is hardly urgent.  Let the casual players have their fun for a while; if the high end folks have an enforced break, well, maybe they'll discover a whole world out there besides EQ.<br />
<br />
And, frankly, if enough of them get pissed off and leave EQ, maybe the tail will stop wagging the dog and they'll put some content in for the casual player.  I sure wouldn't miss the lvl 70 necro in a high-end raiding guild who intentionally trained me at tables in PoFire recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'd say two things:<br />
1) Server population has historically been low at this time of year. <br />
2) WoW is actually a very very viable alternative to EQ for people who were looking for another game to play.  I've started there and it's like the old days of EQ all over again.  The addiction, the sweaty palms in PvP action, the camaraderie with guildies.  I'm having more fun in that game than I've had in any game for years.  Meanwhile, I don't even think about activating my EQ account anymore.  That game still has the same problems that caused me to leave months ago.  That's just my own experience, but it may be an indicator that the server population may be permanently lower than before, even after the turn of the new year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">While people may be playing other games at the moment, most probably still have their accounts on EQ1 still open, and consequently those servers are not going to be consolidated (their operation has been paid for, so to speak). I would think that any move to consolidate would be based on subscription base, not on active player base. In addition, there would likely be a delay between a fall off in subscriptions to server closings in order for the market to stabilize. You have to remember that Sony are in this to make money, so don't be surprised to see another expansion timed strategically to hit the shelves in the first quarter. I imagine that if they did that at that point, they could anticipate recapturing people disillusioned with WoW/EQ2 for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Well, although I do think EQ is starting a significant and permanent contraction, I don't think servers should be consolidated now.<br />
<br />
More chaos that that represents isn't a good thing.  There's simply a process of consolidation and recruitment that needs to occur.  Tons of family style guilds* crumbled after POP, and the uber guilds were loving life.  Now the uber guilds are crumbling left and right and they will have go through that same process of retrenchment and rebuilding (again and again for some).  <br />
<br />
And SOE should think even harder about backflag issues.  I don't know if this patch will address those completely or sufficiently.  Maybe.  If so, great.  If not, more people will quit who might otherwise not quit.<br />
<br />
<br />
* this is really a misnomer.  There were a lot of more casual guilds that raided some, but had a lot of members who didn't, or folks who came and went.  Raiding guilds can't operate really with that mix.  So powergamers who made the core of a lot of more casual guilds left, and many of them crumbled.  Those who didn't move through loyality or whatever, felt stymied in progression or they simply accepted it, or eventually (very eventually) flagged up through pickup/open raid schemes.  I was one of those guys who left for a guild that raided more.  My old guild is still around and doesn't raid at all.  Everyone I know is gone with a few exceptions, and most quit EQ completely.  I'm hijacking my own post...</div></div><hr />

The low player count on most servers is a driver that leads people to quit playing on it's own.  The fact that it's harder to get groups, bazaar trading has dried up, guilds are struggling to assemble raid forces.....those are all frustrations that are forcing people out of EQ.  Many of those will now try one of the other games, not necessarily because they want to but because they are irritated with the low population that is left in EQ and are confident that SoE won't do anything until way later than it should.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Honestly I believe that SOE considered that the mass exodus of players leaving to EQ2 and WoW.<br />
<br />
This is evident by the random rare uber items that drop off of trash as well as the elemental quality items dropping of of 1 groupable named NPC's in the new zones, not to mention the 1.5's that are for the most part attainable by a solid group of 24 or less in most cases.  They wanted to slightly level the playing field and allow 'uber guilds' access to more players by making it easier for newer players to become somewhat desireable, at least able to buff to 8k HP easily now.<br />
<br />
What I do believe is that EQ2 and WoW have struck a severe blow to the king of the MMPOLG's that may become fatal....  I hope not, but I fear that is the way of things to come.<br />
<br />
Give it time.  That is what I keep hearing.  Time is not a luxury of the dieing, and EQ may need more than time.<br />

I reside on Karana with Tordail, and he and I have off again/on again had butted on several issues over the years, and I have to say this is going to be one of them again.<br />
Yes this is historically a lower population time for various reasons...college kids have gone home and are sans internet/computer, its hunting season in most states and while I would say that hunters are probably not a large portion of EQ's population, they are there.<br />
I could probably list a dozen other reasons why there are lower populations before I even began to hit on  EQ2 or WoW, but yes, they are reasons.<br />
Now, I am part of a small guild, very close knit, very friendly, but with very few real goals, just friends that enjoy playing a very good game. We rarely &quot;raid&quot; and when we do it is 1-2 groups hitting smaller targets more for fun and leg stretching than anything,  so the competition for higher end raid targets and such never really affected us. The vast majority of the guilds players are PM EST peak time players, and this is where I come in with the problem.<br />
Since I started playing EQ, I have always been a AM EST player, I log on at 9am EST after I get home from work (night shift ER nurse) and &quot;relax&quot; with EQ for 4+ hrs. For years this has been my daily routine, and I have learned to if not speak French, to at least be able to comprehend it, and have even over the years learned how to chomp my way through a smattering of German when that was necessary too. I also very very rarely raided...I work 4-5 nights a week from 8pm till 8am...not exactly condusive to raid time...and on my days off I spend my evening time with my wife and daughter.<br />
For the last 3 weeks though, EQ has been a technical graveyard for me at my peak times. I log on and LFG for 1, 2, 3, 4 hrs, soloing all the time, Factioning all the time, PLing alts, etc and rarely get a tell for a group.<br />
Now before this gets seen as a &quot;oh woe is me&quot; post, lets examine something here.<br />
I am a good shaman. I have main healed in MPG BEFORE I got the new 68 heal and I dont even have the GoD one. I routinely main healed in LDON hards before that. And yes, I was main/only slower in both those cases. I maximized my play time to be the best I could be given my limitations in both gear and no raid time. I had a fairly extensive list of people I regularly grouped with, either in MPG, LDON hards (before OoW), WoS, and Ruined City. Now, I sit routinely unable to get a group, thus I log off and play other games, tired of doing other than what I want to do (get to 70 before the new year).<br />
In my situation, server mergers may be a viable fix, allowing more people like me to actually see each other and thus get something done. I am a hard core non raider player, nearly 400 LDON wins, 275 AA, good and I sit collecting dust a large part of the time. How many people are in the same boat I am? How many have seen their peak time, because it is different from the normal peaks, become a quest to find a group let alone get anything done with that group. Would server mergers aid this? I think they would, but I think that the higher end players/raiders would not be happy.<br />
All I know is that something will be done eventually, but I fear that for the more casual, it may be too late, they have moved on to greener pixels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
     I tend to agree with you a bit.  Brell is pretty dead right, but this is pretty normal for this time of the year.  I also am taking into account that EQ is having to deal with 2 Mmorpgs out as well as a slew of new video games that have hit the shelves in the last few months, so EQ is definitely going to be quiet for a while.  I also think that this is the time of the year that people generally retire at.  It's the slowest so I think many get bored with nothing to do and move on to other things.  Some come back later on, and some stay retired.  After January hits, though, I expect numbers will pick back up.  Players will burn themselves out on the new video games, and I believe some players who left for greener pastures (WoW,EQ2) will come back due to the games &quot;not being EQ&quot;.  It all depends really, and I think it is really to early to tell if/how well EQ will pick up after the holidays, but I definitely think it is too early for SOE to do anything but watch and wait.  <br />
     During the holiday season, I just typically stick with farming to stock up the trader and questing.  Its a nice quiet time to knock out boring faction need for quests, gather up tradeskill supplies, or level up/gear up an alt.  It keeps you occupied and it takes care of things that you will not want to worry about when the game picks up.  In just this past week, I can't tell you how many Qvic+ players I have tripped over in my hiding spots that were there &quot;to get X drop for twink#6.&quot;  All in all, I would tell everyone to wait it out until late January- kids are back in school and family life tends to calm down and get back in routine.  If the population does not pick up after then- then petition for server mergers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">While I feel EQ will be going for a while and admit I wasn't around to see the effects of previous eqkiller releases. I think one thing people are overlooking is that this time it not a EQ killer it's a raid of them so to speak. EQ2 and WoW are the first of quite a few new MMORPG which will be competing for roughly the same players (though a few based on big properties will introduce new players). I think the problem will be that people will try one and if it is not for them head to the next new one instead of the game they must have already thought about quitting. I bet the longer it takes someone to think about coming back to EQ the less likely they will due to friends moving on.<br />
<br />
I some ways what I feel is happening to EQ is similar to what happened to Shamans. EQ attempts to please a wide variety of play styles and does a fairly good job (Like Shaman were fairly good at several roles). However most of the new ones seem to be after particular groups for which they offer more tailored game play which will be more likely to hold they interest (Like Shamans ended up lagging behind specialists in EQ to avoid becoming overpowered, thus were less desired).<br />
<br />
I can understand people wanting to hold off any merger decision till the dust settles, but if this series of new MMORPG's are released in a way that causes the dust storm to continue for too long, EQ could end up being buried in the dust.<br />
<br />
While I think mergers are too soon at the moment, I hope SOE is already forming plans incase, as I believe is likely, the returning masses never make it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Gerardy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I agree with both side... I can see wher a server merge would help have the numbers high again, keep guilds alive and raiding. and groups up and killing. but also I think that more people will come back, I have seen a few, and the holidays will bring more back. I think they should wait it out before doing any merging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I think those of you who think things are gonna come back are in for a rude awakening.<br />
<br />
I think EQ2 is gonna go down as a flop. WoW is gonna be the hit. And its gonna hit alot of casuals hard as its a game where you can really do something viable in 15 minutes or in 6 hrs your choice.<br />
<br />
After starting and stopping this game more than once, after a month in WoW I dumped my accounts (at the time I had 8). 6 will stay active as my guild took them or bought them from me. One I will keep &quot;just in case&quot; and one will rot. That being said is that healthy? My guild has resorted to botting because there are not enough live people on the server.<br />
<br />
That being said Maelin was always destined to take the first hit as on of the two trully low pop servers.<br />
<br />
The reality is that there are more viable options than ever before and still more in the pipeline. SOE can adapt or die, and in the case of a game were grouping is effectively mandatory that means free moves or server merges.<br />
<br />
Does that mean Bertox (or any high pop server)? No. It means start with the 10 lowest pop servers and consolidate/elinimate them via merges/moves. Do that as needed to maintain a stable player base (as defined by numerical metrics).<br />
<br />
In the end I dont care. I am 99.9% sure this time I will not be coming back. I only saved the one account because its my namesake and keeps the name locked down on my server forever (or until SOE deletes its first account). But the reason I got into boxing in the first place is the difficulty finding grps in off-peak times, and this is only getting worse. Some will just leave rather than bot.....<br />

<br />
<br />
I am on the same server, but I haven't quite decided whether merging the servers is quite necessary yet.  From what I have seen so far are as follows:<br />
<br />
lots of new druids/necros...<br />
lots of 55-59 melees begging to be PL'ed<br />
a so-so amount of others ranging from 65-70<br />
<br />
Raid Guilds<br />
<br />
OoW/Qvic+ level<br />
<br />
Silent Redemption (open recruiting closed, backflagging?)<br />
Alarius (still recruiting, not sure on open or closed)<br />
Enshadowed (no longer raiding)<br />
Watchers (/boggle, they have always have a ton of peeps)<br />
<br />
Time/Uqua/Ikkinz<br />
<br />
Sojourners (not sure on recruiting status, but still raiding)<br />
Sphere of Honor (gone)<br />
Zenith? (gone)<br />
Misericordia? (still around)<br />
<br />
Elemental<br />
<br />
Mythic Voyagers<br />
Veteran Crew?<br />
unsure of other guilds, but probably a few...<br />
<br />
I know quite a few guilds are running at about 60-75% strength, and while a merger might bolster the grouping aspect- I am uncertain at how it will effect guild make-up.  Doubling up raiding guilds even when they are only at 60-75% strength could cause some infighting, and the crap only rolls downhill.  The end result could result with more people leaving due to being fed up with fighting over content....  Brell has always had a strong raiding community (either open or closed), and throwing a monkey wrench into the works could cause some issues.  Of course, I am not raiding, so players like Jaradis and Juujuu probably have a better view from the raiding standpoint on Brell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I have heard that Brells numbers are way low, but I still think they should wait. 1-free-month from some of the new games will be running out soon. Then we will see how many stay and how many come back. Already have seen about 20% of our guild that left for EQ2 or OoW return. Heck, one concern that I have is that we OVER-COMPENSATED our recruiting, and will end up with too many people when its all said and done. <br />
<br />
I am sure SOE is watching the numbers very closely, both the &quot;logged in&quot; numbers and the &quot;accounts canceled&quot; ones. Eventuallly, I do think some servers will be merged/closed, but I dont think that will happen for another 45 days at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also<br />
<br />
Personally I think one of the big problems with EQ is alot of the surprise is gone. <br />
<br />
I think a couple of things they need to do is first combine a few servers. Secondly instead of just introducing new zones, new mobs to defeat, new gear, more tradeskills ; they need to put surprise back into the game.<br />
<br />
They seemed to try this with that recent quest that ended in TOFS but Many people never were even able to get it started because it was over with so soon.<br />
<br />
They also need to create secrect zones that might open up for a month or so not announced just found by accident by someone then the zone just dissappeares for some magical reason /chuckle , More mobs that all of a sudden show up in old zones and when killed drop somthing unique. Like something with 5 charges of Fear all when clicked fears any mob targeted for 5 seconds or a Clicky with 10 charges of Ability of the GoDs ie max Stats for 5 min.<br />
<br />
these are just ideas . Im saying alot of the surprise is gone thus alot of the fun. <br />
They could do so much with Languages, How we interact with each other in game. More unique quest. <br />
<br />
There needs to be more fun items not just that uba weapon with Stun resist V or whatever. <br />
<br />
Wouldnt that be kewl if one day all of the snakes abandon SSRA for a day and roamed The Grey including the Emp ? Or all of a sudden a new Evil Griffin showed up in Free Port that required a couple of combined raids of 100 toones Plus to kill him off and Save Free Port. Sort of like the Sleeper a one time thing ?<br />
<br />
Or how about a new NPC that is cursed but it able to speak to a Maximum of 100 people giving them some quest piece and the the receipe for somthing new and unique that is sellable but can only be made once meaining there would only be 100 of the items on the server ?<br />
<br />
How bout an item with 10 charges of &quot;Call of the Eagles&quot; NON rechargable quested item of only 50 in existance that when clicked 4 Eagles come flying in from the sky to attack the Rangers foe doing much more damage then the Ranger could do himself.<br />
<br />
There is a ton of stuff they could do and I can see them trying but not hard enough. Those fishing tournaments are gonna get old. In fact they already are.</div></div><hr />

February is coming in just a few short days, and I suppose the folks at SOE will take a look at server merges in a timely manner like they said they would (/cough).<br />
<br />
Life on Karana is still plugging along nicely. <br />
<br />
The population has increased a bit, but certainly it is not back to the pre-WOW/EQ2/holiday days. Suits me just fine. Like I said before, lower populations are not necessarily a bad thing.<br />
<br />
My new guild has had to close applications almost entirely, we had so many people banging down our door to get in. We're sitting at a rather comfortable 110-ish mains, and aside from needing a few more monks and enchanters, we're filled to bursting on every class. We had a great crop of people to choose from, too, which tells me there are a lot of viable players still on the server. We turn out 40-ish people per raid, generally. There are enough people in the POK that there is no trouble getting the buffs you need/want, and enough bazaar traders (247 when I zoned in yesterday at around dinner time EST) that you have a relatively good selection. There are not so many people that zones are overcrowded (no more lag in WOS and plenty of open camps in Fire), but there is still some decent competition for mobs (we had to wait awhile to get hold of Sol Ro, for example).<br />
<br />
IMO, life is good on Karana. I do not think we're in any need of a server merge.<br />

<br />
 Warcraft said late last week that there not letting NO one make new account on any sever till they basicly can frigue out thier sever problems. The lag, and over crowed zones have pushed some people out of WoW, I do believe those people who are leaving Warcraft for the lag  , overcrowness or whatever  reason maybe are returning to Everquest Live. <br />
  Everquest is still in my mind the only Hardcore fanstay base game on the market.   <br />
<br />
Have fun and be safe</div></div><hr />
