<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ashleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm about to do Jaeil and have a quick question: my friend has a druid with a left over bowl from her quest, can I use that to spawn Jaeil? or does a ranger have to spawn him? <br />
<br />
I would guess that it doesn't matter, but I figured I would ask here for reassurance...  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">she can spawn him yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ashleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks!<br />
<br />
i found a comment on another post that said a druid could put their bowl to use since they don't need it after a certain point, but it wasn't conclusive.</div></div><hr />
