<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, long time lurker first time poster. Currently looking for an upgrade on my troll shaman's shoulder slot. Using Obulus Death Shroud atm, and would like some ideas on what I should look for. :) Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sad to say there aren't many easy upgrades above that.<br />
<br />
I wear peerless dragonhide (hp/mana and decent ac)<br />
If you can get the no drop shoulders from Chardok those are nice<br />
the rest are quests (like strength of elements and chardok multislot item) or drop from uber mobs.<br />
<br />
those are all I know of so if you happen to find anything let us know.  Fatties kind of got screwed on shoulders :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Salani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One decent upgrade is...<br />
<br />
Death Watcher's Shroud (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=9004) <br />
<br />
fairly common off the Elysian Elders in UP.<br />
<br />
They can be tricky to pull.. they like to nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">oooh<br />
<br />
not bad, need to try and get one of those</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>katranna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are some shoulder that drop in Chardok they have great<br />
stats I just dont remember them of hand hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groxb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Chokidai Hide Spaulders ( 2.5 WT, 6 AC, +8 WIS, +5 SV DISEASE, +5 SV MAGIC, +5 SV POISON).  Any race, Shaman only.  Drops in Chardok or you can buy them for about 1k.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">can do strength of elements quest ac15 +15 all resists +100hps only thing halfways tough about it is Master Yael.<br />
<br />
shawl of perception in Ntov is super nice also, and not no drop. ac15 +10 stam +10 wis +8 resists +30hp/mana.<br />
<br />
silver chains ntov but they are well bid normally.<br />
<br />
barbed ringmail shoulders from velks ? <br />
apparently there is a nice set of shoulder drop in the new Cazic Thule but dunno too much about dem<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lumor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I notice a bunch of shaman wear the Obulus Death Shroud.  I currently wear the Elder Wolf Hide.  With the added hp I feel that it outweighs the ODS.  The biggest thing is the plus mana but the added hp will allow you to cann more so in essence the EWH I feel would be a better choice.<br />
<br />
Am I missing anything???<br />
<br />
Here are the 2 stats<br />
<br />
OBULUS DEATH SHROUD <br />
Statistical Information<br />
Classes:  All Classes<br />
Races:  All Races<br />
Stats:  10 AC +25 MANA +3 STR +5 STA +3 WIS +1 SV COLD +1 SV DISEASE +1 SV FIRE +1 SV MAGIC +1 SV POISON<br />
Special Attributes:  MAGIC, LORE<br />
Slot(s):  Shoulder<br />
Weight:  2 Stone<br />
 <br />
ELDER WOLF HIDE <br />
Statistical Information<br />
Classes:  All Classes<br />
Races:  All Races<br />
Stats:  10 AC +30 HP +4 INT +4 STR +4 WIS<br />
Special Attributes:  None<br />
Slot(s):  Shoulder<br />
Weight:  5 Stone <br />
<br />
<br />
Also the wolf hide is a pretty common drop I was able to net 2 of them in about an hour and a half solo once with my shaman then logged on my necro and bagged another.  Both goten solo with a lvl 51 necro, and my shaman was 51 at the time also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would take the ODS as the +5 sta will add some HP and with the ODS you also get more mana plus some (admitidly rather small) resists</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is a large race equivalent to the IGS from Chardok that is ac15 12 to all saves I believe. Supposed to be a rare drop from the named Gravemaster around the waterfall on way to royals. Actually here it is:<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6865<br />
<br />
And best of all it's no drop so less competition hopefully IF it drops. the area this drops in can be done with one solid group but adds seem to wander in from side and repops in the pits along the walkway to waterfall can surprise you so be careful.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Matchless Dragonwing AC15 65 mana/hps<br />
<br />
just about the best u can get tradeable wise IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">5 stamina is almost the same as 30hp at Lvl50+.<br />
<br />
So obulus is about 15mana, and some Saves better than Elder wolf hide.<br />
<br />
Any  Western Waste mantle is a good shoulder slot though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for all the replies, I think that a WW mantle would be my best option. Really wish I could wear this bloody IGS I have banked. :|  I'll have to console myself with my innate regen, and OT hammer. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There is also the Fairy hide mantle from a quest in Plane of Air.<br />
<br />
+9 AC +5 Str +12 Wis +10 vsMg +10 vsFire +10 vsCold +2.50 Wt <br />
<br />
If your guild goes up to farm Spiroc Wing blades for warrior epic its likely you will get the No Drop piece.  The other two items required are more common drops on the 3rd and 4th islands.<br />
<br />
I am,</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong but I think 1 sta = 3hps, so 5 sta = 15hps. At least for shamans. I know for warriors its 1 sta = 6hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I played around a bit in Umbral Plains and during 3 hours or so I was only able to get one Corrupted Elysian elder, does anyone have a way to spawn the elders or is it just about luck?<br />
