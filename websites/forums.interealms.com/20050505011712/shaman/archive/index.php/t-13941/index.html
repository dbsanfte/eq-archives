<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't seen this before and found it interesting. Here is the link. http://pw1.netcom.com/~sirbruce/Subscriptions.html <br />
<br />
Nice info and graph of how the subscription base has peaked out for MMO games. What's this most likely mean? There isn't enough people for Star Wars , EQ2, and WoW to all be a great success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I disagree.  Many of the games listed fall into a specific category, that being fantasy roleplaying.  I know people that would get put to sleep playing EQ or Shadowbane but would love Earth and Beyond or SWG.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Setting.  Some people that would like a science fiction grounded story would not be able to stand EQ because of the dragons, magic, etc.  I know people that could tolerate neither EQ nor SWG but would spend 10 hours a day playing Sims online.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Setting and purpose.  <br />
<br />
With the numbers of people getting broadband and high speed internet access growing I find it hard to believe that a field of entertainment that is barely been tapped yet (online gaming) is in its last throes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I found this chart vastly entertaining to look over the first time I came upon it.  I would have never guessed that EverQuest had over 400,000 subscribers.  I was thinking more along the lines of 50,000.<br />
I'm curious to see what will happen to this graph at the end of this year, after WoW has been out for a couple months.  I figure I'll hold onto both accounts for a bit before I let my EQ account go by the wayside.  From what I've been reading, there should be a sharp decline in EQ's subscribers, to make way for WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I highly doubt that WoW will be public by the end of the year, I'm guessing more like a year from now if I know Blizzard at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WoW isn't even in beta, is it?  (if I missed that, I'll be cheezed)<br />
That'll last at least a year, in itself.  As much as I love their thoroughness, I've never been as impatient for a game to come out as I am for this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The poor guy who made this must have reached his bandwidth limit or something, all I see is a red X for the chart.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look both ways for hungry mice, there Cheddar  ;)<br />
WoW is in Beta testing now.  Not that many peeps testing, compared to EQ's beta and I'm not aware that applications are still being accepted.  Furor is the most vocal beta tester I know of, you can read all about it at the FoH homepage (which he threatened to change to a WoW page)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">WoW beta has not started.  They're starting the beta in the new couple months, they are probably in an alpha version currently of testing, but still developing things.  <br />
<br />
And yeah, the bandwidth got exceeded, I've seen this link posted on a few message boards lately, must have got it killed off =)</div></div><hr />
