<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kinrab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">k besides pulliig and snare which i find overrated, do the advantages of a shadowknight outwiegh that of a paladin? in a duo fight for exp or for a boss mob(big named mob)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">personally, i like pallies better.<br />
<br />
heals, decent damage and the plan is not to die.  but in the rarity, there is a rez.<br />
<br />
but, you have to get em young and train em right.  i have been duo'ing with the same pally for over 20 lvls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SKs and shaman mesh real nice ability-wise, and their really isn't any getting past FD.  It's just insanely useful.  OTOH, pallys bring a lot of nice stuff of their own to the table, not the least of which is 1500 hp in buffs, stun (which is almost as nice as FD in some cases) and their own heals.<br />
<br />
The answer to your question is.....it depends.<br />
<br />
XP fight I'd say SK.  They are the shammy of melees, lots of tools in the old toolbox.  Boss fight (assuming it's something that's actually difficult, and not just something that used to be difficult), it's pallys, hands down.  If it's hard enough that you're seeking whatever advantage you can get, it's hard enough that a tank that can heal himself is to be preferred.  And I say this having a 65, 100+ AA SK myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tend to find some better DPS from the SKs I match up with, but really both of them are solid classes to pair, depends on how well you and the other work together and what you wanna use :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Both classes have nice tools to make a good duo with a shammy.<br />
<br />
2 more things a pally can offer: HP / AC buffs and stuns (/point gater)<br />
<br />
In the end it is really what you or your friend like more to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i made a pally because i do a lot of stupid stuff with my shaman. can't beat being able to rez yourself after a good idea went unforgivinly wrong...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why would you want to make a comparison regarding SK's and specifically exclude snare and pulling?  Sounds like your mind is very made up already and the question is moot.<br />
<br />
Kind of like saying, would I duo better with a cleric, who doesn't heal?<br />
<br />
What exactly is it you were looking for when you were so careful to exclude the best parts that distinguish him from a pally?  A recommendation on the negatives?<br />
<br />
Ok, pallies tank better and have buffs and stuns.  Therefore, that must mean a shadowknight is better. (?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They both are great to dou with, but i have to lean to the Pally. Ever since that night me and a pally duo's BoT giants with about the same speed as a full group with no downtime ( back when BoT was a tough zone ), was the day i really saw the power of stun and extra healing. The only thing i missed was snare, but thats a situational utility. But then again, so is stun.<br />
<br />
Like i said, they are both good, it depends on your situation i guess on who is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I trio with a Pally and SK . . . and let me tell you they are both excellent.  Each brings it's own unique utility.<br />
<br />
The three of us are able to do LDoN normals with just the three of us in the dungeon.  Better Exp, better loot and a lot more challenge since everyone has to be on top their game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They are both awesome tanks. If you want to do the majority of camps, you will want FD to pull. If you want to fight runners, you will want snare to avoid adds. In these cases, SKs are better. In LDoNs without runners, I tend to prefer Paladins. On normal LDoNs, a Paladin and a shaman are fine for healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Osrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I duo w/ a warrior most of the time. Silken Whip of Ensnaring is your friend.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If i remember right, Pally gets FD also, through AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If i remember right, Pally gets FD also, through AA.<br />
If this is true, I'm quitting NOW, as opposed to waiting til my guild disperses.</div></div><hr />
