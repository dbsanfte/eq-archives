My mana’s out and I’m wondering why I..<br />
Logged on today at all<br />
The Karana rain clouds up my window<br />
And I can’t see no more<br />
And even if I could it’ll all be gray<br />
But a note on everlore<br />
It reminds me, that’s it’s not just me<br />
It’s not just me<br />
<br />
<br />
Dear Brad, I posted on the boards but you still ain’t respondin<br />
I left my server, character and guild name at the bottom<br />
I sent two wizard whinges back in autumn, you must not a got em<br />
There probly was a problem at my ISP or somethin<br />
Sometimes I scribble email addresses too sloppy when I jot em<br />
But anyways ***, what’s been up man how’s your character?<br />
I’m about to start a decent class too, guess what Ima call her?<br />
I’ma call her Druid<br />
<br />
I read about the Druids got improved heals I’m sorry<br />
I had a wizard friend kill himself over groups who didn’t want him<br />
Sorry all us wizards keep complainin wannin changes<br />
But *** man? It worked for all the rangers<br />
I know you probly hear this every day, but I aint your biggest fan<br />
I even got that **** you did, Tanarus, that **** was crap<br />
I got a room full of posters and pictures but you’re not on em<br />
Anyways I hope you get this man, email me back<br />
Just to chat, not quite your biggest fan<br />
This is Kal<br />
<br />
Dear Brad, You still aint fixed our class! I hope you have a chance<br />
I ain’t mad, I just think its F*cked up that you don’t do a patch<br />
If you didn’t wanna talk to me at the gathering, you didn’t have to<br />
but you could signed an autograph for my Shadowknight<br />
That’s my little twink man, he’s only six levels old<br />
We waited in the tedious foyer for you<br />
Four hours and you just said “No”<br />
That's pretty ****ty man – he thinks wizards are f*ckin idle<br />
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do<br />
<br />
I ain’t that mad though, I just don’t like being mocked<br />
Remember when you wrote the manual, you said we’d rock<br />
I can relate to your game<br />
So when I have a ****ty day, I drift away and log on<br />
Cause I don’t really got **** else so EQ helps when I’m pissed off<br />
<br />
I even got a towel with your name across the top<br />
Sometimes I even delevel myself, the waste of time is such a rush for me<br />
See everything in this game is real and I respect you cause you play it too<br />
My girlfriend’s jealous cause I play online 24/7<br />
But she don’t have three accounts like I do, no one does<br />
She don’t know what it was like for wizards like us growing up<br />
You gotta fix our class man, or we’ll be your biggest pain in the ass <br />
Sincerely yours, Kall P.S.<br />
We should group together too<br />
<br />
<br />
Dear Mister-I’m-Too-Good-To-Reply-To-Wizards-I-Just-Threaten-Bans<br />
This’ll be the last petition I ever send your ass<br />
I’ve played for 2 years and six months and still no fix – I don’t deserve it?<br />
I know you got my last two posts on the boards<br />
I clicked on the button perfect<br />
<br />
I’ve got Spirit of Cheetah on the Orc Highway<br />
Hey Brad, I drank a fifth of Kalish, dare me to Levitate?<br />
You know the song by the Bard, “In the Air of the Shadowknight”<br />
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning but didn’t, then the Bard saw it all, then at a guild meeting he found him?<br />
That’s kinda how this is, you could rescued me from cancelling my account<br />
Now it’s too late – I’m on 1000 clarities now, I’m drowsy<br />
All I wanted was a decent spell or a group to give me a call<br />
<br />
I hope you know I ripped all of my Sony’s Playstation Games off the wall<br />
I love you Brad, we could have fought in Cazic together, think about it<br />
You’ve ruined it now, I hope you can’t maintain your servers and you DREAM about it<br />
And when you play I hope you can’t group and you SCREAM about it<br />
I hope EBAY sells your **** and you can’t SEEM to stop them<br />
<br />
See Brad; (*screaming*) Shut up *****!! I’m trying to quad kite!<br />
Hey Brad, that’s my girlfriend screaming “can’t we go out?”<br />
But I didn’t wanna fight, I just told her just five more minutes, see I ain’t like you<br />
Cause if she waits for hours then she’ll suffer more and then she’ll die of boredom too<br />
Well, I gotta go, I’m almost at the CANCEL ACCOUNT screen now<br />
Oh ****, I forgot, how’m I supposed to camp myself out?<br />
<br />
Dear Kalliff, I meant to post sooner but I just been busy<br />
You said your girlfriends mental now, how far gone is she?<br />
Look I’m really flattered you want to group, I think<br />
Here’s an autograph for your little shadowknight twink<br />
I wrote it on another cheap towel map<br />
<br />
I’m sorry I didn’t see you at the gathering, I musta missed you<br />
Don’t think I did that **** intentionally, just to diss you<br />
But what’s this **** you said about you like to delevel yourself too?<br />
That **** means others will probly petition you<br />
I think you need to get out more Kal, I think you need to get a life<br />
To get your ass outa the house and maybe even get a wife<br />
And what’s this **** about us grouping together?<br />
You’re a wizard so we really don’t need each other<br />
Maybe wizards have been nerfed over<br />
You’re right we should really treat you better<br />
But then maybe you just can’t play your class<br />
So quit moaning or I’ll ban your sorry ass<br />
<br />
I hope you read this post in time<br />
If not, don’t worry bout me I’ll be just fine<br />
I’m glad the game inspires you but Kalliff Why are you so sad?<br />
Try to understand, that I do want your measly $10 a month in my account<br />
I just don’t want to hear your endless problems when you put LFG on shout<br />
I saw this **** on the boards about this wizard he was drunk <br />
he ran across orc highway while his girlfriend packed her trunk<br />
So Kal, **** at least until till the next update<br />
We got some **** that to cheer you up even though it’s f*kin late<br />
The **** we put in can’t get any better than this<br />
Cause now during hours of medding you can play TETRIS!</div></div><hr />
