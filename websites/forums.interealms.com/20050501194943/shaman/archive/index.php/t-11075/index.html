<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe I'm retarded, maybe I dreampt the whole thing.  Ok well the first is a given.  <br />
<br />
I was in PoD yesterday, having fun in LC with my new horse and blowing mana like an intern.  We got 2 crawlers pulled into camp, they were mezzed.  I went to slow them both and accidently hit my hotkey for epic.  I didnt realize it till casting was near done, and my instinctive effort to duck out of the spell was of course fruitless.  Then the spirits of the land rage on the mezzed giant centipede.  I tell group I ****ed up and Doted the wrong one, and was going to park when mez broke.  But it never did.<br />
<br />
He stood there mezzed and his hps just ticked away.  This of course struck me odd, so I tried it again on the next multi pull and again Epic dot didnt break mez.<br />
<br />
So has anyone else noticed this?  Is it a patch bug? or have the voices in my head finally sunk in deep enough to completely warp my reality and none of this ever happened and I should seek immediate counseling?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Might've been rooted, because any mob I've epiced breaks mez when first tick of damage hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am pretty sure that the DoT from the epic won't break the mez at the very beginning since there is no damage.  But I would have guessed the dmg from the DoT later on would break it.  Strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Root would of been my first guess also.  But the mob was literally in our camp, I was standing right beside it.  I tried Bane later and mez broke instantly from the DD component.  The first time though, it was down to 98% before we engaged and even got the &quot;MT has awakened&quot; message.  I kinda figured epic wouldn't break mez till the damage actually hit, but it was almost the full duration of time it took to kill the first crawler.  If I wasnt at work right now I'd grab a chanter and test it out, just so I could stop this nagging question of &quot;did that really happen?&quot; that's been in my head since yesterday morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have done this a few times, trying to get a small handfull of damage ahead of time  ....  the epic will not break mez on casting.  It does have a chance to break mez on each tic when it does damage.  The damage is so low that it often will not break mez on the first 3 or 4 tics.  I find it usually will break mez long before running its full course, though.<br />
<br />
not something ya want to do when your group/raid is having trouble keeping things locked down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">doesnt break mez when it lands, however it will break mez once the first tick hits that does damage.<br />
<br />
There is no &quot;chance&quot; - the instant it does damage it will break mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have a good MT, you should epic the mezzed mob just as soon as the first one dies.  A tank has enough time for 3 taunts before epic breaks mez.<br />
<br />
If you're good, they don't even know it was you.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It'll break mez the first tick after it lands on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe your spear is broken, go get it checked out see if it is working right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was almost calmed by the idea that it is a &quot;chance&quot; for breaking mez, that would explain it, if I had just gotten Very lucky and it didnt break for nearly a full minute.  But I too had always thought that Any damage broke mez.  I'm still perplexed by this and resolving it now that I'm just crazy.  I plan on giving it a shot again tonight in a more controled enviroment.  Hopefully my spear is broken, be pretty fokin spiffy if I could DoT all mezzed mobs.</div></div><hr />
