<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shontaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 52 Shaman and I have noticed that recently when I cast Alacrity and the pet quickness (forgot the name) on my pet and then put my pet toys on him that he does not proc very much at all if any. BUT when he looses one of the haste buffs he procs alot more. Can anyone tell me if they have noticed this or not? Or is this my Imagination?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Think its your imagination.<br />
<br />
And on another note, casting your pet buff, then alacrity is not the best buff sequence for your pet.  They appear to stack because the pet buff has str/dex etc.. on it.  Much in the same way that our haste and enc haste can both be on a player.  However, only the more powerful haste component sticks (alacrity) in your case.<br />
<br />
Cast alacrity on your pet, and then buff him like you would a player (minus agility and stamina).  If he's not going to be tanking anything, put IoS and your dexterity buff on him, as well as your strength buff.  Maximizing his dexterity will help with his procs alot.  If he's going to take some hits, use a hp buff like HoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">its imagination, haste does nothing for the procrate, not positive, not negative.<br />
<br />
it just seems it procs less because it has more hits, nothing less.<br />
<br />
procs are (afaik) measured in max proc per time unit<br />
<br />
-&gt; you have max 5 procs in 1 minute, irrelevant if your pet hits 10 or 30 times</div></div><hr />
