<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I am level 44 now and would like to hit 45 quickly, and I remember alot being said about spiders in Nurga. Could someone tell me if this would be good exp and describe how to break the camps. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would like to know also :),  and has the Nurga upgrade gone live?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well I and others posted EXTENSIVE information about how to deal with nurga, but that information is all f'ucking lost now and I'm not in the mood to spend 15-30 minute retyping what I've typed before. :( <br />
<br />
(Yes, I'm upset about it.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, because god forbid you actually do what Sunmoon asked and save copies of the threads that were important to you.  That was hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Show me where the message boards are now, and I'll go save that thread. =)<br />
<br />
Oh.. they're not up? Oh... so... uh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sithithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Soupy, I cannot believe you are whining about the boards!   Sunmoon told everyone weeks ago that if a thread was important to you, SAVE IT!.  Long before the boards were wiped.  And he's put in hours and hours improving this site, going through corrupt databases, and making this MUCH easier to get through.   And you turn around and bitch because you didn't do what he told you to do before he did what he said he was going to do?????   <br />
  Man...they swing low, don't they?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm whining about the immeasurable amount of lost content. That was our greatest asset. I don't have the energy to spend three-four hours going through posts and populating the &quot;hunting grounds&quot; forum as I once did now that it has been eviscerated. So that work is forever lost.<br />
<br />
And I'm whining on behalf of all the level 45 shaman who want to know about Nurga. I'm past level 45. I don't need this content, this dude needs it.<br />
<br />
Shrug. So much good content was lost. I do hope that they make good on their promises to put up a mirror of the old board. That might help out lots.<br />
<br />
I love the speed of the new boards, but I'll take slow-roasted ribs over fast-food muck any day. Content is king and speed is secondary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ShadoWynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Soupy, I believe the idea that was trying to be expressed here was that Sunmoon put word out quite a while before the boards were wiped that he would be doing so, and WE should save any threads we felt were valuable. Sunmoon worked his butt off to get these boards to where they are today, and Thantu went through and tried to save a lot of the threads, but you and I both know the vast wealth of information contained on the boards, and you can't expect ONE person to save every good thread out here. I can understand that you don't have much time to spend saving the threads, but think of Thantu and Sunmoon, who do this of their own free time and volunteering. In the time you spend surfing the threads, you could pick up one or two threads that you saw value in. That's all that was trying to be conveyed here. So please don't degrade the jobs that Sun and Thantu do, by piling more on their already full plates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agree everybody except soupypoopy.<br />
<br />
You toss out that &quot;they&quot; - as in &quot;I hope that they make good on their promises&quot; - as if it's some faceless evil minion playing god with your threads.  In fact, it's a couple of hardworking guys who are doing way more than we have a right to expect.  <br />
<br />
Things don't work the way you want?  Go start your own board.  The software is out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You guys aren't getting it. You get quite defensive and that blinds you to the point I'm trying to make.<br />
<br />
It's okay. I guess the real point is proven by the idiocy here. The dude who posted about nurga has gone UNHELPED because of the failure to put up a mirror in a timely fashion.<br />
<br />
Lost knowledge. So much lost knowledge. A real pity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, lost knowledge, because you were too lazy to mirror your own posts.  If your posts were so imporant, why didn't you save copies of them when Sunmoon asked you to?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Later, also by Soupypoopy:<br />
<br />
Well I and others posted EXTENSIVE information about how to deal with nurga, but that information is all f'ucking lost now and I'm not in the mood to spend 15-30 minute retyping what I've typed before <br />
<br />
Lost knowledge, you say? In your case, I'd call it a lost cause.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How bout it folks?  Any good info on Nurga spiders or da Nurga update going live?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sithithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The way I see it, Jonat has gone unhelped TODAY because the people who have the most knowledge TODAY refuse to post TODAY because, as some anonymous person put it, &quot;I'm not in the mood to spend 15-30 minutes retyping what I've typed before.&quot;<br />
<br />
    If I had any knowledge on Nurga (never hunted there myself), I would post whatever I knew.  Now, who do I know that has EXTENSIVE knowledge of Nurga......hmmmm.....there must be someone.....anyone....<br />
<br />
   Can anyone think of someone who has EXTENSIVE knowledge of Nurga that would be able to help the gentleman who pointed out that the original poster still hasn't gotten an answer?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't know a lot about nurga but I do know that the upgrades haven't gone live yet, if there are even any still planned. I'd recommend  getting a map and scoping out where the spiders are, invis to that area, experiment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Afraid I'm going to have to agree with soupy on this one.  There is no way most people can be expected to go through the hundreds or thousands of posts they've made to extract all of the information that might be useful to someone somewhere down the line.  Heck, many of the people that posted useful info aren't even here anymore.<br />
<br />
A mirror (slow, ugly, whatever) would definitely help.<br />
<br />
I thought Thantu was going through and flagging posts for saving (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=19) - I'm hoping that selections of the old content will be restored at some point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">But the old Spider Spot was one of the best solo exp grinds in the game at any level.<br />
<br />
A number of elements combine to make this a very nice experience camp. These elements are in no certain order:<br />
<br />
Very quiet zone.  This is especially nice for folks on the Bloodthirsty Punk (as opposed to Carebear) servers.  A soloer has a good chance of hunting without getting Ganked.<br />
<br />
The Mobs in the area do not roam, so once you sit down in a spot that is not within agro range of a mob you are safe.  Of course you can still get trained.<br />
<br />
At 45 a shaman has all of the spells and skills he needs to easily handle the mobs as well as travel safely in the rest of Nurga.  Invis, Gate, Ultravision, Cure Poison, Resists, Bear Form, Dots and Pet.  This may be another reason why many classes don't come to Nurga, as they do not have the unique set of skills that make Shammies of this level perfect for this spot.<br />
<br />
The Spiders give great exp for their level.  I don't know exactly why; it may be a combination of factors like dungeon bonus and that spiders are over-conned because of poison.  I personally think that the Craig Spiders of EK are a much worse deal per level than these spiders.<br />
<br />
The map is located at<br />
<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/nurga1map.html<br />
<br />
According to this map with the first coordinate being the up/down, you want to be neg 1500 by neg 100, just right of the number 1, which is labelled Spider Caves.  To your immediate left and right you should find 2 sets of 2 Briar or Bristle spiders with the infrequent Strathbone in the mix.  The rough level of the spiders will be 34-37.<br />
<br />
Getting to the spot should not be difficult as the Goblins do not see invis.  You will have to becareful to avoid the random spider spawns in the Goblin areas as they WILL be able to see invis.  I would also suggest that you spend a few minutes with a map and SCOUT out the exit.  Nurga is a 'oneway' dungeon so you cannot simply go back out the way you came in.  Of course when in doubt: GATE.<br />
<br />
For your first level or so here at 44 or 45 you will not be able to single pull.  This is fine since you should be able to land a root and pull the other mob.  With Dots and Pet you should be able to dispatch the first spider before the other one breaks root or darn near.  Repeat with the other set of 2 spiders.  If you just concentrate on these 2 sets you should be plenty busy.  Don't go looking for trouble with more.<br />
<br />
Another benefit in this area is that you have a fair amount of room to manuver.  You can always root a second and move away to safe distance.  Don't be afraid to let your dog die.  After all it is only mana.  Better him than you.<br />
<br />
I am sorry that this is impromptu without any editing, but I think it will give you enough info to start.  Some of the stuff may be wrong but I am sure that one of the good folks on the board will have time to set this stupid Hillbilly right if I am indeed wrong. Good Luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks Sion :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">With 200,000 threads on this board, there is no way I or anybody else could have had the foresight or time to catalog what was worthwhile BEFORE we even knew we needed it. Frankly, that's a bulls'hit suggestion and it misses the real issue: <br />
<br />
There is a ton of knowledge sitting off on a hard-drive somewhere, and it would be great to have access to it for a little while. <br />
<br />
Thanks for being thick. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Yuuki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I leveled from 40 - 47 at this spot, one of the best exp camps I've seen. Although you cannot do it on a regular basis, you can get singles (rarely) starting at 43 or 44 here. Best idea is to pull with enstill to break the camp.<br />
<br />
I would usually take the 2 spawns by the sleeping ogre up till 45 and jbb started working, which really made this place insane exp. Once you have broken the 2 rooms, start alternating which room you pull from. This way even if you do fall behind you will usually not lose the break. After broken I would pull with slow, stack VoS and EB and tank while dogdog chewed on em. Usually I would also have to throw in a winters roar to keep the dog from KSing me.<br />
<br />
After 45 with JBB I would pull the 2 spiders in front of the large room then start pulling from the large room. Just pull with slow and JBB/canni till dead (3 - 4 blasts + dogdog should kill them). Doing this I was able to take 8 - 9 spiders before repops with no downtime whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I think the spiders start going ligt blue at 46. At 47 too many of them were light blue and I (sadly) had to move on.</div></div><hr />

you know what i actually want? if anyone cares, hehe. i want a solo chardok write-up. though ill post that in the correct forum, you dorky two-ton-tackle-dackles!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I appreciate the help everyone has offered, I actually found some info for it on a hunting grounds thread I stumbled upon. Currently I am pulling the 2 rooms (2 spawns each) by the sleeping ogre with dogdog. Must say the experience is insane. Only taken me about 1-1 1/2 hours for a yellow and now I only sit one yellow from 45 and my jbb. Will have to test out the large room at 45. Thanks again, and btw did not mean to start an argument with this thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>buga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">After the revamp on xp pre-50 , xp is extrememly slow after lvl 30.  I was doing specter in inno. It used to be decent xp, lot of reading while medding then I came to this thread. Thanks guys. Xp is amazing. I didn't use a pet because of ksing and upkeep on jober. I did root/rot with scourge and VoS and throw in a winter roar at then end. Very easy. I had trouble in the beginning (lvl 40) with hps and mana then I remember good ole Inner fire. Don't have torpor yet, but I guess IF will do for now.:p</div></div><hr />
