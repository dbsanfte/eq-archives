<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if this was an instant cast or a 3 second cast?  If anyone knows the input would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gomorrha de'Sade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The cast time is quite long, I think about 12 seconds or so, never timed it accurately.<br />
<br />
Also, it does not seem to work as billed.  All it does is give me an icon that looks like the standard clarity icon, and stays around maybe 2 minutes.  I thought at first that I had made the wrong potions, but these were Greater Mystical Infusion.  Anyone else know what is going on here?  Did VI nerf this potion?<br />

I've made a few of them for testing purposes.  Seemed to boost my mana and mana pool as advertised.. and lasts a pathetically short time.  (&quot;Oh they'll use this mana in a minute anyway, so no need having a duration longer than that!&quot;)<br />
<br />
It's like when you put a Talisman up when low health.  If it's already up, it's a visible heal.  If it's not, the effect seems much smaller since the new hit points are added as your hp total also increases.  <br />
<br />
It's another potion I might carry if it were, oh, about 150p cheaper to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gomorrha de'Sade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I checked today and the cast time was 30 seconds. ROFL<br />
<br />
No such thing as chain casting these suckers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hahaha! I came back to edit my original post.  Made one to double-check.<br />
<br />
I noticed that Titan potions are 30 seconds, too.  Now THERE'S a potion what would be seriously imbalanced with a short cast time.</div></div><hr />
