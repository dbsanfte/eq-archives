<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dinged 65 about 2 weeks ago, yay.  :)  Got some questions:<br />
<br />
- I'm currently working towards Canni 5.  Is this normally used in conjunction with Canni 4?  Or do you guys even mem Canni 4 anymore?  It would be nice to free up a spell slot.<br />
<br />
- Same sort of question for when I finally get Quiescence.  I only have Stoicism right now, no Torpor or Quiescence.  My main heal is Tnarg's, since I'm usually only on spot-heal duty in most situations.  When I finally get Q, will this become my main heal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can5 is nice, but it's not always save to use. Can4 is something you don't use too often, but I always keep the spell memmed for when it gets hectic.  I rarely run out of mana unless I'm spamming fast heals, and usually when I have to do that something is seriously amiss.<br />
Q will become your main heal as soon as you get it, it's amazing how many tanks you can keep alive with it and not run out of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">canni V is great, but canni IV is still extrememly useful.<br />
<br />
In LDoN I use both that way I can dot adds, nuke singles or just plain waste mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As far as Stoicism goes... don't ever mem it again.  Yes, it's the same general effect as Torpor, but Kragg's Mending is much more mana efficient for healing yourself up from canni.<br />
<br />
Also, yes, keep Canni4 memmed.  I will admit, however, that I don't canni4 much anymore.  If I'm doing a lot, buffing, debuffing, nuking, rooting, dotting, etc., etc., I'll be so busy there won't be time to canni4.  Then I'll just pop Can5, hit torpor (Kragg's in your case), and be good for another little bit.  I might hit can4 a couple times.  But don't unmem canni4.  You never know when you might need it.  It's like keeping root memmed all the time (unless you've got clicky root, obviously).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use canni 5 and STILL use canni 4 lots.  It probably has something to do with the fact that I'm almost always casting SOMETHING - just can't break the habit of having a level 65 bard I guess.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I still manage to get down to 30% mana at times even with both canni 4 and 5.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The answers to your questions are situational.<br />
<br />
Can5 is mostly used in conjunction with Can4 for optimal result.<br />
<br />
When it ocmes to healing Tnarg will be your fast heal in emergency situations. Kragg is in between, a bit more health a bit slower.<br />
<br />
Quiesence is the ultimate healing spell when you dont need to heal someone who is dropping fast ie unslowed/hard mobs etc<br />
<br />
Quiesence will be even better when you bag Spell Casting Reinforcement and Mastery thus making it last longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can4 is something you don't use too often, <br />
<br />
I never stop casting Canni4.  I'm tanking and still casting it.  I've no idea how you can keep up manawise but just using Cann5.<br />
<br />
Canni5 is awesome but it is only 1000mana every three minutes.  When compared to the manacost of bloodofsaryan and tugurs that gets eaten up on the next mob.<br />
<br />
Each to their own but even with C5, Pot9, and SD on I still am clicking Canni4 every few seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A well played shaman should always be casting a spell. You should click Canni5 every time it pops up, basically immediately after it pops up. You should cast Canni4 every time you don't have a more important spell that needs casting.<br />
<br />
If you are not using your mana fast enough to need to canni this much, then you are not casting enough spells. Nuke more, DoT more, keep FA on every melee and pet, etc. If all else fails, go pull something :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Within reason re:Canni5 (depends on safety issues) I agree 100% with Ximix.  I cannot ever imagine 'rarely using' canni IV.  I'm constantly casting/canning; there's always something a shaman can be doing in any situation, and no, I don't mean meleeing. (Of course, you lucky EP flagged people with that 2h staff I can't recall the name of, you are excused for meleeing) <br />
<br />
So basically, what most of us here seem to be saying, is that you're not going to be freeing up your Canni IV slot any time soon, unless you're a &quot;%t is slowed, now sit back and do nothing until next mob is inc&quot; type of shaman.<br />
<br />
Just my 2c</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Canni IV is still my most used spell.<br />
<br />
Canni 5 gets used when it pops.<br />
<br />
Kraggs is at the back of my spellbook. I never use it.<br />
<br />
I spam heal and assist heal with Tnargs.<br />
<br />
I use Qui on myself after Canni 5 and when I'm getting hit but in no danger of dying.</div></div><hr />

This was exactly what I was going to say in response.  Thanks for saving me the trouble of typing :D<br />
<br />
It really isn't that hard to do.  Once you have all the mobs debuffed, just start nuking (or healing if needed).  Your mana should be slowly decreasing over time, so just click canni4 in between nukes to try to stabilize it.  Since canni4 is much more efficient than sitting down to med, you should always be casting.  If at any time you aren't casting, you aren't playing to your full potential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are shamans who will stand there, or god forbid meditate, for more than 6 seconds without casting a spell?  What a complete waste.  Perhaps the druid class has what you're looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree, cast cast cast.  I Cann4 all the time.  Only time I'm not casting is when I'm afk or FM.  Being a shaman is about time management more than anything (do I have time to Cann 4 before I need to refresh Q on the MT?  should I waste 8 seconds casting epic or nuke/cann?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I canni 4 so much I've been known to do it when I'm FM out of habit.<br />
<br />
And we won't talk about last night when I was fighting a mob in valor and I hit cann 5 when I had 1800 hp...fortunately he was rooted but it sure scared the crap outta me.  Even more fortunate for me I had just cast Q and it hit JUST before canni 5 did so I had enough hp and didn't die :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On the heals part of the question, Kraggs still has a place for me as the backfill heal to catch up with mob damage.  For example, I was main healer last night in a fast pulling group in BoT Upper Sands.  What I found with a moderately geared MT was that Q will basically negate the dps of the slowed mob, and maybe gain a little bit of ground towards a heal, but you need to backfill with some other heal to recover the damage the mob initially did before it was slowed.  So I would Malo, Slow, Q the tank, then later backfill with Kraggs, saving Tnargs for emergencies like slow resists.  This worked for me even when the MT went LD and we had the beastlord tank for awhile.  I used Kraggs for efficiency, and Q made the long cast time feasible because mob dps was essentially halted by the Q while I wait for Kraggs to land.  Now if I had all the healing AA's to beef up Tnargs, maybe that would make Kraggs not worth the trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There are 4 things to do at any given time for a shaman.<br />
<br />
1. casting something<br />
2. swapping spells<br />
3. moving<br />
4. waiting on a res<br />
<br />
Anything else means you're just wasting time. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd just like to add another voice to the &quot;a shaman not casting *some* spell is wasting time&quot; chorus.   :p   I occasionally read that people rarely use it, or don't mem it after getting canni 5.....yeesh.<br />
<br />
The only time (except death) that I demem it is when I'm buffing for ldon and load 6 group buffs with a saved spell set.  Often, if I don't buff immediately, I'll end up casting group sta a few times wondering why my mana isn't going up.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks guys, but that really wasn't the question hehe :)  I never asked &quot;should I always be casting?&quot;.  I asked if canni 4 was used much after one attained canni 5.  Some folks did answer that though, so good job. :)<br />
<br />
It appears it's common practice to use both in conjunction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Btw, I only have 13 AA points atm, so I'm not to canni 5 stage yet.  One thing that kinda irks me about canni 4 is that it has twice the cast time as the previous Canni 3...  and since I have mini lag-spikes all the time, it makes a canni macro pretty much useless when I'm in dungeons.<br />
<br />
Right now I spend so much time canni'ing....  almost constant canni'ing.  I've only got FT1 so hehe.  I was originally just wondering if Canni 5 relieved some of that time-consumption and allowed me to spend my time casting other spells and allow me to free up a spell slot for something else...  never seem to have enough spell-slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't know about ne1 else, but i'm almost out of mana all the time, so i HAVE to med. i also only have Canni1, so it don't do crap. i also always have Virtue and c3 cast on me (alot of hp, so canni don't do much, but alot of mana, so canni don't give me much). thinking about trying to get Canni2, but it seems like such a long quest when Canni3 is rite aroudn the corner (i think low 50s ? will double check on this &lt;sigh&gt;). will do more research on Canni2 tho. just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I was originally just wondering if Canni 5 relieved some of that time-consumption and allowed me to spend my time casting other spells and allow me to free up a spell slot for something else...  never seem to have enough spell-slots.<br />
<br />
I don't know about others, but I've mastered the art of &quot;hot-swapping,&quot; changing spells on the fly during combat, using the right-click spellbook feature.<br />
<br />
I have spells I commonly use saved as a 1 spell spell set (you do this by unmemming all your spells and memming only that one in the spell slot where you want it to go, then saving the spell set.  Done this way, the auto-mem doesn't delete all your memmed spells, it only mems the spell in the spell set), so when you activate the spellset, only one spell gets memmed.  If you unmem the spell in that spellslot before hitting the spellset, it happens so quickly that you can sit, mem, and stand up if you're tanking a slowed mob, before it has a chance to hit you.<br />
<br />
We have 8 spell slots, but when I solo, I use about 12 spells all the time...so I have 6 &quot;one-shots,&quot; 6 one spell spell sets.  I use a spell, unmem it, then swap in the next one.<br />
<br />
This makes cycling DoT's fast and easy, preventing you from having to keep them all up and active.  I only have one DoT spell slot, which I cycle, through BoS, BoU, Bane of Nife, Bane, and even occassionally Envenomed Bolt (I don't have my epic yet, but I can put about 5 DoT's on a mob at once by using this trick).<br />
<br />
You can pull this trick even without using spell sets just by unmemming a spell and using the right-click feature on the empty spell slot.  If you know exactly where the spell you want is on the menu, you can get the spell memmed before Turgur's refreshes after a slow.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't use this trick, I suggest everyone create a &quot;gate&quot; one-shot...Gate in the slot of your choice.  That way you can quick-mem gate and root like a wildman til it activates, so you can gate to safety if things go wrong.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't there a way to do this via a hotkey as well?  /loadspellset &lt;name&gt; or something if I recall correctly...<br />
<br />
I'd pump out more dots but then root would break...what do you do to combat this problem?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Dinged 65 about 2 weeks ago, yay.  :)  Got some questions:<br />
<br />
- I'm currently working towards Canni 5.  Is this normally used in conjunction with Canni 4?  Or do you guys even mem Canni 4 anymore?  It would be nice to free up a spell slot.<br />
<br />
I haven't dememed cann 4 yet but I'm considering it. For you i'd expect you to want to keep cann 4 memed. On the other hand when you have SCM, 15% mana pres item, ft 15 and a nearly 6k mana pool things are a bit difference. Combine that with horse, c5, po9, SD and bard song in raid situations and you have a huge amount of mana regen and personally I have a hard time using it all even chain casting nukes. Eventually you get to the point where cann 4 doesn't improve things significantly. I can easily keep entire group buffed, slow all mobs and throw a fair amount of nukes around with out ever casting a cann 4. Sure i might be able to get a few more off here and there but it doesn't seem worth the effort anymore since i'm already doing alot. Combine that with my q doing 2100-2400 points healed and you have to cann down forever before you can heal your self up efficiently.<br />
<br />
- Same sort of question for when I finally get Quiescence.  I only have Stoicism right now, no Torpor or Quiescence.  My main heal is Tnarg's, since I'm usually only on spot-heal duty in most situations.  When I finally get Q, will this become my main heal?<br />
<br />
Most people still end up with both memed. Q is a very efficient heal when your in a situation where they don't have to be healed NOW. That enchanter getting pounded on by the mob that resisted mes isn't gonna be saved by a q. You need tnargs for that. Once they've got the mob messed on the other hand q is a great way to fill them up. 200 mana for 1200 min healed is alot more efficient that 450 for 1300 healed and scrm significantly improves what q heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rroq<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about creating a hotkey for it, since I always use the right-click.<br />
<br />
As to roots, it depends on the mob as to how I'm soloing it.  I tend to be a &quot;Shank&quot;, Shaman tank, so when I solo, I'm usually tanking the mob after I've slowed and crippled it, while dogdog bites his butt.  I hit it with DoT's while it's trying to beat on me, hot-swapping my DoT's during melee.<br />
<br />
On rougher mobs, I use a dual approach of pet tanking and root rotting until I have my DoTs on him, then I wade in for melee after it's dying by degrees.  I pull the mob with a weak spell (BURST OF FLAME baby!!!!) and sic dogdog on it to gain aggro.  This is EASY when you've equipped your dogdog with mage proc weapons and maxed his dex with Mortal Deftness and IoS, with Talisman of Kragg on him for some extra HP.  Dogdog attacks, gains aggro.  You slow the mob after dogdog has taken him down to about 97-96%hp to build up some aggro, Q your dog (he'll need some healing), then DoT the mob until you get aggro.  Then you root, back up, DoT, and keep at it until root breaks or you've loaded the mob with all your DoTs.  If root breaks, just root again, back out, hit it with another DoT, and repeat until you've stacked all your DoT's on the mob.  Then you wade in for some in-your-face melee action to keep your now seriously wounded dog from dying.  ;)<br />
<br />
It doesn't give you much time to canni, but when I solo, I kill the mob first and worry about mana regen after it's dead. :D<br />
<br />
I don't solo in PoP (I lack uber gear and only have 14 AA points), so I've never tried this tactic against anything that hits harder than 200-250 a shot.  But against the mobs I do solo, either of these techniques works, and works well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
LOL, the only time I sit down is to stop the cleric from healing me after my canny5 even though I've told him about 6 times not to.  Oh, by the way I think some are a bit extreme on this board about cannying - do yourself a favor and always canny4 when you are fm at least once or twice - thats free mana.  But there is no need to canny down and run around at 80% or less.  #1 it is dangerous #2 it confuses the (cough cough cleric).  I've been in a few double shammy groups where I was just shaking my head at the other shammy who was constantly at 50% health.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If I'm not FM, I canni.  CanniV if available, Canni4 otherwise.  If I get down to 70% health or so, I Quiesce myself.  And then keep Canni'ing.  I don't see that I'd be doing myself a favor by sitting there at less than FM without canni'ing just because it'll take me down to 70.<br />
<br />
I usually Q on inc as well if I'm below 90, I like to be full when the mob gets there.  But Q is so cheap that two canni4's + natural mana regen just about pay for it, so it's virtually impossible to take a LOSS casting Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">And now for something completely different (yet the same...)<br />
<br />
Many people talk about maximizing this or maximizing that.  For what purpose?  Squeeze 3 or 4 more mobs per hour?  Impress people?<br />
<br />
However, this is all kind of a moot point since I never do pick up groups.  I am not dps and my guildies don't expect it.  I buff, debuff, back up heal, cc if necessary, and keep everything running smoothly - they kill it.  <br />
<br />
Also, depending on the dps and puller, you may not actually have time to caniv.  <br />
<br />
I bust my ass on raids so I would like to relax a bit while exp'n.  Play how you want to play.<br />

Too many damn BSD's in this game (and world).</div></div><hr />

I have the opportunity to group with other Shamans on occasion and I am shocked when I see them casting once every 30 seconds.  Call me a spammer but I'm going to contribute to the raid/group as hard as I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">/memspellset is the command.<br />
<br />
i.e.  3 of my spellsets are listed below<br />
&quot;base&quot;<br />
1-Quiessence<br />
2-Canni4<br />
3-blank<br />
4-Tnargs<br />

So If I just get ressed up I &quot;/mems base&quot; and then if I need to buff &quot;/mems buff&quot; and once that's done I go into nuke/xp mode by typing &quot;/mems xp&quot;<br />
<br />
I also have a few specific buffs for mid raid swapping like &quot;soul&quot; is nothing but Focus of Soul in slot 6, or &quot;sta&quot; is nothing but Boar in slot 5.  That let's me quickly swap in a buff to rebuff dead people mid raid and then quickly get back to my old spell setup.<br />
<br />
Last tip, keep one spellset named &quot;current&quot; or something to that effect and once you have your spells setup for a particular situation save it as current if it's not a standard set already.  Then you can swap stuff in mid-fight and do a &quot;/mem curr&quot; to go right back to the original setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I actually make sure I'm balanced out on health and mana, and I try to keep a nice reservoir of mana and health for those situations when the fit hits the shan, and we gotta get down to the nitty-gritty.  Having multiple mobs in camp can drain the mana pretty fast, and you don't wanna get caught with yer pants down (low mana).<br />
<br />
Generally I keep my mana at the same level as my health, if not a touch above.  Hps = future mana, and if you're full health, you're wastin' future mana.<br />

It really depends on the situation... sometimes I get in a really slow group, and when that happens, I take it easy.  'Cause I know the next group will probably make me work my ass off hehe.<br />

On raids it's a never-ending work-session of keeping everyone buffed and mobs de-buffed.</div></div><hr />
