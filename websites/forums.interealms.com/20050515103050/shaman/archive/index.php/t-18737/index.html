Extended Rabid Bear and Quick MGB buff  and swarm melleeing shammies<br />
<br />
/em asks SoE to use the KY <br />
<br />
SoE Laughs and pulls out the sandpaper and barbwire!!<br />
  :mad:  :mad:  :mad:  :mad:  :mad:  :mad:  :mad:  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So far, quick MGB has been proven to be an Enchanter only skill.<br />
Helps to read the thread(s) that were already started for the GoD AA's. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;Bestial Alignment<br />
Proposed 6.5 minute Beastlord Activated skill which will allow them to change into the form of their pet (Bear, Tiger, Alligator, Scaled Wolf), similar to what Mages already have. The forms come complete with generous stat boosts, including, at this time, 40 STA, 150 ATK, Decreased Stamina Loss by &quot;10&quot;, and 65 to All Resists. They are working with 3 levels of this ability, although there is no difference in them so far (which may simply mean that the timer between uses gets shorter with each skill level).&quot;<br />
<br />
So a better version of rabid bear, with +65 to all resists.<br />
<br />
Is it just me or does this AA feel like a big &quot;**** You!&quot; from Sony? =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Our class AA's have never really been strong.  We really only have two good ones that are shaman specific: canni5 and virulent paralysis.  I would neither be surprised nor disappointed if our class AA's are, once again, unimpressive.  If we get enhancements to archetype abilities, I'll be a happy guy.  Those are the AAs that really count.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They copied Ferocity into the spdat and renamed it as bestial alignment.  Whatever the actual spell/ability will be is not final.<br />
<br />
Feel free to look at Divine Avatar 1-3 as well.  Exact copies of Ferine Avatar.<br />
<br />
Grats on jumping the gun though with the bitching. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah I agree with Sciek, why get all worked up over what &quot;might&quot; happen?  Let's just wait till it happens and then flip out... you guys sound like my old lady &quot;OMG there is a new person being hired that probably means that they will have to get rid of someone and since I'm the newest person they'll probably get rid of me!!!!&quot;   This is when I just look at her and say &quot;You sure are pretty&quot;.  Why do people spend so much time worrying about what maybe could possibly happen sometime in the near or maybe distant future?<br />
<br />
I'm all for ranting if when the expansion comes out they hose us let's then all get together and start a big rant message that then SoE can ignore.  But for now let's not start any big rant messages for them to ignore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd rather bitch and be prepared for the lameness of the shammy class additions then get all pumped up and be disappointed.  You have to admit that shaman haven't gotten anything to be excited about in about 4 expansions.<br />
<br />
Slam</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">*shrug* I'm still having fun and loving my class.  I would LIKE to have bigger heals and better nukes but I still think we are a great class and as balanced as they get.<br />
<br />
I think they got way out of whack with Rangers and Beastlords... Rangers having their EndlessQuiver, AM3, TS disc is just sick damage for bosses and they can do it from 4.6 miles away well well outside of AE damage range so they are just huge dots with zero need for heal.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are Monks that get buffs/slow/heal/pet.  If I was a monk I'd be way way pissy that the only thing I got over a BL was FD and Mend while they got a ton of goodies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd rather bitch and be prepared for the lameness of the shammy class additions then get all pumped up and be disappointed.

<br />
Slam<br />
<br />
My point is simply this: If you're going to bitch, at least bitch about actual changes you know to be complete.  At the very least wait until you can be reasonably sure the changes are complete and you know what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Divine Avatar<br />
A 3-tier ability, seemingly for Shamans but listed here among likely Cleric abilities, it appears to be Activated and is, so far, slated to be a 140 point boost to STR, DEX, AGI, and ATK. Higher tiers currently show the same stats, so they will either be raised even higher, or higher skill levels will translate to shorter recast delay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Divine Avatar is a straight up cut and paste of Ferine Avatar.  The BST one is a straight copy and paste of Ferocity.  This is nothing new though.  SoE has done this before when introducing new abilities/spells.  They come up with a name for the new spell, slap a copy of an exisiting spell into the spdat with the new name and then later patch in the actual ability.<br />
<br />
You're bitching about what is likely nothing more than a placeholder.  Give it a couple weeks and as we get nearer to actual release date I'd expect that we'll see these abilities getting patched into a final form.  <br />
<br />
Now, if someone is beta'ing GoD and can say with some certainty that X ability is for Y class and does Z, then feel free to comment on that.  As is though, you're commenting on nothing but speculation.</div></div><hr />
