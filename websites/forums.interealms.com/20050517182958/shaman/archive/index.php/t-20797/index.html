<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Conal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks, been a long time since I wandered the halls here on the Crucible. Used to wander here as Dwyrnacht from Rodcet, but that was over 2 and a half years ago, so seriously doubt anyone remembers me.<br />
<br />
I know alot of things have changed over that time, and of course will be playing the only class I truly loved back then, which was my shaman. Not gonna ask any silly questions like what race is best and all, since I know the answer to that is whatever you will enjoy logging into. Though as of right now, I have no idea what race. Dwyr used to be a barbarian, but not sure if I will be heading back to the frozen north or not. <br />
<br />
To my questions.<br />
1. Have always been a casual roleplayer, but I enjoy being surronded by roleplayers. Dude speak, kind of grates on my nerves and try to avoid it as much as I can. I know of Firiona Vae is the official roleplay server, but what other servers have a good and strong roleplay base still?<br />
<br />
2. Last expansion I actively played was Velious, bought Luclin but went back to DAOC anyways, so really did not play that much with it. Planning on buying Evolutions and Lost Dungeons any other expansion I should get right now, or can I wait on the others cant remember if there was 1 or 2 of them?<br />
<br />
3. How are the Zek servers now? Granted I randomly played on them, when I played back then, but coming back from DAOC and well I enjoy the rvr there. Granted will be playing both games, I just really miss the content of EQ.<br />
<br />
4. I still have friends on Rodcet, who I am sure would love to help me get back addicted to EQ, but really not sure I want to go back there. Kind of looking at this adventure as starting fresh and working for what I need. Any servers that folks would recommend?<br />
<br />
Thanks all for your time.<br />

Heya =) I'll try to answer for Sullon Zek. <br />
Roleplay is very very rare here, as Sullon seam to attract uhm.. a diffrent kind of people =)<br />
Having said that, you do occasionally bump into roleplayers. From my experience, Good team seams to have the largest population of RPs. You might want to look into the guild Wolves of Retribution, where is where I've met most of the roleplaying people of Sullon.<br />
<br />
Sullon is harsh, brutal and cruel. 85 % of the people you meet are tards =P the remaining 15% are really nice folks who just enjoy PvP and have fun on the server.<br />
<br />
About expansions.. I would skip GoD for now if I was you. It's mainly high end expansion, LDoN is also optional imo. LoY is nice since it added a lot of tools (maps, raid tools, guildfunctions etc). PoP is nice, since it saves you a lot of time runing around, and also, it brings some new zones for you when you are 46+.<br />
<br />
Good luck and welcome back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're going to want to see higher zones even while being casual, check which servers have good pickup raid culture: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19127</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Conal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Samanna, good link.<br />
<br />
Honestly I am really thinking of starting back on Firiona Vae. If I remember right, it was the last server I was on when I left. It was farely new though.<br />
<br />
Will be somethings that will need to get used to on it, but I like the atmosphere that seems to come from there.<br />
<br />
Problem is I tend to solo alot. With having kids and all, I might need to walk away at any given moment, and well I hate doing that to people, so I tend to solo more than not, so I dont end up making folks wait for me.<br />
<br />
Are shamans still a good solo class, was pretty good when I left. And though I am really planning on playing my shaman anyone know anything I dont from the last 2 years that maybe I ought to think of another class since of my soloing?<br />
<br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, Shaman is all I play, but I understand that Druids and especially Necros (FD and go AFK) solo better than we can. I'm sure you'll get plenty of feedback on it, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I may be wrong but yes shaman can still solo well. The best solo classes are still Druid, Necro and Bard. If you are going to put a lot of time in, at the high end an enchanter is unmatched as a solo class...getting there is another thing.<br />
<br />
With the changes there is no real replacement for grouping as the quickest way to advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, shaman are still very good at soloing.  However, solo experience has been nerfed quite a bit.  With the right AA's you can still do it pretty efficently though.<br />
<br />
If you still feel the need to solo, then I would recommend investing inL<br />
<br />
Cannibalize V (AA Canni)<br />
Virulent Paralysis (root with knockback)<br />
Spirit Call (swarm puppies)<br />
<br />
You may have known all that already, but i'm sure someone else that reads this may find it usefull.<br />
<br />
Some of the better solo zones I can think of are Veksar, Temple of Droga (much harder after revamp), Plane of Tactics (you'll need a flag for this one).<br />
<br />
If you need any more information on these zones, they are all covered VERY well in the 60-65 hunting section.  Just search for it.  Expansion-wise, i'd look at getting Planes of Power, Legacy of Ye.....err,  Lost Dungeons of Norrath.  Lost Dungeons of Norrath (LDoN) has got to be one of my favorite expansions, and is probabbly the main reason i'm still playing EQ.  But if you buy any, get LDoN and PoP.<br />
<br />
Well, hope my senseless rambling has shed some light.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can't recommend a beastlord highly enough.  Especially a troll....  You missed luclin, so here's the sum up.  Beastlord is what a lot of us thought we were getting when we rolled up a shaman.  Great buffs, good soloing, worthwhile melee.  Get an embalmer's skinning nife for free bandages forever, and go to town.  Beastlord is everything you loved about the shaman, but with more soloing power.  Slow is a little worse, but that's okay, you have the pre-nerf monk avoidance tables and a really amazing (90%) damage avoidance discipline at 51.  Quick heal isn't that great, but you get the best pet heal in the game.  Atk buffs and mana/hp regen buffs mean you'll be a benefit to any group, even before you add your significant damage potential.<br />
<br />
It's a very very self-sufficient class, and can solo better than any non-kiting class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I second that.<br />
<br />
Frankly, many of the expansions are so inexpensive I'd probably just get them all.<br />
<br />
But, to me, PoP is a *must* have.  It greatly improves travel.<br />
<br />
LDoN is also quite important, you can buy a lot of neat stuff with LDoN points, to a Shaman it means a new line of fast acting DoT's . . . a Curse line.<br />
<br />
LoY has some very useful things . . . primary among them is the Shaman Stoicism quest.  It's a mini-Torpor which at the level you get it is EXTREMELY useful.<br />
<br />
Luclin gives you the ability to enter the Bazaar to buy and sell items and utilize Paludal Caverns for leveling your character very quickly.  There are a number of spells that the vendors in Shadowhaven are the only source for.<br />
<br />
Kunark and Velious each have some unique spells, though these spells are often available in the Bazaar on Luclin.<br />
<br />
I do NOT recommend purchase of the GoD expansion UNLESS you plan to be a group leader.  If you plan to be a group leader, the leadership abilities in GoD are wonderful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Conal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually went on ahead and bought Evolutions and LDoN last night and loaded everything up. <br />
<br />
Talk about learning curve. :) Only good thing was, I just made a bunch of new characters and walked around cities just to look around and get the feel again. Plus found a portal book and ported over to there and walked around alot.<br />
<br />
Have to totally get used to the controls again, but will come back in time.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to playing again. Granted still play DAOC cause I enjoy the rvr, but nothing like E for content and fluff still to this day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">about coming back....<br />
<br />
<br />
in pulp fiction marsellus wallace put it well<br />
<br />
&quot;.....you leave town tonight. And when you're gone you stay gone... or you BE gone.....&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
You managed to beat the game STAY AWAY. World of warcraft is not so far away and chances are once it's out nobody will get out of their home and it will be cold by then and until spring comes we will all be 400 lb. So use this summer to slim down whatever needs to be slimmed down to prepare for the fattening of wow :D<br />
<br />
What i just said may not make sense in fact i have no idea why i wrote it but i think it's right. I gotta stop the drugs :)<br />
