<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried accessing Magelo today, and got a request for a file download ~500kb, and when you try to access someones profile its garbled text. Anyone else with same problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In Internet Explorer go to tools--&gt;Internet Options--&gt;Advanced and under HTTP 1.1 Settings make sure you check the box that is next to &quot;Use HTTP 1.1 through Proxy connections&quot;.<br />
<br />
That should do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure why it would've changed on you, but that's usually what happens if you don't have Use HTTP 1.1 and use HTTP 1.1 through proxies checked on your advanced internet options.  (Tools...Options...Advanced in the IE menus).<br />

Edit: Doh, I was too slow! ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Magelo has had some problems lately. I think it was a combination of a server transfer and the OOW update, but for a good while the AA count was off, items weren't showing up, and alternate profiles were gone. They've seemingly fixed most of the issues, though alternate profiles on EVERY profile I look at are complete garble. The main profile shows up okay, but alternates are out of the question -- even mine, which were completely wiped clean and deleted. The new alternates I made last night for my profile are garble. Haven't been prompted for the download, though.<br />
