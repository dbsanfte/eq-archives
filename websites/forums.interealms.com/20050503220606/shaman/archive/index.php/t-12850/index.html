<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Capucinette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking for a summary to &quot;what AA you should look into mostly&quot; with AA skills ordered in their repective categories from most useful to least useful. <br />
<br />
But I could not find it with the &quot;search&quot; function yet :p   <br />
<br />
I was looking for something in this style (enchanter thread) :  http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=78131 <br />
and I was wondering if somebody might have posted a similar thread for shamans.  :)  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my opinion, <br />
Can V is most important  Run speed 3 is desired, MC3 required<br />
ND3 follows in importance (you don't want low health aggro when you Can V)<br />
MGB follows if:  you raid regularly with a large guild and have Fo7<br />
SCRM is next as it extends buff life (including Torpor/Quiescence)<br />
RC1 and VP1 follow as they have a lot of functionality for a few points<br />
SC1 is next for RP and fun (&quot;Cry HAVOK! and let slip the Puppies O Powa!&quot;)<br />
CA3/LR5 follows as Bears only like THEMSELVES hurting themselves<br />
CS3 follows as if someone DOES hit ya, a little mitigation doesn't hurt<br />
SCM is next as lowering mana cost on 61+ spells is good<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom of the list:<br />
Alchemy Mastery:  still sux, little use, too expensive<br />
Increased Rabidity:  proof that Verant not only hates us, but thinks we're stupid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">General Abilities:<br />
<br />
Run3/Regen3<br />
<br />
Some people say to get enhanced stamina instead of these, but I think that's really dumb.  You get diminished returns on stamina past 255, and that's pretty easy to hit.  Before that, 5 stamina is going to give you 15 HP, which is kind of worthless. Run3 is priceless, and regen 3 will give you those 15 HP every 30 seconds, so this is a no brainer in my eyes.  Get these two and leave general alone.<br />
<br />
Archetype Abilities:<br />
<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
<br />
This is your number one priority.  1 mana a tick for 2AA (1 rank of of MC) is nice.  After the first rank you get diminished returns.  4 more AA nets you 1 more FT, which kind of sucks.  6 more AA to get just 1 more FT which definately sucks.  However MC3 is vital because it is a prereq for:<br />
<br />
Class Abilities:<br />
<br />
Cannibalize 5<br />
<br />
This AA skill is god.  Anyone that says otherwise doesn't have it.  Hitting canni5 every 3 minutes amounts to about 30 mana/tick if you spread it out.  That's huge.  The best part about canni5 is that if you need mana and have health, you don't have to sit there for a minute casting canni4.  You just hit your button and BOOM you have mana.  Go straight for canni5 - almost everyone agrees on this.<br />
<br />
After canni5, these AA's are useful (more or less in order):<br />
<br />
Mass Group Buff - At first I wasn't going to get this AA until later in my AA path.  Then, I had to buff a 9 group raid by myself without it.  Then, we wiped and I had to buff them all again.  Once the raid was over I immediately went out and AA'd for about 16 hours to get this AA.  I am very glad I got it.  You'll be glad you have it, and so will everyone else in your guild.  If you aren't in a raiding guild, though, you can skip this one.<br />
Natural Durability 3 - 10% increase to base HP, which is very nice.  It isn't as big an increase for us as it is for a tank, but it is still awesome.<br />
Spell Casting Mastery 3 - Big mana savings on your spec line spells.  I stopped playing for a while and left my friend with access to my account.  When I came back, he had gotten me SCM3.  Since I didn't see stages 1 or 2, I got to see how big a difference it was going from nothing to MC3.  I noticed a very noticable difference, and was quite pleased.<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement 3 - prereq for:<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery - 50% buff extension.  Once you get this, it will seem like your torpor lasts damn near forever, which makes a very big difference for IN TEH FACE soloing.  With extended enhancement focus, your other buffs last a very, very, very long time.  One MGB focus and I usually won't have to worry about anything except rebuffs for the rest of the raid.  11 minute avatars are great, and it is very nice for making those damned haste/regen buffs last longer.  This is an underated AA that many people do not get, but I am very pleased with it.<br />
Radient Cure - Radient Cure 1 is nice.  It gets rid of lots of annoying little effects easily and quickly.  I only have 1 rank of this so I can't tell you about the high levels, but many people say that ranks 2 and 3 are even better.<br />
Quick Buff - I have 1 rank of this, and intend on getting a second.  The cap on buff haste is 50%.  With QB2 and a haste of mithaniel item, you will hit 45% haste.  That is close enough for me.  The downside is that the focus item won't work for torpor, so it will only have 25% haste.  A 3 second torpor (vs 4.5) may or may not be worth 9 AA points.  I will probably get it eventually but QB3 is not high on my list.<br />
Healing Adept - Makes your heals heal for more.  Having better heals is self explanitory, and is obviously a good thing.<br />
Virulent Paralysis - I don't have this AA, but it is easy to imagine having it.  I think 1 rank of this would be well worth the 2 points to get it.  A fast, low-resist root can be a life saver.  I can't imagine the higher levels of it being worthwhile, though.<br />
Combat Agility - Makes the mob miss you more often.  It is definately a must-have for melees, but looks to be only mediocre for shamans.  When I am exping I get hit on a regular basis, but rarely is my life in danger.  On a raid, I rarely aggro, and when I do, I am screwed anyways.  CA3 could be worth the 12 points, but only if you are ready to invest another 15 in to:<br />
Lightning Reflexes 5 - Basically just more combat agility.  People with both CA3 and LR5 will swear by it.  I believe it would be worthwhile, but 27 AA is a LOT to anyone but the most hardcore AAers.<br />
<br />
Useless but fun AA:<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear - Gives you double attack, 200 atk, and 99% haste for 5 minutes every 2 hours.  This AA is decent for dueling and good for a laugh every 2 hours, but is more or less useless.  If the devs were to shorten the reuse timer or make it a permanent improvement to the form of the great bear spell, it would be pretty spiffy.  For the moment though, it sucks.<br />
Spirit Call - Summons multiple pets to fight for you (3, 4, and 5 for ranks 1-3, respectively).  This AA was lots of fun and I was very happy with it for the first few weeks of PoP.  I liked to see my horde of pets, and I loved people saying &quot;what exploit are you using to do that?&quot;  Now, though, everyone and their mother has this AA, and the novelty has worn off.  It's useful as a damage boost while soloing, but that's about it.  I wouldn't advise getting the second or third ranks.  You only get one additional pet for too high an AA cost.<br />
Spell Casting Fury - This would be a fun AA to have, but only because it is fun to see yourself critting.  We can do decent damage with rains and nukes, and that decent damage made even more respectable by SCF.  I will probably never get this AA, because I rarely have the opportunity to use my nukes and rains.  I am almost always much busier with more important things, and leave the nuking to the wizards and mages.<br />
<br />
AA's I don't want:<br />
<br />
Alchemy Mastery - This AA gets a /rude from me.  I would rather put points into innate charisma.<br />
Pet Discipline - Makes it so that your pet won't move until you tell him to.  The only use I could ever think of for this AA is when I am soloing WW dragons and I don't want my pet to run after them when I get hit by an AE while pulling.  You can easily accomplish what pet discipline does by spamming /pet back off.  If it was only 2 points, I might get it, but definately not for 6.  Good for classes that use pets on raids, but not for us.<br />
Healing Gift - Gives you a chance to critical heal.  This is a good theory, but I would much rather have the the stable increase in heals from healing adept than the criticals from healing gift.  Usually when I am healing, I am healing someone tanking a slowed mob.  This means the damage being done is very constant and manageable.  I usually heal them with kragg's when their health is down about 2k.  If I were to crit a heal in such a situation, it would be wasted because they are at full health already.  The constant 10% increase from healing adept will always work.  The only time healing gift would be better is when you are blast healing someone that is about to die.  If someone was at low life and you landed a crit tnarg's on them, they have a better chance of living than if it was just a normal blast.  I would rather have something reliable though, so I skip this AA.<br />
Channeling Focus - Makes you channel 15% better at rank 3.  In my mind, that is not anywhere near enough to be worth 12 points.  If it was 50% at rank 3, I would sure as hell get this AA, but not for 15%.<br />
Hastened Rabidity - Makes your rabid bear usable every hour and a half rather than two hours.  Screw this AA.<br />
Suspended Minion - Lets you suspend a pet that can be called out later.  Does not go with you across zones.  The only use for this is saving yourself the hassle of having to resummon your pet every time you invis.  Would also be good for duels.  I don't care about this AA, since I hardly ever use a pet.  This, however, is an AWESOME AA for any true pet class.<br />
Combat Stability - Not that good for shamans.  We don't take damage on a regular enough basis for this to be worth it, in my opinion.  If you have 27 to dump on this and Improved Defense 5 (like LR5, but for CS), then go for it.  I don't have those AA to spend.<br />
<br />
Others:<br />
<br />
Planar Power and Innate Enlightenment - Full training in these will give you a cap of 355 wis and 305 for everything else.  You should train them as soon as you are hitting your current cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There ya go, two 65's with a bit of AA EXP behind them and you can see that we have differences and similarities.  Where we are similar, (such as Can V) underline our opinions with big, bold letters.  Where we are different (where to place MGB in the list) is all about different playstyles and priorities.  Make the levels, pay your points and formulate your own opinions.  I certainly don't advocate mine as the &quot;right&quot; ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is the path I took<br />
<br />
The standard:<br />
Run3/Regen3<br />
MC 3<br />
Cann5<br />
<br />
The fun:<br />
Spirit Call 1<br />
Radiant Cure 1 <br />
<br />
Getting back to the basics:<br />
MGB <br />
Quick Buff 2<br />
<br />
More functionality:<br />
Virulent Paralysis<br />
<br />
I like extra ability/functionality - and the PoP AA especially provide some of that.  It's much underrated really, including Spirit Call.  Except RC 1, which everyone now knows is excellent.  <br />
<br />
I think SCM is next for me, but I am torn between that and ND3.  An extra 260 hp would certainly make cannibalizing safer and I could do it more in combat.  <br />
<br />
Increased healing would be nice as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like Jinheim's ranking, with one small demurrer ... I think Spirit Call is more than a novelty item.  <br />
<br />
If you solo much, Spirit Call can be very helpful.  For me, at level 61 and still needing torpor/malo/VoB/Pox the extra dogs from Spirit Call 1 are my margin of safety when soloing the Emp in Sebelis.  They do significant damage on the Emp, and draw aggro off of me so I am not of risk of interrupts on my heals.<br />
<br />
Yes, that is an old world mob.  It is also valuable in Tier 1 planes.  The dogs will be less help in Tier 2, and may be novelty items in Tier 3.  Of course, if I make it to Tier 3, the AA will be a lot easier to come by  8)'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Useless but fun AA:<br />
<br />
Spirit Call<br />
- Free DPS is useless? Not for me! Plus it's a great way to position mobs on raids.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Fury<br />
- With poison DoT aggro broken beyond reality, nukes/rains are a nice way to do damage on raids or in XP groups. Sure our nukes/rains are not comparable to Strike of Solusek but they are better than nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I concur with much of what has been said.  Gart is right on the standard.<br />
<br />
Here's some random observations on AA's after the basics.<br />
<br />
1. SCR and SCRM are very important if you are in a guild and buff a lot.<br />
2. MGB is very important if you are in a raiding guild. Most raiding guilds require shamans to have this if they want to join.<br />
3. I find VP1 is very useful. In most situations, I don't mem root, I just use this.  Adding additional levels would be nice, but not necessary.<br />
4. SC1-3 is like a dot that you can use on even magic resistant mobs.  My parses show that each pet you get adds 1500hp damage over 1 min.  I have SC3, so every 12 minutes I can do 7500hp damage.<br />
5. QB is nice to hasten buffs, which you're always doing.<br />
6. ND3 should be a high priority because hp=mana for a shaman.<br />
7. Rabid Bear is broken.  5 minutes of viable melee ability every two hours is flat out useless.  Hastened Rabidity adds insult to injury.<br />
8. Alchemy Mastery: why is this even included as an AA?  The recent infusion of LoY alchemy doesn't need it, the only use for this is to make insanely expenisve Luclin potions slightly less costly.  Should be dropped entirely as an AA skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The downside is that the focus item won't work for torpor, so it will only have 25% haste. A 3 second torpor (vs 4.5) may or may not be worth 9 AA points. I will probably get it eventually but QB3 is not high on my list.<br />
<br />
Haste of mithaniel works on torpor/quies.  Enhancement Haste or whatever it is does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Quickbuff is fairly useless to me, I have 30% beneficial spell haste item with a 10% haste spell from clerics that's and my haste gets close to 50% (cap), with cleric buff my Torpor is 3.6 second cast time with 0 AA invested. QB? No thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Critical heals dont work on our ICH line, at least I have never seen them. <br />
<br />
When you have a 16% chance of critting every time you heal with chloroblast and tnarg's, you will de-memm that Krag's trash forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For me:<br />
Cann5 no brainer.<br />
SCM3 is prolly best next. More mana is always good.<br />
Toss up - ND3 is great for more hps but I hate buffing so SCR/M is up there as well. Plus extra Torpor/Q healing goodness is uber.<br />
RC1 at least. This actually may be moved up a slot, it's that good. <br />
MGB if you raid.<br />
QB if you don't have access to spell haste items readily.<br />
CA3/LR5 getting hit less is good<br />
<br />
Those are the major ones. After that there are some for fun and some with not as much impact. after the ones above I personally went SCF3 for fun, Healing Gift/Advanced Healing Gift to help spot heal on raids. I threw in SC1 earlier for fun actually, and I am working on healing adept atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kintai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">having VP3, i can attest to it's usefulness.<br />
<br />
I'm a pulling shaman, always have been, always will be.  Hell, i can single PoS giants (~.^)<br />
<br />
Uses:<br />
CC:  pull more than 1? np, VP it, for 3 minutes, he's out of the picture.  This does not work on all mobs, but when it does,  you'll be glad you have it.<br />
<br />
Soloing: if you have or obtain the higher level dots, being BoS and BoU, VP is awesome.  Neither of those 2 dots, or the epic cast initial damage.  So, that being said, VP the mob, and you can stack dot after dot after dot and it won't break.  It lasts about 3.3-3.5 min with level 3, so you can recast VP if needed.  <br />

after ID 5 i am going to get SCRM probably</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Torlaan02</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hehe...only thing I would change is Run3 AA. I figure, if I'm in a crawling in a dungeon, and I don't have Sow on because it wore off, I'm probably going to die anyway from slowing too many mobs that are trying to kill us so I don't think I'm ever going to get that skill. But that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Quick Buff was kind of a tough call for me.  <br />
<br />
I don't have a 30% beneficial focus item, and I'm  not raiding with clerics every night, so it took my torpor from 6 seconds to 4.5.  But it's a chunk of AA to do that.  Eventually I will get a Wicked Bone Atatl or something.  That would give me a 3 second torpor (I think), which is pretty nice.  <br />
<br />
Miser is right about Radiant Cure.  It's definitely a &quot;big bang for the buck&quot; AA, and everyone should get it pretty soon after Cann 5.  Much more useful than I realized when I got it.<br />
<br />
And Torlaan, rethink the Run3 thing.....<br />
<br />
Also, MGB may not be critical for non-uber guild raiding shaman, but I'm not one and I'm glad I have it.  It's sweet blowing out Talisman of the Boar on a bunch of groups, or those times I do join a big raid.  It will be sweeter whenever I get Fo7.  It's kind of a landmark AA I think.  <br />
<br />
I love Spirit Call.  Totally worth it.  <br />
<br />
12 AA for natural durability and 260 hp scares me.  SCM or ND?  I dunno... I guess SCM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't a question of is this skill useful, but what first level skill that costs 3 points is better?  3 extra HP per tick?  6 extra Wis?  The vast majority of us agree that the best usage of 3 AA (required to get to level 2 AA's is Run3).</div></div><hr />

One thing I always do when studying how to spend Aa points (on any character) is to ask myself &quot;What would be most helpful considering my playstyle?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Useless but fun AA:<br />

I would rather have something reliable though, so I skip this AA.<br />
<br />
<br />
PoP changed my way to play a bit for a few reasons.<br />
First, my guild (in elemental planes) have a lot of shaman and we sometimes have 5 on raid. So when I m not in the debuff/buff cycle, I nuke or heal.<br />
Second, with all those range only fights or &quot;kill it before it kills you&quot; fight in PoP, I like beeing able to contribute to the kill when I m not needed as patch healer on the MT.<br />
<br />
It's why I m trying to dump more AA on SCF and Healing gift.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know a lot of shaman will disagree with me, but a crit on tnarg already saved my life or MT's life in case of bad things happening(uh.. clerics in range of AoE rampage = dead cleric.. go go shaman and dr00ds !!!). I m planning on buying healing adept too soon (with elem arms focus that should raise tnarg a bit more)<br />
<br />
And about SCF, yeah I love critting a spell, but what I prefer is critting my staff of eternal flames : 400fire lure DD with SC2 = 666 and SCF3= 800 crits.<br />
I rarely cast a dot anymore now except when soloing for XP.. I nuke in raid for damage, I melee when camping stuff in loy and nuke runner so SCF is good free damage for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">1 thing to add about scf in a exp group when dots arent lasting the fight or when theirs a warrior who cant taunt ill whip out my rain / single nuke i only have scf2 atm but i can crit ice strike to 1125 dmg for a example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Something else to consider....<br />
<br />
Don't just consider what the best AA skills are, also think about how easy they are to get. Thus, sometimes its best to do a quick easy AA that gives good value for the time invested, rather than grind out ND3 that will take 18 hours or more before you see any significant benefit.<br />
<br />
On that basis I would strongly recommend RC1, VP1, and to a lesser extent SC1 after Canni V. They are all relatively cheap AA skills, and are in fact extremely useful. If you are in a big raiding guild then MGB probably comes first, but in any other case I'd get these 3 before anything else because they give the BEST VALUE. They aren't the best AA, but you can get them so easily it seems silly not to.<br />
<br />
RC1:<br />
I was helping some people in their low 50s in the hole, and the puller got rooted. np, I run in cast RC1 and root is cured. Soloing the emp in sebilis, wait til a couple of dots are on me, RC1, cured. Nasty PoP dots that really hurt - cured without having to look at my spell book.<br />
<br />
VP1:<br />
Not only is this a mana free root, but also it means I free up a spell gem in situations where I don't expect to be rooting often, whilst still giving me the security of root in emergency (i.e. when we get an add). I've used this countless times in tier 2, and the knockback is a huge bonus for getting a mob far enough away from the rogue. Also use it when someone else roots a mob too close to camp - VP knockback saves everyone else having to move out the way.<br />
<br />
SC1 - think its been discussed quite a bit. Mana free damage is nice. Also useful on a CR if you get jumped, and it can hold off even tier 2 mobs for a fair while whilst the group gets its act together. Don't forget the fun element!<br />
<br />
Personally I went:<br />
Regen3, RS3, MC3, Canni V, SC1, VP1, RC1, SCR3, SCF1 (for fun), MGB<br />
<br />
Next I will work on ND3 and QB2 (mainly for torpor - QB3 seems too pricey as you will often reach the cap with cleric spells, mage summoned items and other focus items), SCRM to get the extra torpor tick. Might fit in RC2 somewhere, as I find some things RC1 won't cure, but I need to ding 63 for that :)<br />
<br />
Very interesting thread btw, with lots of useful info and opinions! Oh, and on the SCF topic - most of my mana in xp groups comes for rains, for which SCF does help. DoTs are simply too much aggro and in tier 2 the mobs don't last long enough anyway. That makes SCF fairly appealing once you have the major things out the way (Canni V, MGB, ND3, SCRM, maybe QB), or get SCF1 even sooner just for fun coz its only 2AA points.</div></div><hr />

Yup.. but with nukes I have hard time aggroing a mob that MUST NOT move and damage are way faster with nukes than with dots (that rarely do their max damage)<br />
I tried the other day in an xp group in plane of fire.<br />
I was slowing, then doting with Breath =&gt; no aggro but breath never did 3k dmg. <br />
Then I tried slowing + blood of saryrn =&gt; Aggro and blood was rarely doing full damage.<br />
So I loaded Velium strike + Tears of saryrn.. Slow + 1 velium strike + 1 tears of saryrn + velium strike = dead mob and min damage was 3k (I had a mage bracer too).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Hail,<br />
<br />
First, this is a quality thread.  Let's keep this near the top and stay on topic (not saying anyone before hasn't) if we can. :)<br />
<br />
I am a raiding shaman who also solos.  I'm not in the Elemental Planes (nor expect to be any time soon), but I am in Tier2/3 almost daily.<br />
<br />
There are distinctions with what TYPE of Shaman you play and what kind of ACTIVITIES you pursue in designing any AA progression guide.  <br />
There are AA's that offer a greater return on investment to a raiding shaman that offer a lesser return to a small group shaman, or one who is usually playing as a duo partner.  <br />
<br />
My advice is to choose your AA expenditures based on your playstyle &amp; AA earning capabilities.  If knocking out 8-12 AA's in a weekend isn't a big deal to do, it might make more sense to go for mastering a specific line.  If getting 3-4 AA's in two weeks (due to raiding or whatever) is more what you accomplish, then spending points on some of the smaller AA's abilities may make you happier.  Choosing WHICH investments to make (whether small or large) should be based on what you spend most of your time doing IG, be it raiding (sole shaman, or w/ many present - big difference), grinding, grouping, soloing, duoing, etc.<br />
<br />
General &amp; Archetype initial progression (RS3/Regen3/MC3) are pretty easy to pick out.  But after that the Archetype waters become murky &amp; making the choices more gets a little difficult.  It is hard to judge whether a raw hp upgrade (ND) is more valuable than an increase in buff duration (SCR) or an increase in Alteration spells mana efficiency (SCM) since they do very different things.  I found all of these valuable, so I max'd each of these areas.  Deciding WHICH to do first isn't easy.  I did SCR first (primarily w/ extended Torpors in mind), then ND (HP&gt;all), and SCM (mana efficiency) most recently.  <br />
<br />
My personal choices for next Archetype AA's are Healing Adept (HA) &amp; Spell Casting Fury (SCF).  Since I like them both, I'll probably stagger them, bumping each one a level at a time.  I originally was going to do the CA/LR next for improving my soloing, but since I'm doing less of that now &amp; more raiding (with multiple shaman present), support healing improvements and additional DPS weigh in as being more valuable for me.  I'll be leaving Crit Heals (Healing Gift), Channeling Focus, and Combat Stability to last in this section.<br />
<br />
Class skills are (to me) pretty easy to pick out.  Canni, QB, MGB, &amp; SCRM are all worthwhile.  How far to go in QB may be gear dependant.<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear and Alchemy Mastery are worthless, and Pet Discipline is of limited use.  I put pet discipline very low on the totem pole of AA's in comparison to other things available (especially with a 6 point investment requirement), but above most other General abilities.  If I was still soloing often, or considered  saving my pet a priority on raids (it isn't) instead of killing him off for AE fights, I might value this more.<br />
<br />
PoP Advance:<br />
Planar Power and Innate Enlightenment in my opinion should be invested in as your stats max out.  I'm just now hitting that point gearwise when buffed, so I'll probably dump points in here soon.  No sense in being buffed to a potential 300 wisdom if you are capped at 280.  Small AA investments make these easy choices when you have a few banked and burning a hole in your kilt. :)<br />
<br />
PoP AdvanceB:<br />
RC1 should be done immediately after Canni in my opinion, possibly even sooner if you are already raiding.  (Canni5&gt;all other AA's).<br />
VP is going to be my next investment, just to free up an extremely valualbe gem slot taken up by a root spell.  Spirit Call is a fun AA I still don't have, but will probably get soon.  Free damage is hard to beat, but it didn't outweigh the benefits of the Class/Archetype AA's I've invested in ( http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=642761 ) so far.  Suspended Minion is nifty, but not worth 5 points when I can just cast a new pet pretty easily.  <br />
<br />
The rest of these abilities are generally dependent upon major investments in either Archetype or Class.  Skip Hastened Rabidity entirely in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Another Elder Prophet's opinion to add into the mix.  YMMV.  :cool: <br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">As stated, it depends a lot on your playing style.<br />
<br />
MC3/Cann5, what else needs to be said here, these should be your first port of call.<br />
<br />
SCM3 doesnt actually give that big a boost to your main spec's mana savings and it doesnt seem to reduce fizzles at all, but it makes an incredible difference to non spec'd stuff, IE dots and nukes for most shaman.  Its still a very important skill though.<br />
<br />
Radcure, get level 2, rc1 is nice but unreliable, rc2 rarely fails unless I've got a lot of nasty stuff stacked on me.<br />
<br />
CA3/ND3 are vital imho, they really do make an incredible difference to your survival rate against higher end pop mobs and pretty much render old world mobs and low end pop stuff obsolete.<br />
<br />
MGB doesnt seem that amazing, but for a raiding shaman it is a huge boon and you'll notice the difference it makes in the ease of buffing a raid.<br />
<br />
There are lots of other seemingly boring but still damn nice AA's too, SCR3/SCRM are worth every point as they help you to be more efficient, essential considering how inefficient shaman pop spells are.<br />
<br />
QB3 is fantastic too, 3 second torpor/quiessence without any need for focus items is worth it alone, and it makes doing haste/buffs a lot less annoying.<br />
<br />
Rabid bear is definately fun, but not fantastic, with a primal 2hb I put out roughly the same damage as a 60 epic warrior with 31% haste against low ac stuff (I accidently ks'd one a few times with melee against FG shrooms).  Unfortunately my damage drops massively against high ac stuff.<br />
<br />
Healing Adept/Gift are also worth considering, Maxed out aha/ahg help beef up our otherwise weedy dd heals and lots of tnargs crits always help =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">One answer, so far, pretty much sums it up:<br />
<br />
&quot;What would be most helpful considering my playstyle?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ok that was a question, but still is the most helpful in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Everyone has thier own beliefs about whats the most useful or useless.  Only thing you can do is try to understand the benefits of each skill, the points needed for each skill, and if it will help YOU.  All shamans are not the same therefore will put different importance on different skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">My thoughts on PP and the 355 wis too.  just my thought, i was expecting alot from PP, seeing my stam go up to 305 was something i was looking forward too since stam == hp.  well 280 max stam, trained pp1 with ND 3 i watched my hp go up 8 hp....  I was very disapointed,  yes my str and my dex went to 290 too, but that means nothing to me, well I guess my stk went up too but big whoop.  The dimishing returns after 280stam, maybe even after 255 is just terrible.  and I see no reason why wis will lead to much more mana.   It something i will max out soon, just cause I'm getting new gear and i need to justify getting it by seeing my new max stats but for it total use I don't think it helping as much as expected.  right now i wish i had those 4aa back(PP 2 now) and i could finish training CA instead.  <br />
<br />
BTW my max wis is not even 255 yet so i wasn't worried about my wis for mana pool just yet.  I will be getting it up there so i can feel better about what so far feels like wasted AA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">In my eyes, there are only a few AA abilities that I couldn't live without...<br />

Mass Cann - #1 Priority! Can't beat the mana regen.<br />
Mass Group Buff - Buffing large raids is a major pain in the ass without it.<br />
Radiant Cure - I use this ability ALL the time. Very helpful for AE mobs, slowing mobs, etc.<br />
Spirit Call - These dogs push HARD! I use them to pin mobs that need to be kept away from casters.<br />

<br />
Another point ... everyone says that you should blow through to 60 and do AA then. Personally I'm farming AA now because I found a sweet spot to farm exp and cash. I have almost 40 k in the bank now and will hopefully have at least 100 k by the time I am 60 to buy some of my spells. Seems to me that doing 23 AA to get canni V at 59 is a good trade off to me ... especially if I can also afford to buy Torpor at 60. Any thoughts? Is it much easier to get cash at 60? All the 60's I know are still more  broke than I am atm.<br />

Not sure how good Canni 5 is without Torpor to go with it... getting the cash for Torpor and then going right for Canni5 seems like a good plan though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The answer is easy.<br />
CANN V requires MC3 to train it. If Cann v didn't require it I think most people here probably never would have trained it or at least significantly later along. <br />
<br />
Personally I went the standard run 3, regen 3, mc 3, cann v route to start off with and then got MGB and QB1 and didn't get much in the way of aa's for a while. Then when they added ND 3 for every I went and got that. Then I got SCM right around when pop came out. Then added QB2, and SCRM to finally get my title with Spirit call 1 and radiant cure 1 thrown in there. I also picked up VP1, CA 2 and healing adept 1. Lately I've been spending my aa's on New taanan's since I'm tradeskilling for my earring. Once I'm done with that I'm going to working on finishing off CA3/LR most likely. Plan to train a point or 2 in RC when I get a chance and finish off spirit call too.<br />
<br />
There's alot of good info on different aa's already and opinions definitely do vary.<br />
<br />
As far as scm goes I'd have to say mana pres aa/focus are really nice. Currently with scm 3 and an mp4 item I can see significant saving on spell costs. For example mgbing focus of the 7th is about 50% of my mana pool. Since that should cost 3600mana the saving seem to be fairly large since I can assure you that I don't have a 7200 point mana pool. Since I have about a 5k mana pool buffed that ends up being about a 30% mana savings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The most &quot;useful&quot; aa's that I have are - Run3, Canni5(MC3), SCM3, RC1.<br />
<br />
Other good general shaman ones to get are ND, SCR lines... Depending on your HP from gear when you get Canni5, ND could be very required for you, before any other AA.  If you have comfortable HP for Canni5 already, then it's just some nice free HP to pad that out.<br />
<br />
Depending on your role and playstyle, MGB, QB, Combat AGI/STA/Lightning Reflexes, Healing Adept/Gift, Spell Casting Fury AA.<br />
<br />
Don't waste points on Planar Power until after you have a lot of other AA.  Stamina for us is only worth like 1.8hp per sta, over 255.</div></div><hr />

bit of background on me.<br />
I almost always group with a warrior cleric and a mix of my other friends going from ranger-rogue-monk-druid-warrior.<br />
My guild raids a fair bit but there are 4 other 65 shammies that can MGB, so I am not going to bother with that quite yet.<br />
I am 64 and have a few things to point out.<br />
<br />
run3<br />
metab3<br />
MC3<br />
Canni <br />
RC1<br />
VP1<br />
SCR1<br />
<br />
<br />
Canni 5 OWNS, take MC3 and get canni 5 asap, you wont be dissappointed.<br />
Radiant cure is nice, but I am dissappointed that it doesnt cure alot of tier2 plane poisons, and LDON curses and such, but nice for low level poisons and even on Grummus raid.<br />
Virulent Paralysis is amazing if you do LDON alot. Having a chanter and shammy in same group is often a low DPS group, so I find its usually me and a bunch of dps, clickable root with knockback for crowd control is sweet, no more cleric dying on us.<br />
SCR I think is the next viable option for me to get life out of my buffs and lower the amount of rebuffin and recasting of stuff like regen and haste.<br />
<br />
opinions-<br />
ND3 i think will be one of the last things i take, yes extra hp are nice, but with always having Virtue, or POTG and Kaz i have 4k hp, more then enough to canni and stay above 40%<br />
Healing Adept + Healing Gift are ok if you heal alot, i use Tnarg and torp (soon to be using Q) so i guess crit heals would be nice, but would rather get a mana saving AA like SCM since as a shammy you should have specialized in Alteration, and most of our spells, least that i use are all alteration.<br />
CS + LR- I think will be next for me after SCR maybe after SCRM, I get aggro, something we shammies cant always avoid, especially when ya hit the slow spell a bit early to save your tank. Avoiding dmg helps ya get that Torpor off and keep ya standing while your tank gets aggro back.<br />
Rabid bear, spirit call, while fun should definetly wait till after you get some of the above, and most likely wait till after MGB too. Rbaid bear sucks I hear, but think it would be fun to be 99% hasted wielding Orb of Forgotten Magic.<br />
Suspend Minion, SCF are a waste and alot more useful for other classes.<br />
<br />
But likes its been said everyone has a different idea what to do after Canni, hope this gives ya an idea what to take a look at</div></div><hr />

I personally didn't care to get SCF for along time (prob started it around 200AAs) cause I thought that shamans should get longer buffs, faster casting spells, better healing, less mana, and defensive skills first.  However, now that I've gotten SCF, I do like it and went on to get FoM1 and realize how much I really liked it so I bought FoM2.  I ended up getting a few other things that I needed first, but eventually went back and got FoM3 (i needed magic resists since my MR kepts getting lower and lower, and I got the suspend minion part cause i'm at the point where I don't really need exp, and sometimes I just want to go in there and kill something named or quest related and get out of there).

SCRM is a must, get it early.  We buff a lot and extended buffs are a must.<br />
<br />
LR5 is awesome.  Don't underestimate the power of this AA.  When slow is resisted in PoP you're going to get hit hard.  There's nothing worse then dying to a resisted slow.  Get LR5 and you can take those hits and then some.  You can tank almost 4-5 slowed LDoN mobs on you at a time with LR5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I'll sum it up.<br />
<br />
Basic good ideas:<br />
<br />
run3/regen3(bleh not for me but seems popular)/IM3(yay lowered stat food costs)<br />
<br />
MC3, Canni 5<br />
<br />
Then work your aa's to max out quies/torpor, scr, scrm qb(some debate this, I love my 3 second quiesc thanks)<br />
<br />
After that my own path was what can i get the most  out of that is mana free?<br />
<br />
SC3(great great thing, free damage free tank)<br />
HA and AHA(crit heals = 2 heals for price of one)<br />
VP3(chain cast essentially unbreakable root)<br />
SCF line(free damage again - nukes/rains = best group damage)<br />
SCM(lowered mana costs)<br />
RC3(I still haven't gotten my group cure from loy..can't say that I miss having it).<br />
<br />
After that it's a toss up. <br />
<br />
ND3 is good, and you get a decent bit of hitpoints for 12aa.<br />
<br />
CA/LR5 seem to be popular.<br />
<br />
I'm kinda curious on the channeling aa, I haven't gotten it yet and have never seen anyone who has it talk about it really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have it, so this is only hearsay, but everytime someone mentions it, it's to say that it's worthless crap.  Supposedly does very, very little, if anything.  Better off getting CA/LR if you want to channel that heal.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Something else to consider is a couple of AA's free up a precious spell <br />

<br />
With Virulent Paralysis you may not need root mem'd. (my advice is go<br />
for level 3. Each level knocks the mob back further). Don't feel <br />
comfortable with the 2.5 (or so) refresh time?<br />
<br />
Spirit Call is like having a second root. Three pets shoot out and tie<br />
up a mob for a minute. <br />
<br />
Radient Cure means you may not have to mem a cure. <br />
<br />
While you don't have to keep SoW mem'd, Run3 is inate - always on. <br />
You don't have to be first out to survive a train, just don't be last! :D<br />
Mobs are lazy and will go after the slowest runner. Indoors, this is<br />
the guy didn't think he needed Run3.</div></div><hr />

I've got it, but I never talk about it because its impossible to tell if it is working or not.  No one has ever parsed interrupts (to my knowledge) and I just can't make up my mind if I notice a difference or not.  I'm fairly sure it does work the way it is intended, but the benefit just isn't that great.  It was the last on my list and I recommend it be the last on yours, as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Current AA's:<br />
<br />
Run Speed 3<br />
Innate Regen 3<br />
Spell Casting Mastery 3<br />
Combat Agility 3<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
MGB<br />
Cannibalization<br />
Lightning Reflexes 5<br />
Radiant Cure 1<br />
Virulent Paralysis 2<br />
Suspend Minion 2<br />
Spirit Call 1<br />
Crit Affliction 1<br />
<br />
CA3 and LR5 were a big let-down for me, I don't think they really help that much - I still get hit 9 out of 10 times. Feels like I wasted 27 points.<br />
<br />
Suspend Minion 2 is a must if you like to solo alot, a BIG help in places like Droga and Acrylia Caverns. Being able to suspend dogdog with all his weapons and buffs so you can invis to the next rare spawn is awesome when farming.<br />
<br />
Crit Affliction 1 was expensive, but it's kinda cool. I'd say at least every 10th tick a dot will crit, usually more often - just the luck of the random number generator. Seeing Blood of Saryn hit for 640 three times in one cast is awesome. If I stack 4 dots, I'll get at least 2 crits before they wear off, sometimes as many as 8. Free damage is nice, but I doubt I'll invest in more levels of this aa. I dot a lot on named raid mobs and it would be much harder to judge how much aggro I'm generating with crits going off all the time. As it stands now I know exactly how hard I can dot depending on who is tanking. On High Priest in Ssra last week I did 48k damage (not counting dogdog and zerg pets) without once pulling aggro. Eat your heart out dps classes!<br />
<br />
VP 1 was nice, but level 2 is much better. Now I kick mobs far enough away that they are always out of melee range. Great at raids (and groups too!) for knocking mobs off the squishy types in casterville.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Abzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Bought Critical Affliction 2 and picked up Spell: Bane in the last two weeks.<br />

Check out my best round so far:<br />
<br />
King Dronan has taken 131 damage from your Breath of Ultor.<br />
King Dronan has taken 840 damage from your Bane.<br />
King Dronan has taken 640 damage from your Blood of Saryrn.<br />
Your Bone-Clasped Girdle feels alive with power.<br />
King Dronan has taken 123 damage from your Pox of Bertoxxulous.<br />

King Dronan has taken 228 damage from your Bane of Nife.<br />
King Dronan has taken 286 damage from your Curse of the Spirits.<br />
<br />
2,248 damage in one tick. Momma said knock you out!<br />
<br />
Of course this is not typical. Usually only get one crit every other tick with this many dots on - with the occasional 2 crits per tick.<br />

Two more aa's to crit affliction 3, yummy.<br />

<br />
um wrong wrong and more wrong...possibly my favorite aa other than canV. it never become usless. (edit for clarity) soloing vp3 is perma root, it almost never breaks early and refreshes before it breaks, groups its super valuable with adds and mobs you are just tired of tanking, raids it allows you to punt mobs off of walls for the rangers/rogues, move em off the healers, occasionally save a life when somone gets frenzied on (i.e. low health agro) and allows you to position mobs the chanters are pinning down or to park one while the chanters are trying to regain control. all that and it lets me punt evils into the hole from up near the paineel zone in :)<br />
<br />
for your aa path here is something that seems to be missing from this thread. <br />
<br />
get your aa's in an order that HELPS you get more exp FASTER.<br />
<br />
run/regen3<br />
mc3<br />
canV<br />
VP1<br />
those are the top of my list because they help you exp faster no matter what you are doing.<br />
rc1<br />
sc1<br />
those are also very very high on my list, but I spent alot of time in tactics soloing, pet burn eats harmtouch nicely and radient cure is very handy vrs the casters in there. that aa path has helped me get more exp faster than getting foo foo aa's like mgb and rabid bear. while I agree mgb rocks the raid shamans world the number of times I have needed mgb I can count on one hand vrs the amount of times I have needed any of the above list is at least in the hundreds. I get over having to buff each group in a raid. if the payoff is one of the aa's that I use tons and speeds up the exp game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Firstly, I recommend doing at LEAST Metab 1, instead of one of the Regens. Not eating RULES with some of the rare and expensive stat food.<br />
<br />
Secondly, if you have a big proccing weapon, SCF and FOM are very nice. However, I would not do them before the Healing Adept line (would do before Healing Gift line).<br />
<br />
Thirdly, VP is one of the best AA we get, period. I actually like it 2nd best after Canni 5. I use it that much. Even in Raids, its fun to play &quot;Bounce the Birdy&quot; with the other shaman in your class's channel, heh. Its VERY good at bouncing an add off a healin cleric though, and I have had clerics and chanters send me tells saying &quot;How did you do that?&quot; heh. <br />
<br />
The whole tree is pretty much a no brainer. SC1 or RC1, who cares. Get the bigs. Get the HPs. Get LR5 so when you get summoned you dont get shredded. <br />
<br />
And have some fun.</div></div><hr />

Like someone else mentioned, it really depends on your play style on which AA's you get. Look at your own play style, then pick AA's that will help you.<br />
<br />
For those that think AA pets are just a  novelty........You have never seen SC5 pets beat the crappzorz out of a druid before. LOL! Unless the druid has Exodus he/she is dead. With the new pvp resist coding it is much more likely that root will land.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I will add my voice to the VP3 fanclub chorus.  I use VP3 to solo at the &quot;tables&quot; camp in Plane of Fire, a place where regular magic-based root will not work (breaks too often).<br />
<br />
Pull with Malicious Decay to debuff DR, hit it with VP before it gets to me.  VP wears off seconds after the AA becomes reusable, so hit it again.<br />
<br />
Most useful with our high-level, no-initial-DD dots.  I have Breath of Ultor and Blood of Saryryn, as well as epic, but I could really use Bane and possibly even Anathema for additional DPS.  Without the curse dots it takes me 9 minutes to solo one Doomfire in PoF, for 14% AA.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone have a list for useful GoD AAs?  I can't figure out if that Call of the Ancients (sp?) for endurance regen is worth it at all.  Everyone is telling me that it is the absolute last AA to get.  Is it worth while to get for long raid fights like HP or EMP?<br />

<br />
Hello again, year old thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly, Call of the Ancients DOES NOT regen endurance.  It simply regens hitpoints, the same as the cleric and druid one.  The in-game description is wrong.  Brenlo, some months ago, said we would get a refund of AA spent and a correction of the incorrect description, but I find it unlikely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Behind Canny5, VP is my favourite AA. Its awesome in PoFire, and great for CC. But I'm always surprised at the shaman that don't use VP for pulling.<br />
Easy tip: Target the mob from a good distance off, turn around, so your back is facing it, hit VP button, and the mob moves towards you. Good for splitting mobs too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">VP is one of the most useful AA's, possibly right below Canni5. Higher levels of this AA are more useful as well, as long root and much further knockback make this a very very useful skill.  It's my second most used skill, with Canni5 being first most used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">12 AA for natural durability and 260 hp scares me.  SCM or ND?  I dunno... I guess SCM.<br />
<br />
Your are forgetting that the Hp you receive from ND changes with your STA. <br />
<br />
With my style of play I am finding that getting a single level of a number of different AAs has been helpful. I currently have the following at level 1:<br />
VP<br />
RC<br />
CS<br />
ND<br />
SCR<br />
CA<br />
<br />
As I am usually in the thick of things, especially when we are pulling several mobs at once plowing an area, anything that helps me stay alive longer while I have aggro helps. If we pull 3 or more one of those mobs will find its way over to me and thing I am a punching bag for a minute or two till its mezzed or off tanked.</div></div><hr />
