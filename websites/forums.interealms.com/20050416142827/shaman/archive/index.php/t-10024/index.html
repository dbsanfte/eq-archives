<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For all of you wanting to get through these lvls, seriously consider SolA.<br />
<br />
I went there while just a shade in lvl36 and made it to lvl39 in about 6-8 hours.  I was getting 2-4% of a lvl per kill solo on Clockworks.<br />
<br />
I was down in the area where the EXG spawns, which drops the Charred Gaurdian Sheild and the Charred Gaurdian Breastplate (got two sheilds - they aren't lore - which sold in 30 minutes in the Bazaar price around 150pp).  Here are a few tips.<br />
<br />
1)  I had PoP so I bind in the Bazaar so I can always gate back and donate for a KEI (I never solo with out it now - man that crack is ADDICTIVE!).  Take the Neriak portal in PoP to get to Lava, or donate for a port.<br />
<br />
2) Use EQAtlas to find where the EXG camp is.  All casting goblins in SolA see invis, so I fought my way there or just ran for the zone down by the Foreman, then fought my way in from there if I had too (only 3 goblins between the Foreman zoneline and the EXG camp).<br />
<br />
3)  After getting the the EXG camp, I'd get out dogdog if not already out.  If you are KoS (troll or ogre - not sure if iksar start out kos to gnomes or not), buff onthe stairs leading down to the EXG area). NOTE!!!! ALL CLOCKWORKS SEE INVIS!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
4)  Kill the roamer first.  Wait on the steps, eventually on clockwork will wander up the steps - this is the EXG or it's PH (note EXG is COMPLETELY 100% immune to magic - although beneficial spells will stick to it - DS's cast by pesky gnome conjurer's).  Kill the roamer (for the EXG I just tanked and let dogdog and myself melee, starting my heal when down around 70% - that way incase I was interrupted I'd have another shot instead of running for the zone).<br />
<br />
5) After killing the roamer, the next step is the hardest part of the camp.  Splitting the first two clockworks.  Aggro one, you aggro both.  Use pet gaurd me, root one, back up debuff (slow, listless power, Scrouge and Envenom Breath) the one that dogdog is tanking.  Then slow the rooted clockwork, I'd also dot it while dogdog and I were finishing off the first.  I used Winters Roar to speed up killing the first to help spread the spawn out a little.<br />
<br />
6)  The next two spawns are single spawns.  Cake.  One is a clockwork, the other is a gnome (miner - warrior, curator - cleric or conjurer - mage).  Nuke the heck out of the curator and conjurers, I hate them.<br />
<br />
5)  At lvl36 I was able to do these 5 spawns no problem.  I figure anyone with a pet could do them (before repops), and make good exp and some decent money (1gp - 3pp each kill, plus FS weapons and some modules that sell for 1-3pp).<br />
<br />
7)  At lvl39 I can do 9 spawns np before repops (which is 18 minutes in SolA).  Still making at least 2% per kill.  I figured I could hit lvl40, where exp may take a dip and have to move on.  But the exp modifier in SolA is awesome which makes up for alot.<br />
<br />
8)  Being an old world dungeon, the clockworks hit like sissies (around lvl38 I stopped using Listless Power to save mana for nukes/dots/roots).  Also they don't have many hitpoint AT ALL.  About 70% of the hp of the same lvl Velious or Kunark mobs.<br />
<br />
9)  Just be prepared to be hated in Ak'Anon (which is an easy sacrifice in my book).  Been there 3 lvls and still not KoS as a Barbie Shaman - but I am down to Dubious.<br />
<br />
10)  Only vendor close is the Druid out in Lavastorm.  Sell all unwanted FS to her along with the words/runes/modules.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps some of the other soloing shaman out there in the lvl34-39 range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Update, at lvl39 about 1 in 10 clockworks are light blue.  All gnomes are still dark blue.  I have a feeling that after I ding to lvl40, the exp is going to start drying up.<br />
<br />
All dark blues are still giving me 2% exp at lvl39, and all light blues are giving 1% (some aren't even giving that).<br />
<br />
But all in all, still a good spot at lvl39.  Made half a level  in about 70 minutes of not so hard fighting (I had about 5 minutes of down time before repops).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lengis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the gnomes down there are their own faction.  You can fix it by killing the dogs in sol b though.  At least in the past it was this way.  I would solo through the 30s on gnomes, killing Gabby and the EXG over and over, and then go to sol b in the 40s to fix the faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They aren't too bad exp higher up.  I did them on my monk until about 44.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are faster places, but this was easy exp and usually wasn't camped, so it was just easier to stay there.</div></div><hr />

What entrance do you come in?  A, B, C, or D?<br />
<br />
#9 is the room you want to camp in?<br />
<br />
Someone should take this map and draw the run route on it.  That would be super useful.<br />

<br />
They way I describe is by coming in from Lavastorm.  The Lavastorm entrance is in the middle of the map and labeled &quot;To Lavastorm&quot;.  It is not labeled with a letter.  If you can find #12 on the map, the Lavastorm entrance is just above that.<br />
<br />
And yes, #9 is the general area you want to camp.  I didn't camp that close to the gnome castle, I usually medded on the steps as this was the start of my run and where the repops would start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do not pull right by the castle.  You will get adds.  I have tried a few times but keep getting trained.  Be carefull or before you know there are 5 on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Furog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is it possible to do SolA without KEI, Aego and other buffs?  I don't have PoP or Luclin and I've only had KEI once (from a kind enchanter passing through Nektulos).  The one time I went to SolA, I had a hard time keeping adds rooted and ended up trained by a ton of goblins (from the one gobby that got away).<br />
<br />
If it isn't possible to do SolA without major buffs, where can a non-uber buffed ogre shammy solo from 34 - 39?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, you can do SolA without UBER buffs, you just have to control runners (as with ANY dungeon).<br />
<br />
By the way, clockworks don't run, they WALK.  They are the slowest mobs in game (I'm convinced).  Many times I made it to the zone without SoW and didn't get hit after a few feet (as long as I wasn't doing the death walk).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hehe. This zone is crazy. At 35, I took down a total of 12 goblins from where Kindle spawns without dying. It was amazing. I had kei but ohterwise was self-buffed. Just kept a cool head, figured which mobs needed slowing and which needed dots first (casters...). Pet died after like 4 mobs, but i handled it pretty well.<br />
<br />
I have also taken out 3-4 clockworks at a time with no big hassel. Downtime is extreme but honestly, 2 clockworks isn't THAT much harder than one, for some reason. Root one, root the other. Control pet well while you dot both with scourge and envenomed breath, then nuke one a couple times and melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hollah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I've been trying to give a sol a a shot at 34, but the goblins are making it plain and simple hell.  After dieing once from falling into the lava, I made an attempt to fight my way through, worked for a while, until 3 goblins ganged up on me, one a wizard, who was being healed through the wall by one of the shamans, had to run.  Came back, tried the run like hell then zone approach, that got me a train of about 10 of them, I got rooted, died, and my corpse is now rotting in sol a :( .  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

I made a small map of where Durdend was fighting, I think anyway. I did all this at work using paint so it's sorta crappy. The black marks the run in. I did this last night, it was pretty exciting. I sow'ed myself before I zoned in, then just booked it. Some of the passageways are fake walls, around the foreman and into room 6, so keep cool and run through them. I paniked a bit and went in a small circle but I made it to solb.<br />
<br />
 After the run I zoned back into sola, got my pet up, medded up to full, took out the 2 or 3 golbins in the room marked 6, then i moved to the green spot. You might run into one or two more in the room next to the green spot but they're easy. Then I sat and medded at the green spot, on the stairs. this is also where I buffed my pet, gave him tnarg, and regen if he needed it, I also hasted him but I didn't bother to keep it up after it wore off. You're hps and mana shouldn't be to low, so if the wanderer (red line) does come you should be able to beat him easy, or move so you don't get argo.<br />
<br />
The hardest part is breaking the 2 clockworks next. They both come if you pull them, so fight them the best you can. I would start by rooting one, slowing the one you're fighting then dotting both, but i'm sorta new to solo'ing so if you know a better way let me know. <br />
<br />
The next 2 spawns are easy to kill. Just be careful of the bridge. If you can break the spawns up the camp is super easy and really good exp and loot. <br />
<br />
I never went further then the last red dot marked on the map.  Past that I saw 2 more gnomes, one was a caster so I didn't even bother. But those mobs should keep me busy for a while. <br />
<br />
The hard part for me is only fighting one at a time, it's hard for me to take on more then one. If I get one go down really easy. I'm going to make another stab at it later today. Another thing to remember is always root when you're fighting one. <br />
<br />
And as you can see from the map, I haven't gotten very close to the area marked 9 on the map, maybe once i get some lvls.<br />
