AC is about 950, and HP's are about 1750.  Most skills are maxed.  I'm wondering because I would like to take advantage of the ZEM.</div></div><hr />

But still V nice Exp.  Park your dog right near the ledge to the pond. otherwise he might agro the other Elemental at the ZI when he attacks.</div></div><hr />

Problem with Hole ZI is that after the pathing patch one (or maybe two) Revenants now path all the way to ZI and those mobs are a bitch to deal with.<br />
<br />
So Hole ZI is doable but has gotten very much more of a hazzle now.<br />
