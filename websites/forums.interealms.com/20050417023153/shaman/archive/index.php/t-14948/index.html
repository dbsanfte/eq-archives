<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hit 24 and I'm trying to find the best place for me (ogre shaman) and an sk to duo for good exp. We're evil so we can't do HHK (and we don't feel like taking the risk to invis down to guard room) so we thought we'd try echo caverns.<br />
<br />
Right now it's pretty easy, even when grouped the bogling scouts give at least 1% and they're really easy. But the problem is their spawn rate is really slow. I've heard many people talk about doing the Needlites, but they hit so fast it's difficult to get spells off on it. I was wondering how you guys do (or did) these pesky little critters, or if there is a better spot we can switch to. We tried Marus Seru, but that was annoying at best.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Savvik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did them with my Bard for a few levels using the damage shield. Since Shaman and SK's don't have that, I suggest buffing to the max, slow and just tanking them.<br />
<br />
When you enter the room, go to the left. This will be your pull spot. work clockwise around the room to get singles. In the corner farthest from you there will be 2 and unless you root one, they both will come. If the gueen is up, might be a tough fight, she is lvl 27 or 29.<br />
<br />
If you get rooted and dotted entering the room, camp out to clear aggro. If you don't, anytime you are in line of sight of the plant things, they will root and dot you. You can avoid the plants by hugging whichever wall looks farthest away from the plants. For the last one (on the roof in center of tunnel) duck and hug the wall. Shrinking might help...<br />
<br />
Good luck and let me know how it works out. I also partner with an SK and we were thinking of coming here also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dawnshroud, Zelniaks. Plenty of mobs to go around and you can level up to the high 30's/low 40's there pretty easy. Once I hit 24 with my Monk that's where I went. He's 36 now and still getting some decent exp from the even con &quot;a Large Zelniak&quot; mobs.<br />
<br />
I was getting 3% to 5% per kill at 24.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Savvik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you group with others, you could do Dawnshroud, but if you had trouble with Marus Seru, you can't do Dawnshroud. Zelniaks hit alot harder here than in Marus, the lightcrawlers blind you, and don't even get me started on the wolves...<br />
<br />
Did you try Netherbian Lair? If you can pull singles, you can do very well there. If you get an overpull, root one then run to the guards. When the guard has aggro on the add, loop back and finish off the first target. <br />
<br />
At 24 (my current level) I can solo the drones and warriors either straight up melee ( pull with a slow ) or root rot. Melee ends with about 20 - 30 % hp left and root rot ends with about 20 - 30 % mana left. With the 25 SK, I slow, lvl 19 dot and we melee them down. Adds are either rooted or trained to the guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ya we decided to go to HHK, but instead of invising and going down we invised and went up. we killed guards right on to 30 and now we're gonna head to DSP.<br />
<br />
it wasn't that marus seru was difficult, it was just annoying. people were pulling all the stone grabbers they could see and die right next to us while we're taking on a stone grabber. so the results from that weren't based on the mobs it was based on it's populus hehe.</div></div><hr />
