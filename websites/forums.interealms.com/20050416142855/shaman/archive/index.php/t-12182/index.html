<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Styantiss Sarnakslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I heard someone mention it before, but they never said how great the camp was. This is the single best camp I have seen. I can do 1 yellow each hour and make about 100pp per hour also. <br />
<br />
 I dont recommend it before 44, because you need the 44 pet's good regen ability, the verdants will be tough. Make sure and buff yourself and your pet somewhat, keep both of you hasted (of course). If you tank 80% of the time and your pet 20%, you can pull 30 giants in a row before you need to rebuff. Thats 30 blue ticks...<br />
<br />
 I cant think of any reason other than boredom to be anywhere else 44-48. If you have a JBB, the camp will be insanely easy. I dont, Im Iksar :(</div></div><hr />

/loc is pos2400, neg3000.  It's near the eastern most Swamp of No Hope zone.  <br />
<br />
.....and yes, the exp is pretty darn good.  I only wish there were more than 3 spawns as I ended up waiting for respawn too often.  That was some time ago but I have my 47 mage there right now as well - way easy.<br />
<br />
The other roaming mobs nearby are mostly green and lt. blue with an occassional dk. blue (at 47).</div></div><hr />
