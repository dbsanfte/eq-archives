<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone solo'd in CT at 58?  I have done the entrance but I get kind of bored plus it seems to be fairly popular lately.  I am looking at trying to get inside somewhere that is safe to park puppy and pull to that does not have wanderers.  Any ideas (never hunted in CT when I was a young lad)?  I may on occasion get to duo with a 60 druid and then snare will make things easier : 0.<br />

This is place was easily doable by me at 58 (JBB equipped, no epic).  However I dont reccomend it because the exp is horrible since the 2 spawns are on 12 min spawn timers.  To break them just do the zone out method though...root one in place by the door, let the other one come to you, sick dogdog to distract it for a bit, root that one then zone out and back in quick and re-root, slow, re-summon dogdog and your good to go :D Theres also another good thread on this: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=11952&amp;highlight=Tae+Ew+Blood<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, and good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To be honest the xp sucks.  But I am after some blood so I can get some needed upgrades.  But the entrance is always camped so it does not work out that I get it to myself.  Will have to check the other thread out : ).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did this off and on to get two bloods (which I used to get my tunic  :) ) zone in and invis. open up the double doors take a right or left, it doesnt matter. there will be a ladder there. there should be two doors on the right and left side with two lizards in front of them. take you pick of which door you take, it doesnt matter. there will be a little leveling off point I set up camp here. Buff up completly summon a dog alpha him and you're gtg. /guard your pet and run up to the door. aggro the lizard and run back, let pet take aggro so you can mal*** and slow it then just smack up the lizard =P. once the first is done just run out and tag the second, nothing should aggro from below. Ive never gotten this bored but I suppose you could break the entrance mobs and then take those two to try to get as much blood as possible. torpor would probably make it more doable, I doubt I could keep all 4 dead lol.<br />
<br />
from what Ive seen both lizards that spawn up there are never casters, just warders and warriors.<br />
<br />
blood drops are very random. If I have 15-20 minutes to burn ill run down there and kill those two. it took me about 4 cycles to get 1 blood then the next day on my run I got 2 to drop hehe.<br />
<br />
GL and hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Careful if camping the upper two mobs.<br />
I was just camping the 4 entrance spawns (2 inside doors and 2 above). I was using invis to change camp spots.<br />
<br />
Well invis went and I got aggro from several in the courtyard and died pretty quickly...went back for CR and the same thing happened! I realised that a Tae Ew Agressor had spawned in place of the usual Warrior/Warder and that it could see invis. A second CR also reulted in death as I tried to drag corpse away from his aggro range.<br />
<br />
So 3 deaths later I managed to get a res... the Tae Ew Agressor had indeed seen through my invisibility and aggroed me. So just watch out and never assume that these are just yard trash... con them first...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>maggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yep, met an aggressor on my own yesterday. i can verify, that they can see invi very well :) :) was on my way to the mace, to check out if its easy doable for a 59 shaman. was a short race from CY to ZO but i was able to manage it with around 10% hp left.....</div></div><hr />
