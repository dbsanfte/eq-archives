I'll let someone else give you the history behind it...<br />
<br />
An Alpha pet is a pet that has been 'fed' 2 weapons so that it will dual wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the 39 pet is the first that can dual weild. It's also nice to give them proccing weapons like gnoll hide lariats at that level, or velium weapons at higher levels, they will proc alot and do extra damage with some dex buffs given to them.<br />
<br />
I believe it was considered a secret at one time that our pet would dual weild and so was called project alpha as the ability was tested and hush hush taught to our younger members. I believe it's common knowledge now but the term is still used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Someone discovered that if we give our pets two weapons, they can duel wield.  Then, someone else decided that if SOE ever discovered this bug, they'd nerf our pets.  Thus, we started calling it &quot;project alpha&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Damn this caps filter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Deny all knowledge!  There is NO Project Alpha.  Repeat Project Alpha does NOT exist!</div></div><hr />
