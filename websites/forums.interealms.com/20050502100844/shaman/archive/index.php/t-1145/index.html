<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for a log parser that lets me track peoples damage.  I've tried EQ log parser but it mistakenly assumes i ONLY want to track MY damage and no one elses.  It gives me all these ultra detailed melee stats but i'm a freakin shaman i don't melee.  I want it to track the tanks in my guild etc.  There any way to get it to analyze anyone or is there one that will analyze anyone you choose?</div></div><hr />

It is fantastic.  I have it running on my 2nd notebook and it runs real-time parsing the log file as it is writting.  It shows DPS from all people attacking the mob (assuming you have others attacks on).  Splits all the different chats (tells, says, guild, group) etc into their own windows.  Can use Microsoft speech thing to tell you when invis/lev/EB is fading.  Best bit of all tho is that you can store maps in it and define co-ordinates in relation to the map, then when you do /loc in eq it displays where you are on the map and the direction you are heading in - great for running through heavily tree'd or foggy zones.  I know my way round most zones I go through like the back of my hand now, but can help hitting my /loc button and having it draw a little circle and arrow on the map.<br />

If you dont want it to run real time you can open up old log files and it will analyse those for you.</div></div><hr />
