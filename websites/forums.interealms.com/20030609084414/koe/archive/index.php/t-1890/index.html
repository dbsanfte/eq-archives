<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wedeln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was doing some reading tonight and it seems that the PoG can be done with 2-3 groups quite comforably.  I would love to run this but I've never run a raid before.  Has anyone ever done PoG and would maybe lead a small raid in there?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wedeln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They got nerfed? Well i still think it would be fun but thats new news to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah on an average 6ish hour raid you will see around 3 things drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wedeln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, reason i wanted to do this was to get to know more KoE members so I'm not overly worried about loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, if there are enough people going, I would be happy to lend my sword!  I have never been, so that would be worth it just to see.  Also, on the rare chance that something good does drop, it would be more than worth it :).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wedeln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">again i cannot stress this enough; We need someone who has led a planes raid before</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It can be done with 3 groups how ever you really need some one who have experience there to go or you will have a NASTY CR to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seraphima Angelique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A CR wouldn't be as bad if you had someone who wasn't KoS yet to rez them along with you, I would imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Infinate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well I'm PoG friendly and I'd really like to stay that way. So after that thought. I'd rather not go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unfortunately Sera, having a non-KoS person there to aid in a CR in Velious does not help.  Because of the importance of factions in Velious, Verant has added some safety precautions so that we are not able to just have a non-KoS person walk in and save the day.  A non-KoS person who attempts to drag the corpse of a KoS person will immediately be aggroed, it is perceived as assisting the enemy.  I believe, tho never seen it for sure, that if you also perform a rez the same effect will happen.  Of course a non-KoS person to do scouting is viable so long as they do not do anything to bring aggro upon them.<br />
<br />
Being an Agnostic, I am not very friendly in PoG, I am threateningly faction.  But this does not mean I'm going to hunt there as it would effectively KoS me in my home town of Felwithe and in my other home Kelethin.  Already KoS in much of Kaladim but that is another story :rolleyes:   Don't do a lot of stuff in Felwithe anymore, but it is my home and my factions are maxxed to Ally there, don't feel like ruining it so count me out of all PoG raids.  <br />
<br />
Yes the armor drops there are pathetic now, and so are any other item types.  It is no longer a zone ppl go to when they are questing after great gear, that being said, why bother going cause all it will do is lower factions in the long run.  If you want to raid there are hundreds of other zones :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I, like I said, am willing to help.  I a no leader for a PoG,raid but would like to go.  I think he just wants a show oof hands as opposed to helpful advice.......  besides, Tunare has a nice behind</div></div><hr />
