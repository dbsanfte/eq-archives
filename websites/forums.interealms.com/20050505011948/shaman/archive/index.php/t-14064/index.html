<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
You know when you first con a mob it will say:<br />
<br />
... appears dubious to you<br />
or ... appears apprehensive to you<br />
<br />
Is there a post or web page that explains what con messages will give you agro?<br />
<br />
Thks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Scowls and Threateningly are the 2 cons where the mob will agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Glares at you threateningly&quot; and &quot;Scowls at you ready to attack&quot; are the two that will attack you unprovoked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The list is<br />
Ally<br />
Kindly<br />
Amiable<br />
Indifferent<br />
dubious<br />
apprehensive<br />
threatening  (percentage of mobs will attack)<br />
Scowling (mobs will attack unless they are green and don't have 'always attack'coding)<br />
<br />
Other that attacking, the only three things these cons effect are whether merchants will sell to you at all, selling price for items and whether or not you'll get offered or can complete certain quests.<br />
<br />
Killing just about anything that effects a faction positively, effects at least one other faction negatively.  It's always a tradeoff....<br />
<br />
Plus, there are 'hidden factions,' due to diety or lack thereof affiliation.<br />
<br />
BTW, beware of Factions.  You might think yer in good with the Scaleybutts of Cabilis if you fight in Seb, but that's only ONE faction in the city, you'd still be KoS with all others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually warmly is in there between kindly and ally.<br />
<br />
Also, merchant mobs are always bottomed out at dubious.  You may actually be in the &quot;scowling&quot; category for a merchant, but he'll con dubious to you.  They used to not do that, so you'd have merchants go chasing kos people around, get out of place, and refuse to sell to anyone for days.  Quite a pain, so they made merchants nonkos.<br />
<br />
There is a point system for factions, I don't know it off hand, but scowling is the largest range.  Killing some mobs give you bigger faction hits than other mobs.  For example (not real number) killing the king of ak'anon might lower your faction with him 1000 points, but killing a clockwork sweeper might only drop you by 5.  In general the negative faction hits for killing things are always larger than the positive ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I always forget that  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Apprehensive is also better than dubious, so that it's:<br />
<br />
Ally<br />
Warmly<br />
Kindly<br />
Amiable<br />
Indifferent<br />
Apprehensive - lowest at which mechants will buy/sell<br />
Dubious<br />
Threatening - will sometimes agro, will always agro if you sit<br />
Scowling - will always agro, except for some that are very green<br />
<br />
And it's true that when you kill something that has any positive faction hits, there are almost always negative hits as well.  The negative hits are usually larger.  There are quests you can do, however, that give only positive faction hits.  There aren't many, but they exist.  An example is turning in goblin ears (or gnoll scalps or orc scalps) in HighHold, which gives only positive faction, to a number of shadier groups in Antonica.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The /con color levels listed on Alla's are mostly wrong. The listing predates the addition of light blues. Also, when LtBlues were added, the Blue ranges were increased in size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dubious - lowest at which bankers will bank<br />
<br />
Untrue. You can bank while KOS. You can bank while the KOS banker is in the process of hitting you. I would do this all the time in thurgadin when I was giant allied. Also fun in Runneye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wouldnt say that on threatening a percentage of them would attack. Its more like you can run past them without them agroing on you, while you cant manage that on a scowl mob, which is insta agro.<br />
<br />
Some threatening mobs dont agro though, remember in grobb, there was some red mobs to me that were also threateningly(Jocka and some more) which didnt attack even if you were close. If you did get killed by her, it was most likely because the skeleton that sometimes spawn there agroed and jocka assisted.<br />
<br />
The crocodiles in Oasis, arent they scowl? But still dont attack you?<br />

Really??  I thought the trick to kos banking was in using sneak or hide to get effectively non-kos long enough to open up the bank.  Learn something new every day.</div></div><hr />
