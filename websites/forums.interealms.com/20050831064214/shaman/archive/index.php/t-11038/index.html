OMG! Raidleader shouts BURN HIM! DISC! FULL CHARGE! CLERICS NUKE! He dropped some nice loot.... Exactly 2 minutes before servers going down for real, the last person was ported out (DKP officer and last person who win something) .... talk about margins hehe<br />

Sad thing is the cleric who died to rampage, was bound near flamewall (dunno why the hell she did that), who LD'd upon death, logged in and got deathloop. Took us like 2 hours to revocer her.....</div></div><hr />
