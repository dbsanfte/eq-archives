<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had my 66 shaman and 65 warrior in fungus grove last night PLing my bot afk cleric to 56 (we were doing the caller cycle with an earthshaker). I had been constantly clicking my 5 line /pause x, /cast x hotbutton on the cleric to raise his skills. The zone was empty for at least 4 hours when all of a sudden &quot;sentinel soandso&quot; turns up, he looks at my cleric for a good 2 minutes then leaves without saying a word. <br />
<br />
Did the GM show up because I was using the earthshaker, because my cleric was leveling so fast (43-56 in 4 hours) or because I was using the hotbutton macro?<br />
<br />
I'm confused, don't really want to get banned lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its possible he thought you were using some form of an AFK macro, but since you werent, and he must have noticed that, since you had no set pattern to your kills/skill raises, etc, he left. <br />
<br />
Personally, I am glad to see they are able to get a flag on some of this stuff and scope it out. I am also glad they didnt take any further action against someone who was obviously at the KB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah I believe someone posted a formal response, from SoE, about some of the macro programs and the onlything they said was that if you were at the KB you could use it.<br />
<br />
If I might make a suggestion is that you shouldnt go AFK when doing it and pay attention incase they do check in on you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can usually tell the difference between someone actually at the keyboard just pressing a key (legal) and someone not at the keyboard using a macro (not). Usually all it takes is /tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had a GM visit myself and the person helping me PL my monk when he was around 20 at the time (60 shm and 60 dru for PL'ing), in FM at the giant fort.  Apparently they got flagged from an &quot;extreme amount&quot; of corpses and came to investigate.  I didn't realize they watched for that stuff really until then.  She came and saw we were fine, gave us some cookies and milk, and left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well i did have 120+ corpses at any time, i wonder if that was it.<br />
<br />
Oh well I guess its no issue.</div></div><hr />

I remember when that happened, Bart.  That was hilarious.  Go go Bartys!</div></div><hr />

Guide stopped by to pay a visit once. I guess me slipping out /say Bugger! when I fizzled the spell (AGAIN) for them to be happy and move along.<br />
<br />
I really need to figure a way to summon more than 5 with one macro.<br />
