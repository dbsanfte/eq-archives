<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tritan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone else have these boots yet?  I just got them last night and it lists the focus effect as blast of venom.  Thats the same name as our 54 poison nuke 600pt DD.  But I cannot click these boots at all.  I petitioned and a GM told me since it was a focus effect he thought it would increase my poison DD's or something.  I tried that and its not true either, I see no effect on these things at all.  Are they broken or am I just missing something.  Any help is appreciated.<br />

<br />
The only assumption I can make is they either ****ed up, or intended to use the Focus Effect Saryrn's Torment (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3654&amp;source=Live) instead. (That's sort of doubtful though being that the effect is on another item already)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh.. I was going to post the exact same question. I got em last night too. They are a wierd item.<br />
<br />
All the other priest boots have mp4.<br />
<br />
They are also 1 less AC then wolf callers(boggle).<br />
<br />
People I linked them to last night said the link was broken.<br />
<br />
Neither lucy nor allas has them listed so no way to check there heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tritan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It sucks doesnt it Karelan?  I was expecting mp4 as well :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bumping this.<br />
<br />
This item isnt in lucy, magelo or allas and I swear to god the effect has to be bugged.. <br />
<br />
is it supposed to be right clicky blast of poison ala jbb style?<br />
<br />
is it supposed to be MP4 like other priest boots?<br />
<br />
is it supposed to be a focus that works on blast of poison(only listed as 44 dd in lucy.. not as a focus effect).<br />
<br />
Im bugging them, kinda pissed about both the effect and the fact of them having less AC then wolf callers boots.</div></div><hr />
