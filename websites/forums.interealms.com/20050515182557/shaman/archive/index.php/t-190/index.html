<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if I'm missing something here... guild been doing the Temple of Veeshan lately (Halls of Testing), and I've gained a Wolf Callers Helm - but it's invisible?  The guy who does the custom helms mentions 'plate helms' specifically, and I've been warned that he'll eat chain/leather helms.  Also found this on VI's boards...Corrected some of the Velious quest helm graphics. All helms of this type are no longer displaying a graphic (as intended) and the 'customized' plate helms should all now have graphics (also as intended)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep this is correct. My Ulthork head gear will not show. It will never show unless verant changes their coding for it. <br />
<br />
If you have a piece that is not showing but should then you may need to go into your eqclient file and play around with your SHOWARMOR settings by changing them to TRUE and/ or FALSE. I don't know the exact combonation you will need to make your helm show. But maybe someone else will read this and post it.<br />
<br />
The last person I helped with an armor graphics problem I told them to do this:<br />
<br />
Turn All Showarmor settings to TRUE.<br />
Turn Showarmor #21 to FALSE.<br />
<br />
This worked for him.</div></div><hr />
