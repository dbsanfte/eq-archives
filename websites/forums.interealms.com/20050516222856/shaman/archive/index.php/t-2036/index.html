<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bazgul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I two-box it with my troll Shaman and an iksar shadowknight (both level 37 now).  I consider the Shaman my main and the SK my second pet :).  My plan is to take this duo well into the 50s, if not all the way to 60. (Note: I have been to 60 before so I appreciate this will take a lot of effort.)  <br />
<br />
All of this said, I am beginning to worry that maybe I should have rolled up a Monk pet instead of an SK pet.  I am concerned about Dmg output later on.  I know that the Monk owns here.  Will the SK be able to do enough dmg such that I can handle bigger (50+) mobs later on?  Are there any veterens on this board that have partnered with SKs that could share?<br />
<br />
I appreciate it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been duoing with an SK all the way from level newbie up to 60 (and still do).<br />
<br />
If you stubbornly will run around with a 1-hander and a shield on the SK then yes, a monk will outdam the SK anyday... but if you get your hands on a good 2-hander, like a reaver or something, and take it from there... you'll be doing quite sufficient damage all the way up in levels.<br />
When we were at your levels we were doing very nice exp compared to others, and no single group we tried gave us faster exp rate than just us duoing away.<br />
<br />
I think you shouldn't worry about it - both combos are very nice ones. Now, if you want to play a monk instead then that's a different story... <br />
<br />
Compare the monks advantage of higher dam output with the SKs advantages: they can tank better (ie. you can go for bigger mobs), makes it easier in dungeons with snare, fear kite rules at lower levels and also their superior taunt ability makes it easy for the shaman ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SK and monks both make great partners for a shaman IMO.  Monks deal faster damage generally, plus mend is a nice bonus heal every few mins.  On the other hand the SK will generally tank better, can snare to keep runners from causing trains, and with a good 2hander can still put out very good damage.  Not to mention with an SK tanking you shouldn't ever have to tank more than 1 or 2 rounds after Slowing and Dotting, SK taunt ability is Sooo nice. :)<br />
<br />
So, either way you'll be fine.  I duo with an SK in my guild regularly and we do very well.  He pulls as well as a monk, tanks better, and puts out good damage although not as good as the guild monks we have.  On the other hand, the SK snares and keeps aggro like nobody else so we never have problems with runners causing trains nor do I get the snot beat out of me which means more hp for cannis and less downtime.<br />
<br />
If both are level 37 now, I'd stick with the SK.  by the time you PL the monk up to the same level as you shaman you could have gained several levels with both the SK and Shaman.  Neither is clearly better as a partner than the other, they're just different...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SK's have come a LONG way since Kunark Expansion.   If you look at just rough parse logs of SK vs Warrior/Monk DPM, yes, SKs are lacking, but SK's get a Pet, Like yours, they get Lifetaps.. Lifetap Procs, and other spells to add to their overall DPM.   In addition, with the proper AA skills SK's can even do MORE damage (- Soul Abrasion) With the implementation of GOOD 2 handers (The aforementioned Reaver is a perfect example) an SK is a pretty impressive stand alone Melee.   <br />
<br />
I duo with Monks and SK's a lot, and find both, when properly played are an impressive partner for a Shaman.<br />
<br />
I'm currently levelling a BST to 60 to box alongside my Oracle for XP camps as I think that combo will be devastating.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aammon Aammonite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe its just me but when duoing with a monk I always feel like I have to do alot of healing to keep his sorry butt alive.  And that leads to alot more down time.  The versatility of a sk makes them a better choice in my humble opinion.  I hate being main healer.  Thats just me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm partial to Shaman + SK.  Taunt (taunttaunttaunt, mmm, taunt), snare, nice debuffs, (IMO) superior tanking ability, pet, fear, the list goes on.  The superior DPS of the shaman/monk combo is nice, but damage is only one tool, albeit a very important one.  And, as noted above, an SK that uses a decent 2h weapon (Strength of Grodan is FREE) can put out a respectable amount of damage when everything is factored in, especially in areas where the pet can be used safely.<br />
<br />
As far as 2 boxing goes, I don't know.  I'd be inclined to think that it might be tougher to get the most out of an SK/Shaman combo than it would be with Monk/Shammy.  I could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok.. a 60 uber SK in like decent gear (Most big mobs, not quite Emp/VT... guild that can take ST, NToV etc) Will outdmg a regularly equipped monk.<br />
<br />
I used to duo with a monk who was just a Regular ole joe... normal equip for a 60 monk. I also duo'd with a 60 sk in a guild i described before. <br />
<br />
The SK didnt need a heal ever. I had mana for a pet, i dotted every mob and sometimes slowed. He didnt need them to be slowed he procced lifetaps that kept him alive. He put out a **** ton of dmg and tanked really well.<br />
<br />
The monk needed me to slow. He did same dmg, maybe a little more. I didnt get to dot every mob and thats where we lost the dmg which made the sk betteer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have some questions regarding the SK in a shaman/rogue group.  Keeping aggro off the shaman isn't really all that big of a deal.  Can' usually get it with just a disease cloud/snare/heart flutter and a round of combat or 2.  No big deal.  now that I've added the rogue (wife), it seems really difficult to keep aggro off of her.  We both have the same haste. She has Shaded dagger (11/22) and centi shortsword (think 12/25) which is a pretty decent weapon combo at level 40.  I have a deathbringers rod (decent, but could be better with something like a reaver).  We both have the same haste items.   She evades pretty well off of me but the thing keeps on turning around to her over and over.  Sk's used to be kings of aggro because of disease cloud from the small things I've read.. Now that this spell doesn't add as much aggro, how does an SK keep aggro?  I can pretty much keep aggro if I heartflutter, but it doesn't seem practical to use it every fight as big as the mana cost is.. If I use it &quot;when I need it&quot; it's usually too late in the fight for it to matter.  I want aggro on me. All the time.  Not having to put chloro on the rogue saves a bit of mana on the shaman as it is and if I only have to pay attention to one for the most part it makes it a lot easier as well.<br />
<br />
So what's an SK do now?  Is the answer that I need to get a nicer weapon? Low mana casting pattern I'm not aware of?<br />
<br />
We've been having her join combat a couple of rounds after I start just to build some aggro and that seems to work ok. Still not perfect all of the time..<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Smert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I haven't tried it, but I was wandering the SK board discussion of the degrade to Disease cloud. One of the options put out was chain casting Clinging Darkness for a simular effect. If you need a better snare, then Shadow Vortex was always a good standby and still is good, and some seemed partial to Asytole. <br />
<br />
I haven't taken my SK out to party recently, much less needed to taunt off somebody, so I can't swear to the effiency of the above.<br />
Personally, I like to time the taunt right after I do some damage- usually Bash + taunt, or Cast+Bash+taunt. It's going to be strange without DC though. It's the second time reducing agro on spells to help non-SKs hurt SKs...grr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shadow vortex and Clinging darkness, both.  They aren't as good, even together, as DC was all by itself, and they eat lots more mana (relatively speaking), but they make it possible for SKs to do their job, sorta.  If you're just gonna use one, it seems to me that SV generates more aggro for the casting time.  Could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The only thing an SK lack is a defined role on raids, since many people don't feel comfortable with being just another melee doing damage.<br />
<br />
In group situations SKs do a bit less damage until you can find some way to get your ATK significantly higher than your base. My SK twink's got some of the best gear availible, mainly W/N ToV, but his damage is still pretty low since he's only got 900 ATK at 52.<br />
<br />
A smart SK can do tons of damage on raids, especially Luclin mobs, there are raids where SKs do damage second only to wizards. The key is of course mana regen. If you are just worrying about duoing through 60 without uber twinkage, an SK will do quite a bit less damage than a monk. Without Death Peace you can't really pull as well as a monk either. The only thing SKs have over monks is versitility and pvp. <br />
<br />
Pure damage wise, monks will be above an SK by a fair margin unless the SK has some serious mana regen. However, SK's invis vs undead + other utility spells makes a SK&amp;Shaman duo far more versital. You can duo in dungeons with both live and undead mobs. Killing will be slower, but the SK is an overall more fun charater to play, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I 2 box my shaman and sk. I also have a friend with a monk that I group with. In the 50+ game a well equiped monk is better than a SK. The reasons are this. <br />
<br />
Damage output is much better with a monk. Monks can bind wounds to 70% + mend out of the box. Monks have a better feign. Add a regen item like the fungi tunic and you will be waiting on the monk to heal you after canna. <br />
<br />
The only downside to a monk is the taunt factor. Given time they will get it, but a shadowknight grabs it faster than any other melee. <br />
<br />
I love my shadowknight. To do over again I would still choose her over a monk. For min/maxing though there isn't a better combo than a monk + shaman. This is all from my perspective running a 55 shaman and 53 SK with decent non-high high end gear. Mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can SKs not bind to 70%? I know shamans can, I assumed that if we can, all melee classes would be able to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Since the change to disease cloud my sk has been trying different spells to see if any others agro well enough to use in its place. I found that although it is expensive scream of hate seems to really torque off mobs. When I cast that spell on a mob I can almost always make it turn on me right away add a snaredot or a dot and you have agro.<br />
<br />
The main thing the disease cloud change did was make taunting more mana intensive but if an sk wants agro he can take it from just about anybody. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Don't get me wrong. I can get aggro if I want.. Heart flutter, snare, scream of hate and it's on my no problem. Problem is that costs 20m. The way we kill things, stuff dies really fast (40 rogue 40 SK).  With no mana regen, slows things down a bit.  I suppose when we hit the 50's fights will last a bit longer and the mana won't be as big of a deal.  I think we'll stick with the &quot;Join in 2 rounds after I build some aggro&quot; method for now and work into something as it goes on.<br />
<br />
I like the SK personally.  I played a monk to 60 and really miss it, but probably wouldn't start one over.  Sk is very versatile and something is cool about a big fat ogre holding a huge stick and pounding people with it.<br />

I have no problem with Taunt and can sit almost immediatly after slowing. I do not DOT unless it is a mob with High HP's (I hunt mainly in old world but do go to ME and duo where I do DOT). I like the SK because of the spells he has. Snare is really nice and his ability to taunt is also. However, the damage output is good but not great on the SK (I currently use an Argent Protector and/or Noc with AS). I have duoed with a 60 Monk many times in FG and that duo is great also. However if you need to dot to kill the mobs then best would be SK. If you get argo using DOT the monk will have a hard time getting it off ya.<br />

<br />
Hmm I didn't know shaman could bind that high. I thought only warriors, rogues, &amp; monks could bind wounds to 70%. I could be wrong though. My sk's skill is at 158. Guess I'll have to take a trip to lava storm and try it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A SK can grow into a more effective partner with greater ability and versatility than a monk can ever hope to achieve.  <br />
<br />
SK's have **** at truly high level that makes them (under the guiding fingers of a professional player) a deadly deadly force of friggen nature.  A SK can solo places for exp that a shaman that would make a same level shaman blanche and turn away.  Amazing class really.  <br />
<br />
It all starts with the enormously overpowered Tank/Mage combo.  Basically if there is such a thing in EQ, which the designers claim that there is not, a SK is a Tank/Mage.  Tanking abilities are same as a paladin armor and defense wise.  Melee output is slightly higher than a paladin due to self attack buffs they cast, raising attack up to 100 points.  That's an avatar folks.  Next, for the SK who knows how to control his pet, there is a kick ass pet at lvl 59 that is about twice as good as our best shaman pet.  It's a lvl 44 necro pet.  <br />
<br />
Next you have the spells.  The DoTs they cast are mostly of the lure variety given to necros, but of a lower level.  Still, they can really lay on some decent DoT damage to aid the DPS they have already.  <br />
<br />
Lastly they can BOTH snare and FD.  This makes the SK the ideal puller for some situations, and a force unto himself in others.  Imagine being able to walk up to a mob deep in a dungeon, surrounded by other mobs (you're invis or ITU, whichever), step off to a corner, pull the mob, slay it, snare it, and if you get adds, just FD and try again.  <br />
<br />
Amazingly overpowered class, akin to necromancers in that respect.  SKs are to other melees as necros are to other casters.  Very self sufficient, powerful spells and abilities, but less raid friendly than some classes, and not really thought of as &quot;a required class&quot; thus causing them to not be top choices in many groups.  <br />
<br />
You'll need to be an outgoing person to play an SK at later levels.  You need to make your own groups, make friends who want to group with you, and thus show them all how you are someone whom they can't live without. <br />
<br />
We shamans have been in that position for a long time, or at least a similar one.  We've shown to the world of Norrath that we are very very useful in groups and highly desired overall.</div></div><hr />
