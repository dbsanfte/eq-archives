<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Cross-posting this from my guild's board...<br />
<br />
Why does it seem that absolutely no thought was put into them? They're down right awful. Now, I know they said that they're looking at them, but I'll bitch anyways. <br />
<br />
Melee/Hybrid Arms: Effect Regeneration (worn). Why? This effect is horrible, especially with the innate regen cap. This effect should be Aura of Daring, which is 20 atk 2 regen. This falls way more in line with the other pieces as well. Bracers? Vengeance 3 (15 Atk). Boots? Vengeance 5 (25 atk). Gloves? Aura of Bravery (30 Atk 3 regen). Sorry, but no Rogue, Monk, Ranger, ect is going to use an item with effect &quot;Regeneration&quot; over their arms from Luclin that have Atk on them. They really need to be made more in-line with the other pieces. <br />
<br />
Hybrid Boots: Why do they have Flowing Thought 5 when Melee have Vengeance 5? That is just ridiculous. They should also be V5, the Ranger ones at least (Atk &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mana Regen at the point in the game where you will get these items). No ones made hybrid gloves yet, I seriously hope they're Aura of Bravery like the Melee ones are heh, and not some insane difference like the melee/hybrid boots. <br />
<br />
Now, for the really big offenders: <br />
<br />
Breast Plates and legs. Spirit of Predator on Ranger legs (with an 8 second cast time at that)? Cloak of Luclin on the SK legs? come on. <br />
<br />
The legs should have Aura of Valor on them, 40 Atk 4 regen. If you're absolutely set on having an inane right-click on them, make Aura of Valor a &quot;focus&quot; effect on the legs and have some &quot;useful&quot; right-click on them as well. <br />
<br />
Breastplates: Right click Avatar on the melee bps (and the one that counts toward the innate atk cap at that) and things like Brells on the Paladin bp? Is this some kind of joke? I hope it is. The BPs should be done along the same lines as my idea for the legs, except they should have Aura of Resolution for the &quot;focus&quot; effect (50 atk 5 regen) and some useful right click. <br />
<br />
Hopefully they'll consider my ideas (as a lot of them do read my guild's mb) and change these items, as they really are not what they should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunjin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The effects are a total joke as they stand ft5 is rediculous sop is stupid....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Our guild had the same discussion the other day.. I couldn't agree more with your points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Whle I agree with your points Sean, I don't necessarily agree with making all the pieces of our armour something with Vengeance or AoB v2.<br />
<br />
Maybe its different in the Elemental Planes (not there yet), but I am not seeing the huge DPS gains with super high boosts to attack like we did with with Luclin.  It helps, there is no question, but not to the degree that I saw in Ssra, etc.<br />
<br />
I would like to see perhaps focus effects such as combos such as ID4 and Spell Haste 4 (perhaps its just me, but I gladly lost 50+ HP in the ring slot for ID4), or Swiftwind effect on the boots (attack and haste), etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Those effects are good, but there is a plethora of them on &quot;non-visible&quot; pieces. No need to put them on the Elemental armor, which is entirely visible pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mortok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How about giving us effects that are just totally different than what we get now.  I have to believe that at some point your ATK is experiencing the same diminishing returns we see with everything in EQ.  Sean you have tons and tons of ATK items... do you really want 30 more atk when you could get a whole new spell/effect that you have no way of getting now?<br />
<br />
But I do agree with your post.  Some of the effects they put on the items are just down right stupid.  Another clear example of the fact that they don't even play their own game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Razumihin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some things change... some things stay the same.<br />
<br />
It's common sense when looking at which effects to give to any set of armor available to all classes, to give roughly the same upgrade in power. When everyone puts on this armor, ideally, all classes should be enhanced at approximately the same level. <br />
<br />
When you give pure melee other classes' spells on their armor, as well as the most sought after enhancement effects (ATK), while giving the other classes their own spells that they ALREADY worked to get through the use of parchments, and then giving them less desirable enhancement effects (FT which is available everywhere now), you completely skew the progression of power each class receives.<br />
<br />
If you give one class a unique spell, you give everyone a unique spell. And there's enough FT in the last two expansions to satisfy even the most hungry hybrid. Keep the FT where it belongs, somewhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unless every other item in PoTime has 50 atk on it, you'd still be hard pressed to hit the cap. As for effects... sure, but come on. You know exactly how well they do hybrid effects. 95% of the time it's some rehash of crap we already have, with pure melees getting some decent effect. I'd rather be a little more realistic and have them put something on the armor I know would be decent.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, if you read my entire post, I left room for adding right-clicks to the BPs and Legs. If you make the Aura of XXX a *Focus effect* you can add a right-click effect on top of it. Which gives them plenty of room to add some neat/useful things to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaggezin Bloodsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I take it someone has made the ranger boots than? What needs to happen is for dev team to put together a hybrid set of the atk effects with ft instead of regen component. Throw a couple of those in there on the bracers and arms as sean said were weak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sorronn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Once again this proves rather eloquently that hybrids are ignored.<br />
<br />
No, there is not a grand conspiracy against hybrids though it sometimes seems that way. Instead we get benign neglect. In other words, since no one on the dev team stands up for hybrids, we get crappy effects, sub par stats, lousy itemization, etc.<br />
<br />
This armor is just a continuation of the same thing.<br />
<br />
Scott Hartsman needs more than improved communication in his dev team to fix this. He needs someone actively acting as an advocate for each class. Improved communication won't help anything if there is no one communicating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tolian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pure melee have right click Avatar on BPs?  Am I reading that wrong or something?  Cuz its total and complete BS if its legit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yes Tolian, you read that correctly...<br />
<br />
the strait melee classes, that get no inate spell capabilities at all, get the single most desired melee buff, as a click item, with only 6 seconds casting time, so that they can click it on demand, as often as need to keep it up all the time.<br />
<br />
But hybrids (especially rangers) get existing spells they already have, and in many cases they get the outdated version of the spells, so that they still have to use their scribed spells to get the most current upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mirklin Darklander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you can't clear VT, you won't be getting elemental armor any time soon,  the effects make mot of those pieces sup-par, and situational at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kiyrwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, my opinion:<br />
1) Right click versions of our buffs are useless, i never had problems keeping a full raid buffed all by myself and doubt it will ever be a problem. If we get a rightclick spell it should be something we don't have and offers some utility. No matter what, rightclicks are usually just a toy, so Seans idea of adding them additionally to other effects is nice, even if you use the click only once per month the piece will be useful.<br />
2) Atk is good.<br />
3) FT for hybrids is umm, well nice for soloing i guess but seriously i can't remember when the last time was i sat down to med during a raid. So no, FT does not even come close to atk in usefulness to Rangers, maybe other hybrids can make use of it but please, FT only if you try really hard and can't think of anything better... and well maybe not even then hehe.<br />
4) Focus effects are nice, yes even Rangers enjoy nuking faster, for more damage, heal better and cast from further away, at least i do.<br />
5) Creativity is good, use your imagination, probably every Ranger here you ask can shake better ideas for effects out of their sleeves in 5 minutes, for the whole set. Even without creating new spells there is more original stuff to put on armor than regeneration and random rightclick buffs from our spellbook.<br />
<br />
Sorry, this got more addressed at the developers than i had intended, it's late and i just got carried away. :)<br />
Just don't mind me, going to sleep now...</div></div><hr />

Did I miss something in the thread? I couldnt find anything on innate regen in that or any other thread...<br />
<br />
<br />
To get back on topic I feel BP/Legs should have an effect and a Focus, then again when we get into PoTime who knows what kind of stuff is gonna drop. Maybe they didnt want to put it all in the elemental planes so the progression would be smoother....</div></div><hr />

 I have to believe that at some point your ATK is experiencing the same diminishing returns we see with everything in EQ. <br />
Wrong. Every bit of attack helps. Unless you're hitting for max damage EVERY hit, you could still use more attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;Wrong. Every bit of attack helps. Unless you're hitting for max damage EVERY hit, you could still use more attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure every little bit helps, but that sounds remarkably close to every little bit of AC helps unless you are getting hit for min every time.  However, I'm not in my experiences thus far, seeing the huge gains of DPS for increases of Attack like we saw in Velious and in Luclin, at least not post 1800 attack on Teir 2 (PoTactics, Torment, etc) encounters.<br />
<br />
So it makes me wonder, which would improve our abilities more, adding another 15 attack to a piece of armour, or granting an focus effect that boosts spell damage by up to 25% (ID4 only does up to 20) and/or spell haste?<br />
<br />
But then, I also don't think just slapping more Vengeance or AoB v2 on all the pieces is any more creative or fun than putting Warders Protection on our Ornate BP.  I would rather see things like Swiftwind or Seething Fury on a piece (rogues get the THO belt effect on one of their gloves), or some combo focus effect that augments our casting abilities, than just another 15 attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Diegaron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This has to be the most ridiculous screw-job given to rangers in a long time.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Moonhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I agree that the BP and Legs are utterly ridiculous when compared to the fact that they are giving the pure melee classes spells that we would love to get. But, I don't think that all our armor pieces need to have just ATK effects. I would rather see some variety. Not everyone plays their class the same way, and not any single one method is &quot;THE ONE&quot;.<br />
<br />
If we HAVE to have SOP on the pants, then make it an automatic MGB SoP, something that gives us a useful tool. I don't care if it is a 30-second cast. Or hey, why not an MGB CoR.<br />
<br />
I would also like to see some Focus Effects on these items, specifically Increased Spell Damage etc. I also like the idea of having the Siftwind Effect on one of the items, or Eye of the Eagle.<br />
<br />
I personally don't mind having FT5 on the boots, especially in the role of the Pulling Ranger.<br />
<br />
I think the most insulting aspect is the Warder's on the Ornate BP. There is no Ranger I can think of that would ever use that effect. To get an Ornate BP you are going to be 62+ anyways, and using CoR+SoT+CoP. I find this quite insulting, especially considering what they place on the melee armor.<br />
<br />
As for the Elemetal BPs, either give us the same Avatar as the melee, or make it something that can be considered as much of an upgrade as having Avatar for melee.<br />

Wrong. Every bit of attack helps. Unless you're hitting for max damage EVERY hit, you could still use more attack. <br />
<br />
I am not saying that ATK is bad in any way... all I am saying is how much extra damage are you really doing with that extra 30atk compared to if you had a whole new spell/effect that could help you on a whole different level.  Honestly I don't know how much added DPS you gain from 30-40 extra ATK but is it really worth it when you are very high anyways?<br />
<br />
I would have just liked them to be creative.  Then again I am sure they would have screwed that up too.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Mortok, there is a plethora of spell focus effects on misc pieces (non visible ones) - zero reason to put them on elemental armor pieces (which are all visible pieces).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yeah, Melee/Hybrid legs on test are all now Aura of Valor (40 Atk 4 regen). <br />
<br />
Melee arms are now Aura of Bravery (30 Atk 3 regen). Hybrid arms are all Vegeance 5 (25 atk) + a Focus effect. Rangers get Improved Damage 4, Paladins Healing 4, SKs Affliction 4.<br />
<br />
Melee boots on test are now Aura of Daring (20 atk 2 regen), and Hybrids Vengeance 4 (20 Atk) and Mana Preservation 4.<br />
<br />
Melee BPs on test have had their Avatar cast time reduced to 2  seconds from 6 seconds. Personally, I still think the effect sucks, but it's a hell of a lot better now than it was, the cast time reduction makes a huge diff.<br />
<br />
Hybrid bps, as said above, have Koadic's Heightened Focus (5 mana regen) now. Which is an incredibly crappy effect. No clue why the put that on there heh.<br />
<br />
Great changes to the Boots, Legs, and Arms though... enough that you can live with the crappy BP effects.<br />
<br />
Overall now Melee get +150 atk, 12 regen, EB, See Invis, and Ultravision from a full suit minus Breastplates. Hybrids get 145 Atk, 7 Regen, Mana Pres 4, EB, See Invis, Ultravision, and another focus effect (Imp Damage 4 Rangers, Affliction 4 SKs, Imp Healing 4 Paladins, not sure on Bard/Bst). All of the pieces are off various &quot;ubers&quot; in the Elemental Planes except the BPs and Legs so far (which we think are in the Plane of Time (the last plane of this expansion), as they're not off the Gods in the Elementals... yet), so they're much more appropriate now imo.</div></div><hr />

There is no reason for ther to be a different effect in the first place.  How can you justify chaining hybrids to their Primal/Prismatic weapons, while giving the other pure melees an automatic out from weapon switching.  <br />
<br />
The designers obviously intended for melee classes all reach the worn ATK cap.  Why the feel it's necessary for hybrids to keep using their outdated weapons for a proc while others don't is what i'm failing to see and why I think KHF needs to go.<br />

I think that if the bps are in potime as speculated than they should pack a punch. Give us swiftwind, give the paladins gift of marr and change their arms to something else like spell haste. SKs give them some kind of FD speeding focus. With just aten neck and c5 without ever sitting I never med on raids as it is.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Xaem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">For most of the people that skipped ST at one point, KHF &lt; Avatar on a BP, its a huge attack and DPS increase, for many are not even close to the ATK cap, and Avatar brings them a little bit closer.</div></div><hr />

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if the version of Avatar on the BP's requires an emerald, then would it not be the version of Avatar that shaman can cast, IE would stack  with the innate Attack cap?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still maintain that KHF is an absolute pile of CRAP for a rc effect compared to avatar.  KEI is very EASILY available from a friendly enchanter, bazaar, etc. and lasts like 3 hours!  It's rare when I DON'T have some form of KEI on.  Having rc avatar &gt; all.</div></div><hr />

We get Improved Damage IV, which increases damage further than the bard song.. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Lyrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Totally agree about every thing but avatar on the bp.  The effect now is better than avatar.  Most rangers are not covered in FT items, but you will have innate attk items.   If you are here at this level of game you aren't gonna be lacking much more attk, at least not to the point of warrenting avatar on BP's.  <br />
<br />
Personally the new effect is sub par (as are all of the avatar effects, really hating that 250 cap, the part that phases out avatar).  Why put an effect that is being phased out anyway.  If the avatar from the BP STACKS, and adds attk like shaman avatar then i'll be happy, but if its the same as from the primal/pristine, it almost serves no point.<br />
<br />
But right now I dont know if avatar from the bp takes up part of our &quot;innate&quot; attack cap.  <br />
<br />
Don't know what to add in its place, time for verant to become creative. <br />
<br />
Ornate effects are becoming a joke (least on bp arms and such).</div></div><hr />
