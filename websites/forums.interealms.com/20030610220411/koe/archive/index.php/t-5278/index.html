<br />
Sony have just announced the launch of EverQuest Legends!<br />
EverQuest Legends is an exclusive server, with a limited population of players able to participate in the new, more dynamic world. <br />
<br />
This new premium subscription service costs $39.95 per month instead of the $9.95 pricing.<br />
<br />
Benefits include: <br />
<br />
New dynamic maps help chart the travels of your character with step by step tracking of your progress through the world of Norrath and beyond. Quickly find which zone your character is bound in, and which zones you have or haven't visited. <br />
Truly unique and awesome new equipment will be introduced prior to their release on our other servers. <br />
<br />
EverQuest Legends players will have a whole new way to show off their characters and equipment - personal character pages! <br />
Part of the Legends web site, each player character will have a personal homepage featuring all the character's statistics and items.<br />
<br />
This first open signup for the Legends Service is capped at 8,000 subscribers. Sign-up commences on February 4th.<br />
As a value-added service to the EverQuest Legends service, you may choose to move up to eight (8) of your existing characters on a single account, with their items, from any existing server to an EverQuest Legends server.<br />
<br />
For more information visit the EverQuest Legends website at: http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com.<br />
<br />
<br />
All I can say after reading that info.....<br />
<br />
&lt;H1&gt;ROFLMAO&lt;/H1&gt;<br />
$40.00 / month?!!?  I'm crazy, but certainly not THAT crazy.<br />
<br />
They can take EQ Legends and shove it.  How bout giving the regular customers at least some new neat features, without having to totally rip their customers off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anuin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well all VI sees is $$$$$<br />
And I bet that they will be able to fill all 8000 spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hahahaha<br />
<br />
I think the polite term for this is &quot;a load of crap.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually,<br />
If I thought I could convince all of KoE to move, I would do it.  I don't really care about the gizmo's, but having the server population limit looks good to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is a response to a hot topic of a year or so ago concerning whether players would pay a premium service fee for an exclusive server and a higher level of customer service.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, I might pay this, if I had any expectation that I could see friends there.  It does at least offer the possibility of some releif of upper-level crowding.  Not level 10 n00b is gonna pay this fee to get a lower server population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Neverflee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">mmmmmm if I am paying 40 bucks a month for a game-- would be time to find a new game. However for 40 bucks I should be able to log on and say you know I need a new weapon and poof there it is lol. When Verrant asked would you pay more a month for better service I almost luaghed my self off my chair. <br />
<br />
Think if you went into  any restraunt and waited and waited like 2 hours for service or for anyone that worked there to say Hi. Then the Manager comes out and say you know  we could give you better service if you would just pay 40 dallors for your steak instead of 20. What would you say to the Manager?<br />
<br />
Need a map? use EQmaps.  Need to look up a quest go to Everlore.  Want to show off your Charicter? Make your own web page. Want to pay 40 bucks to play a vidio game --- you go dog go lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm.. couple of thoughts..<br />
<br />
Make dual (or more) boxing very expensive.<br />
<br />
Hope some uber types on our server do it.. one way to lessen the server population.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On the other hand, given our experience with Kirn tonight (I wasn't there, but watched in /gu) -- I'm thinking this new server will have at least one if not 3 GMs online all the time - in this case Kirn would have likely been spawned, and 20 people would not have lost several hours of their free time.<br />
<br />
I personally cant afford it now -- I'm actually fearful of when my last 6 month payment is going to wear off, because I'm out of the game if I don't find work soon -- but if I wasn't in a guild with 100 people I consider friends, I might have considered it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seran Swiftstrike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dear Verant,<br />
<br />
YOU = STUPID <br />
<br />
We're supposed to pay $40 dollars a month to experience EQ the way it's actually supposed to be?<br />
<br />
Die.<br />
<br />
ps: irl!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Let's see... for $40 a month would we get  unique armor textures back or will everyone's armor look exactly the same on the new models like it does now?  It was nice to have a unique look on some things - now every wood elf wearing plate I run across looks the same as me, just  a different color, even with velious armor :/ <br />
<br />
Would Verant actually test zones, armor, weapons, or spells before they release them to the general public on that server instead of letting people play for a few weeks then say &quot;Holy, how did that XXXX item get into the game?  We'd better reduce its effectiveness to balance out the game.&quot;?  <br />
<br />
Fix quests, mobs, pathing on the new server that have been broken for years?  Have more GM run events and dynamic stories or just have the same quests and mobs happen over and over and over again?<br />
<br />
There are tons of things that everyone who pays the $10 a month to play should have at their disposal right now and not have to pay $40 a month for.  If EQ actually has the customer subscription base it keeps boasting about then they are making plenty of cash, even after paying their employees, even after buying new servers, parts, etc.  <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;psychic&gt;<br />
Here's what will end up happening eventually.  We'll stay on Veeshan or wherever we happen to have characters parked, customer support will get worse (it could happen), content will get released to the new servers and never the old, people will complain and be told if they want the &quot;full&quot; EQ gaming experience then cough up the bucks.  We'll be known as Everquest Lite(tm) after about a year.  Our server population will reach 50,000 and we'll be denied a server split because they have an option available for $40 a month if we want to play in a better environment.<br />
&lt;/psychic&gt;<br />
<br />
Focus on fixing the game so it works the way it's supposed to now, then move on to new projects.  I say repair some of the spaghetti code and frustration you've got going now -- if you want more $$$ coming in every month giving features to everyone who plays now would bring back some that have left and make it more attractive to newcomers.<br />
<br />
Ok sorry for the rant :)  I just don't have much respect for a company that releases a buggy product and then turns its focus on releasing something better for more money without fixing what's wrong first.  Whoever thought of this needs to be kicked in the junk and have their wallet stolen ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There is already a server that has a by far fewer population, that gets items before the rest, that gets new features before the rest.  Ahhh perhaps this new $40/month server is to replace the existing one.... Welcome to Test Server II</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There seems to be a running theme.  When Verant adds something everybody complains, I don't understand this.  They are not taking anything away from you.  Adding a new service is not going to make life on Veeshan any worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Adding a new service is not going to make life on Veeshan any worse. <br />
I agree with that stament in its intent, Nin, but in light of the CS issues, bugs, etc that continue to haunt EQ, to me this is like asking for a Porsche or a Jaguar before you can drive. The fear I (and doubltess many others as posted) have, is that VI's resources will be poured into enhancing Legends as opposed to addressing current issues in the existing framework. The thing that ultimately PO's me the most about this, is that it was our monetary and playing support (through the reporting of bugs, etc) that  is being used to develop Legends. <br />
<br />
I think Seran summed it up for many of us...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ryptagudn Gobbleguts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Waran,<br />
<br />
I agree with you.  I really think the quality of service, such as it was, on the regular servers is going to degrade.  And it's a shame that it is.<br />
<br />
When I left the game there were still gobs of bugs and pathing problems.  How many of those have been fixed?  They shouldn't be making a better server until they take care of their initial customers first.<br />
<br />
Trust me when I say I'm wondering if Star Wars Galaxies is going to be on my list in the future.  This isn't helping Verant's cause with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">*Sigh*<br />
<br />
This is why I jumped ship.<br />
<br />
Naught but Greed at $OE.<br />
<br />
Wonder if the RISK will have to be increased in order to increase the sense of reward . (Verant Logic)<br />
<br />
I mean &quot;For Real&quot;.<br />
<br />
Folks have been paying $10/mo since the beginning (Summer 99) with an average $40 original outlay, and 3ea ~$25 expansions = an average of $300 to $450 investment per long-term player.<br />
<br />
400,000 players (as they claim) would mean they've probably made in the neighborhood of $160,000,000 (using $400 as the average).  And for THAT they want to charge 4 times as much to provide the latest niceties they've come up with.<br />
<br />
I don't think /rude suffices.<br />
