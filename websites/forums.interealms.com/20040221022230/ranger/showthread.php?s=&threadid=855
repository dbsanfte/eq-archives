	<p><i>Dis is Numbuk's first attempt at writing epic story.  It especially Numbuk's first attempt at writing story from an ogre perspective.  Me will <b>try</b> to update dis tory every day or so, so keep checking back.<br />
<br />
Please no reply to dis thread, so it make it easier to read from chapter to chapter.  If yous have any comments, suggestions, or anyting about dis story, please post it in <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=850" target="_blank">Dis Thread</a>.<br />
<br />
Me hope yous enjoy dis story as much as me is writing it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and me never really been writer before, so grammar stink.  But hey, me is an ogre, so cut some slack!</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Chapter 1.</b><br />
<br />
<br />
In a small cave in Oggok dere lived a nice ogre family.  Like many ogre families, dey had a mommy, a daddy, and two boy ogres.  Dis family was da Emgood family and dey were a happy bunch.  Smash was da older brudder and he would play "How Many Lumps Can I Make Yous  Head Get" with younger brother Bash.<br />
<br />
Dis was a happy time.  Daddy Emgood would fish all day long and sell his wares to the shopkeepers.  Mommy Emgood would spend her days dirtying up da unsightly "clean spots" in da cave and make her usual Froglok Booger Pie.  All was going berry well, until one night.<br />
<br />
"How was yous day, Bash?" asked Daddy Emgood while his family was sitting at da dinner table.<br />
<br />
"It fun!" said Bash excitedly.  "Smash gave me record number of lumps on head!  He gave me 14!  At least, dat what he say.  But me tink he no can count good."<br />
<br />
"Shut up," growled Smash, "Yous is just a dumbhead!  Me give yous more tomorrow!"<br />
<br />
"Now be quiet both of yous," barked Mommy Emgood.  "Don't make me have to give you both baths!"<br />
<br />
Both young ogres immediately slammed deir mouths shut and began eating quietly.  Nothing was heard but da sound of chomping and slurping.  Nothing, until da cave door exploded into a pile of smoldering rubble.<br />
<br />
Da Emgood family looked up with a shock.  Standing at da door was a mean looking goblin wizard.  Hand still smoking from some spell, he point a finger at Daddy Emgood.<br />
<br />
"Ah ha!  So you're the one I've been hunting for all these years!" da goblin cackled gleefully.  "Now I've found you, and now you shall die!"<br />
<br />
Without another word, da wizard send two fireballs hurling into da Emgood family.  It hit both Mommy and Daddy Emgood and dey disappear into a cloud of smoke and ash.  Bash and Smash just look on in disbelief and horror.  The goblin just smiles and blows on his finger.<br />
<br />
"That takes care of that," da goblin say. "No more worrying about that ogre coming to slay me."<br />
<br />
"Yous dumbhead," Bash yell out sobbing.  "He was good ogre!  He no wanted to kill anyone but gnomes, frogloks, orcs, bears, lizards, giants, treants, mammoths, sarnaks, skeletons, zombies, beetles, griffins, and dorfs.  He no wanted to kill goblin magic ting!"<br />
<br />
"Ah, but he would have," said the goblin.  "He was prophecied to kill me, so I just did the deed first.  Prophecy speaks of an ogre who will be my downfall, and I have tracked him to this house.  And by process of elimination, I figured it was your dad since you two are both too small and your mother was just a female.  So you see, now I can be safe."<br />
<br />
"Me tink yous is telling us too much information," said Smash.  "But why did yous kills our mudder too?"  Smash's eyes started to well up in tears.<br />
<br />
"I've nothing to fear from telling you too much information," remarked da goblin snidely.  "You're just kids!  As for your mother, well, I just happened to miss with my first fireball and hitting her was an accident.  Oh well, nobody's perfect."<br />
<br />
"Yous name is... Smellybreath?  Or is dat just a trait?" asked Bash inquisitively.<br />
<br />
"It is both a name and a trait.  How did you know it was my name?"<br />
<br />
"Yous have a sticker on chest dat say, 'Hello!  My name is Smellybreath' with words 'A.A. Meeting' at bottom."<br />
<br />
"Oh.  Right.  I forgot to take that off."<br />
<br />
"Ok den.  We will not forget.  Us is gonna train now for few years and we'll bash yous good!"<br />
<br />
"Good luck with that."  Smellybreath chuckled to himself.  "I'd like to see <b>that</b> happen.  Yeah right!  Take care, you little kids!  I am sure I'll never be seeing you ever again!"<br />
<br />
And with dat, da goblin vanished in a puff of smoke.</p>

	<p>Bash and Smash never forgot da face of mean goblin who killed deir parents.  Dey never forgot da evil glint in his red eyes, but mostly, dey never forgot his horrible breath.  Dere was a good reason his name was Smellybreath.<br />
<br />
Dey both went and lived with deir ogre grandfather.  Deir granddad was an ogre hippy, so he would always be using "special herbs" and listening to ogre sitar music.  <br />
<br />
Bash and Smash no had need of such tings, and so began to teach demselves da art of combat.  Dey knew dere was more to it dan just picking up big stick and smashing tings wit it, and dey knew it gonna take more dan said stick to bash Smellybreath.  Dey practiced hours on end learning different moves, different swings, even a few shamanistic spells.  Dey did nothing else but practice fighting wit each other.<br />
<br />
Well, until a few years later when dey discovered ogre girls... but let's skip past dat part right now.  Fast forward a few years and us is now on same page.<br />
<br />
"Moondoggy," said Papa Smurpheater while sitting in a meditative pose in da living room, "come on in here child."<br />
<br />
"Grandpa, my name is Bash," Bash said getting tired of reminding his grandfather of what his real name is.  "Me hate name Moondoggy!"<br />
<br />
"Right, right.  Far out, man!  Moondoggy, can you go grab your brother Shroombaby?"<br />
<br />
"Grandpa," said Smash, "Me name no is Shroombaby and me is already here!"<br />
<br />
"Right, right.  Outta Sight!  Feel the love.  The love!  Then cherish the colors.  The colors!"<br />
<br />
Bash and Smash looked at each other and rolled deir eyes.  Dey had been through dis routine before.  Once grandpa got going, he never came back until a few hours later.  Luckily, dis time, he snapped out of it.<br />
<br />
"Whoa!  Trippy.  Now look here, flower children, I have had a revelation this night."<br />
<br />
"Like when you had a revelation dat we should spend adolescence naked wit our names painted on our butts?" Bash asked not all too kindly.<br />
<br />
"Yeah, dat was embarrassing!" excalimed Smash.  "Us still get picked on today!  How about da time yous had a revelation dat lizardmen now like ogres and we should go try and make friends wit dem?"<br />
<br />
"Me still have lizard teeth stuck in me arm!" shouted Bash.<br />
<br />
"Settle down, lovemonkeys," Papa said calmly.  "This hip revelation came from the Sacred Peyote."<br />
<br />
Both brothers just stared in silence.  Papa's revelations were never wrong when he smoked the Sacred Peyote.  It was rumored he had pilfered it from a wizard's spire long ago in his adventuring days.  He rarely touched it, but when he did, his predictions always came true.  Well. most of da time.<br />
<br />
"Now, you should know that one of you isn't going to like this," Papa said with glazed eyes.  "I have had a vision of that goblin you crazy cats always are talking about.  I have had a vision of where he's hiding out, and what you boys are to do about it."<br />
<br />
Both ogres just stared with jaws agape.  Dis was good news.  Dey would do anyting to smash dat dumbhead goblin.  Dey waited intently for da old ogre to continue.<br />
<br />
"It appears," Papa began, "that unrighteous oppressor has been shacking up in a mountain range known as Trakanon's Teeth.  And, my vision has said that only one of you may go to slay him and the other must stay behind.  If it is any other way, then you will both be killed.  Whoever leaves, man, it must be tonight.  And, man, if you don't do the deed within three months, it'll be too late."<br />
<br />
"What do yous mean, 'too late'?" asked Bash.<br />
<br />
"I'm not sure, Moondoggy.  It just says, 'too late.'"<br />
<br />
"It actually say, <i>'too late,'</i>?" Smash interjected.<br />
<br />
"Well, no.  I saw the vision of a donkey skinnydipping in a vat of chocolate ice cream.  We ogre hippies concluded long ago that <i>that</i> particular image means 'too late.'"<br />
<br />
Da young ogres could no deny da wisdom of da ogre hippies of yore.  Dey thought about what deir grandpa had told dem.  Dey thought so hard it make deir heads hurt.  Finally, Smash stood up.<br />
<br />
"Me will go!  Me will go smash goblin!  Me is oldest, and derefore me should be one who goes!"<br />
<br />
Bash didn't like da idea of his brudder on his own and felt confident dat he himself could kill mean old Smellybreath.  But, he and his brother have become almost perfect equals in fighting over the past few years.  He no could argue with his older brudder, and he knew no udder ogre -- udder dan himself -- was suited for da job.<br />
<br />
"Smash," Bash said with tears in eyes, "Me know yous will avenge our parent's death.  Me sure you not gonna fail and den force me to go on adventure of me own.  Make sure yous give dat wizard an extra good bash for me."<br />
<br />
"Me will.  Me promise.  Me will come back and den us will finally be like regular ogres."<br />
<br />
"Shroombaby," Papa said placing his arms on Smash's shoulders, "Take care of yourself.  I have put together a journey pack for you.  It has all the things you will ever need.  Well, it has all the things <b>I</b> ever needed on adventures.  Hurry up and take it and get out of here!"<br />
<br />
With a nod, Smash picked up da ogre backpack off of da floor.  He gave his family each a good, big ogre hug and den opened up da door.  He stepped out into a starlit sky, and jogged off towards the city gates.<br />
<br />
"Me hope he be ok," sniffled Bash.<br />
<br />
"Shroombaby's got a good head on his shoulders.  Nothing's gonna happen to him.  He'll be back before the three months are up.  Man, I've got 'the munchies' something fierce!"<br />
<br />
A year passed by and dey never heard from Smash.</p>

	<p>Lilting was a young male halfling who grew up in Rivervale with his family.  Like almost all halflings, Lilting was a druid.  His mother was a druid, his father was a druid, and his uncle was a used armor salesman... but we won't speak of dat black sheep of the family.<br />
<br />
On a particularly hot afternoon, Lilting was on da outskirts of town trying various techniques of da druid ways.  Da blond haired halfling liked to try unconventional methods of his magic.  He thought dere was more to being a druid dan what most people tink.  Unfortunately, he just wasn't very good at spell casting at all.  And even more unfortunately, he was a bit clumsy and some would also say a little slow in da head.<br />
<br />
"See that bixie over there?" Lilting asked his halfling buddy who was out wit him dis day.<br />
<br />
"Of course I do," his friend Nappyhair replied wit a hint of irritation.  "It's five feet in front of us!"<br />
<br />
"Well watch this!  Watch how a tried and true method can be used more effectively when reversed!"<br />
<br />
"Whatever," Nappyhair responded not really, caring anymore.<br />
<br />
Lilting began waving his arms around and chanting.  Blue sparks emanating from his fingers, he spoke da magic words. "I call upon the spirits of wolf!  Come to me and enter this bixie!"<br />
<br />
Nappyhair, hardly listening but catching dat last line, snapped his head in Lilting's direction wit pure puzzlement.  <br />
<br />
"Are you sure that you want to do..."<br />
<br />
"Shhh!  Watch!  Trust me," the halfling said as he quickly began casting his second spell.  "Sticky feet come to me, Ensnare my foe and don't let him free!"<br />
<br />
Instead of pointing at da bixie, however, Lilting pointed to himself.  His feet seemed to magically acquire some powerful adhesive dat made it much harder for him to run.<br />
<br />
"Ummm..." is all Nappyhair could say.  He was in complete bewilderment.<br />
<br />
"I call this a 'Reverse Kite.'" Lilting said proudly.  "You see, I figure that if most druids have a hard time when they are sped up and monsters are slowed down, that if the opposite were applied then I should have an easier time with everything.  The theory is sound!"<br />
<br />
"Ummm..." is all Nappyhair could say as he looked at his friend in disbelief.  About dis time, da small bee-like fairy realized what was going on.  It turned and made a mad dash for Lilting.<br />
<br />
"Run!" yelped Nappyhair.  "You've made it mad!"<br />
<br />
"Like I said, don't worry!  My theory will work.  It's been...  OW!"<br />
<br />
Da bixie easily caught up with da slower halfling and stung him right in da arm.  Even da bixie couldn't believe how stupid dis particular halfling was.  Realizing dat maybe his idea might not be as brilliant as he had thought, Lilting opted to do what druids do best:  Run away like mad.<br />
<br />
"Let's get out of here!  Ow!  Ow!" Lilting said turning to his friend, but Nappyhair had long since bolted away.  Lilting started to make a run for his home, but it was slow-going because of his ensnare spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
<br />
Back in Rivervale, an out-of-breath Nappyhair explained to Lilting's parents what happened.<br />
<br />
"What are we to do with our son?" asked Mama Lildruid.  "He doesn't seem to want to learn our ways."<br />
<br />
"I guess we'll just have to punish him.  Again." Daddy Lildruid was disappointed his only son wouldn't learn da art of being a druid.  "How far behind you was he, Nappyhair?"<br />
<br />
"Well, uh," stammered Nappyhair, "I think he, uh, was right behind me."<br />
<br />
Suddenly a faint noise could be heard coming from just outside da city gates.  "Ow!"  It progressively became louder.  "Ow!"  Many halflings exited deir homes to see what dis noise was and crowded around the center of da town.<br />
<br />
Coming over da ridge, a very stung and very slow Lilting jogged towards his parents.  Just behind him was da mean bixie who kept stinging his backside.  "Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!"  Lilting kept yelping.<br />
<br />
Daddy Lildruid came to da rescue and swatted da bixie away.  "Get out of here!"  Da bixie just made a laughing, buzzing sound at Lilting and left da way it came.<br />
<br />
"Now, young man," Daddy Lildruid began, "What were you thinking?!"<br />
<br />
"I wanted to try..."<br />
<br />
"You wanted to get yourself killed!" Mama Lildruid scolded.  "Why do you have to try different things?  We're druids!  We cast, and then we run away!  We cast again, and then we run away again!  Anything else is suicide!"<br />
<br />
Da gathered crowd of halfling villagers all nodded deir agreement at what da boy's mother had said.  Dis was da art of kiting first invented by da halfling legend, Kiter McTerrified.<br />
<br />
"Son," his father told Lilting sternly while placing a hand on his shoulder, "I'm going to have to punish you until you learn.  No supper for you tonight."<br />
<br />
"Nooooo!!!  Dad, please, no!  Anything but that!  Anything!"<br />
<br />
"Hold on, I say, Hold on here!"  A voice from da crowd rose up.  A halfling pushed his way through da crowd.  He was older dan da rest of da halflings, fatter too.  "Now what is, I say, what is the problem here?"<br />
<br />
"Mayor McFurrybottom!"  Daddy Lildruid said in astonishment.  "There's no problem.  Well, nothing too big.  It's my son, your honor.  He rejects our standard druid ways and tried a new fighting tactic.  He trained a bixie into town."<br />
<br />
"Is that so?  Bixies, eh?  Nasty little, I say, nasty little buggers.  Can't have them running around town.  Certainly not."  Da crowd of halflings shook deir heads in agreement, wit several others repeating "Certainly not."<br />
<br />
"None of you understand," Lilting began, "I feel that druids are capable of much more than what we know!  I think that we can become one of the land's most respected people and not just a running gag!"<br />
<br />
"Nonsense, my boy," da Mayor said in disbelief,  "We druids have survived hundreds of years by holding dear to the truths and teachings of our beloved Kiter McTerrified!  We will continue to do for hundreds of years more.  Running away is what we do best!"<br />
<br />
"Well, maybe I'm tired of running away!" Lilting said wit tears of anger and frustration welling up inside him.  "Maybe I want to use a weapon now and then!"<br />
<br />
Mama Lildruid snapped a hand up to her mouth in utter horror at what her son had just said.  Da crowd of halflings gasped in shock and began whispering amongst demselves.<br />
<br />
"Maybe I want to actually use spells like thorn skin!" Lilting said defiantly.<br />
<br />
Mama Lildruid's second hand snapped up to her mouth.   Louder gasps and whispers came from da crowd.<br />
<br />
"And maybe I want to shave my foot hair from time to time!"<br />
<br />
Mama Lildruid's eyes rolled back into her head and she fainted.  Daddy Lildruid could stand to hear no more. <br />
<br />
"Blasphemy!" said Daddy.  "Son, I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that!  I'm going to pretend the bee stings on your backside are causing you to think irrationally!  Look what you did to your mother! Go to your room this instant!"<br />
<br />
"One more thing, dad." said Lilting.  "Maybe I want to actually join a group when I go out fighting."<br />
<br />
"That's it, boy," Mayor McFurrybottom said wit a finger pointed straight at Lilting, "You're a bad seed.  Thoughts like that will destroy this town!  You bring a nasty bixie here today, what will you bring tomorrow with these foolhardy ideas?  A bear?  A giant?!  I hearby decree that you shall be banned from this city for a period of no less than 3 months!  If being out on your own doesn't teach you that our ways are the correct ways, nothing will!"<br />
<br />
"Sir, I..."<br />
<br />
"Go!" da mayor pointed towards da gates of da city.  Da crowd all nodded in agreement with the mayor.  Each halfling had a scowl on their face and waited impatiently for Lilting to leave.<br />
<br />
"Son," Daddy Lildruid said wit restraint, "I think this is for the best.  Please do as the Mayor says.  And please remember our teachings.  They will keep you alive.  Don't be a fool and try to change them.  Now, please go.  Your mother and I will await your return."<br />
<br />
"Dad, I just..."<br />
<br />
"Please, son.  For your mother, for me, for yourself.  Just go."<br />
<br />
And without another word, Lilting turned around and slowly walked out of Rivervale.</p>

	<p>It was da middle of da night and all was silent in Oggok.  Well, all was silent except for all da loud snoring coming from every single ogre cave in dat town, and da loud scraping sound made whenever da guards needed to scratch demselves.  Udder dan dat dough, all was quiet.<br />
<br />
On his bed dat was made of a big slab of rock, Bash slept uneasily.  He always had nightmares of what he feared may have happened to Smash on his journey.  It had been a year since he saw him last and Bash worried he may no have killed Smellybreath.<br />
<br />
A very loud *THUD* woke Bash up with startle.  Bash looked over to see Papa Smurpheater on da floor cursing someting about it being too dark during night time.<br />
<br />
"Grandpa!" said Bash as he jumped out bed to help da old ogre up. "Is yous ok?  What you doing in me room dis late?"<br />
<br />
Grandpa rubbed da side of his face for a few seconds and den spoke.  "Well, Moondoggy, I wake up because I had the munch...er.. I was hungry.  So I stumble into the kitchen to grab a bite to eat.  Well, I accidentally grabbed the Sacred Peyote and didn't know it.  I took a huge bite and swallowed it down."<br />
<br />
Bash hoped his grandpa wasn't going to die.  He never seen him so sick and wobbly before.<br />
<br />
"The funny thing is," said Papa, "I found out that I've been using the Sacred Peyote wrong all these years.  You're not supposed to smoke it!  It was a groovy experience, man."<br />
<br />
"Well, what happened?!"<br />
<br />
"Hmmm... let me think... it's all a little fuzzy.  Well, naturechild, I think your brother's not coming back anytime soon.  And I think he may even be in danger.  The Details are a bit funny.  I do know this though:  You must go to Halas."<br />
<br />
"Halas?!" Bash said in complete shock.  "But dat is farthest away place of anywhere in dis world!  What is me supposed to do dere?!  Buy a kilt?!"<br />
<br />
"Settle down, hip cat."  Papa said wit his hands raised.  "You need to head to that land of uncool coldness to talk the one person who can tell you where to find your brother."<br />
<br />
"And who would dat be?"<br />
<br />
"I have no idea.  I just know he's hanging around Halas.  That's what my vision said."<br />
<br />
"And is dat all?"<br />
<br />
"No, it said that if you find people willing to help you along your journey, that you should let them.  Maybe even go out of your way to ask a few people.  If I had not smoked the Peyote last time, I bet the same would have applied to your brother.  Stupid me.  I should have realized that trying to solo in this world is the second dumbest thing there is."<br />
<br />
"What's da first dumbest ting?"<br />
<br />
"Answering a female ogre when she asks, 'Do yous tink me hips look fatter now dan before?' instead of running away.  There is no way to answer that question without getting several broken bones."<br />
<br />
"Hmmm.  Me remember dat.  Is dat all da visions yous had?"<br />
<br />
"Yep.  Well, after all that I did have a good conversation with a purple camel and a very foul-mouthed rock.  But it wasn't anything important.  Something about 'A Banshee and sock puppets.'"<br />
<br />
"Ok den.  Me will leave in da morning for Halas.  Me was having good dream about dat cute ogre girl in da Shaman guild."<br />
<br />
"No no!  You have to leave tonight!"<br />
<br />
"Why?"<br />
<br />
"Because that was part of my vision."<br />
<br />
"You said dat was all..."<br />
<br />
"Yeah yeah.  Shut up.  You have to leave tonight or else..."<br />
<br />
"...Da donkey and da ice cream?"<br />
<br />
"You got it."  Papa reached into his tunic and pulled out some coins. "Here, take these and buy some food for your journey.  And also..."<br />
<br />
Papa walked to the other end of the room and opened up a secret, false-rock panel.  He pulled out a gigantic, gold-plated mallet.<br />
<br />
"I want you to take this.  I should have given it to your brother, but I was too stoned to remember it.  This hammer has seen many adventuring days in our family and has squished many an orc head.  It is said that if the right ogre were to ever wield it...  Ah, I can't remember the rest."<br />
<br />
Bash's eyes were wide open, staring at da most beautiful hammer he ever seen.  He thought he was not worthy of such a ting.<br />
<br />
"Grandpa... me... me no can take dis."<br />
<br />
"Yes you can, and yes you will.  I can't smoke it, so what good does it do me anymore?  Besides, you may need it for some nasty, harrowing, climactic escape or battle.  Now, get out here.  There's little time to waste!"<br />
<br />
Bash gently took da mallet from Papa's hands with awe and reverence.  He den hugged his grandfather and left da house he and his brudder had been raised in for several years.  Bash stopped at da 24 hour ogre store near da Oggok entrance to buy some rations and den set off on his journey.<br />
<br />
Bash jogged down da road dat lead southeast in da Feerrott swamp.  Swatting at buzzing mosquitoes and stomping on da occasional snake for fun, he made good time.  An hour or so down da road he noticed dat da sun was starting to come up. <br />
<br />
Bash stopped as he saw a small lizard camp dat he knew well.  He saw da three lizardmen warming demselves around a fire dat he and Smash used to beat upon to help demselves train.  He smiled.<br />
<br />
Da lizardmen all looked up at da same time and saw Bash wit a wicked grin on his face.  Den dey saw da big, golden hammer da ogre was carrying.  Dey looked at each udder, and den dey immediately scattered in all directions to hide from da ogre dey remembered all-too-well.<br />
<br />
Bash frowned.  Da lizards no wanted to play.  He sighed and prepared to continue onward, but he heard a noise come from somewhere above him.<br />
<br />
"I'm a tree!  I'm a tree!  I'm a..." Da snapping and cracking of a branch was heard shortly after da voice was interrupted.<br />
<br />
Bash scratched his head in puzzlement and a few seconds later he saw a blond halfling fall from da sky and land wit a loud *THUMP* in front of him.</p>

	<p>Bash looked at da unconscious halfling dat lay in front of him on da forest road.  He said many 'tank yous' to his god, Da Warlord, for giving him such a fine meal dis day.  He bent over and picked up da halfling, opened his mouth and prepared to take a big bite.<br />
<br />
Da halfling awoke just as his little head was inside da big ogre's mouth.  A muffled scream came from inside Bash's throat.<br />
<br />
"Pleesh donf eaf mef!!!"<br />
<br />
Bash pulled da halfling out of his mouth.  "What did yous call me?!"<br />
<br />
"I said," the frightened halfling stammered, "'Please don't eat me!'"<br />
<br />
"Why?  Yous look like a good meal.  Me is hungry.  Me have long journey ahead of me and me need da protein."<br />
<br />
"But...  But I can help you!"  The halfling would do anything at this point to get out of being eaten.  "You need someone to carry that big hammer for you on your journey?  You need someone to help you fight whatever it is you need fighting?  You need anyone to slay some mean wizards or someth..."<br />
<br />
"Wizards?  What yous know about wizards?"  Bash was intrigued.  Maybe he stumbled upon a ting who knew where Smellybreath was.<br />
<br />
"Nothing other than they use magic.  I was just saying I could help..."<br />
<br />
Den again, maybe not.  But Bash remembered what his grandpa said about letting peoples join his group if he meet peoples who is willing.  He decided to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
"Ok den.  Yous can come along wit me and me will no eat yous.  Me name is Bash Emgood."<br />
<br />
"Great!" The halfling became excited and relieved at the same time.  Maybe Lilting will be able to do something to prove dat druids is more dan what everyone tinks on dis journey.  "My name is Lilting.  So where are we headed and what are we doing when we get there?"<br />
<br />
"Us is going to Halas.  And when we get dere, us is looking for a person me grandpa told me about who can tell us where me brudder is so us can find a goblin who bashed our parents and den bash it and come back and be done."<br />
<br />
Lilting just blinked in confusion.<br />
<br />
"Us is going to Halas."<br />
<br />
"Ok!  Well, let's get going!  I hope you don't have anything against druids because I am one."<br />
<br />
Bash's urge to eat da halfling resurfaced.  He did his best to stifle it.  <i>At least</i>, Bash thought, <i>he'll be able to haul his little butt away from any danger.  Me will no have to protect him too much.  Dat is good.</i><br />
<br />
"However," Lilting began, "I'm not like most druids.  I don't believe in using the same tactics every other druid employs."<br />
<br />
<i>So much for dat.</i><br />
<br />
"Well, let's get going!" the enthusiastic halfling excalimed excitedly.  "Can I carry that big hammer of yours?"<br />
<br />
"No."<br />
<br />
"Can I ride on your shoulders?"<br />
<br />
"No."<br />
<br />
"Can I sing some traveling songs?"<br />
<br />
"No."<br />
<br />
"Can I pick fights with everything that passes us by because you'll pound them?"<br />
<br />
"No."<br />
<br />
"Can I..."<br />
<br />
Da questions of da halfling trailed off as dey headed east towards da murky, foul, Innothule Swamp.</p>

	<p>Da big ogre and tiny halfling made it to da pass dat lead to da swamp in just half a day.  Once through, dey found da swamp was thicker, muckier, and more stinky dan normal.<br />
<br />
"Can I run circles around you for excercise?"<br />
<br />
"No."<br />
<br />
"Can I hop up and down instead of just normal hiking?"<br />
<br />
"No."<br />
<br />
"Can I..."  Da smell of da swamp hit da halfling's nose.<br />
<br />
"Ewww!  This place is gross!" a very disgusted Lilting said as he placed his hand up to cover his mouth and nose.  "How long do we have to endure this?"<br />
<br />
"You not know?" Bash asked curiously.  "Didn't yous come through swamp to get to da lovely Feerrott?"<br />
<br />
"Well, uh, no." da halfling said nervously.  You see, I, uh... well... I tried to teach myself to teleport but in an unconventional way.  To make a long story short..."<br />
<br />
"Save it.  Me tink me hear someting."<br />
<br />
Through the dense fog and trees covered wit vines, Bash thought he could see a lot of movement.  He figured da sounds he heard came from dere, so he decided to head towards it.<br />
<br />
"Nuh uh!" a defiant Lilting said.  "I'm not wading through that muck!  You can just go on without me!"<br />
<br />
Da next sound heard was da splash of water about as loud as a splash dat a halfling makes when thrown by an ogre into a murky bog.<br />
<br />
Bash and Lilting trudged through the thick slime for about an hour until Bash spotted da ting he saw from da pass.  A large group of green, stinky trolls were huddled together in a large circle cheering and hooting about someting.  Bash decided to get a closer look.<br />
<br />
"Are you crazy?!"  Lilting was not happy about going to meet a bunch of stinky trolls.  "They'll eat us alive!"<br />
<br />
"No dey won't."  Bash said. Lilting's face became washed wit relief.  "Dey will only eat yous.  Trolls no mess wit us big ogres."  <br />
<br />
Lilting's face contorted wit fear again.<br />
<br />
"But no worry.  Just don't talk and yous be fine.  Me have idea if trolls ask questions.  If anyone is gonna eat yous, it gonna be me!"  <br />
<br />
Lilting thought dat was good, but wasn't sure.<br />
<br />
Da ogre and halfling approached da trolls cautiously.  Da trolls were excited about someting in da center of deir circle.  Dey were throwing gold pieces all over the place in da center.  Bash and Smash no could see into da circle of trolls because da green, smelly tings were tightly packed together.  Bash pulled one troll aside to ask some questions.<br />
<br />
"Hey, dumbhead," said Bash with authority and intimidation, "What is going on in dere?"<br />
<br />
Da troll looked back and forth with a little bit of fear.  Not wanting to get involved wit an ogre, and also wanting to get back to whatever it was he was doing, he decided to just answer da ogres questions quickly.<br />
<br />
"Miz iz warchin dim barsh gud!  Us trows monies at chumin ilf gud barsher.  Miz maykz lotz uv monies!  Himz barsh de froggo bist miz evur see!"  Da troll, not wanting to waste more time talking to da ogre, turned around and begain cheering some more.<br />
<br />
Lilting raised one eyebrow in complete confusion.<br />
<br />
"What did he say?" whispered da halfling to da ogre.<br />
<br />
"He said dat dere is a human-elf in dere who can bash frogloks better dan anyting he ever seen before.  Me guess da trolls is betting money on who will win, and he made tons of money from betting on human-elf.  Me guess it never lost yet."<br />
<br />
"I want to see!" da halfling said excitedly.<br />
<br />
"Yous is too short to see over da trolls."<br />
<br />
"Not if you pick me up!"<br />
<br />
"Hmmm.  Dat true.  Maybe dat good idea and yous tell me what yous see."  And wit dat, da ogre picked up da halfling and held him high over da heads of da trolls.<br />
<br />
What Lilting saw was two beings locked in a fight. Both a froglok and a light brown-haired half-elf were circling around each other, waiting for da udder to strike.  Da froglok wore chainmail and was holding an axe. Da half-elf wore leather armor with udder bits and pieces of green cloth all over  da place (but nothing on his head) and wielded a longsword in one hand and a forward-curved short sword in da udder. <br />
<br />
Da froglok attacked first.  It swung its axe in a chopping motion towards da half-elf.  Da half-elf easily dodged and parried da blow down to da ground.  Da froglok lifted its axe and swung at da half-elf. It was easily parried wit one sword as anudder stabbed da froglok in da arm.  Da froglok went into a frenzy and swung wildly at da half-elf.  His axe was blocked again and forced downward to touch da ground again.  Da half-elf brought up his short sword in a blinding rush and caused da froglok to try and dodge.  As soon as da froglok did, dough, da half-elf switched directions wit his short sword and den spun around in a quick flash and stabbed da froglok wit his longsword straight through its head.  Da froglock fell over in a lump and da trolls cheered and roared.<br />
<br />
Lilting watched da whole ting in amazement.  Da fight was over in a blink of an eye and never before did he ever see such skill and speed in a swordsman.  <br />
<br />
Da trolls in one part of the circle spread apart to let anudder troll walk in.  Dis troll was carrying a bigger, meaner looking froglok.  He set it down and joined da udder trolls.  Da trolls formed a tight circle again.<br />
<br />
Da froglock, not wanting to be away from its home any longer dan needed, began attacking da half-elf right away.  But instead of using a weapon, it started to cast fireball spells at da half-elf.  Da half-elf was quick dough, and dodged back and forth avoiding da fireballs.  Leaping and rolling, he moved closer towards da froglok.<br />
<br />
Da froglok summoned more power dis time and its hand glowed brighter dan before.  It shot out a massive fireball towards da half-elf.  Da half-elf leaped high and did a flip towards da froglock.  At da end of his spin, and before he touched da ground, he stabbed da froglock wit his longsword and den sliced downwards wit his shortsword, splitting da frog's head in two vertical pieces.<br />
<br />
Landing and den pulling his swords out sharply, da half-elf watched as da froglok just slumped to da ground next to a dozen or so udder froglok corpses.  Da trolls roared and cheered even louder dan before.<br />
<br />
"What is going on in dere?!" Bash asked quickly.  "What do yous see?!"<br />
<br />
"I see....  Wow!  This guy is amazing!"  Lilting was too awestruck and breathtaken to find words.  "He killed them all."<br />
<br />
"Who did?  A troll?"<br />
<br />
"Wow.  That wizard had no chance at all!"<br />
<br />
"Wizard?!"  Bash became excited at da thought of someting being able to kill a wizard.  Bash needed whatever's help was in dat circle of trolls.  He got an idea.<br />
<br />
At da top of his lungs, Bash shouted.  "Me saw Jocka da female troll outside of Grobb entrance skinny dipping in da swamp!  She said someting about free food to da first 3 'cute' trolls to come see her!"<br />
<br />
Da entire group of trolls immmediately shut up and turned towards da ogre.  Den, each at da exact same time, turned deir heads in da same direction looking off into da swamp somwhere.  A split second later, da trolls were running off into da swamp at extreme speed.  Well, fast for trolls anyway.<br />
<br />
Looking downward and brushing himself off, da half-elf started to talk.  "Thanks for that, I didn't think they were going to let me go anytime soon."  Da half-elf looked up and saw da ogre holding a halfling in one hand.  Swords instantly came up.<br />
<br />
"Leave me alone, big one!  I'm sure you'll kill me, but I'll go down with a fight!"<br />
<br />
"Me don't want to kill yous.  Me want yous help.  Us is looking to kill a goblin wizard and we need someone like yous."<br />
<br />
A little confused, da half-elf furrowed his brow and just stared at da ogre.<br />
<br />
"It's true!" Lilting piped up.  "He hasn't eaten me and it's been almost a full day since we met!  I'm pretty sure he's telling the truth!  You were amazing in there!"<br />
<br />
"Well, I was <b>this</b> close to being killed.  Had I been in there one more minute, I'd be dead right now!"<br />
<br />
"What are you talking about?  You were wiping the floor with them!"  da halfling said not believing dis half-elf.<br />
<br />
"I was brushing near death each time!"<br />
<br />
"You didn't even get a scratch!"<br />
<br />
"I was lucky.  Had you not come along..."<br />
<br />
"Why didn't you just kill the trolls and be done with it?"<br />
<br />
"Because, I knew I was going to get killed any time now.  It's a miracle I've lived this long.  I figured I might as well go out a hero."<br />
<br />
Bash had enough of da question and answer session.  "Look, will yous help us or not?  Us is in kind of a hurry."<br />
<br />
Da half-elf considered it for a minute.  "Well, I'm <b>positive</b> I'll be slain within a day and won't be much good to you.  But, I've got nothing better to do while waiting for my inevitable death.  Sure, why not?"<br />
<br />
"Ok den.  Us need a good elf fighter."<br />
<br />
"I am <b>not</b> an elf or a fighter!  I'm a half-elf ranger!  Fighters can at least survive their fights!"<br />
<br />
"But you just surviv..." Lilting began but was interrupted by Bash.<br />
<br />
"Ok den.  Me is Bash Emgood and dis is Lilting.  Us is going to Halas and we need to get going now."<br />
<br />
"All right.  My name is Treehugger."<br />
<br />
And wit dat, da three of dem trudged northward in da swamp.</p>

	<p>Onward through da icky swamp da three heroes charged.  For hours and hours, dey marched never stopping.  Well, ok, dey did stop once at a McNuglug's for a Big Nug and some fries, but dat's it.<br />
<br />
Through slime and stagnant water, dey trode.  Avoiding such dangers as mad frogloks, mean alligators, and female trolls in heat, our party finally made it to da trail dat lead out of da swamp.<br />
<br />
"Is this it?" an exhausted, slime-covered Lilting asked.<br />
<br />
"Me tink so," said Bash.  "Me pretty sure dis is da way to Halas."<br />
<br />
"This, my friends, is the way to Southern part of the Desert of Ro."  said Treehugger.  "Not exactly the fastest way to Halas, but probably the least dangerous.  I came through here from the town of Freeport.  We'll need to go there and head west.  From there, we'll need directions because that part of the land is new to me."<br />
<br />
"Ok den.  Dat sound good."<br />
<br />
Wit dat, da party walked da trail to Southern Ro.  Expecting desert, Bash and Lilting were surprised to see a lush, green landscape full of trees and grass as far as dey could see.<br />
<br />
"Why you lying son of a...!" da halfling started to say but was cut short.<br />
<br />
"Lilting!  Be nice.  Treehugger, dis not look like a desert."<br />
<br />
"I'm aware of that.  The desert is a few miles north of here.  There seems to be some magical barrier that prevents the desert from touching the swamp but I'm not sure if..." <br />
<br />
Da ranger was cut short when an orc approached dem.<br />
<br />
"Hul-lo," the orc said in a deep, raspy voice.  "Me are Smeg.  Smeg wants sell you copper coin for two silver!  Smeg say it good deal!"<br />
<br />
Bash fought da urge to pound the hated orc into vanilla pudding.  He never liked orcs and never trusted dem.  Lilting spoke for dem all.<br />
<br />
"Well, that sounds like an 'ok' deal Smeg, but I think we're not interested."<br />
<br />
Just den, Bash felt his hammer become warm.  It became warmer and warmer and he didn't know why.<br />
<br />
"Right," said Treehugger, "We've no time for orc deals."<br />
<br />
Just den, Smeg smiled and four orcs appeared out of da trees and surrounded da little party.  Bash's hammer flared up.  It turned bright white and was berry hot to da touch.  For some reason, Bash not minded it and no dropped it.<br />
<br />
"Smeg think that since you no like deal, he say you die!" the orc said.  Da four orcs all wit weapons drawn, closed in on da group of good guys.<br />
<br />
Treehuggers swords instantly appeared.  Lilting pulled out a tiny, tiny, miniscule dagger.<br />
<br />
Da orcs rushed in.  Treehugger took da orc nearest to him.  Lilting squealed like a little girl as one orc rushed him.  Bash felt da heat from da hammer and almost seemed to speak to him.  It wanted orc blood.<br />
<br />
Treehugger had little trouble fighting his orc.  Da orc was clumsy and stupid.  Treehugger was not.  Slapping da silly orc's club dis way and dat and kicking it square in da chest, da orc just got madder as it fell backwards to da ground.  It sprung back up with a mean sneer on its face.  Treehugger grinned.<br />
<br />
Lilting, on da udder hand, was scared out of his little britches.  He saw big, nasty, green orc charging at him with a shortsword.  His first instinct was to run.  But some, sane, rational, quiet part of his mind told him not to.  He instead, on instinct alone, started to use da same trick he tried on da bixie.  He started to cast da Spirit of da Wolf on da orc.<br />
<br />
Bash was oblivious to everyting but one orc charging in on him.  Da orc let out a little snarl.  Bash let out a roar.  A deafening roar.  A roar dat would have made a giant lion proud.  A warrior's roar.  Dis made da orc slow down a little bit in confusion.  It was all da time Bash needed to bring up his hammer and send it swinging down towards da orc's head at a blinding speed.<br />
<br />
Treehugger seemed to be having a little bit too much fun taunting and mocking his orc opponent.  Da orc would swing his club at da ranger only to find dat da ranger would swing his swords underneath the club and force it back at da orc.  Da club would den smack da orc's face.  <br />
<br />
Da half-elf realized da trouble Lilting might be in and decided to end his own fun.  He turned his back to da orc and with a quick backwards thrust slammed his longsword into da orc's gut.  And without even turning around, Treehugger quickly bent backwards and  thrust his shortsword in an upward motion dat arced right into da orc's head.  Treehugger quickly bent forward again to stand upright and da orc just fell limply to da ground.<br />
<br />
Lilting quickly began da words to his spell.  "Spirit of Wolf I beg of you; enter this orc, oh please do!"  And wit dat, da orc started to run at twice da speed it did before.  Da halfling pointed his dagger straight at da orc and shut his eyes in a wincing manner.<br />
<br />
Da orc, fully surprised dat it was moving much more quickly now, realized much too late what to do about it.  Before it had a chance for its brain to tell its feet to stop moving, da orc looked down and saw dat it's chest was bloody.<br />
<br />
Lilting opened his eyes to see a very shocked orc impaled on his tiny, tiny, oh-so tiny dagger.  Da orc looked at its chest wound, looked up at Lilting, and looked down again.  It den finally fell backwards, dead as a doornail.<br />
<br />
Bash's hammer came straight towards da orc.  Da orc, realizing it's doom, swung its sword at da ogre in desperation in da hopes it would hit someting.  A split second latter, where an orc once was, dere was just a messy mess of orc splat.<br />
<br />
"Did you see that?!" and excited Lilting exclaimed loudly as he ran up to Bash.  "It worked!  My theory worked!  Woo hoo!"<br />
<br />
Just den, da fourth orc charged at Lilting (me said four orcs surrounded dem, remember?).  Not even noticing, Lilting just danced around.  Without even tinking, Bash dropped his hammer, picked up Lilting, straightened da halfling's little arm dat was holding da dagger, and threw da little guy at da orc like a spear.<br />
<br />
Screaming through the air (not just a figure of speech, Lilting literally was screaming), Lilting headed right for da orc.  Da orc stopped and just watched dis blurry little guy come right at him.  Da orc exploded as da halfling went right through it like a warm knife in butter.<br />
<br />
Bash picked up his hammer and stomped over to an onlooking Smeg.  Treehugger jogged up right next to him.  Both had weapons drawn ready to finish off da devious orc.<br />
<br />
"Smeg sees you are not stupid customers." da orc said nervously.  "Smeg make deal.  Smeg sell copper piece for one silver instead of two."<br />
<br />
Bash looked at Treehugger, and da ranger silently nodded at da ogre.<br />
<br />
"Ok den," said Bash.  "Dat is a good deal.  Here is yous money."  And wit dat, dey purchased da copper coin and Smeg walked away.<br />
<br />
"Wow.  I can't believe I survived that!  I thought I was surely done for.  That orc came real close to killing me!" da ranger said with no amount of sarcasm.  "If you guys hadn't been there I....  say, Bash, you're wounded!"<br />
<br />
Bash looked down.  His thigh was sliced open by da first orc he smashed.  He didn't even realize it before, but now dat he did, it burned like fire.  Da blood was coming out pretty rapidly.<br />
<br />
"What we need is a cleric," Treehugger said.  "A cleric could heal that, no problem.  Plus, a cleric <b>might</b> be able to keep me alive longer than 24 hours.  Maybe I'd be able to live 48.  I doubt it though."<br />
<br />
"Ok den," Bash said as he grinned against da pain.  "Where can us find one of dem?"<br />
<br />
"Oasis, I bet.  They're always hanging around there to heal up the idiots who think they can take on crocodiles."<br />
<br />
"Ok den.  Let's go dere."<br />
<br />
Just then, Lilting slowly wobbled up with arms outstretched and a look of shock on his face.  Da halfling looked down and noticed he was completely covered in orc goo.<br />
<br />
"EWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!" da halfling screamed.</p>

	<p>Treehugger dressed Bash's wound as best he could, but he was no doctor.  Treehugger was sure da bandages would no last.  <br />
<br />
After a quick bath (more like "ogre dunk") in a nearby pond, Lilting was, for da most part,  cleaned up and ready to go.  Northward bound, our party trekked.<br />
<br />
Through da desert dey went.  Hot sands blowing into deir face, sand blowing down up deir shirts, sand blowing down deir paints, it was not da best ting each of dem remembered.  Da worst of it, dough, was Lilting constantly complaining about his chapped lips and how he needed some chapstick or he'd "just die."<br />
<br />
Half a day's journey through da desert, Bash started to feel da effects of his loss of blood.  His bandages had long since been bled through and dere was nothing any of dem could do but hope dey made it to da Oasis in time.  Pushing back da pain and fatigue, Bash moved onward.<br />
<br />
A couple hours later, Bash collapsed.  Lilting and Treehugger spent some time rigging up a stretcher dat dey could drag da ogre on.<br />
<br />
After several hours, dey gave up.  Dere is no way in da Plane of Hate dat a halfling and a half-elf can move an ogre.  No possible way.   So, dey just dumped some water on Bash's face and smacked him around a bit.  After twenty minutes of dis, Bash wake up enough to continue on.<br />
<br />
Barely able to lift his hammer anymore and just dragging it in da sand, Bash saw finally saw a ray of hope.  In da not-too-distance, he saw what appeared to be a small oasis.  He concluded dat dis place must be da Oasis.  Dough, it confused him because just a few hundred feet from da Oasis was da ocean, but he soon forgot about dat and concentrated on more important tings like how much a good halfling, lettuce, and tomato sandwich cost.  And how does paper actually beat rock?  And, oh yeah, how he can get dis nasty cut in his leg cured.<br />
<br />
"This is it! Treehugger said.  "We're bound to find a cleric here."<br />
<br />
"I hope so." whined Lilting.  "I'm sure to die if I don't get my lips healed!"<br />
<br />
Treehugger just gave da halfling a scornful look.<br />
<br />
"Oh yeah.  Right." Lilting remembered da ogre's big gash.<br />
<br />
"Me.... be... ok." Bash said in ragged breaths.  "It.....just....papercut."<br />
<br />
Without hesitating or arguing da point, Treehugger lead da way down near da shore to a small, abandoned dock.  Well, it was abandoned by da original owner, but it was currently occupied.  A berry long line of peoples of all shapes and sizes was formed for someting.  As da party approached, dey saw what it was for.<br />
<br />
A high-elf female stood at da beginning of da line, facing all da peoples who was obviously waiting for her.  She was dressed in a blue and white robe and had light brown hair.  She was tall, tall even for a high-elf.  Treehugger made haste to get to her.<br />
<br />
"And what's your problem?" da high-elf asked a human who's arms and legs apparently had been chewn off.  "And I suppose you want that healed, huh?  You sure?  You could get quite the many ladies with a nickname like 'Stumpy' and a tale of woe about the loss of your limbs."<br />
<br />
Da man started to frown.<br />
<br />
"Oh all right!" da high-elf said exasperated.  "Blah biddy blah, you're healed.  Now get out of here.  And if I see you again today, you're going to be 'Stumpy' for good!"<br />
<br />
Next in line was a male wood-elf who was not bleeding and had all of his limbs.<br />
<br />
"And what's your problem, little man?" said da high-elf, obviously not caring.  Da wood-elf turned around to show what was wrong.  Clamped onto his rear was a baby alligator who did not want to let go it seemed.<br />
<br />
With a quick yank and a loud scream from da wood-elf, da high-elf removed da alligator and threw it into da ocean.  "Blah blah blah, you're healed."  Da high-elf became real saracastic and condescending and said, "Now don't pick on those mean ol' babies anymore!" and den cackled.<br />
<br />
Treehugger appeared, out of breath from running.  "Ogre.... cut..... lips.... leg.... orc...."<br />
<br />
"Look, honey, I don't care what kind of panting pervert you are, but you're going to have to get in line like the rest of these poor saps!"<br />
<br />
Catching his breath, Treehugger stood up straight and finally realized just exactly how beautiful dis high-elf female was.  "Whoa!  Hey baby!  What's your sign?"<br />
<br />
"Red and octagonal.  Now get in line!"<br />
<br />
Remembering just why he was here, Treehugger focused his mind back on da situation at hand.  "Forgive me, but I am dire need of help.  An ogre friend of mine is in need of your aid or he will die."<br />
<br />
"And I should care because...?  Look, all of these people in line are 'on the brink of death' and many of them have been waiting here for hours!"<br />
<br />
"It sounds like you're not enjoying this."<br />
<br />
"Oh, I love to sit in the hot sun healing idiots who think they're all big and bad by fighting crocodiles only to learn they get the tar pounded out of them." said da high-elf sarcastically.<br />
<br />
"Well, look, what if I said we could get out of here.  What if I said I can take you to a place that is nothing like this hot desert?  We are in need of a cleric."<br />
<br />
"You're in need of a brain.  But still, it would be nice to get out of here.  What's the catch?"<br />
<br />
"My ogre friend..."<br />
<br />
"Right, right.  You're mortally wounded ogre friend."<br />
<br />
"Yes.  Can you please go over there and heal him?"<br />
<br />
"All right, all right!  I'll go.  You lead the way though.  I don't want you staring at my elven behind, pig!"<br />
<br />
"Sure thing.  My name is Treehugger."  <br />
<br />
"Am I supposed to care or something?"<br />
<br />
"What about all these people you need to heal?"<br />
<br />
"I'm sure they'll manage.  They've survived this far in life despite the fact they're idiots.  They'll continue to survive somehow.  Morons never seem to die."<br />
<br />
All da people in line began to start frowning and crying.<br />
<br />
And wit dat, Treehugger lead da way towards da place where Bash had passed out yet again.  <i>"I think she likes me,"</i> he thought and smiled.  <i>"I'm such a smoothie!  Too bad I'm going to die any day now."</i><br />
<br />
Da two approached da prone ogre and a crouched halfling searching da ogre for any sort of chapstick.  He turned around and shot straight up as he saw da high-elf.<br />
<br />
"Whoa, big momma!" said da shocked halfling.<br />
<br />
"Whoa, big intelligence!" said da high-elf mockingly.  "Now, stand back, both of you."<br />
<br />
Da high-elf removed da blood-soaked bandages, placed her hands over da wound and said, "Blah blah, yakkity yak.  You're healed."<br />
<br />
She moved her hands away and da wound was gone.  Bash's eyes snapped open and he sat up.  "Me had bad dream.  Me dreamt me was getting felt-up by Lilting!"<br />
<br />
"My lady," Treehugger began, "Meet Bash Emgood.  The little one is Lilting Lildruid."<br />
<br />
"Yeah yeah.  Let's get acquaintences over with already.  I'm Medsa.  Medsa Lotte."<br />
<br />
<i>"What a pretty name for a pretty lady,"</i> Treehugger thought.</p>

	<p>Da party moved northward through the desert.  Reaching da northern side of da oasis in Oasis dey stopped at a merchant's tent for some supplies.<br />
<br />
"So just where exactly are we going?" asked Medsa in her usual over-authoritative brash way.<br />
<br />
"Halas!" said an excited Lilting after having just purchased some lip balm.  "It's gonna be fun!"<br />
<br />
"<b>HALAS?!?!!</b>" said a not-so-calm cleric.  Turning to Treehugger, she asked, again in a not-so-calm fashion,"What in the 3 planes and 3 unreleased planes of existence made you think that I'd enjoy that frost-ridden, savage-infested, slippery, slushy, iced hell-hole of a waste of space on this planet?!?!"<br />
<br />
A little more than afraid, Treehugger bowed his head in silence.  Den, he remembered someting and said, "Well, I did say that we were going to a place that is nothing at all like this desert."<br />
<br />
Medsa just sneered at da ranger but didn't say anyting.  Treehugger just winked back.<br />
<br />
"Listen, tiny lady," Bash joined in, "Us is on an important quest.  Us needs to stop a powerful goblin wizard."<br />
<br />
"From doing what?"<br />
<br />
"Ummm... us just needs to stop him, ok?!  If yous want to go back to heal da losers den just go.  Yous not need to waste our time and insult me friends."<br />
<br />
Medsa considered da ogre's words.  But, den she looked back half a mile and still saw da line of peoples waiting to be healed.  Da peoples were still looking around not knowing what to do, while some where just looking in her direction.  She thought she could still see some crying.  Da cleric decided dat life was not for her and maybe she needed to go on dis adventure after all.  Maybe it would be nice to have some friends for a change.<br />
<br />
"Fine!  I'll go on your lame little voyage. But I'm just doing it because I feel sorry for you pathetic people!  Always remember that!"<br />
<br />
"Ok den.  Let's get moving."<br />
<br />
Just den, dey all heard a loud, deep scream of terror.  Dey turned around to see a big, mean Sand Giant running from a tiny skeleton.<br />
<br />
"Help!  Help!  It's gonna kill me!" da Sand Giant yelled as it came near da group.  It stopped in front of Bash and pleaded.  "It's gonna kill me!  He's gonna kill me!  Please help!"<br />
<br />
Da skeleton caught up to da giant and laughed.  It poked da giant in da ankle.<br />
<br />
"Ow!  Ow!" da Giant cried.  And den, a split second later, it fell over dead.<br />
<br />
Da skeleton laughed again and did a Pee-Wee Herman dance with a bit of disco thrown in for good measure.  Over da hill, a tiny gnome came running up to da dead giant.  Da gnome had white hair, a big nose, and a brown robe.<br />
<br />
"Good work, Jakontiklarkiak!  Here's a skellie snack!" da gnome said as he pulled out a green and blue box dat had da words 'Skellie Snacks' on da front.  He took out a brown cookie-like object and tossed it to da skeleton.  <br />
<br />
Da skeleton jumped up in da air and caught it in it's mouth and swallowed it.  When da skeleton landed, da cookie crumbs just went through its ribcage and landed on da sandy floor.  Da skeleton no seemed to mind or even notice.<br />
<br />
Treehugger looked at da gnome and skeleton and rolled his eyes.  "Oh great," he said, "A necromancer."<br />
<br />
Da whole group rolled deir eyes and moaned at da news.<br />
<br />
Da gnome bent over da giant's corpse and took some loose change from its pocket.  A split second later, da giant disappeared in a puff of smoke.<br />
<br />
Da gnome stood up and noticed da group. <br />
<br />
"Hi guys!" da gnome said.  Seeing da supplies in hand dat da party just purchased, da gnome became curious. "What are you fellows up to?"<br />
<br />
"Nuttin'." Bash said quickly.  "Yous can go back to giant killing now."<br />
<br />
Realizing what was going on, da gnome excitedly said, "You're going on an adventure!  Oh boy!  That sounds like it's going to be fun!  Oh boy oh boy!"<br />
<br />
Da gnome started jumping up and down wit excited glee.  Da skeleton looked at da gnome, shrugged, and started jumping up and down too.<br />
<br />
With fingers in his ears, Lilting shouted, "Can you please stop doing that?!  That rattling from the skeleton is making my ears hurt!"<br />
<br />
Da gnome stopped jumping and den da skeleton did too.<br />
<br />
"My name is Philiac, but you can just call me Phil."  Pointing to da skeleton, da gnome said, "And this here is Jakontiklarkiak."<br />
<br />
Hearing his name and seeing his master point at him, da skeleton wasn't really listening to what had been said so it just started to do 'da moonwalk' and ended wit a spin.<br />
<br />
Da group half-heartedly clapped.  Jakontiklarkiak bowed for da applause.<br />
<br />
"Listen, we both were wondering if you would like to have a necromancer and a skeleton along for the ride." da gnome said.<br />
<br />
Da group looked at da gnome, and den each member of da party turned deir heads to da skeleton.  Da skeleton just pointed at da gnome, shook its head and shrugged at da party.<br />
<br />
"Ummm... look, us appreciate da offer but..." Bash began.<br />
<br />
"I'm really powerful!  Look how I took down that giant!  I can kill anything!"<br />
<br />
"We're sure you can but..." Treehugger said.<br />
<br />
"I've got more money than everyone in Norrath combined!"<br />
<br />
"That's nice but..." Lilting started.<br />
<br />
"I've got three banks-worth full of ultra-uniquely rare items!"<br />
<br />
"Dat's great, but, why would yous want to join us if yous have all dat?  Us is not in dis for da money or da items.  Well, me is not." Bash said.<br />
<br />
"Because," Phil said, "Well.... You see.... Well...."<br />
<br />
"Yes?" da party said.<br />
<br />
"Well, I'm.... I'm lonely.  All I do is sit here waiting for the next giant to arrive so I can kill it dead.  Then I wait some more.  And then I kill some more.  And then I wait some more." da gnome started to sniff some tears back.<br />
<br />
"Nobody wants to be my friend.  Nobody wants to date me.  All this power, and no one to share or frighten it with."<br />
<br />
Da skeleton nodded at da party and den made a 'L' shape wit his hand and stuck it up to its forehead looking at da gnome.  Phil wasn't paying attention.<br />
<br />
"Me is sorry," said Bash, "But yous is just a necromancer.  Us is not wanting... er... needing a necromancer right now."<br />
<br />
"PLEEEEEASE?!" da gnome said desperately throwing himself at da ogre's big feet.  Stench overpowering, da gnome backed up a little bit.  "Oh please oh please oh please let me join!  You have no idea how boring it is having my life!  Please please please let me join!"<br />
<br />
Phil began to sob uncontrollably and his whole face seemed to leak.  Da gnome used part of his robe to blow his nose on.<br />
<br />
One eyebrow raised, Bash looked at da skeleton for an answer.  Da skeleton just shrugged.<br />
<br />
Treehugger had an idea.  "Say, what if we said that we'd let you in the group when Hate freezes over?"<br />
<br />
Sniffling, da gnome said "You... *sniff* guys would *sniff*  do that for me?"<br />
<br />
"Sure we would!" da ranger said looking to da party for some false support.<br />
<br />
Da whole group nodded with eyebrows raised and big smiles all around.<br />
<br />
"*Sniff*... you guys *sniff* are the greatest!  *Sniff*  Come on Jakontiklarkiak, let' go bag us some more worthless platinum pieces!"<br />
<br />
And wit dat, da gnome smiled and waved to da party and was trotting off in da desert.  Da skeleton, mockingly rubbed his eyes like it was crying and pointed at da running gnome and den laughed.  It looked at da party, shurgged again, waved goodbye, and den ran off after da gnome.<br />
<br />
"Necromancers," said Medsa, "Not the brightest bunch."<br />
<br />
"Us almost had one in our group!" da big ogre said.<br />
<br />
Everyone shuddered.<br />
<br />
Da party snickered some at da gnome now too small to see from dis distance, and den headed northward towards da town of Freeport.</p>

	<p>In a thick cloud of red fog, a demon sat on a throne made of bones from different races.  Da red fog surrounded everyting as far as da eye could see.  Moans and wails of pain and suffering could be heard from unseen captives in dis dense, nasty haze.  Dis was da Plane of Pain.<br />
<br />
Adjusting his huge black wings jutting from his red, scaly body, da demon made himself more comfortable in his chair.  Pure white eyes stared off in da distance in pleasure as he listened to da harmonious sounds of da tortured souls in his "care."  Blood stained fangs jutted out from both upper and lower jaws and curved into a smile.  Dis was his home.  Dis was his paradise.<br />
<br />
Some people said dat da souls were screaming in pain because of da eternal fire dat is scorching deir bodies.  Some say it is because of da mourning of a life dat dey screwed up.  But most say it's because of da demon's favorite music dat is piped in throughout da Plane -- music made by an elf named Yanni.<br />
<br />
Da Plane of Pain is where dumbheads go when dey die.  If yous did sometime particularly stupid, den you ended up here.  All da people who claimed to have seen da Lake Rathe Monster were here.  All da people who ever typed da words "sow" or "plz" were here.  And all da peoples who shout conversations across vast areas were here.  Dey didn't like it much.<br />
<br />
Nodding his head in-time to a particularly torturous melody, da demon noticed green smoke starting to form at da foot of his throne.  Realizing he was about to have company and not wanting dem to know his secret admiration of dat elf's music, da demon pressed a button on his throne dat made Yanni's music disappear and some heavy sounds pipe through from an ogre group named Savatage.  Interestingly enough, da captured souls sounded a bit more happy.<br />
<br />
Da smoke cleared and da image of a robed figure was standing before da demon.  Da demon couldn't see da figure's face, but he knew who it was.  Da demon had dealt wit dis person in da past.<br />
<br />
"Ahhh, good old, Killdead." da robed figure said.  "I see you're back to your usual self and enjoying the fruits of your office."<br />
<br />
"No easy thanks to you." da demon grumbled in a low, gutteral, hissing voice.  "Speak what you need and then get out of here!"<br />
<br />
Da shade laughed a ****y laugh.  "I'll stay for as long as I choose!  You have very little power over me."<br />
<br />
Da demons eyes turned into mere slits with hatred towards da shadow.  He knew it to be true.<br />
<br />
"Now, I came here to ask of your assistance." da figure said.<br />
<br />
"You've already forced me to grant your one wish, fool!  Remember?!" Killdead da demon was quaking with rage.  "You asked for power beyond that of my own and inso doing got your wish but reduced me to weaker state whilst you gained abilities your kind could only dream!"<br />
<br />
"That is quite true.  I'm not sure why you just reminded me of that bit of history because I obviously know it.  But who knows what demon logic is like, eh?<br />
<br />
"No I have come here to ask of one and only one favor.  In return, I shall grant you some of your former power back and also never bug you again."<br />
<br />
"Never?"<br />
<br />
"Never."<br />
<br />
"Not even on my birthday?"<br />
<br />
"Nope."<br />
<br />
"Not even when you want to show off your newest Pokemon trading cards?"<br />
<br />
"Not even then."<br />
<br />
"You have got yourself a deal!  I will do anything to be rid of you.  What is that you would have me do?"<br />
<br />
"There is a group of adventurers heading towards the barbarian home lands.  I do not know exactly where they are or just who these people are themselves, but I do know they must be destroyed.  Demons are the best at that sort of thing, so naturally I thought of you.  Kill them all, and you will be free to do as you wish without me in your life to bug you again."<br />
<br />
"Sweeeet!" Killdead excalimed.  "I'll have to do some tracking once I get down to the mortal Plane since you've robbed me of my demonic finding power, but it shouldn't be that difficult.  Now, once they're gone, you promise I'll never see you again?"<br />
<br />
"I promise."<br />
<br />
"Do the eternal damnation soul oath." da demon said wit a smile.  Dat oath no character could break.  Good or evil.<br />
<br />
Da shade sighed and den placed his right hand on his head.  And den his left hand.  And den placed his right hand on his hip, followed by his left.  And den he stuck his right hand straight out, and den his left.  Den he put both hands on his hips and moved his rear around in a circular motion while ending wit da sacred chant,  "Haaay Mock-a Ray-Na!"<br />
<br />
Satisfied, Killdead smiled his approval.  "I will set off for those pathetic souls tonight.  Now, if you don't mind..."<br />
<br />
"Gotcha.  I'm gone.  Do as I ask, or you'll be seeing a lot more of me.  A lot more.  And I just got my Ultra-Platinum Limited Edition Pikachu Trading Card Series that I'm dying show somebody."<br />
<br />
Da demon shuddered wit revulsion and made a silent vow dat it would complete dis quest or die trying.  Shortly after, da shadow disappeared in a puff of green smoke.<br />
<br />
Switching his music back to Yanni and hearing da screams of anger, hatred, and ultimate pain begin again, da demon settled back comfortably into his chair.  He wanted to relish every last bit of scream and music before he took flight to da mortal plane.<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes and lips turning into a contented smile, da demon just contemplated etnernity one last time.  One last thought occured to him before he finally left his throne.<br />
<br />
<i>"You know, even that guy's shade has really, really bad breath."</i></p>

	<p>"Ha ha!" da knight shouted.  "Your evil taint will foul this magnificent city no more, dragon!  Taste holy steel!"<br />
<br />
Da townspeople of Freeport knew dat cry well.  It was da ravings of da local village idiot, Sir Yessir.  Some said Yessir used to be a great paladin, but too many blows to da head ended him up here.  Some said he never was a paladin because no holy order would let such a fool in deir ranks.  Some just didn't give a rats foot what his past was.<br />
<br />
In da middle of one of da crowded streets of Freeport, a tiny lizard scuttled by.  Hearing da battlecry of Yessir moments before, da villagers in da street were smart enough to split apart and make room for the soon-to-follow bumbling idiot.  Sure enough, da knight came around da corner at a full run.  Losing sight of his prey, he came to a halt.<br />
<br />
Sir Yessir was dressed in a patchwork of rusted armor full of chinks, holes, and dents.  A tarnished sword and a trash can lid served as his weaponry.  An old bucket dat was used for wellwater was atop his head used as a helmet.  Bits of da man's grey hair jutted out from underneath da helmet in a random, chaotic pattern.  Blue eyes wide open searching, his weatherworn face tightened wit concentration.<br />
<br />
A little girl giggled at da funny man.  Yessier noticed da little girl and hobbled over to her, armor squeaking all da way.  He bent down to see da girl face to face.<br />
<br />
"My lady, didst thou see where the fearsome dragon went?" said Yessir to da small girl.<br />
<br />
Da girl giggled and nodded.  She den pointed down da street in da direction da lizard ran.<br />
<br />
"A thousand thank yous, my lovely lady.  Be not afraid, for I am Yessir the Dragon's Bane!"  Yessir kissed da girl's hand while she giggled some more.  He den stood up and bowed, and den ran off in da direction da girl had indicated.<br />
<br />
Da girl's mother scolded da little girl for talking to da knight and da crowd of people went back to deir daily business.<br />
<br />
"Ah ha!  There you are!  You could not hide from me forever, dragon!" Yessir had found da  dragon in da courtyard outside of a tavern.  "You shall not elude me with your tricks again!"<br />
<br />
Da lizard just perched itself on a branch oblivious to anyting around it udder dan da bug it was gonna eat.<br />
<br />
"Prepare to burn in Hate!" da knight shouted.  Yessir smacked his sword against his make-shift shield and charged.<br />
<br />
Da lizard stuck its tongue out and caught a bug.  It began munching happily until da sword came down and split it into two pieces.<br />
<br />
"Triumph!  Triumph for the Holy Order!  One less dragon to spread its evil across this land!"  da paladin said wit his sword raised high into da air.  He den kneeled down and stuck his sword into da ground.  Yessir den gave tanks to his god for imbuing him wit da power to be da greatest dragonslayer dat ever  walked Norrath.<br />
<br />
Finishing his prayer, da knight stood up and looked around.  Noticing da convenient tavern nearby, da knight became thirsty.  "I think my victory deserves a toast!"<br />
<br />
And wit dat, da paladin took off his helmet and walked into da bar.</p>

	<p>Bash's group made it to da gates of Freeport wit not too many problems.  Well, unless you consider constant whining about having to go to da bathroom by Lilting a problem.  Or da constant pick-up lines Treehugger was dishing out a problem.  Or da fact dat Medsa got fed up and kicked Treehugger wit extreme force in his "lower area" and let him suffer a bit before healing him up a problem.  No, it was a pretty smooth journey.<br />
<br />
"Halt!  Who goes there?!" a fully armored person standing in front of da Freeport gate asked.<br />
<br />
"Yes!  State your business now or be cut down  where you stand!" said da udder fully armored person standing in front of da gate.<br />
<br />
"Hail, friend guards." Treehugger said.  "We come to the city for supplies and information.  No trouble walks with us."<br />
<br />
"You speak the words, ranger, but what of that big fellow behind you?" da guard said pointing to Bash suspiciously.  "He looks like an ogre.  Ogres are to be killed on sight!"<br />
<br />
Bash's face became an expression of anger.  He wanted to squish dis little human wit his hammer.  Treehugger quickly interjected.<br />
<br />
"An ogre?!" Da ranger laughed.  "What would I be doing with an ogre?!  Besides, you intelligent guards would have seen an ogre coming from miles away, right?"<br />
<br />
Da guards looked at each udder and nodded deir agreement.  "Yes, that is correct.  Nothing gets by us!" said da first guard.  "Quite right!  We are trained from childhood to detect such things!" said da udder guard.<br />
<br />
"Exactly.  Now, if you would let us pass, we'd like to enter.  We're on urgent business." da ranger said wit a smile.<br />
<br />
"Very good.  In you go.  Hurry along now." da guard said.  Da group not wanting to waste any more time began to march through the gate when all of a sudden one of da guards spoke up.<br />
<br />
"Wait a minute!  Something's not quite right here."<br />
<br />
"Yes, I sense it too." said da udder guard.<br />
<br />
Bash looked uncomfortably at Treehugger, and da ranger just looked back with uneasiness.<br />
<br />
"There!!  There!!  I see it!!" said da first guard.<br />
<br />
"Yes! Yes!" da udder guard said.  "<b>SNAKE!  SNAKE!</b>  To arms! brothers, to arms!"<br />
<br />
Da two guards rushed passed da party and ran out into da field where a tiny, harmless moss snake was slithering past.  Da guards drew deir swords and began circling da snake cautiously.  <br />
<br />
Cries from udder guards inside da city could be heard.  "Snake!  Snake!"  Five more guards  rushed out of da gate to join da first two.  Three more guards came to block da entrance to da city.<br />
<br />
Da seven guards surrounded da snake in a circle so da party couldn't see what was going on.  But swords were flying all over da place, clanging against each udder every few seconds.  Screams of panic and fear were constantly heard from da little group of guards.<br />
<br />
Da moss snake slithered through one of da guard's feet and den hurriedly sped away from da city.  Not noticing at all, da guards continued to hack away.<br />
<br />
One of dem finally said, "It's gone!  We killed it!"  A loud cheer erupted from da guards in da group, da guards at da gate, and several guards up on two battlements who spectated from above.  Patting each udder on da back, da guards marched back to deir posts.<br />
<br />
"Sorry about that" a guard said to da group.  "You may enter now."  Da guards made way for da party and Bash's group walked into da city.<br />
<br />
Lilting quietly said to Medsa, "Wow.  Such fuss over something completely harmless.  Makes you wonder what they'd do if they saw a bat or something."<br />
<br />
A guard caught part of da conversation.  "BAT?!!"  Anudder guard heard da guard.  "BAT!  BAT!"  Soon, all da guards were yelling da warning across da whole entrance.<br />
<br />
Twelve guards stormed out of da gate weapons drawn.  Dey began searching for da dangerous threat to da city.<br />
<br />
Bash's group just sighed and continued on into Freeport.<br />
<br />
"Ok," said Bash turning to da party.  "Us needs to find two tings.  We need to get information on how to get to Halas, and if possible, we need to find more peoples to help us fight Smellybreath.  Let's split up and meet back here in an hour, ok?"<br />
<br />
"Sounds good," said Treehugger.<br />
<br />
"Bah," said Medsa, but willing to do it anyway.<br />
<br />
"Okie dokie!" said an excited Lilting.  And wit dat, da party split up.  <br />
<br />
Lilting raced around dis great big city.  He was not used to everyting being bigger dan him.  He ran around and around, poking his head into several different shops and giggling.  He eventually got tired and found his way into a bar.<br />
<br />
Lilting pulled up a barstool.  Da bartender moved over and said, "What can I get for ya, pint-size?"<br />
<br />
"Ummm.  I'm looking for a courageous fighter to help us kill an evil foe!  I'm also looking for the way to Halas.  Do you know where I can get these things?"<br />
<br />
Hearing what da halfling sitting next to him had just said, a grey-haired man turned to Lilting.  "My boy, I can help you.  I am the greatest dragonslayer that ever lived!"<br />
<br />
Lilting just stared in awe of da man.  He knew he had found someone who could surely help.</p>

	<p>Bash stood on da street corner tapping his big foot impatiently.  He told his group to meet back here in one hour.  Dat hour had been up over half an hour ago.  <br />
<br />
Bash was getting more angry by da minute, and had just about almost resolved to go continue da journey on his own when he saw two silhouettes approaching from down one of da streets.<br />
<br />
"Shut up!" said one of da peoples.<br />
<br />
"No, you shut up!" said da udder.<br />
<br />
"No you!"<br />
<br />
Bash saw dat da two peoples coming were Medsa and and a sludge-covered Treehugger.  Dey both not looked berry happy.<br />
<br />
"Hey, why is yous fighting?" asked Bash.<br />
<br />
With a frustrated scream, Medsa just said "Why don't you ask hormone boy here?!"<br />
<br />
"Me?!  I didn't jump into that food trough  voluntarily!  Some pyscho witch who doesn't know a good man when she sees one pushed me!"<br />
<br />
"Well, if you hadn't followed me everywhere I went and actually split up like Bash  said, maybe you would  be high and dry right now!"<br />
<br />
Bash, trying to follow da converation, said, "Me take it yous not find someone to help us?"<br />
<br />
Medsa and Treehugger both instantly turned to da ogre and simultaneously yelled, "NO!!"<br />
<br />
"Ah.  Ok den.  Me neither.  Peoples here no like ogres much, so me couldn't get much more dan a scream from most."<br />
<br />
"And another thing," began Medsa to da ranger, "This whole, 'I'm gonna die tomorrow for sure, so how about some lovin' routine is getting really old!"<br />
<br />
"Well, it's true!  Pretty soon my luck is going to run out and I'll be killed! I suck at fighting!"<br />
<br />
"You suck at a lot of things!"<br />
<br />
Bash just rolled his eyes and threw his big ogre hands up in da air and turned around and let da two crazy peoples go at it.  Dat's when he saw da halfling.<br />
<br />
Lilting trotting along wit a big smile on his face came bounding towards da ogre.  Behind him, an old man hurriedly walked behind da halfling with armor creaking and  squeaking noisily.<br />
<br />
"Hi guys!" said da halfling even more excited dan normal.  "Guess what I found!"<br />
<br />
"A whino?" Treehugger guessed.<br />
<br />
"Nope!  A great knight who's willing to join our cause against evil!"<br />
<br />
Da old man attempted to make an elaborate bow, but his armor and old legs somewhat prevented dat.<br />
<br />
"He's the greatest dragonslayer that ever lived!  He's killed more than forty dragons in his day!"  Lilting barely could contain his excitement at his find.  Bash would surely be proud, he was certain!  Turning to da old man, da halfling said "Go ahead!  Tell them about the Dragon of Qeynos and how you tricked it into drowning!"<br />
<br />
"Yes, of course!" da old man said.  "There I was, polishing my armor, when I hear this tremendous roar..."<br />
<br />
Bash couldn't quite put his big ogre finger on it, but dis man seemed a little odd to him.  Medsa and Treehugger just ****ed one eyebrow at each other not knowing what to tink of da knight.<br />
<br />
"Save yous story, old man." Bash said.  "Us is sure you're a good hero, but..."<br />
<br />
"But what?" asked Lilting a little sad about what he might hear next.<br />
<br />
"...but, us not sure about yous skills.  Us really is needing a guide to Halas right now more dan a 'dragonslayer'."<br />
<br />
"My boy," said da knight, "Not only do I know the way to that frigid region, but I personally have slain 12 ice dragons there!  I can show you the way, with most certainty!"<br />
<br />
Bash considered his words.  Dey needed to get to Halas as quick as possible, and dis crazy old man seemed to know da way.  Da ogre shrugged.<br />
<br />
"Ok den.  Yous can come."<br />
<br />
"Thank ye, my good fellow.  Ye'll not regret it!  I, am Sir Yessir!  Evil trembles before me!"<br />
<br />
And wit dat, da party headed westward out of Freeport wit Yessir telling of his good deeds, Lilting listening intently, Bash tromping ahead focusing on his goal, and Medsa and Treehugger bickering some more.</p>

	<p>In da huge forest of Faydark, nestled snugly deep within, was da tree city of Kelethin.  Dis was da home of da tiny, wussier elves of da lands lovingly referred to as wood elves.  Long ago, it was decreed dat calling dese elves "Tiny Wussy Elves" didn't go over well wit da Kelethin residents, so da races just created da term "wood elves" as an accepted standard.<br />
<br />
Dese wood elves were a clumsy sort.  Dey was always falling flat on deir faces.  Some said dat da race was magically born wit da subconscious desire to kiss dirt, udders just  believed dey had no coordination.  In any case, da ancient wood elves long ago decided to erect a city dat was as far from da ground as possible.  Da theory was, "If us is not near da ground, den us can't smack it wit our faces!"  Like most theories, when it was applied to da real world it didn't work berry well.<br />
<br />
"Hail, NoodleArm!" said a wood elf as he walked into one of da Kelethin shops.  Da wood elf took a few more steps and den fell flat on his face.<br />
<br />
"Hail, Jammypants!" said da dark brown haired elf.  "Need some more supplies?"<br />
<br />
Getting off da floor and rubbing his nose, Jammypants just got up and smiled.  Dis was a regular occurrance for a wood elf. <br />
<br />
Turning to look out his shop window at da beautiful day, NoodleArm noticed a couple wood elves walking along one of da ramps high in da trees.  Like clockwork, dey both began to stumble and den fall right off completely.  A short scream was heard by dem and den dey fell out of da shopkeepers sight.<br />
<br />
"What have you got for sale today?" asked Jammypants.<br />
<br />
"Same stuff as yesterday," said NoodleArm.  Three more screams erupted from wood elves outside as dey lost deir footing and tumbled seventy feet to da ground.<br />
<br />
"Heard anything about the trouble brewing?"<br />
<br />
"What trouble?"<br />
<br />
"I was just making small talk.  There's no trouble.  Especially not here in this wonderful city."  Jammypants fell on his face again and two more wood elves outside could be heard falling to deir doom.<br />
<br />
Just den, da shopkeeper heard a different sound amidst da sound of wood elves hitting dirt.  It sounded like da flapping of two huge, slow bird wings.  Jammypants and NoodleArm looked around da shop in confusion.<br />
<br />
<i>Whoosh.   Whoosh.   Whoosh.</i><br />
<br />
Jammypants stood up and shrugged at da shopkeeper.  Da beating of da huge wing-like tings stopped and da whole city shook like someting monstrous had jumped up and down on one of da platforms.  <br />
<br />
A nasty, loud, deep, bloodcurdling roar was den heard.  Jammypants and NoodleArm became berry afraid.  Dey didn't know what was going on.  Screams of terror erupted from many wood elves outside.  Da two elves in da shop heard many elves running around in a panic, and even more falling off da city and to da ground.  Some even on purpose.<br />
<br />
"<b>Come back here and face me</b>!" a deep, booming, gutteral voice yelled.  "<b>You will answer my question or be destroyed</b>!"<br />
<br />
Jammypants quivered in fear and so did da shopkeeper.  More screams from da elves outside did nothing to calm deir nerves.  All of a sudden, dey could hear da ting outside move closer to da shop.<br />
<br />
Da whole shop shook more violently wit each booming step.  Da footsteps came to a halt where it seemed to be just outside da door to da shop.<br />
<br />
Dere was complete silence and da two elves just stared at da door.  Too scared to move.  Too scared to fall down.  Too scared to wee wee.<br />
<br />
A gigantic, black-clawed, red hand smashed through da door and swung upward to rip off da ceiling of da shop.  A fifteen foot tall demon stood snarling over da elves.<br />
<br />
Jammypants let out a shriek and started to run, but da demon snatched him up and bit him in half wit his massive jaws.  NoodleArm just  stared in utter horror.  Den da demon moved over to him.<br />
<br />
Da demon picked up da shopkeeper and brought da elves face just inches from its own.  NoodleArm could barely breathe da fetid breath coming from da demon's mouth.  Blank white eyes stared back at him wit pure hatred.<br />
<br />
"<b>What do you know of a heroic party heading towards Halas, elf boy</b>!?" da demon asked in an otherworldly voice.  NoodleArm just shivered wit fear.  "<b>Answer me</b>!!"<br />
<br />
NoodleArm just froze up in shock.  Da demon, realizing he was not going to get any information from dese clumsy, wussy elves decided to try to acquire it elsewhere.<br />
<br />
"Maybe that idiot Crush will know something," da demon mumbled.<br />
<br />
Da demon took to da sky once again and headed north.  Da last thing heard was da scream of NoodleArm as he was flung into da mist below Kelethin.</p>

	<p>Over da treetops Killdead da demon flew.  Looking downward only to spit da occasional demonic loogie on a poor unsuspecting adventurer's head, he kept his flying steadily northbound.<br />
<br />
On occasion, Killdead would hear da shouts of  some mortals auctioning off deir petty wares.  Da demon smiled evilly for he knew da secret, evil pact dat da gods made when dividing up da land.  Dis pact said dat anyone who shouts lame tings or auctions <b>anyting</b> in Faydark will spend da rest of deir lives in da Plane of Pain.  Dis pact also apply to a place called East Commonlands, but da demon wasn't entirely sure where dat was.<br />
<br />
He finally saw da pass dat lead to Emperor Crush's city.  Flying over it he saw many orc  tents and buildings.  Hundreds of orcs were fighting hundreds of different 'heroes' dat comprised of elves, dwarves, humans and gnomes.  It was just one big chaotic mess.  It made Killdead smile and brought a tear to his eye.  But da demon had more important tings to tink about.  He headed straight for da castle in da middle of da orc town.<br />
<br />
"Whatever you say, your <i>majesty</i>," grumbled a dark elf in a red sportcoat.  He standing along side a particularly stupid looking, cross-eyed orc in a castle tower.  "I am here but to <i>serve</i> you," da dark elf said wit obvious sarcasm and disgust.  <br />
<br />
Da orc, being da stupidest of his race, didn't catch any of da elves hidden messages and just took da words at face value.  "That right!" da orc said.  "Me are Crush!  Me are Emper... Eperom... Eeprom... Me are king!  You is just elf!"<br />
<br />
"Oh, you are so correct, oh <i>great one</i>," da elf said rolling his eyes.  "You're the one who's <i>really in charge here</i>!"<br />
<br />
Just den, a small group of dwarves came running up da castle steps into da tower room.  Dey readied deir weapons and growled at da orc king, ready to attack.  Da orc king just looked stupidly onward.  Da dwarves den began to advance until dey caught sight of da da dark elf dat was standing next to da big orc.  <br />
<br />
Da dark elf turned towards da dwarves and made his eyelids become slits.  Da dwarves' eyes opened so wide dey almost popped out of deir heads.  Dey dropped deir weapons and ran screaming in fear from da tower.<br />
<br />
Da dark elf turned back towards da orc.  "As I was saying, <i>your highness</i>, I think that we need to take your orc forces and GURAMMFF!!"<br />
<br />
"What?  What Gurammff?  It nasty high level?  What?  What is it?"  Da orc not notice da elf was gone.  "What?  Gurammff?  It is a gnome, isn't it?  Crush hate gnomes!  Oooh, Crush hate da little GURAKKK!!"<br />
<br />
A big red hand had reached in from da outside window and yanked da dark elf from da  tower.  Anudder hand reached in and yanked da orc.<br />
<br />
Da demon flew a little bit aways from da castle wit da two beings's heads palmed in each hand.  He set dem down not-so-gently on da ground.<br />
<br />
"Crush want to know why you take Crush from castle!" da orc yelled at da demon, seemingly not afraid.  "Crush crush da crushness out of Crush's crushed crushy crush man!"<br />
<br />
Da dark elf, being slightly more quick-witted dan da orc, saw da demon and recognized who he was.  "Forgive his <i>highness</i>, he is not accustomed to one such as great as you visiting <i>his</i> land." da elf said wit a berry low bow.<br />
<br />
Da orc just screamed obscenities at da demon and danced around in a fit threatening Killdead, occasionally even giving him da orc "finger."  Killdead, also being quick witted realized who really was in charge here.<br />
<br />
"<b>I am looking for a group heading towards the ice country where Halas resides.</b>" da demon said towards da elf in his booming, growl of a voice.  "<b>There is a good chance it is being led by an ogre.  Do you know of such a group?  Tell me now or I will kill you where you stand</b>!"<br />
<br />
Da dark elf searched his memory of recent news.  He remembered someting a dark elf scout had told him.  "I have heard of such a group.  They were in Freeport a little less than five days ago."<br />
<br />
Da orc looked confused at dis news, but den nodded an agry nod at da demon like he knew of dis information all along.<br />
<br />
Da elf continued, "It is rumored they acquired a knight who is leading them to the ice country you spoke of.  Our dark elf underground web...er... <i>Emperor</i> Crush's vast orc empire stretches far across these lands and there is little I... er... He doesn't know."<br />
<br />
Da orc just stared his cross-eyed face at da demon wit pride and dignity.  Da demon wanted to just bite him in half, but he knew dere was probably a reason his dark elf friends kept him alive to be used as a puppet.<br />
<br />
"<b>Good</b>," said da demon, "<b>You have served me well, elf.  You shall be rewarded after your soul departs this plane</b>."  Da demon gave anudder look of disgust to da orc king and den flew straight up fifty feet and den zoomed westward.<br />
<br />
"Crush no like stupid red bird!  Crush want it crushed in crush-like manner!"<br />
<br />
Da dark elf sighed.  "But <i>my lord</i>, the bird is already dead.  You killed it, don't you remember?  You slew it thirty seconds ago!"<br />
<br />
Crush not wanting to admit he didn't remember such a ting, just puffed out his chest wit power and conceit and said, "Of course Crush did!  All peoples fear and tremble before Crush!"<br />
<br />
"Of course they do.  Of course they do."  Da dark elf got an even worse look of disgust on  his face.  Some wandering adventurers came nearby and da elf spun towards dem.  "Boo!"<br />
<br />
Da adventurers screamed and bolted da udder way.  "D'Vinn!" dey shouted!<br />
<br />
Soon, udder people shouting "D'Vinn!" and "D'Vinn's out!" and den mass hysteria ensued.  Elves and humans were tripping over each udder to get to da pass dat lead out of Crushbone.  Dwarves and gnomes were getting smooshed under da weight of all da panicking peoples.<br />
<br />
Da dark elf smiled evilly and quietly said wit dripping sarcasm, "Yes, Crush, people do indeed tremble before you." <br />
<br />
"Of course they do!" said da orc who obviously heard.<br />
<br />
And wit dat, da dark elf and orc walked back towards D'Vinn's... er... Crush's castle.</p>

	<p>Traveling for two days straight, our heroic party had trudged through da commonlands.  Yessir was now in da lead as everyone else was too exhausted to even move.  But, wit da warnings of da paladin saying dey no could stop until dey reached East Karana, da party received no rest.<br />
<br />
"Ah! Here we are," said da knight.  Da party reached da entrance to da haunted Kithicor Forest.<br />
<br />
Lilting gave a frown.  He knew of dis forest, but he no had explored it much.  He heard too many ghost stories to even tink about going in.<br />
<br />
"Isn't this place haunted?" da halfling asked as he saw da moon beginning to rise as da night slowly began around dem.<br />
<br />
"Of course it is!" sad Sir Yessir.  Everyone in da party got a look of terror on deir faces.  "But fear not!  For 'tis only haunted by day!  Never at night!"<br />
<br />
Everyone heaved a sigh of relief.  Everyone except Medsa, who had to keep shoving Treehugger away.  "Get away from me!  I don't need any of your comfort to get rid of my fear!" said da cleric.<br />
<br />
"But I do!" da ranger said with shivers.<br />
<br />
Da cleric just sneered at Treehugger.<br />
<br />
"Ok, lads!" said Yessir.  "Let's hurry up and get through this place as quickly as possible before the morning dawns!"<br />
<br />
Da group trotted along following da crazy paladin.  Dey ran into da forest and it looked pretty spooky.  Each tree seemed like it was dying and dey felt like dey was being watched from every angle.<br />
<br />
Dey continued running along da path through da forest.  Spooky hoots and howls could be heard all around dem.  Lilting wanted to run away.  Bash wanted to smash da dumb owl hooting.  Treehugger wanted to be held because he was so afraid.  Medsa wanted da ranger to leave her alone.<br />
<br />
Dey was making good time for about half an hour when all of a sudden dey was ambushed by a group of skeletal mages and zombies.  Da undead tings jumped out of da trees and bushes and surrounded da party.<br />
<br />
"Ye know, come to think of it, I think I may have been mistaken" da paladin began saying outloud but tinking to himself.  "I think maybe the forest is haunted at night and not by day."<br />
<br />
Treehugger's swords instantly appeared in his hands.  Bash readied his hammer.  Medsa placed her hands on her hips and glared at da  undead tings.  Lilting drew out his tiny, tiny, almost microscopic dagger.  Yessir still contemplated if he truly was wrong about da forest being haunted in da daytime.<br />
<br />
"You'll not take us without a fight!" da ranger said wit a snarl.  "I'm sure I'm no match for you, but my friends will take you down after I die!"<br />
<br />
Just den, da biggest, meanest skeleton made its way through da circle of undead.  It carried a huge doubled bladed axe in one of its massive hands.  It looked at da little ranger dan den laughed.  It was at dat moment, Bash found he was frozen in place and  couldn't move.  Da udders noticed da same ting about demselves.<br />
<br />
Da zombies in da undead group all had hungry glints in deir eyes.  Da skeletons raised deir weapons.  Dey all started moving in closer.  Da big skeleton raised his gigantic axe, and den swung it downwards towards Bash's head.<br />
<br />
"Wait!  Wait!  Stop!" yelled a voice from somewhere behind Bash.  He no could see who it was, but da voice sounded familiar somehow.  "Stop!  Hold on!"<br />
<br />
Da big skeleton's axe stopped just inches away from Bash's forehead.  All da udder undead stopped deir advance as well.  Out of da corner of his eye, Bash saw da big skeleton look at da unseen figure and den walked in its direction.  He heard da person talking to da skeleton, but he could barely make it out.<br />
<br />
"Right," said da voice.  "I'm aware of the deal.  But these guys are not a part of it.  They're my friends!  And you know what happens if you hurt my frends."<br />
<br />
Bash knew he had heard dat voice before, but he could not figure out where.  Dis was worse  torture dan waiting for da skeletons and zombies to eat him.<br />
<br />
"Exactly.  Now, release my friends before I get mad!"<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, Bash found he could move once again.  He spun around to see who da voice belong to.  Dere, standing in front of da huge skeleton, was a tiny gnome wit a brown robe.<br />
<br />
"Phil!" shouted Bash wit relief.  "Me glad to see yous!"<br />
<br />
Phil looked at da big ogre and smiled.  Den he turned his attention back towards da big skeleton.  "So what do you have to say for yourself?"<br />
<br />
Da skeleton moved it's jaw like it was talking, but no words came out.  Only da sound of bone scraping against bone could be heard.<br />
<br />
"All right then," said Phil.  "But don't apologize to me.  Apologize to my friends!"<br />
<br />
Da skeleton opened and closed its mouth and shrugged its shoulders like it was sighing.  Den, it turned towards da group and moved its jaw again like it was saying someting.<br />
<br />
"That's better!  Now don't you feel better?"<br />
<br />
Da skeleton looked down and den moved its mouth slightly like it was muttering someting under its breath.<br />
<br />
"Ok, now make sure my friends get out of this forest safely, ok?  I would be upset to find out they didn't have your protection.  Most upset."<br />
<br />
Da big skeleton nodded.<br />
<br />
Done wit talking to da skeleton, Phil excitedly ran up to da party.  "Hi guys!  You still on your adventure?  Is it fun?"<br />
<br />
"Hiya Phil!" said Lilting.  "We're glad to see you."<br />
<br />
Treehugger and Medsa said sarcastically at da same time, "Yeah.  Real glad."  Realizing dat she was tinking along da same lines as himself, Treehugger winked at da cleric.  Medsa just rolled her eyes in disgust.<br />
<br />
Just den, anudder skeleton came running up da trail through da woods.  It was Jakontiklarkiak, da same skeleton dey saw wit  Phil in Oasis.  Jakontiklarkiak waved to Bash and den saw da udder skeletons dat were gonna eat da group.  It jumped up wit joy and ran over to dem.<br />
<br />
Jakontik jerked his head up quickly as if to say, "Wassup?" to da group of skeletons and zombies.  One of da skeletons held out its hand and Jakoktik slapped it wit his own.  He patted a zombie on da back and den began moving his jaw like da big skeleton did before.  Da udder skeletons did da same.  Da zombies just made moans and growl sounds.<br />
<br />
"Anyway," said Phil, "You've got clearance to pass through the forest now.  Skeleton kings can be so fickle when it comes to tresspassers.  Not to worry though.  He'll make sure you get through safe.  If he doesn't, he'll be sorry and he knows it."<br />
<br />
"Wow," said Bash, "Yous is pretty powerful to command da king."<br />
<br />
"Well, duh.  I'm a necromancer.  I have more power than a god!  I'm just waiting for Hate to freeze over so I can join you guys!  You're so cool!"<br />
<br />
Not wanting to be around da annoying necro much longer, Bash decided it was time to go.<br />
<br />
"Ok peoples, let's go.  Tanks for helping us Phil.  Us will give yous a shout when it ok for yous to join us."<br />
<br />
"Okie dokie!  I'll be waiting!"<br />
<br />
Da party den said deir goodbyes and began marching westward once more.  Yessir, not having said a word, had his brow furrowed in concentration da whole time.  He finally spoke up as he lead da way.<br />
<br />
"Ye know, I've been thinking about it.  I'm pretty sure the woods is haunted in the daytime.  I don't think I was wrong."<br />
<br />
Bash sighed and den looked at Lilting.  Da halfling seemed to be looking northward and was crying a little bit.  Da ogre decided not to bug da halfling.<br />
<br />
Dey reached da trail dat led out of da woods and evntually found deir way to East Karana.  Dey decided dis was a good place to rest.  It was a good idea, until Bash's clothes suddenly and magically burst into flame.</p>

	<p>Bash smelled smoke and looked down to see his pants and shirt engulfed in flames.  Confused for only a second, panic took over as da heat found its way to his skin.<br />
<br />
"AAAAHHHH!!! PUT IT OUT!  PUT IT OUT!" da ogre screamed as he ran around in circles.<br />
<br />
Da group, not exactly sure what was happening, each had deir own ideas of which was da best ting for Bash to do in dis situation.<br />
<br />
"Keep running and the fire will get tired!" said Lilting.<br />
<br />
"Flap your arms faster to fan out the flames!" said Treehugger.<br />
<br />
"Stand still and act like something that doesn't look like it would burn!" said Yessir.<br />
<br />
Medsa just calmly said, "How about Bashing that woman over there with the flaming hands laughing at you?"<br />
<br />
The whole party turned to see who Medsa was talking about.  Everyone, except Bash of course.  He was still running around in a panic.  The woman dat da cleric had pointed out was a dark skinned, dark haired erudite wit a red robe.  Her eyes were orange, like dey demselves were ablaze.  She was cackling wildly at da sight of da flaming ogre.<br />
<br />
"Let's go take her out!" said Treehugger.  "You guys can use my corpse as a shield if she starts getting rough!"<br />
<br />
Medsa thought dat was a good idea.  Da group, minus Bash, walked over to da much-too-happy erudite.  Her cackling abruptly stopped and her eyes snapped to da peoples now standing in front of her.<br />
<br />
"Go away!" she said wit a hiss.  "This doesn't concern you!"<br />
<br />
"You set our friend on fire!" said Treehugger.  "Of course it concerns us!"<br />
<br />
A big ball of flame da size of an ogre ran by da party screaming loudly.  Nobody seemed to notice as all focus was on da erudite woman.<br />
<br />
"If that magical fire is tied to ye, m'lady, then I am guessin' it will be extinguished with your life!" da paladin said.<br />
<br />
"Sorry, no.  It's normal fire.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got more things to burn."<br />
<br />
Da erudite's hands started to glow red and flames danced about dem.  She shot out fire balls into trees and bushes and anyting else nearby.  She cackled some more as she watched da flames rise up.<br />
<br />
"Listen, you witch...!" started Lilting.<br />
<br />
"Wizard.  I'm a wizard, well, wizardess.  I'm not a witch!"<br />
<br />
"Listen, you wizardess!" Lilting corrected himself, "You help our friend right now!"<br />
<br />
"Why should I?  You know, I haven't seen a roasted halfling in a while..."<br />
<br />
Lilting immediately shut up.<br />
<br />
Medsa realized dey was getting nowhere.  Noticing dat dis lady had some decent fire summoning power, and her seemingly overjoyment of setting tings ablaze, she got an idea.  "Look, we're on a quest.  A quest that our large friend has undertaken.  We'd like it if you came along.  There will be many, many, many things that are combustable along the way."<br />
<br />
"Lots of things that will burn?" da woman asked as her eyes lit up.  "Really?"<br />
<br />
"Uh..... yes." said da cleric.  "Lots of things to burn.  Will you help us?"<br />
<br />
Da big ball of flame ran screaming by again.  Like before, no one noticed.<br />
<br />
"If you say there's things to burn, then count me in!" da wizardess said happily.  "My name is Pyra.  Pyra Maniaca."<br />
<br />
"I'm Medsa," said Medsa (obviously), "And this is Lilting, Yessir, and this cute...er... ugly guy is Treehugger."<br />
<br />
"And your large friend?"<br />
<br />
Everyone's mouth dropped as dey remembered deir big, burning friend.  Dey looked around for Bash.  Dey saw him running around in circles, stopping, and den spinning place.  Screaming still, but more out of panic and fear dan pain.<br />
<br />
"He's Bash!" said Lilting.  "He's the nicest ogre in the world!  Can you please put out the fire?"<br />
<br />
"No.  I can't."<br />
<br />
"What?!" said da halfling.  He turned to da cleric.  "You said she could help him!"<br />
<br />
Da cleric shrugged.  "I thought she might, since she set him on fire in the first place."<br />
<br />
"I can't put the fires out," said Pyra, "But that river can.  Maybe you guys should have told him to jump in it."<br />
<br />
Da group looked over to where da wizard was pointing.  Dey all smacked deir foreheads.  Dey all hurriedly ran towards da bright, burning ogre.<br />
<br />
"Bash!" said Lilting.  "Hurry!  Follow me to that river!  If you jump in, it'll put out the fire!"  Da halfling took off towards da river.<br />
<br />
Bash, still in a fearful panic, got up and ran after da halfling.  He saw dat Lilting stopped near da edge of da water.<br />
<br />
"Here!  Here!  Jump in!  Quick!"<br />
<br />
Witout hesitation, da big ogre jumped into da river.  He landed wit a humongous splash.  Steam hissed and rose from da water as da flames were extinguished.  Bash's eyes rolled back and he let out a berry, berry contented sigh.<br />
<br />
Da udders reached da edge of da water and saw da ogre bathing in extreme pleasure.  Bash, noticing he was being watched. quickly stood up.  Unfortunately, da ogre's clothes were burned to a black crisp and dey just broke apart into flakes and fell of his ogrish body.<br />
<br />
A good laugh was had by all, except for a very beet red Bash.<br />
<br />
Da naked ogre climbed out of da water.  Lilting noticed dat da ogre did not have a burn on him.  He thought it odd.  But not as odd as da hammer dat Bash had in his hand now looked.<br />
<br />
"Bash!  Look at your hammer!"<br />
<br />
Bash looked down at his hammer and saw dat it was pulsating berry, berry rapidly.  It was turning from white to orange with extreme speed.  Bash had no idea what was wrong wit it.  Figuring he could smack some sense back into his grandpa's mallet, he swung it towards a nearby boulder on da ground.<br />
<br />
Da hammer hit wit such force dat it created da sound of lightning striking nearby.  Da rock was instantly smashed into a thousand, burnt pieces.  A ring of fire exploded outward from da point of impact.  Bash was amazed at by what his hammer was doing, and by da fact dat da fire dat passed through him from da hammer did not harm himself in any way.<br />
<br />
Lilting was not so lucky.  Da blast wave hit da little guy wit such power dat it knocked him completely off his feet.  He landed into da river.<br />
<br />
Everyone just stood completely still wit jaws agape and eyes wide open, including Bash.  Da big ogre even forgot he was naked, let alone burn-free from da previous fire.<br />
<br />
Shaking da shock of da hammer-blast free, da party realized what happened to da halfling.  Dey all went rushing up to da river's edge.  <br />
<br />
All dey saw was da tiny outline of a halfling being pulled downstream, and den out of view.</p>

	<p>"Lilting!" shouted da big ogre.  "Lilting!!"<br />
<br />
"I'll get him!" said Treehugger pushing his way past his friends trying to get to da river's edge.<br />
<br />
"No!" exclaimed Pyra.  "The current is too powerful!  Nobody but our big friend here could withstand the pull, and even he would be too slow to catch up to the halfling!"<br />
<br />
"Then what can we do?" asked Medsa.  She looked down at da ground and started to feel bad dat she ever made fun of da little guy.<br />
<br />
Nobody knew what to do.  Dey all kept looking down da river where dey last saw Lilting being carried away by da raging water.<br />
<br />
Yessir scratched his stubbly chin for several minutes.  He finally broke the silence.<br />
<br />
"Ye know," da paladin began, "I remember fightin' a river dragon in this here stream.  The current toppled both me and the fearsome beast this way and that, but in the end I was victorious."<br />
<br />
Da group turned deir heads listened intently to da crazy old man.<br />
<br />
"I beat the dragon, but the river still had it's icy grip of death on me.  I could do nothing but wait for the end.<br />
<br />
"Luckily, a few miles west of here, the water's flow is disrupted greatly.  The water weaves back and forth, and I was thrown onto the shore of Southern Karana.  Most large pieces of debris eventually end up on the shallow, southern end because of this figure-eight like water pattern."<br />
<br />
"Is yous saying dat Lilting is probably on udder side of da river?" asked Bash.  Da ogre was concerned for his little buddy.  But, concern suddenly shifted to himself when he realized he was still naked.<br />
<br />
"It's a possibility," said Yessir.  "We can but only search, can't we?"<br />
<br />
Bash went over to a nearby bush and uprooted it.  Sliding da bush on like a pair of underwear, it did well to hide his ogreness.  Mostly well.<br />
<br />
Da wizardess Pyra suddenly pointed to da south-west. "We can't cross the river here, but there is a bridge in Northern Karana that we could use.  It would be just a matter of tracking the halfling down once on the other side."<br />
<br />
"Leave that to me!" said Treehugger.  "I can track a falcon on a cloudy day!  Well... ok... maybe not a falcon... or on a cloudy day.... but I can track some things!  Sometimes, anyway."<br />
<br />
"Well, let's get to it then!" said an impatient Medsa.  She started off along da riverbank and headed west.  Da party immediately started marching behind her.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Life was going good for Cam-Pur and his gang of thugs.  They'd wait outside the little rat-hole known as SplitPaw and just 'jump' the poor dogs and rob them of their gold and trinkets.  It required no effort whatsoever.  This was Southern Karana living at its finest.<br />
<br />
It was da greatest time Cam-Pur and his gang ever had.  Da best time, dat is, until a female treant came storming over da hill screaming in a panic and rage.<br />
<br />
"My baby!!  Where's my baby?!?  Someone kidnapped my baby!!" screamed da treant.<br />
<br />
Cam-Pur and three friends, Loot-Hor, Ock-Shun, and Pack-Rat spun around to see da treant coming right at dem.<br />
<br />
"It was you, wasn't it?!" da female treant screamed.  You see, dis female treant in particular was berry near-sighted.  She could no tell who kidnapped her child and dese guys looked like da culprits as anyone else.  She decided dat da best course of action is presume guilty until proven innocent.<br />
<br />
Da female treant ripped through da four peoples like dey was tissue paper.  She slammed her massive trunk-like arms into one person, den she broke da neck of anudder.  Blind mudderly rage filling her body, da small group was dead in less dan ten seconds.<br />
<br />
"Where's my baby?!" da treant asked aloud.  "<b>Where's my baby</b>?!!?!"<br />
<br />
Not seeing her offspring anywhere nearby, she set off wandering in a blind fury and panic in no direction in particular.<br />
<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackness is all Lilting could remember.  All he could see was black.  Someting hurt.  Someting throbbed.  He couldn't pinpoint it in dis nothingness.<br />
<br />
A sound helped stir his brain as to what was going on.  <i>What is it?  Something moving.  Something roaring.  Water!  River!  Yes, there was a river.</i><br />
<br />
Da next ting dat he noticed was da cold stickyness of someting.  Someting soft and berry sludgy.<br />
<br />
Da halfling finally realized his eyes were shut. He opened dem and in poured a blinding amount of daylight.  Dis caused the throbbing to continue much harder and faster.  He pinpointed da location to da sides of his head.  Once realizing it, da pain appeared.<br />
<br />
Lilting noticed he was face down next to da river in a big pile of mud.  His whole body, from head to toe, was completely covered in da brown muck.<br />
<br />
<i>What happened?  How did I get here?</i>  Da halfling probably could have figured it out if he had a moment longer to tink about it, but a moment longer didn't come.<br />
<br />
What came was a berry large treant.  When it saw Lilting sitting up, it screamed wit delight.<br />
<br />
"<b>My baby</b>!!!"<br />
<br />
It launched itself at Lilting and heaved him right out of da muddy bank.  It den curled its big, barky arms around da halfling and held on for dear life.<br />
<br />
Da treant, wit Lilting in arm, headed south.</p>

	<p>Far away, on da very peak of da highest mountain top for as far as da eye could see, stood a pitch black castle.  Da walls of the castle glistened in da light as if dey was covered wit some type of dark slime.  Dis castle would have glistened brighter, but da sun was not out.  It was eternally hidden by deep, grey, overcast sky.  No pure light ever entered dis place it seemed.<br />
<br />
Inside da castle, Smellybreath, da goblin wizard, stood atop an altar made of arcane runes and symbols.  With arms outsrethed to ceiling, da goblin was chanting in some arcane tongue dat anyone within earshot would  not have known.<br />
<br />
Da only spectators da goblin had were four knights.  Dese knights wore armour as black as da castle walls.  Each held swords with blades equally as dark, but wit blood-red hilts.  None of da knights faces could be seen for each wore a full helmet wit sharp horns justting out of da sides.  Dey stood like silent statues as Smellybreath continued his chanting.<br />
<br />
"Ooom bop zoppa doo wop zoppa doo wah ditty," da goblin continued.  Da goblin's body began to glow blue and a humming sound could be heard hanging in da air. His chanting continued uninterrupted.<br />
<br />
"Oooh Eee Oooh Ahh Ahh ting tang walla walla bing bang..."  As da goblin continued speaking getting progressively louder and louder, his body began glowing even a brighter shade of blue.  Da humming also continued to get louder while da color kept getting lighter and lighter.  It became so light and so bright, dat da goblins body was engulfed in a pure white luminescence.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath was screaming his magical incantation to be heard over da loud and throbbing humming sound.  He couldn't see anything anymore.  He finally cried out da final words, "<b>Shayka bom bom, shayka bom bom</b>!!"  <br />
<br />
As da last words exited da goblins mouth, Smellybreath flung his outstretched arms towards da black knights.  All da light dat encompassed his body was shot out into four directions and slammed into each of da black warriors.  Each  knight jolted and and convulsed as da light seared through deir bodies.  None made a sound as da light arced and twisted around each knight.<br />
<br />
Within seconds, the light disappeared and all was dark within the goblin's hidden sanctum once again, save for the light of the torches on the walls.<br />
<br />
Da goblin collapsed on his altar from overexertion.  Rising to his elbows, da goblin managed to speak in rasped breaths.<br />
<br />
"There.... it is.... done!  You.... are now infused with the powers of the elements themselves...."<br />
<br />
Da knights, each looking down at deir swords, noticed dat each glowed very brightly.  Each, also, glowed wit a different color; blue, orange, white, and brown.<br />
<br />
"You are now the guardians.... of what will be ... the future Lord of the Planes.  You are now imbued with powers that are more ancient than time itself.  I now.... dub each of you.... with the names of your respective magics.<br />
<br />
"Fire.  Ice.  Earth.  Air.   Your are now the Elemental Guardians.  And I.... have just brought forth the second stage of.... the prophecy.<br />
<br />
"Go now.... guard each corner of the castle.... until I call upon you again."<br />
<br />
Each knight silently nodded and turned around and began hurriedly exiting da room.  Da goblin held up a tiny finger da largest of da knights.<br />
<br />
"Wait.... you.... you will be my personal guardian.  You will be the general of the other three.  Such a calling will grant you more power than what you have just received, so.... so states the prophecy.  Do not fail me."<br />
<br />
Da knight banged his guantleted fist against da chest of his black breastplate and turned around and marched to his post.</p>

	<p>Sir Yessir led da way westward along da riverbank at a hurried pace.  Da squeaks from his rusty armor was almost too loud to even hear da river itself.  <br />
<br />
Da udders were right behind da paladin.  Bash noticed dat da sun was going down.  He didn't tink dey would make it to da udder side of da river before it got dark.  He also no liked da fact dat it was gonna be cold and he  was pretty much naked.<br />
<br />
Pyra was busy shooting small blasts of fire at everyting along da river bank.  Most of da  fires she created never lasted too long.  She eventually became curious about da group she was wit.<br />
<br />
"So who is the old man?" asked da wizardess to a nearby Medsa.  <br />
<br />
"Some guy named Yessir," said da cleric who was walking briskly next to Pyra.  "I guess he's a paladin, though I don't know what paladin would be caught dead with a bucket for a helmet.  He claims to be a great dragonslayer."<br />
<br />
"And what about the ogre?" asked Pyra.  "What's his story?"<br />
<br />
"None of us are really sure.  He says he needs to get to Halas to find some type of seer or oracle.  I guess there is some big danger to the lands that he either won't speak of, or isn't sure of himself."<br />
<br />
"And the halfling?"<br />
<br />
"Just your standard, run-of-the-mill, halfling druid.  You know...?"<br />
<br />
"Annoying?"<br />
<br />
"Bingo."<br />
<br />
"And what of the ranger?  He seems kinda cute.  Are you two...?"<br />
<br />
"No!" said da cleric a little too quickly.  "No way!  I'd never date Treehugger in a million gazillion years!"<br />
<br />
Hearing his name, Treehugger turned around and smiled at da cleric.  He winked at Medsa, but da cleric just scowled back at him.  Da ranger quickly raised and lowered his eyebrows twice at her, and den turned back to continue keeping pace wit Yessir.<br />
<br />
Da night set in, and when da sun was completely gone da party saw da bridge.   It was a huge ting dat spanned da big river dat seperated da northern part from da southern Karana plains.  Part of da bridge was a guard outpost.<br />
<br />
Dey reached da outpost and went inside.  Two guards stood directly in front of da archway to da bridge.<br />
<br />
"Halt!" said one of da guards.  "None shall pass!"<br />
<br />
"Excuse us sir," said Treehugger, "But we need to get across this river."<br />
<br />
Da two guards said in unison, "<b>None shall pass</b>!"<br />
<br />
"Why?" asked Medsa.  "Is it because we have an ogre in our group?"<br />
<br />
Bash gripped his hammer tightly.<br />
<br />
Da two guards looked at each udder.  Den da first one said, "No.  None shall pass because  the bridge is under repair.  The construction crew has gone home for the night.  If you want to cross, you'll have to wait 'till morning when they can guide you across."<br />
<br />
"Right," said da udder guard.  "If you want to wait, there's a room upstairs you can stay in 'till morning."<br />
<br />
"Right!" da first guard said.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked a little confused.  But in da end, dey all went upstairs to sleep until morning.  If dey no could get across da river, dere was not much dey could do.<br />
<br />
Bash got no sleep dat night.  He kept tinking about Lilting, his hammer, and his clothes.  Why had Papa Smurpheater not told him about dis hammer?  Why did it act so funny?  Bash blamed himself for losing da halfling.  Da ogre silently vowed dat he find Lilting and den find Smellybreath and bash da goblin once and for all.  He was tired of da tings dat was happening to him, and it was all dat wizard's fault.<br />
<br />
He would smash him good if it was da last ting he did, dis he swore.  As soon as Bash thought dat, he thought he almost felt his hammer grow warm for an instant and den cool of a split second later.  He figured he imagined it.<br />
<br />
Outside, da moon shown brightly.  Nothing could be heard but da crickets, owls, and occasional wanderer accidentally being squished by a distant hill giant's foot.  All was pretty much quiet, until da sound of giant wings flapping appeared.<br />
<br />
If one were watching, dey would see a giant shadow on da ground from someting high in da air flying past da bridge.  And if one were watching closely, dey would see it was humanoid wit wings and headed west.  And if one were watching really closely, dey would see dat da 'head' of da shadow was moving back and forth as if it was searching for someting.<br />
<br />
Nobody was watching dough, and da shadow disappeared westward as quickly as it came.</p>

	<p>At da brink of dawn, da party went to go cross da Karana bridge.  Da construction crew had a fun time using cranes and lifts to get each person over, especially da big ogre.  But, it was accomplished in da end.<br />
<br />
"So dis is da 'Dreaded Southern Karana', huh?" asked Bash to no one in particular.  "It not look so bad to me."<br />
<br />
It was true.  Da sun was shining in da eastern horizon, birds were singing.  It was berry nice.  At least, until dey took deir first steps off da bridge and onto da grass itself.  Da second da ogre's foot touched soil, da sky darkened and down came da rain.<br />
<br />
"Me take it back," muttered da ogre.<br />
<br />
"Let's hurry and search the river's edge for signs of Lilting before they get washed away from the rain!" Treehugger said.  "If they disappear, we've got no chance of finding him.  Us rangers are the masters of tracking, but we suck at it.  How's that for irony?"<br />
<br />
"We could ask a druid to track him down if we  can't find him," said Pyra.<br />
<br />
Da party agreed dat dey would rather live with a lost friend dan deal wit anudder druid.<br />
<br />
Treehugger was off in an instant racing eastward along da side of da riverbank.  Da group followed soon after.  Not too far down da ranger came to a dead halt.<br />
<br />
Catching up to him, da group saw da ranger paused still in his tracks.  <br />
<br />
"What's wrong?" whispered Medsa.<br />
<br />
"Shhhh," said Treehugger.  "I hear something.  It's like the sound of a thousand miniature horses walking the field." The ranger frowned.  "Erm, don't ask how I know that."<br />
<br />
Da ranger signaled da group to follow him and he went south a little ways.  Beyond some trees dey saw what caused all da noise.<br />
<br />
Walking in a southern direction was a wood elf wit his held head high.  Behind him, several thousand peoples silently followed him.  Humans, elves, half-elves, all different sizes, but each wearing green.  Most were sniffling or shedding some tears.  All, but da leading wood elf.<br />
<br />
Treehugger bowed his head in respect.  He seemed to know who da elf was.<br />
<br />
"Who is dat?" asked Bash?<br />
<br />
"The Glademaster," Treehugger solemnly replied.  "The greatest ranger that ever walked Norrath, it is said.  His time in this world is up and he goes to give his life essence back to the forest."<br />
<br />
Bash looked at da elf.  He no could see what da fuss was about, but kept quiet out of respect.  Dis elf didn't seem as wussy as udder wood elves, he was sure.<br />
<br />
"Glademaster, eh?" said Yessir wit raised eyebrow.  "Sounds like some sort of gardening tool."<br />
<br />
"The Glademaster, it is rumored, has slain over a thousand banshees.  It is said he is immune to their wailing cries.  He has done much for our forests and our heritage."<br />
<br />
Da elf and da thousands of peoples following him marched off into da distance.<br />
<br />
"Come, let's continue our search for the halfling," Treehugger said wiping a tear away.<br />
<br />
Da group was once again following Treehugger along da riverside.  Bash couldn't see how da ranger was paying attention to details at such a pace, but he was somewhat sure da ranger knew what he was doing.<br />
<br />
After a time, da ranger stopped and squatted down to get a better look at someting on da riverbank.<br />
<br />
Da group caught up wit da ranger and looked to see what he was examining.<br />
<br />
Dere, in da sticky mud, was da impprint of a halfling sprawled out face first.</p>

	<p>Treehugger immediately recognized da annoying facial imprint in da mud.  He stood up immediately and stuck his arm straight out in front of him wit palm facing to da side.  He den began to spin slowly.<br />
<br />
"What are you..." a confused Medsa began to ask.<br />
<br />
"Blip..." said da ranger. "Blip... Blip... Blip...." da ranger repeated as he slowly spun in da clockwise direction.  Den, he began saying da word faster as his arm stretched in a southern direction. "Blip Blip Blip Blip..." He finally stopped and was facing a bit southwest. "Bliiiiiiiiiiiip!"<br />
<br />
Da ranger got a smile on his face and den was racing off in da direction at a break-neck pace.<br />
<br />
Da group sighed in frustration.<br />
<br />
"Me wish he would start letting us know when he gonna take off like dat!" exclaimed an irritated Bash.  Da udders agreed and dey all ran off after da ranger.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Dey eventually came upon a copse of trees and saw what dey was looking for.  Dere was Lilting, covered in dried mud, struggling wit all his might to break free of da grip of a large treant.  Da big treant not even seem to notice dat Lilting was trying to get free.<br />
<br />
"Let me go, barkface!" said Lilting.  Da treant not even seem to hear.  She continued to cradle da halfling and rock back and forth while singing her lullabye.<br />
<br />
"Rock a bye baby in the treetops..."<br />
<br />
Da party looked on wit disgust and horror.<br />
<br />
"We've got to save the lad!" said Yessir in a loud whisper.  "I'll go in and slay that thing that reminds of a dragon!"<br />
<br />
"No!" whispered Bash.  "Us not want to fight a treant.  Especially a protective mother-type.  Us need to figure out what to do."<br />
<br />
"She thinks Lilting is her baby?" asked Pyra.<br />
<br />
"It look dat way," said Bash.<br />
<br />
"Well, what should we do?" asked Treehugger.  "I found the guy, but that's pretty much all I'm good for.  I can't fight that thing because I'll get killed!"<br />
<br />
Nobody knew what to do.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Medsa spoke up.  "Why don't we just find her real baby?"  Everyone turned to  da cleric.<br />
<br />
One by one, each party member slapped deir forehead.<br />
<br />
"Ok, let's see if I can track that thing," said Treehugger.  "Radar signals get very jumbly in this area since there are so many crossed frequencies with all the druids around here tracking.  I'd need a general direction."<br />
<br />
Bash looked at where da treant was sitting.  Next to her was a cradle.  By da cradle, where some bird-like footprints dat lead off to da west.<br />
<br />
"Me is no expert tracker," said Bash, "but me is wondering if dose footprints have anyting to do wit da kidnapping?"<br />
<br />
Treehugger looked at da big ogre amiably.  "I think you've got it, Bash!  Let me test it out."<br />
<br />
Da ranger stuck his hand up in da direction da footprints led and said, "Blip Blip Blip Blip Bliiiiiiiip!"  Da ranger smiled.  "Yep!  Let's go!"<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Birdbrain da aviak sat high in his treetop home.  He looked at da treant child and laughed to himself which sounded berry much like clucking.  His partner-in-crime, Egghead, stood closeby scheming.<br />
<br />
"Cluck cluck cluck, BickAww cluck!" said Egghead, which was Aviak for "<i>We're going to be rich!</i>"<br />
<br />
"Cluck!" said Birdbrain, which was aviak for "<i>Darn tootin' we are!  It is conceivable that that treant female will pay handsomely to us whether in gold or magical services!  We shall be kings amongst birds!  Hail to us!  Hail!  Hail!</i>"<br />
<br />
"Cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck, Bickaww, cluck cluck cluck hoot hoot cluck whipperwhil!" said Egghead, which was aviak for "<i>w00t</i>!"<br />
<br />
Just den deir friend Chickenlegs burst into da room at blinding speed.  Slamming da door behind it, da bird began speaking out of breath, "<i>Look out... *pant*... someone is onto our scheme.... *pant*....  they're coming</i>!"<br />
<br />
"<b>CLUCK!</b>" yelled both Egghead and Birdbrain which was aviak for.... well.... me can't say because it not a nice word.  Just know it showed dat dey was both angry and frustrated.<br />
<br />
"<i>How long do we have</i>?!" asked a panicked Egghead.<br />
<br />
He needed no answer.  For just den, someting massive slammed into da door wit a thunderous cracking sound.  Da birds looked at each udder wit eyes wide open in terror.  <br />
<br />
Da wooden door flew apart into many splinters as a giant hammer slammed into it a second time.  A monstrous, naked ogre forced his way into da room and roared.<br />
<br />
"<b>CLUCK!</b>" screamed da three petrified birds.</p>

	<p>Da aviak treehouse was ransacked by da enraged ogre.  Not much was left except all da molted feathers flying around from da many terror stricken aviaks.  Bash even destroyed da stereo system dat was playing da annoying John Tesh music da aviaks seemed to enjoy so much.  Dere was much cheering from all da druids who was camping at da bottom of da treehouse.<br />
<br />
Bash came running back up to da place where Lilting was being held against his will.  He carried someting bundled up in a blanket.  Treehugger looked at ogre and gave him a silent nod.<br />
<br />
Da group watched as Bash went into da clearing, somewhat out of sight of da treant, and unwrapped da blanket.  Dey no could see what was in da blanket from where dey was.<br />
<br />
"Mama!" cried a tiny voice in da direction of Bash.  "Mama!  Mama!"<br />
<br />
"Baby?" a confused mommy treant said.  "Baby?" she said again while looking at Lilting.<br />
<br />
"Mama!" da voice cried.  Bash was sure to get out of da way and headed back to where da party was hiding.<br />
<br />
"Baby!" da big treant screamed while dropping Lilting and running to whatever it was dat Bash brought back.<br />
<br />
Treehugger was quick to run in and snatch da halfling before anyone was da wiser, including Lilting.  <br />
<br />
Da big near-sighted treant screamed wit joy when she found da ting she had been looking for all along.  She picked up her baby and cuddled it close.<br />
<br />
"Mama!" said da baby.<br />
<br />
Da group finally was able to see da treant's child.  It was a baby Hill Giant.  Dey all looked at each udder and shrugged.  At least da baby and mommy was happy once again.  Bash sniffed back a tear.<br />
<br />
"It's about freakin' time!" said a high-strung Lilting.  "Where the Hate were you guys?!  Do you have any idea what the Hate it's like to be snuggled against by a thing whose skin is made of rough bark?!  Gaaah!!"<br />
<br />
"Us is sorry, Lilting," said Bash apologetically.<br />
<br />
"You better be!  And where's your clothes?!  And what was the deal with your hammer?!  And what was...."  Lilting stopped in mid-sentence.  His eyes became distant and glazed.  Without a word, he spun around and bolted away from da party.  Da halfling waved his hands and his feet sped him up even faster.<br />
<br />
Everyone just stared in shock and confusion at da distant halfling.<br />
<br />
"Well, I guess we better follow the idgit," said da Paladin.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Grizzleknot da treant was feeling good today.  He didn't like to venture out into the open much, but today felt different.  He felt alive and good about life.  So much, dat he felt like singing.<br />
<br />
"Doo bee doo bee doo bee dee doo," sang da treant.  "Well it's a doo ba dee doo, I mean a doo ba dee doo, I mean a doo bee doo bee doo bee doo ba dee doo!<br />
<br />
"It's a.... hey!" at dat moment a halfling druid had leapt out of some nearby bushes and attached itself to Grizzleknot's leg.  It den began pounding at da treant wit its fist.<br />
<br />
"Hey now, little britches!  What's the big idea?"  da treant began.  But just as he did, two more halflings came running up from different directions and jumped and landed on an arm and his back.<br />
<br />
"What's going on here?"  <br />
<br />
Four more halflings came running up and jumped and latched on to da treant.  More halflings were seen running up behind dem.<br />
<br />
Grizzleknot was starting to have a hard time standing up wit all da halflings on him.  Dey was grabbing his neck and his waist, everyting.  He started to fall down.  He saw even more halflings coming his way.  One was a little odd, he thought, because it was covered in dried mud.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Da group saw where Lilting had went when dey caught up.  Dere, standing three stories high, was a giant mound of halflings piled on top of each other.<br />
<br />
"How are we going to find him now?!" shouted a frustrated Medsa.  "I say we ditch the guy."<br />
<br />
Just den, da group heard some peoples trotting up behind dem.  A troll, a barbarian, and anudder ogre came lumbering up as fast as dey could.<br />
<br />
"Chococake heard that Grizzleknot was around?" said da barbarian.  "Chococake wrong?  Can you tell Chococake where he is?"<br />
<br />
Da troll looked like it was deep in thought and then pointed to da halfling pile-up.  "Deyz iza ona Grizzy dere!"<br />
<br />
Da ogre, troll, and barbarian ran up to da pile and roared.  All da halflings scattered in every direction like dey was ****roaches when da lights come on.  On da ground, dere was da skeleton of a treant.<br />
<br />
"Ahhhh.... dang it!!!" da three shamen screamed aloud.<br />
<br />
Bash saw da halfling he was looking for running in a direction similar to where he was at.<br />
<br />
"Oh no yous don't!" said da ogre as he grabbed da halfling and hoisted it into da air.  Lilting legs were still moving wit effort like dey not knew it dey wasn't on da ground anymore.<br />
<br />
Lilting had a frenzied look in his eyes and his teeth gritted a piece of bark dat he apparantly had torn from da treant.  <br />
<br />
Bash smacked da halfling upside da head.  Lilting's face returned to normal.  Bash grabbed da bark from his mouth.<br />
<br />
"Sorry about that," said da halfling.  "I don't know what came over me.  I just had this overwhelming urge to..."<br />
<br />
"Save it," said da ogre.  "Right now, us have overwhelming urge to kick yous tiny butt!  Let's get to Halas."<br />
<br />
"Right-o, my boy!" said Sir Yessir.<br />
<br />
And wit dat, dey all followed Yessir to da northwest.</p>

	<p>"Ahhh... we're almost there!" said da paladin.  "I remember this place.  See that cave?  That's the entrance to Splitpaw, which is in turn the entrance to Everfrost, which is in turn the entrance to Halas.  Golly, I remember killing three dragons on this very spot!"<br />
<br />
Pyra looked a little confused.  "Dragons?  Here?  I think you may have been mistaken, sir.  The only things near here that resemble a dragon are the harmless little gecko lizards that run around.  I should know, because I've fried more than...er... I've seen 'em around!"<br />
<br />
"Geck Ko?  Never heard of the beasts.  All I know is that three dragons appeared one day and I slew them!"  Da paladin beamed proudly and as he threw his shoulders back his rusted armor squeaked loudly.  "Erm, we should get moving."<br />
<br />
Bash suddenly got a chill.  It sent shivers down to da berry marrow of his bones.  He wasn't sure why.  Maybe it was a warning dat someting bad was gonna happen.  Maybe it was a ghost of a family member dat was nearby.  Or maybe it was da fact dat he was mostly naked.  Us will never know.<br />
<br />
Da group marched on towards Splitpaws entrance in da distance.  Da sun was beaming high overhead and casting it's rays down upon da party in triumph.  It had only been a week since dey left Freeport and dey were finally near deir destination.  Hopefully, some mysteries would finally be answered.  <br />
<br />
Lilting was feeling much better ever since Bash had dunked him in da river to wash away da mud.  He was feeling especially much better since his clothes finally dried.  He was happy dat he was with such good friends.  Maybe he could prove himself on this journey to his halfling brothers and finally be accepted as a druid and not a fool.  He hoped with all his halfling might.<br />
<br />
Treehugger was hoping he wouldn't get killed today.  He looked down at his swords hanging from his belt.  How he longed for da day he would be able to use them with some amount of skill.  He longed to even be a fraction of da famous warrior swordsman and teacher, Da Geistmeister.  He hoped one day to meet the revered man, but nobody has seen him in over 20 years.  Treehugger's thoughts eventually drifted over to Medsa.<br />
<br />
Da brown-haired cleric was walking slightly in front of and to da side of da ranger.  She pretended not to notice Treehugger looking at her.  She also pretended not to care.  She hid her blushing well.<br />
<br />
Pyra was walking behind everyone else.  Not because she was slow, but mostly because she didn't want anyone to see dat she was setting  trees and plants and anyting else ablaze wit some fireball spells as dey passed dem.  She quietly giggled as she set another tree stump on fire.<br />
<br />
"Here we are!" said Yessir as he stopped at da cave's entrance.  "I'd better go ahead and check to make sure no dragons are lurking just inside the cave entrance.  I've found a few there before.  Wait for me, I'll be right back!"<br />
<br />
Da paladin pulled out his rusted sword and wit a battle cry and armor squeaking and grating loudly, he charged into da cave.  Bash couldn't see how a dragon could fit into da tiny, seven foot cave.  He began to wonder if dis paladin really what he said he was.<br />
<br />
Den da thought disappeared just as it came when Bash felt his hammer grow very, very, warm for an instant and den cool down just as fast.  Almost like it was warning him about someting.  Bash didn't want to take any chances.<br />
<br />
"Yessir, wait!" screamed da ogre. "Don't go..."<br />
<br />
It was too late.  Da paladin vanished from sight as he ran deeply into da cave.  Da group looked at Bash and wondered why he would have yelled what he did.<br />
<br />
Den dey found out why.<br />
<br />
A loud <i>CLANG!</i> was heard and Yessir came flying out of da cave backwards wit tremendous force.  He flew horizontally about 30 feet and den slammed into da ground, unconscious.  Da group just stared wit jaws agape and in shock as dey watched da paladin go limp.<br />
<br />
Den dey heard a very low, growling chuckle come from da cave.  Dey turned and saw two bright, white orbs in da cave moving up and down wit da chuckling.  Da group den saw da orbs move closer and dey heard loud <i>THUD</i> followed by anudder.  Bash saw what da orbs were.  Dey were eyes.<br />
<br />
A fifteen foot tall demon, hunched over, pulled himself out of da cave and stood upright in da noon sun in front of da party.  Sunlight glistened off its red scales and black horns.  Da demon waved its hand and a sword appeared in it.  Da blade was black, so black dat light seemed to be absorbed into it and lost forever.<br />
<br />
Da demon smiled a wicked, evil smile dat bared all his long, sharp teeth.  It pointed its sword right at Bash and den laughed.</p>

	<p>Bash just stared at da demon, frozen in pure terror.  He had never known such fear before.  He could easily see da demon's fangs were stained wit blood while it smiled wickedly.  He watched as da demon unfolded its massive black wings to deir full extension.<br />
<br />
"<b>So you're the one that I've been looking for</b>," da demon said in an otherwordly growl.  "<b>Pity.  I expected you to be much bigger, much more intimidating, and much more.... clothed.  No matter, you will die today in any case.</b>"<br />
<br />
Da demon let out an ear-splitting roar and den charged Bash.  Cloven hooves digging into da ground, da demon moved wit lightning speed towards da ogre.  Killdead slammed his shoulder into da ogre and sent Bash flying into da air.<br />
<br />
Killdead laughed as da ogre landed wit a <i>CRUNCH</i>.  He knew his fun was just starting.<br />
<br />
Pyra screamed at da demon after watching her two friends be tossed about like rag dolls.  She sent two fireballs flying towards da demon.<br />
<br />
Killdead turned just in time to see da balls of flame hurtling towards him.  He did nothing to stop dem.  Da fireballs slammed into his body, and da demon didn't even blink.  Da conjured spheres of fire did not even phase da demon.<br />
<br />
"<b>Fool!  Do you really think such primitive spells could harm me?!  I've let you all live for too long.  Now the killing begins!</b>"<br />
<br />
Da demon ran towards Pyra wit sword raised and ready slam down into da wizardess.  Da demon came into striking distance and swung his sword right towards da lady's head.<br />
<br />
Treehugger came running up behind Pyra and leapt over da wizardess and put both his swords up in a cross formation while in mid-air.  Da demon's sword collided wit da ranger's and it sent da force sent da ranger flying towards da ground.  Treehugger's body slammed partially into Pyra and da wizardess was sent into a daze and laid on da ground.<br />
<br />
But da ranger was quick and jumped to his feet.  He whipped his swords up towards da demon and let out a snarl and his eyes filled wit rage.<br />
<br />
Treehugger called out, "Medsa!  Go tend to Bash and Yessir!  Now!  Lilting, help me take this sucker down!"<br />
<br />
Da cleric quickly nodded and ran off to Bash and Yessir.  Treehugger's eyes never left da demon.  Da demon's eyes stared back, glowing even hotter wit rage.<br />
<br />
"<b>So it will be you who will die first today</b>," da demon growled.  "<b>Tell me ranger, will you still be so courageous when I am torturing your soul for an eternity?</b>"<br />
<br />
"I guess you'll just have to find out!" yelled da ranger as he sliced his shortsword towards da demon.  Da demon blocked it wit his massive black claymore and den swung it  towards da ranger's head.<br />
<br />
Treehugger easily ducked underneath it and rolled towards da demon.  He spun upwards and  chopped at da demon.  His swords bounced off  da demon's scaly hide doing berry little damage.  He leapt back in surprise.<br />
<br />
Da demon grinned at da ranger.  Den it lifted up its sword, roared, and charged.<br />
<br />
Treehugger parried the forthcoming blow and sent two more Killdead's way.  The two combatants were now locked in intricate swordplay.  For every thrust there was a parry.  For every parry, there was a swing.  For every swing, there was a block.  For every hack, there was a dodge.<br />
<br />
Medsa reached Yessir first who was just coming back to consciousness.  He sat up blinking.  Da cleric casted a quick refreshing spell dat let him come to his senses quickly and den she was off towards Bash.  Yessir saw da fight between ranger and demon and immediately stood up.  He ran towards da battle wit rusty sword raised.<br />
<br />
Da demon swung his claymore downwards towards da half-elf again, and Treehugger brought his swords up in an X shape once again.  Da swords banged into each udder, and den just stopped in place.  Killdead pressed downwards on his sword and Treehugger did his best to push back wit his swords.<br />
<br />
Da ranger was losing da test of might.  He was going to be forced off his feet soon.  And probably would have had not a halfling appeared on da back of Killdead.<br />
<br />
Lilting climbed up da demon's backside quickly and stood on its shoulders.  Den da lil guy screamed, "Booot to the head!" and kicked da side of da demon's head wit all his halfling might.  Dis distracted da demon enough to let Treehugger jump away from da demon.<br />
<br />
Killdead howled wit rage and grabbed da halfling wit his free hand and tossed Lilting away from him.  Da halfling floated gently to da ground.  Treehugger sprang back into the demons range wit swords flailing.<br />
<br />
Medsa reached Bash and revived him wit a spell.  Bash sat up and blinked.  He saw da battle his friends were having wit da demon.  His friends were losing.  He didn't know what to do.  <br />
<br />
"What are we going to do, Bash?!" pleaded a frightened Medsa.  <br />
<br />
"Me no know," said Bash wit a frown.  "Me no kn...." Bash's hammer flared and became hot to da touch again.  It glowed a brilliant white.  "Wait.... me have idea."<br />
<br />
Da demon's sword nicked da ranger now and den spilling bits of da ranger's blood here and dere.  Nothing worse dan scratches, da ranger was skilled at avoidance.  Treehugger did his  best to dish out as much damage as he was taking, but da demon's scaly hide prevented him from causing much hurt to Killdead.<br />
<br />
Pyra started to come out of her daze and turned to see Treehugger locked in combat wit da demon.  Da ranger's swords were moving so fast dat dey was just a blur.  She started to stand up to try and help.<br />
<br />
Yessir ran as hard as he could.  He hoped he could get to Treehugger as quickly as possible to lend some muscle to their side.  He saw da two swordmasters in a perpetual dance.  If he could just get dere quick enough...<br />
<br />
Treehugger started to feel the strength leave his body.  Da toll of his fighting began to set in.  Killdead noticed his opponent was becoming slower.  He knew his chance was coming soon.  It was inevitable, he knew.  No mortal could ever hope to defeat him.<br />
<br />
Treehugger swung into da demon one more time.  Killdead swung his sword wide and hard and forced Treehugger's own swords to swing wide.  His midsection exposed, da demon swung his free hand and clawed at da ranger.  Treehuggers stomach was split wide open.<br />
<br />
Da rangers eyes went wide and just stared into da distance.  Da demon smiled.  Da ranger fell to his knees, still staring at nothing.  His swords fell to da ground, and den da ranger fell over backwards.<br />
<br />
Medsa turned to see Treehugger just as he fell to da grass limply.  She screamed.  "<b>NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!</b>"</p>

	<p>Bash no could believe what he saw.  One of his friends just dropped to da ground dead.  He knew dat it would happen again and again if he no did anyting.  He grabbed Medsa and picked her up and ran to where da demon was.<br />
<br />
Yessir made finally made it to da demon.  Out of breath, he took off his bucket-helmet and threw it to da ground.  Da old man's grey hair was sticking out in every direction.  His eyes were filled wit rage.<br />
<br />
"Ok, demonspawn," spat da paladin.  "Let's see you fight me when I'm expecting ye!"<br />
<br />
Da demon turned his attention from da limp ranger to da paladin.  Da demon licked da blood from his hand and den grinned at Yessir.  "<b>Looks like my belly will be rather full tonight</b>!"<br />
<br />
Yessir charged wit rusted sword raised and trash-can shield held high above his head.  But as he ran underneath da demon, he did what nobody, not even da demon expected.  He jumped high into da air and spun in da air to  deliver a roundhouse kick to da demon's face.  He landed on da ground wit sword poised ready to strike.<br />
<br />
Killdead's head twisted to da side wit da blow of da paladin's foot.  He slowly turned back to da paladin wit a look of amazement and puzzlement.<br />
<br />
Yessir grinned.  Den he swung madly at da demon.  Another swordfight bewtween mortal and demon ensued.<br />
<br />
Da demon didn't see da ogre approach.  Bash pointed to where Treehugger lay.  "Heal him," da ogre said to da cleric.<br />
<br />
"I can't!  He's... he's dead!" cried Medsa.<br />
<br />
"Heal him!  Heal him now!  You can do it.  Me know yous can.  Me need him alive for plan to work."<br />
<br />
"I'll.... I'll try."  da cleric said wit a sob and went to da ranger.<br />
<br />
Bash felt da heat from his hammer more intensely.  It kept getting hotter.  He approached da dazed halfling and wizardess.  "Ok yous two... listen up, us not have much time."<br />
<br />
Medsa knelt down next to Treehugger.  She saw da wound da ranger suffered was deep and gaping indeed.  She choked back her tears.  Da rangers eyes stared blankly at da sky above and his hands still clutched tightly to his swords.<br />
<br />
Medsa just wanted to leave dis awful, awful place.  Run away from all dese emotions dat appeared from nowhere.  Fear, hate, mourning, and... love.  She knew she couldn't dough.  Her friends needed her.  Bash needed her.  Treehugger needed her.  She mustered up her courage and placed her hands six inches above da ranger's wound.<br />
<br />
Yessir did his best to block da demon's attacks, but he was nowhere near da fighter dat Treehugger was and he knew it.  "If this thing were only a dragon..." da paladin muttered out of breath.  It was only a matter of time before da demon overtook him.<br />
<br />
White light flared from Medsa's hands.  It grew brighter until encompassed both her and Treehugger.  Her face contorted and strained wit pain and concentration.  Da light grew so bright dat she no could see anyting anymore.  She put all of her energy she had into dis spell.  All of her hope, all of her mind,....and all of her heart.  "Come back to me...... please...."  Den she screamed from da pain da spell demanded of her.<br />
<br />
Da light disappeared.<br />
<br />
Da light distracted da demon for a moment as he looked to see where da source of it was coming from.  It was all Yessir needed.  Da paladin stabbed his sword into da demon's wing and tore downwards, ripping da leathery wing open.<br />
<br />
Da demon roared in pain and anger.  It kicked da paladin square in da chest and sent him flying.<br />
<br />
Medsa collapsed from fatigue.  Da spell had drained her.  Treehugger just lay there, motionless still.  Medsa wailed for her lost friend.  She did not know what else dere was to do.<br />
<br />
Da ranger'ss eyes continued to stare into nothingness.  Until, dat is, dey blinked.  His eyes blinked once more.  He turned his head to da prone cleric.  "Hey.... baby," da ranger rasped.  "Couldn't stand to.... be without me for..... two minutes, huh?"</p>

	<p>Medsa laughed as tears of relief streamed down her face.  She did her best to try and hide her joy, but it didn't work too well.  "Shut up, worm!" she tried to say wit a scowl.  "Bash.... Bash needs you to fight...." da cleric was growing weaker.  She needed to rest badly.  "Can you.... can you fight?"<br />
<br />
Da ranger sat up.  He looked at his torn armor and saw dat a scar was now visible where da demon and ripped him open.  "I think I can.  I believe I owe a certain demon some steel."  And wit dat, da ranger leapt to his feet.<br />
<br />
Medsa smiled and den passed out.<br />
<br />
Da demon stomped up to da paladin on da ground.  It raised it sword to strike at da old man.  It was about to swing until it felt  someting tapping its shoulder.  Killdead turned his head to see what it was.<br />
<br />
"Hiyas," said Bash.  "Remember me?"  Da ogre slammed his hammer into da side of da demon's skull.  Da demon spun about in a 360.  It came to a stop and shook off da daze.  It roared.<br />
<br />
"Yeah yeah, me heard dat before."  Bash stabbed his hammer into da demon's chest and Killdead staggered for a second.  It den raised it's sword in a flash and began swinging at da ogre.<br />
<br />
"Pyra, NOW!" da ogre screamed.  Off to da side, da wizardess began summoning fire from out of nowhere dat collected around her hands.  It accumulated into da largest fireball she ever cast.  She sent it reeling towards da ogre and demon.<br />
<br />
"<b>Foolish ogre</b>," da demon growled.  "<b>Have you learned nothing yet?  Such a spell cannot harm me</b>!"<br />
<br />
"It not for you," said Bash calmly.  "It for me."<br />
<br />
Da fireball slammed into da ogre.  Flames arced all around Bash, but none of it touched him.  Bash's hammer took all da fire in like it was hungry for it.  Flames swirled and swooped into da hammer.  Da demon furrowed his brow in confusion as it looked down at da flashing orange hammer.  Da next ting it saw was da hammer slamming into its torso.<br />
<br />
The sound of a thunderbolt ripped through da air as da hammer struck.  A ring of fire spread outwards and da demon went flying straight back.  Killdead slammed into da rock wall right next to da mouth of da cave.  It fell over in a lump on da ground.  <br />
<br />
Bash grinned.<br />
<br />
Yessir got up and shook his head violently to  regain his senses.  He trotted up next to Bash.  Treehugger arrived seconds later.<br />
<br />
"Is it dead?" da ranger asked.<br />
<br />
"Probably not," said Bash.<br />
<br />
Da ogre was right.  Killdead got onto his feet.  It did not look happy.  But it did look like it had been hurt.<br />
<br />
"Guys, us need to fight it at da same time," said Bash.  "Charge!"<br />
<br />
Da three of dem went at da demon.  Killdead did his best to deflect a blow, but as soon as he blocked one, anudder sword or hammer slammed into his body.  Treehugger jumped into da air, did a flip, slammed his swords into da demons shoulders, and den leapt off da demon's back pulling his swords wit him.<br />
<br />
Killdead was losing, and he knew it.  Da hammer-fire dat slammed into him hurt him more dan he thought any mortal weapon ever could.  But he had a few tricks up his sleeve yet.<br />
<br />
Da demon arced his back and roared. He became surrounded by a red flame.  He seemed stronger.  His wounds seemed to heal, and his tear in his wing sealed up.  Da flames went away and da demon smiled.<br />
<br />
He den attacked wit a ferocity dat dey had never seen before.  Bash expected da demon would not be easy to defeat.<br />
<br />
"Lilting, us need dat teleport now!  It is distracted!  Cast it now!"<br />
<br />
Da halfling was waiting for da ogre to say so.  He began his spell.<br />
<br />
Bash fought as hard as he could.  He knew Treehugger and Yessir were giving it deir best as well.  He just had to keep da demon from disrupting da halfling so Lilting could evacuate dem away from da demon and maybe dey could hide from it until dey could figure out how to destroy it.<br />
<br />
Lilting waved his hands some more.  He knew his teleport spell would take several moments to cast.  Da halfling it was up to him now.  He had an idea.  He spoke da magical words, "Woodland spirits, my voice hear it.  Come down from above, and give me the power to teleport with love!"  <br />
<br />
Da halfling's hands spewed forth blue sparks.  But instead of pointing dem at himself and his friends, he pointed dem at da demon.<br />
<br />
"Lilting!  What is you doing?!" yelled Bash.  "What is you....?" his words were cut short as he watched what happened.<br />
<br />
Da demon looked at da halfling wit puzzlement.  His body became surrounded by da blue sparks.  "<b>Fool!  What do you think you will accomplish?  You cannot get rid of me on this mortal plane!  I can find you from anywhere on this world!  I can....</b>" da demon's voice started to fade.  Da demon started phase out of dis area.<br />
<br />
Da sparks swirled around da demon faster and faster and den da demon and da sparks disappeared all together.<br />
<br />
"Lilting!" said Bash.  "Dat was great!  But he'll back... he said...."<br />
<br />
"Don't worry guys," shouted da halfling.  "Trust me, he's not coming back.  I call that my 'Reverse Port'." Lilting winked.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Killdead opened his eyes.   He found it hard to see because of all da bright light around him.  White light seemed to permeate da area all around him.  His eyes started to adjust and he saw dat he was standing on some cotton-like clouds.  His eyes adjusted further and he saw houses all around him made out of da same cloud-like material.<br />
<br />
A gnome in a white robe appeared from one of da buildings and saw da demon.  "Brothers and sisters!" da gnome called out.  "Come!  See!  A new friend!"<br />
<br />
Da demon raised one eyebrow.  He saw hundreds of gnomes, dwarves, and halflings pour out of all da buildings around him.<br />
<br />
"He looks like he needs a hug!" da first gnome said.<br />
<br />
"Yes!  Yes!  Hug!  Hug!" all da udders started to say cheerily around da demon.<br />
<br />
Da demon was suddenly filled wit terror and dread.  He knew where he was.<br />
<br />
One halfling came and hugged Killdead's leg.  Den anudder followed.  Da demon screamed in fright.  He knew where he was indeed.  A place he never hoped to see.  Da Plane of Love.<br />
<br />
More and more little peoples piled onto da demon.  "We love you!  We love you!" da all started chanting wit happiness.<br />
<br />
Da demon was toppled by so many of da little guys piling onto him.  He screamed again.  He began clawing at da ground to try and get away.  It was useless as he became swarmed.<br />
<br />
Killdead screamed in horror one last time before it was muffled.  Da demon disappeared under a huge pile of one big group hug of small peoples.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
In his castle, Smellybreath's eyes snapped open from meditation.  Da goblin looked at da big black knight standing by his side.<br />
<br />
"There has been a change in plans.  The demon has failed."</p>

	<p>Emerging from da other side of da cave, da party just stared in wonder and awe.  Dey had never seen snow before. Well, none but Yessir, who recounted tales of how he slew three snow dragons in one single day.<br />
<br />
Snow covered everyting in dis mountain canyon dey was in.  Rocks, trees, mountains, nothing was untouched by dis cold, white substance.  <br />
<br />
"The one thing I don't get," said Lilting, "Is that how can it get so cold over here when it's like 80 degrees just on the other side of the cave?"<br />
<br />
"Shhhh!" da party shushed.<br />
<br />
"Or what about that desert we went through," da halfling started again, "How did it go from hot humid swamp to dry arid desert  in just a blink?"<br />
<br />
"Shhh! Da gods might hear you!" Bash said.  Da last person he knew dat questioned da gods was an ogre shadowknight friend of his.  He had questions and sought answers, but one day he woke up wit no intelligence.  Dey said he only had enough brain cells to breathe, eat, and blink.  Bash never forgot his friend whose name was Nurphed.<br />
<br />
While pondering on his friend Nurphed and anudder friend who had disappeared from dis world altogether, Bannedfur Good, someting hit da ogre like a ton of troll casserole.  It was cold!  It was berry cold outside!  Freakin' cold!  Bash was suddenly berry aware  of his naked ogre body.  He started to freeze all over, from his head, to his feet, to his jumblies*.<br />
<br />
"Guys..." Bash said shivering, "Dis starting to suck.  Me need clothes!  Bad!  Let's get to dis Halas place soon!"<br />
<br />
Yessir lead da way through the cold slush and ice.  Overhead da clouds moved in and blocked out da afternoon sun.  It den began to snow.<br />
<br />
Dey came upon a fork in da canyon road.  Yessir became puzzled.<br />
<br />
"Hmmm.  I don't remember this place having a fork in the road." da paladin mentioned confusedly while rubbing his stubbly chin.  "Hmmm.  Maybe we'll go this way."<br />
<br />
And da party took da right fork.  Dey came upon anudder fork shortly after.  And anudder.  And anudder.<br />
<br />
"This place wasn't this maze-like before!" da paladin exclaimed.  But den he asked himself under his breath, "Was it?"<br />
<br />
Da party was so turned around dat dey didn't even know which was up anymore.  No sun could tell dem where north was, and da only tings Treehugger and Lilting could track was demselves.  Finally, dey came out in a big snowy clearing.  About a hundred yards ahead dey saw a gigantic frozen river.<br />
<br />
Bash's skin was now purple.  He was so cold his brain started to tink he was warm.  His whole body was numb.  He just wanted to lay down and go to sleep.  Den he saw two figures wave at him from a distance.  He didn't know if dey was real or not.  Da figures den started running towards him and he finally saw who it was.<br />
<br />
"Nnnnn.... Nnnnnn....." Bash chattered trying to talk.<br />
<br />
"What is it, Bash?" asked Medsa.<br />
<br />
"Nnnnnn.... Nnnnneeee...." da ogre tried to say.<br />
<br />
"What do you see?" asked Pyra.<br />
<br />
Da party strained to see what Bash saw.  Several seconds later dey saw da figures for demselves.<br />
<br />
"Nnnnnn.... Nnnnnecro!"<br />
<br />
Up came running a snow-covered Philiac followed by his skeleton friend Jakontiklarkiak.<br />
<br />
"Hi guys!" da gnome said cheerily.  "Cold enough for you?"<br />
<br />
Da skeleton just waved at da group.<br />
<br />
Bash wanted to pick up da gnome and chomp him, but he was too cold to even do dat.  So he just gritted his teeth in a big grimace.<br />
<br />
"I was studying how snow looks, so that, you know, when Hate freezes over I'll be sure to know!  You remember our deal, right?"<br />
<br />
Bash just grimaced some more.  <i>Tink happy thoughts, Bash.  Tink happy, warm thoughts.</i> thought da ogre.<br />
<br />
"Oh yeah!  I almost forgot!  Come see what I found!  Hurry!" da gnome was off running back towards da frozen river.<br />
<br />
Da skeleton shrugged at da party and was off running after his master.  Da group slowly and reluctantly followed.<br />
<br />
Bash couldn't keep up wit da group.  His limbs were almost gelatin.  He saw his friends step out onto da river and look dowanrds at to someting Phil was pointing at.  Den dey looked up at Bash, and den back down at da ice.<br />
<br />
"Bash," shouted Lilting, "I think you better come look at this."<br />
<br />
Bash made it to da river and looked to see what everyone was staring at.  He looked down.<br />
<br />
Dere, frozen in da ice wit eyes open wide and  mouth in a timeless scream, was an ogre dat appeared to look just like his brother Smash.<br />
<br />

	<p>Bash just stared at da frozen ogre wit puzzlement and shock.  Could dis be his brudder?  Could dis be...<br />
<br />
"Smash?" da big ogre asked quietly to da ice-ting.  Obviously, it no responded.<br />
<br />
Bash's friends just watched silently.  Dey felt sorry for da big guy.<br />
<br />
"Smash!" shouted Bash.  "Help me get him out of here!  Please!"<br />
<br />
"Bash," said Medsa, "I'm still very weak from healing Treehugger.  Even if you got him out I don't think..."<br />
<br />
"Us have to try!  Please help me get him out here!"<br />
<br />
Shivering from being almost frozen to the bone and also from being so shaken up over seeing his brudder, Bash lifted up his hammer and began slamming it into da ice.  He repeatedly hacked away trying to break up da thick, frozen sheet.<br />
<br />
Lilting pulled out his tiny, tiny, ultra-tiny dagger and ran up beside Bash.  He bent down and started chipping away at the ice to help his big friend.  <br />
<br />
Phil joined in too.  He came up next to Bash and started jumping up and down on the ice in the hopes to break through. Following his master's lead Jakontiklarkiak started jumping up and down alongside the gnome.<br />
<br />
Da rest of da group sighed and started helping deir friend.  Everyone was chipping away what dey could.  Da person who gave da most help was Pyra.  She sent out a stream of flame dat spewed forth from her fingers like a blow-torch.  Da ice started to melt away quickly.<br />
<br />
Bash noticed da ice around da ogre was melted enough.  Slush covered da face of what he thought may be his brudder.  He signaled everyone to stop.  He took his big hand and brushed away da snow-cone like ice remains and took a look at what dey uncovered.  Bash began to sob.<br />
<br />
What appeared to have been an ogre trapped in ice was nothing more than a large, brown rock.  Everyone's eyes went downward feeling bad for da ogre.  Dey knew he missed his brudder very much.<br />
<br />
"Me should have known," sniffled Bash.  "Me should have known he not be here.  Why would Smash go to Halas?  Why would..."<br />
<br />
Da ogre stopped.  He looked to his side and noticed dat Phil was still hopping up and down like mad.<br />
<br />
"We'll get that ogre out!  We'll get him!" da gnome chanted as he leapt up and down and slamming as much force into da ice as his tiny body would let him.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, da ice underneath Bash's feet began to crack.<br />
<br />
"We'll get your brother out Smash!" said da necromancer.  "Don't worry!"<br />
<br />
Treehugger saw what was happening.  "Phil!  Stop!  Don't jump anymore!"  Da ranger just looked on as da gnome didn't seem to hear him and da ice began to crack some more.<br />
<br />
"Stop, Phil!  Stop" each person started scream.<br />
<br />
"Don't worry guys!" da gnome said again unaware of da warnings being shout at him.  "I'll rescue that ogre! I'll...."<br />
<br />
Da ice underneath Bash and Philiac gave out.  Both the gnome and the ogre were immediately plunged into da icy river.  Da party just stared in surprise and horror as dey saw da forms of deir friend and gnome acquaintence get pulled underneath da ice by da river's strong current.  Da two bodies could be seen moving at a great speed under da thick ice sheet dat covered da rest of da river.<br />
<br />
Jakontiklarkiak looked at da group, shrugged, and den hopped into da newly made ice-hole.<br />
<br />
"Now that," Sir Yessir said, "Is why I'll never group with a necro.  They never listen."<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Bash's mind was racing.  He knew he was being pulled somewheres at an alarming speed.  He knew he was in someting berry, berry cold.  And he knew dat if he tried to breathe, he would die.<br />
<br />
He tried his best to grab onto someting as his body zoomed by large, icy, underwater outcroppings.  His hands were so numb dey couldn't get a firm hold onto any of da slippery surfaces.<br />
<br />
He eventually gave up trying to struggle and faced da fact dat he was gonna die.  He prayed dat his brudder would one day find his way back to Oggok.  He prayed dat Smash had found Smellybreath and bashed him real good.  He started pray some more when his body slammed into someting berry hard.<br />
<br />
Bash realized he had come upon a rocky bank.  He mustered what strength he had and tried to climb out of da river.  He plopped himself onto da stony ground, sat up and realized he was in an underwater cave.  Not five feet away fom him was Philiac lying unconscious, face-first in da gravelly rock.  Bash sneered at da gnome.<br />
<br />
Den da ogre felt someting hot on da back of his neck.  Bash spun his head around and saw, just inches from his face, da muzzle of da biggest, meanest, white-est, bear he ever saw.  Three times da size of da ogre, it was.<br />
<br />
Da bear roared at Bash.  Our hero, overcome with fear, fatigue, and hypothermia, passed out.</p>

	<p>"The time has come, my Elemental Guardians," Smellybreath said while standing atop his small altar, "To set in motion my grand design.  You four are but the first step."<br />
<br />
Da four black knights stood motionless in front of da goblin wizard.  Each of deir swords glowing as brightly as da day dey was created was in each knight's hand.  Fire, Ice, Earth, and Air these dark warriors were named and deir bladed weapons glowed brightly da color of each respected element.  If dey could speak or not, only Smellybreath knew.  If dere was actually someting inside da ebony armours, only da goblin knew.<br />
<br />
"It was very difficult in acquiring these, but well worth it.  Here, each of you take one."<br />
<br />
Da goblin reached into a pouch he had on his belt and pulled out a single, polished, shiny, black, oval-shaped stone.  Da stone had a single white rune symbol on it.  He handed it to da first and biggest black knight, Fire.  Da black knight closed his fist around da stone and stood back at attention.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath den did da same for da udder knights until each had a single stone of deir own.  Da goblin grinned wickedly when his presents were passed out.<br />
<br />
"Now, using these stones is simple.  If you trace the rune one way with your left index finger, it will teleport you to a destination I have predetermined for each.  If you trace it the opposite way, it will teleport you back here.  Any questions?"<br />
<br />
Da knights just stood stock still, full helmets just staring straight ahead at da goblin.  Smellybreath chuckled to himself.<br />
<br />
"Good.  Now, go.  And when you arrive at your  destinations unleash vengence.  <b><i>My</i> vengence!!</b>"<br />
<br />
Eeach knight simultaneously banged deir clenched sword hand against deir breastplates.  Da room was filled wit a resonating <i>CLANG!</i>  Each knight put deir swords in deir magical scabbards and den traced da different patterns on deir stones.<br />
<br />
A whirlwind of colors swarmed around each individual knight.  Then colored lines raced up and down each of deir bodies.  A bright flash briefly appeared and den each knight was gone.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath smiled evilly, each pointed tooth clearly visibile in da light of da torches surrounding his altar. <br />
<br />
"And so begins the prophecy..." da goblin said to himself.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
<br />
"What should we do?!" pleaded Lilting.  "We can't go after them!"  Da halfiling looked across where da frozen river ran where he saw his ogre friend disappear out of sight.  Lilting sniffled back some tears.<br />
<br />
"I....  I don't know." said Treehugger.  Frustration, anger, and sorrow welled up inside da ranger.  He slammed his sword deeply into da ice out of rage.<br />
<br />
"There isn't a thing we can do, lad." da old paladin said.  "But that doesn't mean there isn't a thing <i>anyone</i> can do about it.  Let's go talk to the barbarians.  They skinny dip in this thing all the time, like it's some sort of test of manhood.  I bet they may know where Bash ended up."<br />
<br />
"Test of manhood," snorted Medsa.  "Sounds more like a test of idiocy."<br />
<br />
"You'll find that those two things are often one and the same, my dear lady." Yessir said wit a smile.  "Come, I think I can remember the way to Halas.  Follow me."<br />
<br />
And wit dat, Yessir trekked off into da snowy hills wit da group in tow.</p>

	<p>Dan YellSan was one of da best monks in his class.  He lived in Qeynos wit all da udder monks.  He spent many years training berry hard to get where he is today.  He mastered every move dere is in da Book of Chan, da monks' bible.  He most recently mastered da "Hold Fists in Front of Self, Shiver and Shake With Rage, and Scream Waaaah!" technique.  He currently waited in the "Room of Patience" just outside his master's dojo.<br />
<br />
Dan YellSan's sensai, Mee YahGee, was quite proud of his student.  Today, in his dojo, he  was going to present da black belt to his finest pupil.  He was quite confident dat Dan YellSan could face any opponent and be victorious.  This was the price of 25 years of hard work, training, discipline, and doing odd jobs for Mee YahGee.<br />
<br />
"Dan YellSan, come here!" shouted Mee YahGee while he stood in da middle of da wooden dojo.<br />
<br />
Dan came running and bowed before his teacher.  He stood up and met his sensai eye to eye.<br />
<br />
"Show me, San-Do-Floor!" exclaimed Mee YahGee.  Dan started spinning his arms in huge concentric circles.  Mee started quietly giggling.  Dan YellSan always fell for that and still believed it was of any use in da battlefield.<br />
<br />
"Dan YellSan, you have achieved great rank amongst the monks.  You are deserving of this."  Da old man held up a folded belt of black color.<br />
<br />
"Thank you sensai," said Dan wit a bow.  "I will do my best to...."<br />
<br />
Dan YellSan was cut off by screaming outside.  He and his sensai looked at each other and immediately bolted to da door and went outside.  If dere was someting looking for trouble, dey was gonna find it wit Dan YellSan and Mee YahGee.<br />
<br />
What dey saw horrified dem.  Da streets were completely covered red wit running blood.  A dark figure was slashing monks left and right and ripping through dem like dey was tissue paper.  To get to udder peoples, it would crash through houses and den throw limp bodies outside.<br />
<br />
Da dark figure came closer to where Dan and Mee stood.  It slashed more monks along da way until it stood right in front of Dan YellSan.<br />
<br />
"Dan YellSan!" shouted Mee YahGee, "The Crane!  If do right, no can defense!"<br />
<br />
Dan nodded and put his arms up in a 'Y' formation and lifted one foot off da ground.  Whoever dis ting was, Dan was sure it finally would pay for da deaths of his friends.<br />
<br />
Da dark being looked at Dan and den swung its  sword downward towards da young monk.  Dan YellSan was split into two symmetrical vertical pieces.<br />
<br />
Mee YahGee just stared in disbelief. "But... but he did right...  No can defense!"<br />
<br />
Mee YahGee looked at da big black ting in front of him.  He could see dat it was a knight, at least seven feet tall.  His eyes trained downward to da bright, glowing, white sword da knight held.  Mee YahGee took up an offensive stance.  It was time to show dis ting what an old monk can do.<br />
<br />
Da big knight made no advance on da monk.  Instead, it thrust its sword downward into da ground.  A blast of hot air shot out from all around da knight.<br />
<br />
Da wave of air slammed into Mee YahGee, instantly ripping him apart.  Da air continued outward from da knight totally destroying anyting, building or person, in its path.  Da blast wave died out about one hundred feet from da knight.<br />
<br />
Air, da black knight, pulled his sword from da ground and turned around to continue his carnage.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Norrath had just begun to feel da wrath of Smellybreath by his guardians.  Da black knight, Earth, was seen ripping apart da underground dwarf city of Kaladim.  No dwarf was safe from dat black knight as he chopped, sliced, and fileted dwarves by da dozens.  Occasionally da knight would cause massive earthquakes dat brought many of da beautiful earthen structures down killing many more.<br />
<br />
Ice was seen in da High Elven city of Felwithe.  Elves were instantly frozen in deir tracks and den shattered into millions of tiny pieces wit a swing of a sword or a punch of a black gauntlet.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath could feel his anger manifested through his guardians as each scream echoed in his tiny, green ears.  He could feel each soul taken away from the mortal plane.  Da prophecy da goblin knew about was indeed coming to pass.  He would make everyone pay for what dey did to him.<br />
<br />
Soon, he would become so powerful that none would be able to stop him.  This he knew, and this he planned.</p>

	<p>"Halt!" shouted a voice from behind Ice.  Da black knight had been continuing his razing of Felwithe for several hours uninterrupted... until now dat is.  Da black knight pulled its giant sword out of his latest high elf kill and turned to face dis nuisance.<br />
<br />
"I am Orclous Calbane!" shouted an elf decked out in fine armor,dat glowed wit magic power, and held two swords dat looked like dey was looted from a powerful dragon's hoarde.  Standing next to him and behind him were several scores of powerful looking peoples of all races and classes.  Wizards, warriors, rangers, magicians, necromancers, monks, everyting.  "Prepare to die, foul fiend!  For all seventy of us are level 62 or higher!  We have destroyed gods and dragons alike in multiple different planes!  You'll soon be nothing but dust in the wind!  Have at you!"<br />
<br />
Da huge group of "high level" peoples charged da black knight holding da glowing blue sword.  Da knight just ****ed its helmeted head in curiosity as da peoples came rushing towards him.<br />
<br />
About thirty seconds later Ice walked away from a berry bloody, destroyed section of town.  In his left hand he held da head of "Orclous Calbane," da idiot elf who thought he and his buddies could kill da Elemental Guardian.  Da knight shook his head and den tossed da elf's noggin behind him as he went deeper into da city to do some more killing and destroying.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
<br />
Bash began to awaken from a deep, unconscious slumber.  His body hurt too much to move, and he couldn't feel much in terms of his arms and legs.  Da ogre tried to open his eyes, but it only hurt to do so.  He found he was able to squint witout da pain being so bad.<br />
<br />
He saw dat he was lying on his back.  He also noticed dat a single torch was attached to da wall near his head.  It didn't give off a tremendous amount of light, but it was enough to hurt his eyes further.  He saw dat da wall and floor around him was made of rock and ice.  And since da light no hit da ceiling, and since his breathing echoed loudly, he could only guess he was in a huge cavern.  Anyting beyond dat, da light would not penetrate.<br />
<br />
Bash tried to sit up but found he was berry much unable to do so.  He got his head up a couple feet before he felt completely spent of energy and had to plop back down.  He was berry tired and berry sore.  He was able to see dat somone had put some blankets and straw over da ogre to keep him warm while he slept.<br />
<br />
Bash was confused.  He tried to tink of da tings dat happened before he blacked out.  He remembered floating along da raging river.  He remembered da passed out gnome.  He remembered....  he remembered.... he almost remembered someting else when he heard sounds of footsteps.<br />
<br />
Da light from da torch no would let Bash see what was going beyond da length of his make-shift bed.  But he could tell dat da footsteps were entering da same cavern he was in.  Bash's ringing ears were able to distinguish two different patterns of footprints.  One set was light, and da udder... da udder set was...<br />
<br />
"So, the promising ogre has awakened" a berry, berry deep but comforting and somewhat  famliar voice spoke.  "I am glad to see you are not dead."<br />
<br />
Da sound of da lighter footsteps began to walk around his bed as da voice spoke.  "I knew you would come, just as you did.  Just as <i>he</i> did.  I expect there are many questions you must have.  I will do my best to answer what I can."<br />
<br />
"Where is me?" asked Bash in a raspy voice.  It felt like he no used his voice box in ages.<br />
<br />
Da deep voice chuckled, but in a non-threatening or mean way.  "You're deep underground.  Beneath the frozen, icy fields of Permafrost.  Below the barbarian city of Halas."<br />
<br />
"Where..... where is me friends...?"<br />
<br />
"They go to seek the help of the primitives...er... barbarians as you call them, for their help in rescuing you.  It is too bad they do not have the gift, for they would know you are in far safer hands than one could imagine.<br />
<br />
"You have spent your time searching for a certain person, Bash.  You have faced many dangers and acquired powerful allies into finding the one who can guide you along your path.  Your grandfather knew you would find that person.  And now you have.  You have found... me."<br />
<br />
"And..." Bash wheezed, "Who are you?"<br />
<br />
A larger-dan-average gold-tinted skeleton stepped out of da shadows.  It stood next to Bash.  Bash looked at da ting in curiosity.  He wasn't expecting a skeleton to be da ting he had been looking for.<br />
<br />
Bash den heard a louder, heavier set of footsteps come closer to him.  Out of da darkness emerged da biggest, white-est bear Bash had ever seen.  <br />
<br />
Da bear began speaking and Bash recognized da voice as da one he'd just been listening to.<br />
<br />
"I am the oracle."<br />
<br />
Bash, unable to stay awake any longer, let his head fall backwards and den slipped back into a deep rest.<br />
<br />
"Rest now," said da bear.  "All will be revealed in good time."</p>

	<p>Bash's eyes snapped open.  He no knew how long he been asleep.  Last ting he remembered was some weird dream about a talking polar bear and freaky looking skeleton.  Bash heard and felt a deep, earth-shaking rumble.  His whole body shook wit da sound.  Da ogre immediately sat straight up.<br />
<br />
Bash saw dat he was in da same cavern from his dream.  Da torch, da bed, da ice, da cavern, all was da same.  Da deep rumbling sound came again and he shook even more fiercely dis time.  Bash pinpointed da sound to have originated from his stomach.  It was den dat he realized dat he was famished.  Da big ogre no could remember da last time he ate.<br />
<br />
Bash heard some footsteps enter da room he was in.  Wading out of da darkness was da bigger-dan-average skeleton holding a huge dinner tray.  It set it down next to da ogre's bed and den raised its hand in a "thumb's up" postion to da ogre.<br />
<br />
Bash was so hungry he no cared about anyting anymore.  He grabbed da tray and pulled off da tin lid.  He set da tray on his lap and looked at was steaming on top of it.<br />
<br />
Lying on its stomach, apple in mouth, was a gnome dat had been roasted to perfection wit a light lemon glaze.  Bash began devouring da  wonderful looking meal.  About halfway through, he looked at da skeleton.<br />
<br />
"Ish dish..." da ogre tried to say wit a mouthful of gnome, but den swallowed.  "Is dis Philiac?"<br />
<br />
Da deep voice Bash remembered from his dream all of a sudden boomed throughout da room.  "The annoying necromancer?  No, that's not him.  Though, that isn't a bad idea."<br />
<br />
Bash heard da big footsteps come from da direction of da voice.<br />
<br />
"I see you've regained much strength since we last spoke.  Excellent.  Now we can discuss what it is we need to discuss."  Da footsteps came closer and den da voice said, "Lights!"<br />
<br />
Da whole cavern lit up brightly.  Bash squinted his eyes in slight pain, but dey adjusted quickly enough.  He saw da big bear and da skeleton as plain as day standing next to him in da most beautiful, wondrous ice cavern Bash knew he would ever see.<br />
<br />
"We haven't much time," said da bear.  "Swallow your last bit of dinner, and follow me."<br />
<br />
Da bear, on all four legs, led Bash down some windy tunnels dat were carved out of da ice.  Da ogre walked alongside da bear dat was at least twice his size.  Da skeleton followed behind da two.<br />
<br />
"Who is you?  What is you?" asked Bash.<br />
<br />
"I'm a bear, nothing more.  Just smarter than your average bear, I suppose.  I have many names.  To some I am called the Glacier Bear.  To others I am the White Death.  To many orcs I am known as "Squish Squish Run Away From Squish Squish."  And to a very, very small group of extremely special people, I am  known as The Oracle."<br />
<br />
"Yous is da glacier bear?!  But, isn't yous pelt needed for da shamanic totemic helm?  Me have seen a shaman wit dat!  Yous must be dead!"<br />
<br />
"Bah!  How many of those 'totemic helms' have you seen around?  There are over a thousand of them in circulation.  Many idiot shamen come down here to kill me and claim my hide for their own selfish purposes.  All have never seen me.  I almost figured you for one of those morons, until I saw your hammer... and the fact that you're pretty much naked."<br />
<br />
Bash looked down at da leafy bush dat he had uprooted and used as a make-shift un-embarrassment.  "Oh, yeah." said da ogre.<br />
<br />
"But, if dey all have totemic helms, and none have ever seen yous...."<br />
<br />
Da bear stopped.  It turned his head to look behind itself.  "Miragul, would you care to show our young ogre friend?"<br />
<br />
Da skeleton saluted da big bear and began waving its arms.  Yellow light shot out from da skeletons hands and where it landed, a big, white bear appeared.  It looked just like da Glacier Bear, but was about two-thirds da size.  It roared at Bash and den disappeared wit a wave of da skeleton's hand.<br />
<br />
"Miragul is a wonderful lich, conjurer, and good friend." da bear said.  Da skeleton, bowed.  "He creates those things to fool the idiots.  He can create one every eight hours or so.  The hide from the conjured bears can be used to make a totemic helm.  It's too bad they're not <i>real</i> totemic.  A real totemic helmet is about thirty times as powerful as the pieces of huddah they think is so special!<br />
<br />
"If the shamen would only take the time to open up their minds they may actually get a real one someday.  But do they ever even try to talk to me?  Do they even hail any of the bears they meet?  No!  It's all about 'kill kill kill, die die die, pelt pelt pelt!'"<br />
<br />
As da three peoples continued walking, anudder skeleton came running around da corner.  It saw Miragul and ran up to da lich.  Da two exchanged high fives and den began moving deir jaws up and down as if dey was talking to one anudder.  Da sound of bone scraping against bone echoed throughout da hallway.<br />
<br />
"Ah, there's Jakontiklarkiak.  A good friend of Miragul's.  It is too bad that gnome of his isn't as cool.  I had to put him in stasis.  He'll be hibernating for a good long time.  Maybe that will cure him of his highly annoying demeanor."<br />
<br />
"Me doubt it."<br />
<br />
"Me too." said da bear shaking his head wit a sigh.<br />
<br />
"Mr Bear... uh sir..." said Bash.  "What is me doing here?"<br />
<br />
"Prophecy."<br />
<br />
"What prophecy?"<br />
<br />
"Prophecy.  There are all sorts of prophecies in this world.  Some are unimportant, some are very important.  Some are right, some are wrong, some are just plain weird.  There's even one that speaks of you stubbing your toe in this place."<br />
<br />
"OW!" screamed da ogre as his bare foot accidentally kicked a protruding rock.<br />
<br />
"I guess that particular prophecy was one of the correct ones." da bear said wit a shrug (as much as a bear can shrug at least).  "Prophecies are tricky things.  They're not set in stone, and they can be changed.  But not always.  Sometimes there are loopholes."<br />
<br />
"What does dis have to do wit me?"<br />
<br />
"The goblin that killed your parents became a student of prophecy.  He found a particularly  nasty one that he felt he could twist to his own advantage.  He learned all he could about it, and took measures to make sure all the things that kept the prophecy in check were eliminated.<br />
<br />
"Each prophecy, good or bad, has a seperate part to it that keeps it in balance.  For example, if a prophecy states that you'll stub your toe, there will be a subsection or a clause saying that it's possible a big, white bear might possibly warn you about the rock."<br />
<br />
"And why didn't yous?" asked da ogre a little upset.  His toe still hurt.<br />
<br />
"That was just an example.  Besides, it had slipped my mind.<br />
<br />
"Anyway, the goblin, whom you know to be called Smellybreath, found a prophecy that worked to his advantage.  He studied the parts that could stop him from bringing it about and made sure the loose ends were tied up, so to speak.  This is where your family comes in.<br />
<br />
"Smellybreath did indeed put a stop to the things that would be his downfall.  Your father, your mother, and... your brother."<br />
<br />
Bash fought some tears back. "Den what can me  do, if Smellybreath took care of everyting?"<br />
<br />
"Ahhh... well, I think he has overlooked some  important information.  Prophecies were written by not just by ancient prophets, but ancient lawyers too.  The language is always hard to read and understand.  I think it was a mistake to overlook you.<br />
<br />
"I am forbidden to tell you some of the more important information, for such knowledge would cause your head to implode.  Sorry, but  it would.  I don't make the rules.  But I am allowed to give you a small bit of the prophecy and point you in the right direction.  You must figure the rest out for yourself.  That is your destiny."<br />
<br />
"Me understand...  me tink."<br />
<br />
"Very well.  Listen closely Bash, for it shall be spoken only once and once only.  So is the way with prophecy.<br />
<br />
<b>Ancient word, sends a bird<br />
End of world, magic swirled<br />
Born of fire, to rule desire<br />
To make men slaves, or to their graves<br />
Champions four, are good no more<br />
Born of fire, believed a liar<br />
Tricked with fish, a demonic wish<br />
Fueled by hate, will life negate<br />
Fed by deceit, destroyed complete<br />
Born of fire, champion aspire.</b><br />
<br />
"That is all I can speak of the long prophecy that the goblin uses against this world.  Whether you use it to your advantage or not is up to you."<br />
<br />
"Me no understand it!  What it mean?!"<br />
<br />
"I can't tell you.  Sorry." said da big bear as it lowered its head.  It den raised its head once again and looked straight at Bash.  Da bear appeared to have a slight smile.<br />
<br />
"Now, how about we get you some respectable clothes, hmmm?"</p>

	<p>Bash stood before two massive, arched, swinging doors interlocked wit each udder.  Da doors were at least fifty feet high.  Dey appeared to be made of da same material as da cavern walls, but dey obviously stood out from da surroundings.  Bash no could feel anyting but awe in front of da huge doors.<br />
<br />
"Prepare yourself for a sight that few have ever seen... and lived to tell about it." said da Glacier bear who was standing alongside da ogre.  Da bear padded up to da doors and stuck it's nose on one of da doors.  Both doors began creaking and groaning as da heavy weight of da two structures began shifting and swinging inward.  Da noise from da doors was berry loud and Bash could feel da whole cave floor shaking beneath his feet.<br />
<br />
Bright light spilled in from da opening slit in da middle of da doors.  As da doors opened wider, more light filled da cavern in which Bash stood.  Da ogre had to squint against da luminous white dat spewed forth from da gigantic entrance.<br />
<br />
Da doors eventually came to a halt when dey swung as wide as dey could.  Da whole caves shook violently from da massive slam da doors made against da walls, but da bear seemed unconcerned.  Bash guessed it would take more dan dat to collapse dese caves.<br />
<br />
"Follow me, young ogre." da bear said solemnly.  It bowed its head and sauntered slowly into da bright room.  Da bear den loudly said, "Miragul!  I will require your assistance."<br />
<br />
Da gold-ish skeleton appeared from around a corner behind Bash and ran at full speed into da room behind da bear.  Da two disappeared into da light.<br />
<br />
Bash gripped his hammer tightly in his right hand and used his left arm to shield his eyes from da blinding light.  He den walked in after da bear.<br />
<br />
Once inside, Bash's eyes adjusted quickly.  Da light no seemed as bright in da room.  Da room was da biggest room Bash ever saw.  He no could see da udder end of da room, it was so big.  Everywhere Bash looked, he saw golden objects of all shapes and sizes.  Some floating, some not.  Some with light magically cascading up and down dem, some not.  Dere were armors, swords, axes, shields, moneys, and a big stockpile of toilet paper.<br />
<br />
But da ting dat drew Bash's full attention, da ting dat made his heart skip a beat for some reason, was da big fountain in da middle of all da golden objects.  It was an octagonal shaped pool dat was eighty feet wide wit crystal clear water.  No color.  Just pure transparency.  Out from da middle of da pool sprayed a fountain dat shot at least ninety feet straight up.  <br />
<br />
From each point at da edge of da pool rose a hollow, see-through column.  Eight ramps ran from da middle of da pool down to da columns.  On top of each column was a piece of da most beautiful armor Bash ever saw.  Gauntlets, leggings, boots, yous name it.  Each was da color of when gold kissed silver -- da color of platinum.  Dey hovered each column, spinning ever so slightly.  Da water from da fountain collected into each ramp and it flowed down into each column underneath each armor piece.  Light bounced against da water and appeared to be giving life to da armors.  It was da most beautiful ting Bash ever saw.  It brought a tear to his eye.<br />
<br />
"As you can see," said da bear quietly, "There are three columns with some armor pieces missing.  They were gifts to another such as yourself hundreds of years ago.  They have long since been lost." <br />
<br />
Da bear paused for a moment.  "But that does not mean more cannot be made.  Miragul..."<br />
<br />
Da lich bounded up beside da bear.  Bash heard anudder set of skeleton footprints and turned to see Jakontiklarkiak jog up beside his friend, Miragul.<br />
<br />
Da glacier bear den started to shake himself violently, as if in were drenched wit water.   Tiny, white hairs flew from its beautiful coat.  Da lich waved his hand and dey all floated to da skeleton.  Da skeleton gathered da furball up and den walked over to da fountain.<br />
<br />
Miragul's jaw moved as if it were talking, den it waved its free hand over da pool.  Da pool turned from crystal color to emerald green.  Da room changed color as well, and Bash realized da light was coming from da fountain.  Miragul dropped da bear's fur into da fountain.  <br />
<br />
Da fountain den glowed so brightly dat Bash no could watch.  He shieled his face wit both arms.  A second later, da light faded.  Bash looked up and saw dat hovering atop one of da empty columns was now a platinum helmet wit three horns in a row, from front to back, in da center.<br />
<br />
"These pieces," said da bear, "Make up the true Totemic Armor.  The true armor of the Pure Shaman.  Few exist today, but one who's heart is true and just may find himself with such a set someday.  You, Bash, are one of those few."<br />
<br />
"But... but me is just a fighter.  Me no is..."<br />
<br />
"Your heart tells me what you are.  You just have not realized it."  Da bear looked at da fountain and sighed.  "I wish I could give you the breastplate as well.  But, I have not the component I need.  Grizzleknot bark is so hard to come by these days, what with all the friggin' druids."  Da bear muttered someting under his breath.<br />
<br />
Bash recalled Lilting in Southern Karana.  He remembered grabbing him and pulling from his mouth...<br />
<br />
"Is dis what yous need?" asked Bash as he pulled out a piece  of bark from his make-shift-from-a-shrub shorts.<br />
<br />
Da bear looked at what Bash held.  It den seemed to smile (as much as a bear can look like it can smile) and den said, "Yes!  Throw it in!"<br />
<br />
Da fountain changed colors again, dis time to a royal blue.  Da room, again, changed colors as well.  Da bright light appeared once more and den da fountain was back to a crystal white color.  Dis time, a gleaming breastplate was now above anudder column.<br />
<br />
"Wow..." whispered Bash.  "Mr. Bear, uh sir, what about dat last column?  What goes dere?"<br />
<br />
"Oh that?  Well...  hey, you know, your mallet looks a little dirty."<br />
<br />
Bash looked at his hammer.  It's golden tint glinting brightly in da crystal light from da fountain.  Bash looked confused.<br />
<br />
"It looks dirty, Bash.  Dip it into the water to clean it."<br />
<br />
Bash no wanted to argue wit a bear.  He walked up to da fountain's edge and plunged his hammer into da transparent water.  As he did so, he watched da gold from his hammer melt away in da water.  It washed off as if it were mud.  Bash slowly pulled his bashing mallet out and it now gleamed da same platinum color as da armor.<br />
<br />
Miragul and Jakontiklarkiak applauded enthusiastically wit deir bony hands.<br />
<br />
"And there you go," said da bear.  "Now, for the test.  Miragul!"<br />
<br />
Da lich nodded.  It waved its hands and all da armor pieces from da fountain lifted up into da air.<br />
<br />
"Do not be afraid, young shaman." said da bear.<br />
<br />
Da armor pieces den came flying straight at Bash.  Bash closed his eyes before da impact hit him.  Nothing happened.  He opened his eyes and found himself covered from head to toe in da beautiful platemail.  He grinned.<br />
<br />
Bash den felt his hammer, his helmet, his breastplate, his pants, everyting, get berry warm.<br />
<br />
"Do not be afraid.  The armor must test you.  It must know your heart to accept you." said da bear.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
All throughout da underground caverns, an ogre's scream of pain resonated loudly.</p>

	<p>Bash stood in da middle of a large, dark room.  Torches hung upon da big stone walls, but still not giving off enough light for da ogre to see much.  In da center of da room was a tiny, circular altar wit weird symbols and runes etched all over.  Da arcane letters gave a small amount of light of deir own, pulsating slowly.<br />
<br />
"Where in da...?!" said da ogre aloud.  His sentence was cut off by someone behind him.<br />
<br />
"I am so glad to see you.... my son." da familiar voice said.  Bash spun around and became face to face wit his father and mother.<br />
<br />
"Mudder?" asked Bash quietly.  "Fadder?"<br />
<br />
"I knew you'd make it!" said Mommy Emgood.  "We knew you were strong."<br />
<br />
"Yes, we did," said Daddy Emgood.  "We cannot stay long.  We just wanted to tell you that we love you and..."<br />
<br />
"...and that we don't think you should kill another life just to avenge our spirits." Mommy Emgood finished his father's sentence.<br />
<br />
"Yes," began Daddy Emgood.  "Forget about the goblin, son.  We're proud of you no matter what you do.  We know you love us.  Please, just leave the goblin alone.  We don't want to lose you too."<br />
<br />
"Take care, son." said Mommy Emgood.  "Remember that we love you!"<br />
<br />
Bash's parents suddenly began to become transparent and den dey disappeared.<br />
<br />
"Mama!  Dada!" shouted Bash.  Bash let loose some tears quietly and thought about what had just happened.<br />
<br />
Bash became confused.  He spent da last several years of his life waiting to smush dat dumb goblin's head in.  Now his parents come out of nowhere and tell him....<br />
<br />
Atop of a flight of stairs in da room, a door opened.  A lone figure's shadow was seen against da light and den stepped into da room.  Bash recognized who it was instantly.<br />
<br />
"Smellybreath!" whispered da ogre.<br />
<br />
Da goblin no seemed to notice da ogre and stepped onto his altar.   He pointed both hands straight above him and began chanting in a language Bash never heard before.<br />
<br />
Da ogre's face contorted wit rage.  He felt his hammer flare up.  He felt da need to see goblin brains splattered all over da room's walls.<br />
<br />
Bash ran up as fast as he could behind da goblin and quickly raised his hammer to end da miserable ting's life in one blow.  Da goblin heard da ruckus behind him and spun around to see dis massive ogre wit hammer held high above its head.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath couldn't scream.  It just looked at da ogre wit surprise and fear.  Eyes wide open and jaw agape, all he could do was shake his head in a "No! Please!" manner.<br />
<br />
Bash's hammer felt white-hot.  It wanted blood.  It wanted goblin blood.  Da ogre knew it, and wanted it too.  He screamed.  In da middle of his scream, dough, he remembered his parents.<br />
<br />
His hammer made him quickly forget what his parents said and just as quickly reminded him of what happened to dem in da first place, and just who caused it.  Da ogre swung his hammer downwards.<br />
<br />
In dat split second of da hammer's swing, Bash thought again to his parent's wishes.   As his hammer arced down into da perfect curve dat would connect it to Smellybreath's soft head, da ogre pulled wit all his strength to divert its course.  Da hammer just barely missed da goblin and swung wide.  Da force from his swing ripped da hammer out of his hands and sent it flying into da wall.<br />
<br />
Da hammer ripped a hole through da stone and purple light poured into da room from it.  Bash felt da floor begin to shake beneath him, and den saw da whole castle room begin to crumble.  Stones started falling from da ceilings, and da walls collapsed upon demselves.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath, along wit his altar, vanished before da ogre's eyes.  Bash was so confused at dis point, he no thought about his own safety.  Da whole castle began to fizzle, and den pretty much disappear all together.<br />
<br />
Da ogre saw nothing but purple.  He was standing on someting solid, but could no see it.  Da color purple permeated all throughout his surroundings.  Nothing else seemed to exist.<br />
<br />
"Well done, Moondoggy!" said a voice from, again, behind da ogre.<br />
<br />
Bash spun around, again, and dis time was face to face wit Papa Smurpheater.  <br />
<br />
"Grandpa!"  exclaimed Bash excitedly.  "What in da Hate just happened?!"<br />
<br />
"You passed the test, hip cat!"<br />
<br />
"What test?" asked Bash confusedly.<br />
<br />
"THE test.  The test the armor had to perform to make sure you were worthy of wearing it!  An evil heart cannot wear such a piece, and it had to know if your heart was filled with nothing but vengeance."<br />
<br />
"Me see..." said da ogre, not totally understanding.  "Where is dis place?"<br />
<br />
"This?  This is the place few visit other than in dreams."<br />
<br />
"So da goblin, da castle and......." Bash began to choke back some tears. "....and me parents...?"<br />
<br />
"Not real, lovemonkey.  Sorry about that.  It had to feel real to you, or the test wouldn't have been accurate, man.  You're not even here.  Only your mind is."<br />
<br />
"Are yous real?"<br />
<br />
"You better believe it, nature boy!  I'm here, just not physically, man!"<br />
<br />
"How....?"<br />
<br />
Da old ogre pointed to a jar of someting he was holding.  Bash recognized it as da Sacred Peyote.<br />
<br />
"What about what me parents said.... about not smashing dat goblin?  Me not allowed to smash dat dumbhead?"<br />
<br />
"Well, those weren't your real parents.  At least, I'm pretty sure they weren't.   I think you've proven to the armor that you wouldn't kill him if you were told not to.  And since it now knows you're not in this thing only for revenge, I think it's plausible you can beat the crap out of that little bugger."<br />
<br />
"Dat good!"<br />
<br />
"But anyways, Moondoggy, you have to get back.  Your friends are in danger, or will be soon.  The oracle should be able to get you to them.  Take care, my little one.  I love you, man!"<br />
<br />
"Me love yous too, grandpa."<br />
<br />
Bash hugged his grandpa tightly and sniffed back some more tears.  Me hope he no cry like baby all throughout story, it embarrassing to write about.  Anyways, he sniffed back some tears and den his world suddenly faded to black.</p>

	<p>Smellybreath stood outside on da battlement of his castle, high above da ground.  Da goblin surveyed da surrounding area and let out a sigh of contentment.  All around him thick, grey fog blanketed everyting dat he could see.  But da goblin could see more dan just what his eyes told him.  He felt da surrounding dead trees, he sensed da rocky, black earth beneath da castle, he tasted da setting sun.<br />
<br />
"All will look like this one day," da goblin said quietly to himself.  "All will be paradise.<br />
<br />
"Lousy, good for nothing, Alcoholics Anonymous friends." muttered da goblin.  "Laughing at me saying my plans for world domination would never happen."<br />
<br />
Smellybreath chuckled to himself.  He took in da wonderful, black/grey site once more and den turned around and headed back into his castle.<br />
<br />
Da goblin walked down many stairs until he reached da heart of his home, da underground chamber dat housed his altar.  Da goblin stepped atop it, placed his feet on two particular types of runes, raised his arms up high, closed his eyes, and began chanting.<br />
<br />
Da whole castle started to shake ever so slightly.  So miniscule was da vibration dat most wouldn't notice it.  However, it didn't stop dere.  Da castle began to quake more and more violently wit each passing moment.  It started shaking back and forth so hard, dat torches were flung from deir holsters across da room.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath kept his balance, kept his eyes shut tight, and continually chanted in some acient, arcane tongue.  Da castle was quivering so much now, it was if it were in a giant's grasp and he thought dat da castle was little plastic globe dat 'snowed' when you shook it.<br />
<br />
Just as quickly as it started, da castle's shaking stopped.  All was quiet outside.  Da fog still rolled past, da sun still no gave any light anywhere around.  No birds chirped.  And had one been able to get a good look through da fog, one would see dat da place where Smellybreath's castle used to be on da mountain was now no more dan a huge, empty crater.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
<br />
"But we need to see your chieftain!" demanded Treehugger.  He and da group were outside da barbarian city dat was located in da heart of da icy mountains of Permafrost.  Da barbarians didn't welcome outsiders much.<br />
<br />
Two guards stood outside da city, not allowing da group to pass.  As a rule, barbarians always wear kilts and nothing else.  Da bare chested guards had blue war paint on deir faces, and stood shivering in da snow.<br />
<br />
"Nnnnnn...No.  BBBBarbarians only.  NNNnnnn nnnn No one sees Chief except Barbarians." da guard said as he stood at attention.  His teeth began chattering.  Da udder guard's teeth were locked in a grmaced grit.  Each gaurd's skin was red from being exposed to extreme cold.<br />
<br />
"Don't you boys think you should wear a jacket or something?" asked Pyra.<br />
<br />
"Nnnnnnn.... Nnnnnoo!!  Jacket is wwwww...wwwweakness!  BBBBBBarbarians.... strong!!"<br />
<br />
Da udder barbarian nodded his headed slightly and quickly.  His mouth never moved and stayed locked in a grimace.<br />
<br />
"Bah!  Enough of this, lads." exclaimed Yessir.  "They'll not give us any trouble.  They can barely move.  Follow me!"<br />
<br />
Da paladin marched between da two frozen guards.  Da first paladin raised his arm slightly as if to protest, or maybe try to use force, but his arm locked up and became motionless.  Da barbarian just chattered his teeth and shivered while his eyes followed da party as dey walked on by.  His udder guard friend, just stood staring straight ahead, still in his perma-toothy-smile.<br />
<br />
Finding da Chieftain's hut was not hard for da party.  Da barbarians would do deir best to point dem in da wrong direction, but dey was so stupid dey always point in da exact opposite way which da hut was located.  Da group found deir way to da hut wit little problem.<br />
<br />
"Why for you come to Chief Hardnipple's city?!" shouted a big, angry barbarian man standing in da middle of da hut da party just entered.  Da barbarian was barechested, just as da rest of da males, (to Yessir, Treehugger, and Lilting's disappointment, da females were not topless).  He had blue war paint all over his body, supposedly in articulate designs, but looked like dey was painted on by a toddler.  "Chief Hardnipple is not happy you have come to Chief Hardnipple's city!"<br />
<br />
"I thought this guy <b>was</b> the Chief?" whispered Lilting to Yessir.  Da paladin just shrugged.<br />
<br />
"Where is your Chief, good barbarian?  We've an important matter at hand!" said Treehugger forcefully.<br />
<br />
"Chief Hardnipple says you are speaking to Chief Hardnipple!  Chief Hardnipple does not like you being here!"<br />
<br />
Treehugger figured it out.  Da chieftain spoke in da third person.<br />
<br />
"Chief, please hear us out.  We need your help.  A friend of ours fell into your river of ice and we don't know where he is or how to..."<br />
<br />
"Chief Hardnipple says SILENCE!  Chief Hardnipple does not see you worthy of barbarian acknowledgeme.... acknow.... Well, you know what Chief Hardnipple means.  Chief Hardnipple says you must prove to Chief Hardnipple that your blood is that of a barbarian!"<br />
<br />
"All of us?!" asked Lilting.<br />
<br />
"Chief Hardnipple says, Yes!  All of you!  Chief Hardnipple says that if you...."<br />
<br />
Chief Hardnipple was cut short.   Outside dere came a sound of a gigantic explosion.  Screams broke out from somewhere outside da hut.  Everyone in da Chief's hut looked surprised, including da Chief.  Just den, a big chunk of wood debris came ripping through da hut's roof and landed right next to Lilting.  Da piece of wood was on fire.<br />
<br />
Da party ran outside and saw smoke billowing up from da center of town.  More screams were heard in dat general direction and most were cut unexpectadly short.<br />
<br />
A gigantic ball of flame exploded from somewhere in da center of town, setting more barbarian homes ablaze.</p>

	<p>"Chief Hardnipple is asking what is happening to Chief Hardnipple's village?!" demanded da barbarian chieftain as he stared out at da smoke coming from da center of Halas.<br />
<br />
"I don't know, but we're going to find out!" said Treehugger.  Da ranger turned to da paladin.  "I'll probably die, good knight, so please avenge my death!"<br />
<br />
Yessir brought his fist to his heart.  "Of course, ranger!  I shall avenge thee, those barbarians, and the tiny little microorganisms that were living in the air before they were incinerated!"<br />
<br />
"Micro what?" asked Lilting.<br />
<br />
"Nevermind!  Let's go!"<br />
<br />
Da group charged out of da hut of da barbarian chief.  Lilting stumbled and fell flat on his face while da udders sped away.  Da halfling picked himself up and den began to cast a spell.<br />
<br />
"Spirit wolf come to me, charge my feet; set me free!"<br />
<br />
Blue sparklies formed around da halfling and den he ran twice da speed any halfling ever ran.  He zoomed by da group and raced towards da center of town.<br />
<br />
Lilting could hear da cries of pain, fear, and sorrow as he neared where da smoke originated.  More explosions and gigantic balls of flame erupted.  Da druid rounded da corner and den came to a skidding halt to what he saw.<br />
<br />
Standing amidst a score of charred, barbarian-shaped piles of ash, was da biggest knight da halfling had ever seen.  Standing ten feet high, his armor was da color of pure black.  No light seemed to escape da knights surface.  A horned, full helmet covered da knights face.  In his hand was a huge, glowing claymore sword.  It glowed da color orange.  It glowed da color of fire.<br />
<br />
Da Black Knight was swinging his sword into barbarian homes.  Wood splintered as da sword passed through it and offered no resistance as if da huts were made of paper.  Da places where da sword had passed through began to burn, as if it were a wound dat was somehow infected wit flames.<br />
<br />
What resistance da barbarian warriors put up was easily overcome by da knight.  Slicing peoples in two while deir bodie den set on fire, shooting flames out of his sword, punching udders and sending dem flying, da knight was not slowing down for nobody.<br />
<br />
Da knight den turned and started reigning his carnage in Lilting's direction.  Da halfling was so terrified dat it no could move.  Da knight smashed buildings to da left and right and came closer and closer to da halfling.<br />
<br />
Lilting was rooted in place wit fear.  His eyes were as wide as his mouth as he watched dis walking death draw near.  Da knight came upon da halfling.  To it, da druid was just anudder obstacle.  Da knight raised his sword.<br />
<br />
Just as it was about to strike, a green-brown blur came streaking down from overhead and slammed into da gargantuan knight.  It was Treehugger.  He had tried to drop-kick da knight in mid-air, but even dough da force was enough to take down someone da size of Chief Hardnipple, da ranger fell to da ground as if he had hit a brick wall.  Da knight wasn't even phased, but da ranger had distracted him enough so dat its sword didn't swing at da halfling.<br />
<br />
Medsa dove in and grabbed Lilting by da arm and pulled him to safety.  Yessir charged in and raised his rusty sword and trash-can lid shield.  Treehugger leapt to his feet and pulled both his swords free from deir scabbards.<br />
<br />
Pyra den appeared from behind some smoldering rubble and den proceeded to shoot fireballs into da knight.  Da plan and hope was dat she would distract da big knight long enough for da ranger and paladin to go in for da kill.  It probably would have worked on any udder creature dan dis one.<br />
<br />
Da knight turned its head to see three balls of flame and magma come streaking towards itself.  It immediately went into a crouch wit arms forward and downward.  Even dough no one could see its muscles, everyone was reasonably sure dey were tensing up and flexing.  Da knight den immediately shot  out of his crouch to be upright again and thrust his arms upwards at a criss-cross angle.<br />
<br />
Da air around him became wavy, like da heat rising off a fire.  Da group heard a sizzling sound some small popping sounds.  Treehugger and Yessir had to jump back abruptly from da heat dat was forming.  Pyra realized what was going on.  Da knight was becoming so hot, dat he was burning up da air molecules around him.  Da knight's feet began melting into da ice and stone, and da fireballs rushed on.<br />
<br />
Da balls of flame reached deir target, but da black knight, Fire, had begun to give off so much heat around him dat when da balls of hot goo reached him dey instantly burned to a crisp.   What was glowing hot before, became even hotter and da magma solidified and became nothing more dan harmless, charred carbon.  Da three balls of burnt crispy critters plinked harmlessly off da knight's thick platemail.<br />
<br />
Da group just stared in complete amazement and shock.  And as da heat from da knight slowly began to grow outward, Fire lowered his arms and da air around him stopped sizzling.  Fire pulled its feet free of the liquid lava dey had created and den came for da party.<br />
<br />
Treehugger was da first to meet da knight head-on.  His swords whipping in a figure-eight pattern, following one another, he came at da knight wit battle finesse.  Da ranger den stuck his arms out and sliced at da knight from both sides by bringing dem back together.  Fire just stood there.<br />
<br />
Da half-elf's swords struck da knight, but da knight's armor was still so hot dat each blade just melted as dey collided wit da knight.  Da swords melted down to just a couple inches from da hilt.  Treehugger was not expecting to be no resistance from his swings, and was thrown off balance.<br />
<br />
Fire raised its left fisted gauntlet and den punched da ranger right in da face.  Da force snapped his head back and sent his body flying.  He was brought to a sudden stop by his head colliding wit a stone, barbarian house.  Da ranger fell to da ground limply, and was immediately knocked out.<br />
<br />
"Lilting!" shouted Sir Yessir.  "The snow!  Cool him down!"<br />
<br />
Da druid shook himself to try to get rid of da fear, panic, and awe.  He began casting a spell.<br />
<br />
"Cold snow, here we go.  Come to me and put on your show!"<br />
<br />
Large piles of snow were lifted off da ground and den were sent flying into da knight.  Hissing and steam came from da black knight and da snow was instantly turned to water.  Dis did not slow da knight down.<br />
<br />
"Taste holy might, foul beast!" shouted Sir Yessir.  Da paladin charged da knight.  He swung his sword at da knight and it just bounced harmlessly off Fire's armor.  Yessir den brought up his right foot to kick da knight as hard as he could.<br />
<br />
Fire caught the foot in his left hand.  Almost as quick as anyone could blink, da knight brought up its sword and swung it downwards.<br />
<br />
Yessir let out da loudest scream any one of dem ever heard.  It was a scream of pain.  Six inches below his right knee where his calf and foot once were, was now just a stump.  Da knight's sword cauterized da wound instantly as it went through.  Da paladin's foot fell to da ground.<br />
<br />
Fire shoved da knight and Yessir went flying like a rag doll and landed in a snow bank.  Da knight den looked up at da rest of da group.</p>

	<p>Fire came towards da group while dey just looked at him wit deir moths and eyes wide open.  None of dem could move.  None of dem believed dat moving from da knight would help dem anyway.<br />
<br />
Da black Guardian moved closer and closer to da party, wit sword glowing brighter dan ever.  Da knight reached Medsa first.  Fire raised its sword arm to do da killing blow to da caleric.  Da high elf just bowed her head and closed her eyes in sorrow dat she could do nothing for her friends and wished dem all a quick death.<br />
<br />
A sound made da knight pause in confusion.  It was a voice, and it came from behind da Guardian.<br />
<br />
"Hey...  Dumbhead!"<br />
<br />
Da Elemental Guardian lowered its arm and turned at da sound.  Medsa opened her eyes and watched da knight turn around at dis new sound.  She no could see over da knight, but she did catch a glimpse of a huge, huge hammer twirling quickly, stopping, and den swinging fast to connect wit da knight's helmet.<br />
<br />
A loud <i>*CLANG!*</i> resulted, and da knight was hit so hard dat it spun in place.  It stopped and doubled over onto  one knee.<br />
<br />
Dere, standing behind da knight, was an ogre.  Clad in an armor dat looked like it was dipped in pure platinum, he held aloft his shiny matching hammer, ready to smash it into da knight again.  Da group recognized dis new savior.  It was...<br />
<br />
"BASH!" shouted Lilting.  "You're alive!"<br />
<br />
"Yup!  But dis guy no is for long!"<br />
<br />
Da black knight quickly shook its head violently to remove da stun from da hammer.  It got back to its feet quickly.  Standing upright, da Guardian was easily da same size as da ogre.<br />
<br />
It looked at Bash and ****ed its head as if confused slightly.  Instead of making an attack, it immediately went for someting in its black belt.  <br />
<br />
Bash watched wit curiosity as da knight rapidly sheathed it's sword and pulled out a small, gleaming black stone wit a white rune on it.  He watched da knight trace his left index finger from da bottom to da top of da symbol, making sure to follow every line and curve.<br />
<br />
Da knight den vanished in front of dem all in some sort of dimensional gate.<br />
<br />
"And don't come back!" said da ogre.<br />
<br />
Medsa, Pyra, and Lilting rushed da big ogre.  Dey all each hugged da big ogre (one on each leg, while Lilting hugged a knee cap).  Tears were streaming down everyone's face.  All was quiet except for da loud snort-sobbing of Lilting.<br />
<br />
All was quiet until a roar of cheering erupted from da many hiding barbarians who witnessed Bash getting rid of da terror dat ruined half deir town.  Barbarians came from all over da place to slap da ogre on da back and continued to cheer.<br />
<br />
"What going on?" asked Bash.<br />
<br />
"That knight you killed destroyed their town!" said Medsa.   "He also.... he also."<br />
<br />
"He hurt Treehugger and Yessir." Pyra said solemnly.<br />
<br />
"Where is dem?  Can we help dem?!"<br />
<br />
"I can probably heal their wounds, but I'm afraid... I'm afraid I can't do anything for Yessir's leg." Medsa told da ogre.<br />
<br />
"What happened to his..." da ogre began but was cut off.  He saw Sir Yessir hopping on one foot.  Half of da paladin's right calf had been lopped off below da knee.  Interestingly  enough, da noble knight didn't seem too upset by it.<br />
<br />
"Now that fellow," said Sir Yessir, "Was the second meanest fellow I've ever met!"  Da knight muttered someting about da first being some dumbhead dark elf named Giz or Gix or someting.<br />
<br />
A scream of pain and ultimate suffering rose up among da noisy barbarians.  Out of some rubble stumbled Treehugger.  Da ranger held his swords, well, what were formally his swords, in his two hands.  Dey had been melted into nothing more dan hilts.  Da ranger wailed as if he had just lost all of his family in an explosion.<br />
<br />
"Us need to get Yessir fixed up." said Bash.  "Who here can help us wit dat?"<br />
<br />
"I'm betting that big Chief Hardnipple can!" said Lilting excitedly.<br />
<br />
Da ranger wailed some more.<br />
<br />
"Ok den," said Bash.  "Let's go see him.  Where he at?"<br />
<br />
Da group went back to da chieftain's hut, wit Yessir hopping behind and Treehugger walking slightly slower crying and pouting and wailing all da way.  Da biggest line of barbarians hooted and hollered behind dem as dey followed dis great party toward's deir tribal chief's home.</p>

	<p>"Chief Hardnipple is saying thank you for saving Chief Hardnipple's city!" said a very grateful chieftain to da group standing before him.  Dey was standing in da chief's berry large hut.  Da barbarians was uncomfortable being around da big ogre, and Bash mutually shared dat feeling, but da big humans knew well enough just who had saved deir snow covered town.<br />
<br />
"Mr. Hardnipple, sir, I have a question." stated a concerned Sir Yessir.<br />
<br />
"Chief Hardnipple is saying ask what you wish of Chief Hardnipple."<br />
<br />
"It's about my leg, Mr. Hardnipple.  Might I be able to get something to stand on?" da paladin asked his question while hopping on his good foot to keep balance.<br />
<br />
Da chief looked at one of da barbarians standing right next to him and nodded.  Da barbarian was off and running out of da hut.  "Chief Hardnipple will be taking care of that!"<br />
<br />
Bash wondered what da chief was up to to help his friend.  Da ogre soon realized a sound was coming from behind him.  It got louder and udder peoples in da room noticed it too.<br />
<br />
It was sound of crying and phlegm being snorted back at da same time.  Bash stepped aside and dere was Treehugger clutching his melted swords to his chest.<br />
<br />
Chief Hardnipple frowned in confusion at da ranger.  Medsa just shook her head and sighed.  "You big baby!" she said.<br />
<br />
Treehugger just looked at her, looked at his swords again, and just started wailing even louder dan before.<br />
<br />
"Can't you do anything to shut him up?" Pyra asked looking up to da chieftain.<br />
<br />
"Chief Hardnipple would do anything to get wussy human elf to zip lip!  But Chief Hardnipple is not sure what Chief Hardnipple can.... wait.  Chief Hardnipple may have an idea."  Da chief looked at anudder barbarian standing next to him and nodded.  Den dat barbarian bolted out of da hut at da same speed da first one ran.<br />
<br />
"Anyway, since you have saved Chief Hardnipple's village, by barbarian law you must each marry one of Chief Hardnipple's daughters or sons by tomorrow morning!  If you don't Chief Hardnipple will see it as an insult and comdemn you to death!"<br />
<br />
Each one of Bash's group got a real uncomfortable look on deir faces.  Lilting began to squirm uneasily.  Bash frowned.  Pyra got sick.<br />
<br />
Da chief had a straight face, but den started to snicker.  Den he and his barbarian friends burst out laughing.  Dey laughed REALLY loud.  "Chief Hardnipple is saying he is joking!  Chief Hardnipple says you should have seen the looks on your faces!"<br />
<br />
Da whole group heaved a sigh of relief.  Da laughter died down as da two barbarians da chief had sent away came back wit blankets under each of deir arms.  Da blankets were obvioulsy each wrapped around someting.<br />
<br />
"Ah, here are Chief Hardnipple's loyal subjects!  Let us and  Chief Hardnipple be seeing what they have, shall we and Chief Hardnipple?"<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Dark fog.  Dat was all dat surrounded dat black castle.  It slowly moved around da castle, seemingly penetrating da black stone like it didn't exist.  Da only sound heard was violent screaming coming from somewhere inside da structure.<br />
<br />
<b>"WHAAAAT!!?!?!?!?"</b> screamed Smellybreath to da big, black knight, Fire.  "Are you SURE you saw what you saw?"<br />
<br />
Da Elemental Guardian slowly nodded its horned, helmeted head.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath turned away from da knight and began to think aloud to himself.  Da goblin tapped his tiny green fingers together methodically.<br />
<br />
"An ogre in True Totemic?  That in of itself is a bad sign.  But even worse it's an Emgood.  I was hoping that the ogre with the party was just your average, stupid ogre.  But noooo, that never happens!  Do I ever get my way?  Do I?!"<br />
<br />
A bird flew past da window on da wall da goblin was facing.  Smellybreath instantly pointed and shot a magical beam of energy at it.  Da bird was instantly fried in magical fire and den floated to da goblin's hand.<br />
<br />
"I'll get my way this time," da goblin said as he bit da head off of da bird.  "Oh, I will indeed."<br />
<br />
Da goblin spun around to face da big knight.  "It is time.  Begin phase two of my plan!"<br />
<br />
Da black knight nodded, banged its fist against its breastplate's chest, and den pulled out da teleport stone it carried.<br />
<br />
Da knight was gone moments later.</p>

	<p>Da sun was high in da sky and shone down brightly on da Northern Plains of Karana.  Bash's armor glinted and reflected da light all over da place.  Da ogre was a sight to behold!  Local residents and bandits alike had to stop to watch da strange and curious vision go by.<br />
<br />
Da ogre was not da only odd ting.  Behind him marched a funny erduite wizardess who kept shooting small balls of flame at da woodland creatures as dey passed.  Behind her zipped a hyperactive halfling dat kept running circles around an annoyed looking high-elf.  Behind her trailed two more peoples, one a scruffy old paladin wit a wooden stump in da shape of a boot on one leg who made squeaky noises as he walked; and da udder was a ranger who's eyes were wide open and had a smile like a little kid wit a new toy, for he had two shiny shortswords in each hand and was twirling dem by da hilt in huge circles.<br />
<br />
"Will you stop that?!" blurted Medsa almost screaming at Lilting.  She gave da halfling a look dat would have made fire turn to ice.<br />
<br />
"I can't help it!" said da halfling.  "I'm just too happy!  Too happy!  Too happy I am!  Bash is back!  Woo hoo!  Bash is...."  Lilting found dat his feet were somehow rooted to da ground and he no could move anymore.  He saw magical sparklies fade from Medsa's hand.  "Hey!"<br />
<br />
"And you," said Medsa looking back at Treehugger, "Will you stop with the whirling and twirling already?!"<br />
<br />
"I can't help it!" said Treehugger.  "These swords are just so cool!  They're lightweight, yet stronger than anything I've ever held!  And look!  Look!  See that?  On each blade there is a barbarian warrior locked in battle with a monster etched on the metal!"<br />
<br />
"I know!  I've seen it!" exclaimed Medsa who apparently was a bit high strung.  "You've only been showing us for the past two days!"<br />
<br />
"Yeah, I know.  I just like it when you get mad though.  Your face gets flushed and your eyes get wide so it makes it easier to see how pretty and brown they are."  Da ranger winked at da cleric.<br />
<br />
Medsa just sneered at da half-elf and faced forward away from him.  She wouldn't let him see it, but she was blushing and trying her best to keep her lips from curling into a grin.<br />
<br />
"Ye know," said Sir Yessir not really paying attention to anything, "This wooden boot actually is better than my real foot!  It's not nearly as painful to walk on.  There's no arthritis, corns, athletes foot, and this weird green fungus that burned.  I think I like it!"<br />
<br />
Da whole party shuddered wit revulsion at da mental image da paladin just gave dem.<br />
<br />
"So where are we headed, Bash?" asked Pyra.<br />
<br />
"Freeport.  Da oracle told me of a hermit dat lives out on an island in da ocean dat may have some information to where we need to go to find Smellybreath.  And since Freeport has da only boats dat can sail out into da ocean, well, me guessin' us gonna have to go back dere."<br />
<br />
"Guuuuuuys!" a faint voice shouted dat sounded not too dissimilar from Lilting.  "Wait up!  Come on!  I can't move!"  Da halfling's feet finally came free and he ran as fast as his tiny legs could to catch up.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Smellybreath sat on his throne tapping his fingers on one of da armrests.  Da goblin could feel <i>their</i> presence and waited patiently for dem to come.  How dey got here, he didn't know.  But he was confident dat dey would not stay long.  Da goblin thought to himself, "<i>Here they come.  Three.... two.... one...</i>"<br />
<br />
Da door to da goblin's inner room where his throne and altar was blew apart from some magical force.  In poured dozens of peoples all wit berry shiny armors and all carrying weapons dat had sparklies running up and down dem, or swords made of fire.<br />
<br />
"Hail a Smellybreath Goblin!" said da person at da front of da group.  He did not look too happy to see Smellybreath.<br />
<br />
"I will ask you this once and only once," said da goblin.  "How did you get in here?"<br />
<br />
"How?  How?!  What do you mean, <i>how</i>?!  I am Uber Boober, guild leader of the Flames of Heaven&amp;#153!  We can do anything and go anywhere!  We are always the first to do so!  Our "ShowDToT" Linux users have told us that you are a new spawn in this world and are very high level.  We have come to destroy you!"<br />
<br />
"You all must be powerful indeed if you come here boasting to kill me without even the slightest hint of fear amongst any of you."<br />
<br />
"We have spent our entire lives becoming powerful!  We're all just nerds who have nothing better to do with our time other than focus it all into fighting big stuff like you and getting cool weapons and armor!  We are betting you drop some nice phat l00t, so therefore you must die!"<br />
<br />
"You really think that I will give you something that will help you rule the world?"<br />
<br />
"Of course not!  In fact, we'll probably just sell what we find on your carcass for about 100,000 platinum pieces!  We just want to be the <b>first</b> to get it, have the picture of it up on the "internet" and have everyone else bow down before us because of our awesome power!  So prepare to die!"<br />
<br />
Smellybreath yawned.  "I grow tired of this.  Since you are all so powerful, you probably will be the only ones to ever figure out how to reach my castle.  This makes me much more happy.  It was nice knowing you, I guess."<br />
<br />
Da goblin outstretched his hands and shot forth a red lightning bolt.  It arced through Uber Boober and den spread out shooting through everyone else in da Flames of Heaven&amp;#153 guild.  An instant later, everyone in da guild was shrunken down to about an inch high.  Da goblin waved his hands again and all da guild members floated up into da air and was pulled towards da goblin.  Da goblin held out a bowl and everyone was deposited inside.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath looked down at all da tiny peoples in da bowl in his lap.  "You guys like being the first of everything, eh?  Well, here's something you may like.  You will be the first of the races to see what my stomach looks like from the inside."<br />
<br />
Da goblin grabbed a handful of peoples and den shoved dem into his mouth like popcorn.  Smellybreath chewed a little bit, swallowed, dan den spit out some tiny, tiny breastplates.<br />
<br />
"Now, let's see how my Fire Elemental Guardian is doing."  Da goblin waved his hand in an arc and in da air in front of him came da image of Fire standing in front of a big lake.  "Good, good.  He's progressing nicely."<br />
<br />
Smellybreath grabbed another handful of peoples and den sat back to watch da show.<br />
