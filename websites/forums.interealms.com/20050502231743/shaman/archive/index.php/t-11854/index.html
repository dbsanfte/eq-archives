<br />
Hopefully we will get half of the board to respond to this like we did the PoP stat bufs. They were magically changed after a huge rant and many petitions. Perhaps we can do the same for our broken dots.<br />
<br />
The Agro issue with shammy Poison dots is out of control. Please do one of 2 things.<br />
<br />
1) Up the damage so if we are going to get massive agro, at least make it sting some.<br />
OR<br />
2) Lower the agro and keep the damage the same.<br />
<br />
Also please FIX the Extended duration for dots to ALWAYS do another tick of damage for poison dots.<br />
<br />
Last thing, although nice but not a necessity, shorten the time for poison dots but UP the damage per tick so it comes out to the same amount of damage. This would encourage use in groups. Currently high end dots are pretty much used only for solo.<br />
<br />
Edit: added request for sticky to title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i lke my dots just fine. Ive learned to use the aggro i get . im one of the best solo class in the game cause of them in part. I have no problems getting groups as it is , so i dont see how this would help me.<br />
<br />
I just dont see a reason to support this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While our dots are fairly substandard in pve, they are downright horrid in pvp. I'm better off nuking in pvp right now. Nothing ever lands, and if it does the dots are easily (too easily) cured and even when not the damage done is totally subpar. So I'm all for changing/upgrading how dots work. <br />
<br />
BUT, if a change to dots involves yet another reduction of counters in an attempt to reduce the agro they draw I am going to object very loudly. After the PoP dot retuning (no initial dmg and reduced counters) our two top dots Ultor and Saryrn are as easily cured as my lvl5 dots.<br />
<br />
While I realize the pvp servers were never and will never be anything but yet another marketing tool for SOE which they pay little to no heed, I will not sit quietly when the players try to push for change which will result in further headaches for me. So consider me having said it now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets see.. the fact the the extended item does not extend your dots part of the time does not affect you?<br />
<br />
The fact that you cant let dogdog tank if you go heavy on dots Does not affect you?<br />
<br />
The fact that you cant go heavy on dots in a raid because you will get your *** summoned and beat down does not affect you?<br />
<br />
Do you actually PLAY a shaman? And if you do do you do anything besides slow?<br />
<br />
I've talked to a number of shammys on Sol Ro about this. They fall into 2 categories. The ones that mainly slow and group, and the ones that are not the main slowers in raid, and solo alot. Group one could care less if dots are broken. Group 2 cares greatly. I guess it matters how you play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">DoTs should be:<br />
1/5 the aggro<br />
1/4 the mana<br />
1/3 casting time<br />
<br />
Then a shaman could actually layer dots and it wouldn't be so bad if the dots didn't run to completion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Haven't you yet learned to ignore Litgruv, Flargly ?<br />
<br />
The issue with our DoTs has existed for a long time now.<br />
<br />
The resist rate is plain broken, yet they cost more mana than other classes DoT's.<br />
Disease DoT's are the bigges joke there is in EQ. A DoT doing 3.4 k in 2 mins and 36 seconds ? Nope, it isn't unresistable if that was your hope. It ****ing sucks and is easily resisted 30% of the time on exp mobs(exp mobs, funny huh?)<br />
<br />
Lowering the counters was a slap in the face to all PvP shamans. The reduction of the poison counters did jack ****. Tash only adds 1 poison counter, that said you knew reducing the poison counters would just not cut it.<br />
Besides there's other ways of reducing aggro on spells and it has been done in the past. Attach a hate reduction to the whole spell line.<br />
<br />
So what i ask Sony to do is to fix what VI screwed up long ago.<br />
<br />
- Add a -100 resist adjust to all poison DoT's shamans get(Think about how many happy PvP people and some necros too)<br />
- Attach a hate reduction to the spell, that applies, when it sticks<br />
- Make disease DoT's completely unresistable, if you don't want to drop the duration. <br />
Otherise<br />
- Cut the duration on Disease DoTs in half to actually underline our expertise in this realm and add a -50 resist adjust to the whole line<br />
- Possibly remove the DD portion on the disease and poison DoT lines as you did for Blood of saryrn(poison) and Breath of Ulthor(disease)<br />
<br />
This is overdue. You left us with sub par heals, totally changed(want me to say nerfed?) our prime ability(Slow), i think this would be a good start.<br />
<br />
Edit: If you want this stickied, you should probably add your request to the title, Flargly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just reduce the agro/resists and make ALL dots last 3-4 ticks.  Wouldn't think that would be so hard to do...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What level are you talking about? Are you 65? Maybe it's different there than 60 and under.<br />
<br />
Maybe you have the idea that all of our DoTs need to be stuck on every mob in every situation. Not so.<br />
<br />
I've had no trouble using our DoTs effectively 1-61. If a mob is resistant, debuff their resists. If agro is a problem, manage it; i.e. lay off the poison.<br />
<br />
About the only complaint I have is needing a couple more spell gems to hold resist debuffs and dots at one time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually disease dots are a niec form of damage when soloing say guardian wurms. The aggro from dots is fine and rather useful I'd say. The aggro while soloing is useful and if your planning on letting the dog tank you just mem a spell called root. On the other hand keeping aggro on you is pretty useful when your pet could die in a few seconds.<br />
<br />
As far as group wise I love the aggro because it's my way of getting the mob off the enchanters who can't take the damage. Aggro from dots is to useful I'd hate to see it changed but fortunatly I won't have to worry about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think DOTs are underpowered and have too much aggro but you will never get a consensus here, it's been hashed over many times. Unless you are soloing just ignore DOTs and get crit nukes and use the poison rains and velium strike or spear of torment. DOTs are worthless in a grouping situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am all for making some changes to dots. There are a lot of good suggestions here:<br />
<br />
I'm shaman #5 in a high velious level raiding guild. After slow or malo (if I'm even on that) there isn't all that much for me to do besides attempt to deal damage. Most of the time I have to completely rely on ice strike/torment/JBB because dots either:<br />
<br />
A) Bounce almost every single time on the boss mobs they'd be useful on. About the only dot's I ever land on mobs like Dain and PoS minis are epic and occasionally Pox and thats on a mob with Malosinia, Tash, and sometimes bard debuffs. <br />
<br />
B) They are useless on mobs being killed to clear to target. They die far too fast (old world) or resist just as much as boss mobs (planes).<br />
<br />
So during raids I get to sit and nuke like a level 39 wizard with a lot more resists. <br />
<br />
Adding dot stacking into the game was a great idea to make shamans and necros more stackable on raids. Now they need to make the dots more useful themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shaman DoTs are just fine the way they are.  I break out the poison DoTs every time I go out and solo, but I do have to admit that the disease DoTs tend to slip towards the back of my spell book.  It's rare that I'm fighting something that lives as long as the disease DoT lasts.<br />
<br />
In a group situation, our DoTs are fine too.  /assist MA, /pet attack.  Give dogdog a couple pokers, and you're just fine. <br />
<br />
There are always going to be exceptions here, but that's the beauty of playing a shaman.  We have the tools to adapt to many many different situations.  Use what you've got, and if you're not satisfied with your results, keep trying new tactics until you are.  Trust me...that'll get you a lot further than bitching about being underpowered on a message board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Everyone in this thread who has said our dots are fine, with the exception of one person, has recommended to lay off them or use another avenue for damage.  And you say they are not broken?  They are our prime ability, our MAIN spell line.  I agree that the aggro can be useful sometimes for getting adds on to you, but cmon there are many other ways to do that if you think about it.  DoTs are way broken and I think its time they fixed them.  <br />
<br />
Loving the idea about the -100 resist factor and shortened duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Problem is that being versatile doesnt cut it. In the high end game (you are either already here or heading here, at your own pace) you want specialized abilities that you truly excell at to be viable in a group/raid atmosphere. Being mediocre at just about everything doesnt make you good. In Kunark it worked, in PoP it doesnt. <br />
<br />
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but saying our dots are just fine the way they are makes me wonder when last you played any other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why is it that whenever someone makes some very reasonable, not at all game-unbalancing suggestions to fix something that could use some improvement people come out of the woodwork and say pointless things like &quot;we don't need DoTs fixed.  Just use nukes&quot; and &quot;we don't need DoTs fixed.  Just slow and send in the pet&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I'd like to ask those who feel that DoTs shouldn't be fixed what the negative consequences would be of fixing them?<br />
<br />
How exactly would making a poison DoT last 4-5 ticks instead of 7 cause a problem?  <br />
<br />
How exactly would establishing a minimum of 1 tick improvement to DoTs if you're using extended affliction cause a problem?<br />
<br />
How exactly would fixing the resists / agro on DoTs slightly so the Nth shaman on a raid can do slightly more efficient damage on bosses without getting insta-summoned and killed cause a problem?<br />
<br />
I understand objecting to things on the basis that it'll undercut someone elses role or that the shaman will be less fun to play if it's changed.  But time and time again I see people coming out of the woodwork and saying stuff which is obviously broken doesn't need fixing, but giving no coherent reason why.<br />
<br />
At least the guy who didn't want the agro changed said he likes using poison dots as an agro tool.  I personally think cripple is a sufficiently good agro tool myself and would like to be able to toss a bane on a mob without immediately getting agro.<br />
<br />
I agree with most of the suggestions for improvements to DoTs.  They are not very usable in xp groups, nor are they especially usable in raids as they currently are.<br />
<br />
When my level 49 druid routinely sticks drifting death on a mob and my level 58 shaman promptly has bane resisted, it feels a bit absurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just wanted to add I also think DoTs are broken at the higher end of the game.  I've always liked using my DoTs, but the number of situations where this is practical is dwindling to almost nothing.<br />
<br />
I am going for crit nukes so I can have a higher DPS in raids and groups.  To me this doesn't mean &quot;DoTs are fine, just go ahead and switch to nukes&quot;, it means &quot;DoTs are broken, so I have to resort to our gimpy nukes.&quot;  (Don't get sidetracked here, I'm not saying fix the nukes.  That our nukes are gimpy is a fact, not a plea for better nukes.)<br />
<br />
The only thing I'd add to the good suggestions here on fixing DoTs is that we need an AA skill (or two) for DoTs as well.  Faster casting, less mana, more damage, whatever, just improve the DoTs at the base level, then give us a chance to improve them again ourselves with AAs.  <br />
<br />
The Shaman class isn't broken and I have no desire to play another class.  However we could use a little retuning, and this change would go a long way towards that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;The fact that you cant let dogdog tank if you go heavy on dots Does not affect you?&quot;<br />
<br />
I myself like this, i prefer soloing in wide-open zones, which allows me to cast a dot, which will aggro the mob, and let pet attack while i run the mob around. If you prefer in door/dangerously close add places, then i can see your point. I however think it has something to do with our pets taunting, IE, its skill is too low to keep taunt, ive always felt its taunt isnt as strong as it should be.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fact that you cant go heavy on dots in a raid because you will get your *** summoned and beat down does not affect you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You are DoTing too early then..... by the time you should be doting(after MT calls attack, after slow has landed), you should have no problem at all DoTing, and there is no need to sit down to med(which might grab you aggro), as you can just canni &amp; torpor/stoicism<br />
<br />
You raise some good points, a lot of yall do, i think a rehaul in the Poison lines would be called for. Playing on a pvp server I find it too hard to land BoN unless the guy is lower level, the resistance check is sucky =/</div></div><hr />

You misunderstand my intent. I currently don't use them much for the reasons listed. I do gimp along and &quot;get alot further&quot;. The problem still exists that they are broken and need to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Not using them is NOT the answer. In a raid me sitting there nuking like a lvl 39 wizzy (like someone else mentioned) cause I cant get a Dot to stick isnt the answer either. The Dots are supposed to be our primary form of spell damage as a shammy. Hence the dot effect on our Epic. Hence the post 60 dot spell line. Hence the crap D's we get. The fact that they are NOT working as intended needs to be raised so that SOE KNOWS that is broke and that we are unhappy with them.<br />
<br />
Sure. It totally possible to play a shammy and do literally NO damage if grouped. You can simply maloxx/slow/heal. Not all shammy want to play this way. Some want to do damage. Its simply ignorant to tell people to shut up and find another way to be useful. Note: this is not a direct poke at you, im talking in generalities.<br />
<br />
Like i said earlier, alot of shammies are happy to play the healer then step back. Being a versatile calss though, some of want to do damge. We feel frustrated that we are not able to do so given the current situation. We dont mind not being &quot;great&quot; nukers. We just want dots that stick, do a reasonable amount of damage, and not agro us like mad.<br />
<br />
To the person that griped that reducing dot agro would mess us up because we could no longer tank and dogdog would get eaten:<br />
<br />
Load the lowest spell of the cripple line. Its uber agro and chain casted (at next to zero mana) will pull a mob off of any, and I mean anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you arnt lvl 65 and you dont own blood of sarnyn and breath of ultor along with all the other dots.. Dont post here. You are a waste of time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Again do damage too slow. Disease dots are even more of a joke. <br />
<br />
3 ticks for poison and 6 ticks for disease dots.. Go ahead make this apply to 61+ dots if you want. Would put us in a better place along with all the other dot users. <br />
<br />
Let this apply to necros,druids also. <br />
<br />
Other idea would be to make extended affliction lower the amount of ticks and increase the amount of damage per tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Dot's are funny.  2 dot's on 90% of warriors and I tank.  2 dot's on hybrids and I'm usually ok, but I run them out of mana fast.  Dots on a long boss mob is fun.   After you see the attacking animation on the MT, sit down, watch him turn and stare at you.  Stand up before the next round of attacks =)  Great way to pass the time.  Do it at low health and see how many people you can kill with enrage!  Have compitions with your fellow shamans and see who can get summoned first!  No, dot's are not broken at all.  I mean, I was probably doing around 80-90dps ! ! ! <br />
<br />
This isn't about being under powered.  This isn't about not finding a good way to use them.  This isn't about trying to be overpowered.  This is about having a tool that doesn't work.<br />
<br />
As for casting dots early, try it at anytime durring a long fight.  You'll get very high on the agro list quickly.<br />
<br />
You can't really cut the durration to 1/2, because our DPS would go through the roof (or double).  If it was just done to the disease line, then what's the point of our poison line?<br />
<br />
A -resist adjust would be nice, but I wouldn't hold my breath.  At 65 after malos I don't see many resists.<br />
<br />
What I would love to see:<br />
<br />
1) Agro reduction component.  Agro compared to DPS is silly.<br />
2) Cut duration on poison dots to 36 seconds<br />
3) Reduce casting time (8 second ebolt is silly)<br />
<br />
1 might happen, 2 + 3 aren't gonna happen unless we bitch like druids/Sony's feeling nice.<br />
<br />
Mana reduction isn't gonna happen.  How else would they balance our mana regen?<br />
Resist reductions aren't gonna happen.  We have malo and are expected to use it.  Everyone gets resists.  <br />
<br />
As for boss mob resists, have a necro cast there pr/dr resist debuf and have the druids cast there newer ac/attk debuff that doesn't have the Fire debuff component.  It helps resists alot.  Sorta sucks tho, dru's are attached to there older fr debuff and that doesn't stack with the necro debuff =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">compare our Disease dot to Poison dot, poison dot have instant insane agro but disease dot have zero instant agro but build agro over time from damage done, this instant agro is unfair, it should build over time after damage done like our epic/disease/other class dot<br />
<br />
remember 1 year ago ? our disease debuff or disease dot used to huge agro and many shaman use it as taunt spell; later they add disease counter to slow spell and remove agro from disease counter, because it cause extra unwant agro for slow<br />
<br />
now, Disease dot/debuff not longer have extra instant agro; but  poison dot still have poison counter which is cause instant huge agro, this share same counter to chanter's Tash line so I think it hard to fixed poison agro by simply<br />
<br />
the problem for poison dot is : it have instant agro from poison counter, and damage agro over time, I think it should remove instant agro and fixed agro on Tash's line so it won't calculate agro from poison counter<br />
<br />
really, I don't care about this extra unfair agro, everyone have learn how to deal with it like we did with old disease dot/debuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">actually, at 65 I'm for the first time happy with my dots. On a typical BoT exp group, I cast malos, turgurs, BoS, BoN and epic dot, then canni back up.  So I get to cast 5 usefull spells, do about 6500 dmg and do it at a rate I can basically sustain indefinitly. Aggro is only an issue if you have a bad warrior tanking, with a decent warrior or a palladin tanking I get hit once every 10 mobs.<br />
Disease dots are still underpowered, I only load uthor and pox when I fight a poison restant mob, or when soloing something with high hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It isn't a huge issue to me, but I think DoT aggro could stand to be reduced.  I can land a ~ton~ more damage via tears of saryn or ice nukes than I can using blood of saryn before getting aggro.  They don't need to be equal, but it would make more sense if they were at least roughly comparable.<br />
<br />
The main issue with increasing DoT power in other ways is that making them more group/raid friendly would in most cases make them more solo friendly, which is something VI doesn't want, especially with the reintroduction of root-dotting in PoP (indeed, solo root dotting is much easier becuase of the removal of DD components from PoP dots).<br />
<br />
Perhaps introducing &quot;affliction compression&quot; focii or AAs, where the DoT does the same damage but in x% less time would help a little.  This wouldn't help soloing that much because it would not affect damage per mana, only damage per second.  It would,however, be a significant boon to grouping.<br />
<br />
again, not a huge issue, but a couple tweaks would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Guys *sigh think of it from the way the game is programmed now.<br />
<br />
1.  Rain Damage only counts against you for the first wave.  The other two waves don't generate agro.  (Its even hard coded if the mob is low enough health second and third wave will always be resisted.  The mob would pop otherwise.)<br />
<br />
2.  Poison dot agro is generated once for landing, then again for doing initiate damage.  That gives you 2 strikes right there.  Look at your fellow necros in a raid they can lace multiple dots because of no initial damage.  Hell, if you don't believe me, those shamans with their epics, how is the epic dot for agro?  <br />
If you all, seriously want to see less agro and not to mention less resists then ask verant to get rid of the initial damage poison and disease dots do when they hit.<br />
<br />
3.  Some shamans here do like the aggro poison dots create.  As explained above you don't want to take damage soloing with your dots and you want Dogdog to tank for you... Then Use root.  It works for even summoning mobs.  Some of us like to sow dogdog and aggro kite.<br />
<br />
4.  In raids in a long fight, I hope by know we get an unresistable disease debuff.  When push comes to shove with resists towards ice and poison.  I like the feeling to know our chance of lacing a disease dot is there somewhere!  And yes, I have had the satisfaction of after several poison and ice resist I finally got a disease spell to land.  So please don't whine about our disease line ALWAYS getting resisted.<br />
<br />
5.  Many will say that a mob only lives for 30 seconds on average to a group engaging it for exp and I have news that is not end all average time unless charm killing.  <br />
<br />
6.  I have a 200 in evocation and I still get fizzles on my rains.  It pisses me off a lot.  I also get a bit of resists, often wondering why do I try. <br />
<br />
I don't agree, I think our dots are fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Resists are horrid, dps is horrid, the aggro I can live with, but our dots really are useless unless soloing. And the only reason they are uselful soloing is we kill slow as molasses solo. Its much more efficietn to just use the rain nukes for damage, at least the 3 waves have a chance of landing before the mob is dead.  I haven't used a dot in an exp group in a very long time.  <br />
<br />
BoN and Pox are the worst.  Very expensive in mana and resisted 40% of the time on the minority of mobs that are not outright immune.  If you assume that we must debuff for each one, then you have added hundreds of mana to their already high price.<br />
<br />
Tainted breath is great for taunting when duoing with a rogue though :P.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">1.  Aggro on Poison Dots should be counted only 1 time, not 2.<br />
<br />
2.  Disease dots are just fine as they are.  I use them in VT all the time.  I've only been summoned 2 times due to dot aggro towards the end of mobs life mainly because I stacked 5 dots on it because the group had 3 healers, which meant I got to goof off.<br />
<br />
3.  Extended Affliction should extend dots for the full amount.  If they are not, it's a timing issue that we should not accept.<br />
<br />
Some above posters have made good observations about our DoTs and their comment should not be discounted out of hand because you may not aggre with them.  EQ is much simpler and easier now than it was 3 years ago.  While it is easy to get to 65 now, making all the aggro issues pathetic would take a chunk of skill out of the game that I personally think Shaman need.<br />
<br />
While I did say in 1 that poison dot aggro should be reduced, that's going from personal experience where I Malo, Turgur a mob, wait till it's at 80%, cast BoN and promptly get summoned.  This is with a warrior with good gear and a damn good weapons.  That to me is just silly.  But opinions may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I work on around 70%/60% usually, and find I don't get summoned by the Mob. I usually Malosini (Ghetto Shaman 101), Turgur, Epic wait until 70% then BoN.  Both my Epic and BoN spells generally have time to run their full course, depending on the group/where I am hunting. If the group you are in is killing too quick for either of these to run their course, does it really matter? <br />
<br />
Rather than just dotting as soon as you can, it doesn't hurt to experiment and find out what you can get away with agro wise, and then learn from that experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I agree that the duration for disease dots should be shorter. But personally I like the aggro on the posion dot's. Meny is the time I have had to use Bane or blood to jerk aggro off a clr. And has for the pet tanking and all of that noise. At 65 I cant think of a mob one that I XP on atm that the mutt could &quot;Effectivly&quot; tank for longer than say 20-30 seconds. Problly more like 10-15 seconds. AKA a head start to zone becuse a repop or romer cautgh you with your pants down :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">It amuses me that people constantly refer to our direct damage spells as if they were unacceptably weak.  Consider:<br />
<br />
Velium Strike<br />
925 damage, 300 mana, 7.8 second cast time<br />
<br />
Spear Of Torment<br />
675 damage, 275 mana, 4.2 second cast time<br />
<br />
Tears Of Saryn<br />
1950 damage, 450 mana, 6.0 second cast time<br />
* expect 1 wave to be resisted on average<br />
<br />
These are not horrible spells; considering our mana regeneration capability, we are able to cast these spells OVER and OVER and OVER to deliver very respectable damage over time.  How much damage do you reasonably expect to do during a fight?  <br />
<br />
In raid situations, when the call comes to nuke, I can do ALOT of damage in a relatively short period of time.  If you have spell casting fury 3 and fury of magic 3 and spell casting mastery 3 (and an ODS) then you are able to output a tremendous amount of damage.  If you are lucky enough to have an improved damage 4 item (such as the mage summoned bracelet) you can do even more damage.  <br />
<br />
What do you want to be?  A wizard?  To me a shaman is a debuffer first, a healer second, and a nuker third.  Are we the best nukers?  No.  Are we the worst nukers?  Depending on the situation, sometimes yes and sometimes no.  Does being only half as good (or one third as good) as a wizard mean that we are somehow inadequate?  No.  <br />
<br />
Regarding DoTs (the original subject of this thread) I actually prefer them WITH the excessive agro.  I find it somewhat useful to be able to pull a mob off a person or my pet when the situation calls for it.  It allows me to control the fight much more efficiently than I otherwise would be able to.  <br />
<br />
I would agree that the extended duration focus items should aways add another tick (strikes me as a bug that they do not).<br />
<br />
I would disagree with increasing the damage of our DoTs.  Considering that we can already stack them, this would push our DPS beyond that of other pure damage dealing classes.  We are not the wizards of the DoT.<br />
<br />
Same damage, half the time?  Same issue.  That means you can do twice the damage in the same amount of time as the original spell.  Again, not fair to the other classes.<br />
<br />
The only real solution would probably be cut the time in half, cut the mana in half, and cut the damage in half.  That might be an acceptable solution.  <br />
<br />
Do I DoT in experience groups?  No, not really.  I prefer to nuke in experience groups because by the time I finish malo/slow the mob doesnt HAVE 42 seconds left to live.  I, however, still have alot of unused mana regeneration capability.  Instead of wasting it, why not do 4k of damage in 32 seconds (if you are unlucky and do not crit) or, more likely, 5k.  You can do that, and still regenerate your mana to full before the next fight.  Or perhaps the mob is still VERY health after malo/slow?  Well, then.  Thats what tears of saryn is for.  Tears, Velium Strike, Tears, Velium Strike, and so on.  Depending on the quality of your tank, you can actually get away with quite a bit of this.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, you will find no real concensus on this subject because it comes down to what you think the shaman class is.  Some, like me, fall into the debuffer/healer/nuker/dotter/jack-of-all-trades category and some fall into the good-at-some-stuff-but-superb-at-one-thing category.  To each his own, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I think DOTs are underpowered and have too much aggro but you will never get a consensus here, it's been hashed over many times. Unless you are soloing just ignore DOTs and get crit nukes and use the poison rains and velium strike or spear of torment. DOTs are worthless in a grouping situation. <br />
<br />
       Agree . forgot dot (resist ,aggro ,mob dead before they end and all in all weak dmg) and use nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I think they should let us land a Critical DOT.  Maybe at 20 to 30% more damage over the same amount of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sad thing is that everyone is entitled to his opinion and as much as some people might hate that comment, i had to say it. <br />
Of course sometimes you can pull the aggro off a caster with a poison DoT and feel like a ****ing hero, but how many classes who tank better than us, have tools to counter their high aggro ? Or do you think Shamans tank better than say Rangers ? Yet some seem to think using them as a taunt spell solves the issue. It doesn't, it's still horse ****.<br />
<br />
There difference in tankability between a Shaman and a caster with the same skills is marginal at best. In PoP it is negligeable, so drop that legend that Shamans can tank somewhat compared to a caster.<br />
<br />
I bet 50% of the posters in this thread still think that the DD portion on our DoTs had a separate resist check and this alone makes me wonder why anyone should ever listen to this comunity.<br />
<br />
Anyways, i realize this cause is lost. Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

Despite the usual posters who simply say &quot;I don't like it&quot; without offering anything constructive (thereby making me wonder how pathetic their lives must be that their idea of fun is critisizing other people's suggestions on message boards, but that's just me), I think its great to at least have a debate/discussion about the issue.  Personally I weigh in with the opinion that are DoTs aren't &quot;broken&quot; per say, but at the same time the game has changed with PoP, and shaman DoTs haven't changed enough to keep up with it, which is something which I think could be improved.  There have been several suggestions as to how to do this, now let's just cross our fingers and hope the devs have a similiar discussion over one of their meetings.</div></div><hr />

The real problem is that there are current inequaties in warrior taunt.  Throw all your dots while a good paladin or shadow knight is tanking, then throw your dots against a warrior of the same caliber.  If you don't notice a difference immediatly, you're blind.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Well there are 2 sides to this story.<br />
<br />
Side 1: our dots are fine, the agro on it aint to high. However the ability to taunt for tanks is broken. In effect this turns our dots into a useless spell as we can not use the high DPS ones (the poison line generates a lot more agro the the disease line) and the long lasting, low DPS ones are to slow.<br />
<br />
Side 2: our dots are broken. Looking at a recent remark from SoE about the dots I myself think this is the case.<br />
They do not deliver the Damage that is needed to justify the mana they cost:<br />
There is hardly any focus item or AA skill that gives an improvement to them<br />
They generate to much agro (Poison line)<br />
They get resisted to much (even the ones without DD part are still an all or nothing spell)<br />
They are not mana efficent in a &quot;fast and furios&quot; PoP where mana is hardly ever an issue (battle last to short)<br />
<br />
To fix this I think that agro reduction, Duration decrease (with the same overall damage) and Focus items/AA skills that grant a critical dot (double damage while running) and/or a lowered resist would go a long way in solving this issue</div></div><hr />

As far as EQ not being a skill , i have to disagree , pretty much anything you do in life is a skill .  Most everyone can do most everything , its how well they do it is that is the measurement of skill. Ive seen very skilled chanters that can dance around your raiding party mezzing as needed and charming as needed and instinctivly know when a mezz is going to break , not using a timer mind you , but just have a feel for when the mezz is going to break , kinda like when you fighting Terris Thulle or something and you just know whem slow is going to wear off. Thats a skill , as are many things in this game IF played correctly.</div></div><hr />

What would be reasonable is that Blood/Breath should have a -50 or -100 resist check.

Intresting idea , the other thread talking about this i didnt agree with , well i just said i wouldnt use it. But giving us this AA would  allow us to tailor our aggro managment.

I dunno , i stand by the agrro we have , i like getting hit , i like pulling aggro , i use it to my advantage , but this would possible help other people in the game.

Slows Primary?    Guess someone forgot to tell the mitigation that, so Beastlords and chanters prime ability to slow too?<br />
<br />
Shaman do not have a prime ability..if anything thier prime ability would be canabalize buts a little different. <br />
<br />
All POP dots are messed up. For some reason when making dots for each class they just upgraded the damage on them a little but they didnt bother to look at what people were casting them on.  Pop fights are fast.  They arnt stamina fights like luclin. You gotta burn  down stuff fast. Dropping dots on it can do that but you gotta put down about 5 dots to get any realistic damage. This causes aggro,, too much aggro really when you add in malo(s)  and slow.   How is it something that does 300 damage tick causes you to get soo owned when a wizard can drop 3k nukes and have nothing happen?  The Aggro is messed up , There is something wrong in thier system that is starting to rear its head as the damage  is increasing. <br />
<br />
Anyways back to the dots. Dots need to be faster then they are not but not faster then nukes. During encounters it needs to be Plausable to drop  1 or 2 dots on a mob at a time and have it do some decent damage. We got dots because we have other duties to attend to. (Debuffing, rebuffing, some healing) Many classes can do this debuffing though and just as well in most cases.  Anyways in order to make dropping 1-2  acceptable as a way of doing damage to mobs you must lower thier duration. <br />
<br />
This should only apply to POP dots because they are the &quot;NEW&quot; dots which should be balanced to the &quot;NEW&quot; fast encounters.<br />

<br />
By lowering the duration to 3 ticks you do a nice chunck of damage in a short period of time.. its much less then a druid or mage or wizard can do nuking in the 25 seconds it takes for this spell to work its magic. This is exactly the same damage it would do in the 7 ticks but cut down to 3 ticks. <br />
<br />
Some people might say then the focus effects of EA 4 wont work with it.. The point is not to make the dots last LONGER but to LOWER the duration but keep the same damage goin. <br />
<br />
I guess an Idea would be to  make it 4 ticks at the start but have some focus effect cut it down to 3 ticks if that is possible to do? I doubt too many people know what the code monkeys at VI can do =( since most of the original team is gone and the new people have to figuring out *** the first people did. <br />

2.6 mins for that spell is unacceptable, POP is fast encounters not LONG LONG LONG ones.  <br />
<br />
This is one of the reasons we arnt loved in Trails in POJ.<br />
POP should be  Dots that HIT HARD and do not last long. <br />
<br />
These high damage dots would probably cause some aggro but can somoene explain to me WHY they would cause more aggro then a 3k nuke form a wizard or a 2k nuke from a druid or mage? <br />
<br />
We are not supposed to be able to draw aggro liek that with damage OVER time! If you wanna draw aggro use root and do proximity aggro. much ezier and more mana efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I think dots are fine. I could care less about the agro, I only use dots for soloing... maybe duoing.. thats about it. In groups I use Tears and on raids I use DDs. <br />
<br />
I am curious, Flargly if the majority of the shamans here thinks dots need to be fixed. I'd like to see a poll!<br />
<br />
I think this is the point though. Why don't you use your dots for grouping/raiding? They are near useless, thats why. Why should we be denied our best source of damage for what makes up most of the 60+ game?<br />
<br />
I absolutely love using my dots, but when I do my wife can't nuke at all because that breaks root and I'll get agro. Cleric can't nuke at all, nothing can use a procing weapon. Unless I have one of the three best tanks in the guild as a tank in an exp group I will pull agro if I use my dots. That is just broken. I know I have rain and nuke spells, but why shouldn't I be able to use my dots in these situations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I would be happy if all of our dots had their DD removed.  I am happy to keep my dots for solo use, but if I do that I would like to use the Shaman dot stacking that is available to me.  I would like to be able to stack 6 dots on a mob without it breaking root 75% of the time I cast one.<br />
<br />
While grouping, Im happy chaining a nuke with canni4.  Little aggro, 50+ dps, very little mana used with horse, c3, and mc3, plus I dont have to worry at all about how long the fight will last.<br />
<br />
Proposing to lower the duration of dots isnt the solution.  Poison dots are already seven ticks, which is already pretty short.  Lowering to three or four ticks is similar to a rain spell.<br />
<br />
I would like more AA for dots though.  AA's affecting duration, damage, crits, resists, aggro, effeciency, etc.  Its too bad VI hasnt expanded the class / archetype AA possibilities further :(<br />
<br />
As for the AE items, yes thats screwy and is certainly a bug.  I have had a Coldain Military Wristguard for quite a while and was not aware of the problem.  I will /feedback that tonight.<br />
<br />
In terms of gaining aggro, cripple or an additional slow works just about as well as a poison dot.  Theres also root, sitting, etc.  The reasoning behind keeping poison dots the way they are in terms of aggro is flawed, as one of the initial points is they are broken because they have too much aggro.  The defense is part of the original problem.  Keeping the aggro at their current level would be fine if the damage were scaled accordingly, as many have suggested.<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
<br />
Forgot to mention that if the DD isnt removed, then significantly lowering the resist check would probably be a sufficient fix as well.  Either / or really, but something that makes it so they dont break root as frequently and can be used while raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Forget the &quot;but I can use that aggro&quot; argument. I think that it is a red herring to talk about the benefit of being able to generate aggro, as a control tool. Sure it is tool that you can use, but its kind of a side effect. DoTs were not given to us so we could rescure enchanters. The fact that DoTs generate so much aggro is a pain in the butt, and it is a tribute to shaman inventiveness that we have found a way to at least get something positive out of something that is basically a negative.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of other ways to get aggro too (begging?) <br />

- Aggro on poison DoTs is beyond broken.<br />
- No AA skills associated with DoTs.<br />
- Due to DoTs being worthless in most situations (other than soloing), the associated focus effects are also mostly useless.</div></div><hr />

I dunno, but other classes seem to still generally view the shaman class as pretty well balanced and desirable for both grouping and raiding as well as capable soloers...  <br />
<br />
We have a wide variety in our spell line up, and that's why we work in any of those roles.  It's also why several of those spell lines are situational, i.e. DoTs, Rains, DR slow/debuff, Cripple...  <br />
<br />
DoTs could use a tweak here and there, especially in the aggro dept. on PR dots IMO.  But asking to make them do the same damage in half or less the normal time frame just doesn't make sense.  We aren't a damage dealing class, at least not a fast damage dealing class.  If you want to add some quick damage in a group, break out the Ice or Poison nukes and/or the Rains.  You're main job IS still going to be slow/debuffs and that alone is enough to make you desirable for most groups or raids.  The DPS is just a lil icing on the cake.</div></div><hr />

agro is fine because it forces you to control it and can come it handy in a lot of way that high end shamans have assimilated as a playstyle , and taking the aggro off would piss a good lot of people . <br />
lowering the mana cost would still leave a good deal of shamans pissed , because of the too long duration of most , and the inneficiency in groups / raid troubles .<br />

I'm sure if I had a crapload more AA and some better gear I'd have mana coming out my tail end, but DoTs are not solely a shaman problem. DoTs in general are just not that good any more. Look at a log of a wizard with maxed crit AAs and a mage bracer and tell me that nukes don't completely and totally own dots. There used to be some mana-to-damage ratio advantage of using DoTs, but that's pretty negligible in this stage of Everquest. DoTs need to be seriously looked at across the board, because they just don't cut the mustard anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree. How are slowing and debuffing my &quot;main&quot; job? In Pop I can only slow 5% better than a enchanter. An enchanter has mezz, charm ect. In the 25-50% of the mobs now that mitigae, a chanter or beastlord slows the SAME as me. Yes thats right. There is no difference in slows on a mitigating slow mob. This has been proved in umpteen other threads.<br />
<br />
So our main job as a slower is out the window. Or, if it is still our main job and other classes can do it just as well, then we plain out suck.<br />
<br />
Dont start with the argument that chanters cant tank as well in PoP. With thier runes its not an applical argument. Ok, so we can last 1 round longer than them. Maybe. Thats 3-6 seconds. Maybe.<br />
<br />
With beastlords you can make the argument that they do not have debufs therefor its harder to land thier slows. This is a valid argument. The only thing we seem to have is a unresistable debuf which is only 10 points better than the mage one at lvl 60. 20 in PoP.<br />
<br />
So what does this make us? The kings of debuf. Yeh. I'm wet. Being reduced to the kings of debuf is a boring role to play.<br />
<br />
If our dots were not obviously broken and useable it would take some of the sting off since we could debuf then land a dot or two and do some damage. You feel like you did something then. Helped the group out with thier spell damage with the debuf, then did some damage of your own. On a raid when thier is more than one shammy (Thats right sometimes there are 2 or 3 of us on a raid!) we might actually feel like we could contribute something. Right now I feel, and contribute, as much as a lvl 39 wizzy. Not because I dont know how to play my class or toon, simply cause there is nothing I can do to contribute.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Krac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">A quick and easy test as to just how broken our poison dots are would be a simple aggro comparison.  Take 2 shamans, pull something with high HP and have somebody tank it.  Have 1 shaman chain nuke and one stack dots.  See who gets aggro first.  <br />
<br />
If somebody has a wizard friend of roughly equal level, do the same thing.  Have the wizard nuke and the shaman stack dots and see who pulls aggro first.  I would not be suprised to find out that a shaman can pull aggro before a chain nuking wizard, despite the wizard doing far more damage.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, if somebody was feeling really bored you could try to find out what the nuke to dot aggro ratio was.  I.E., you have to do twice, three times or x number or times the damage the dots dish out with nukes to pull aggro from a shaman stacking dots.  Once again, I would expect that you have to do 3-4 times the damage with nukes to out aggro shaman dots.</div></div><hr />

I use my DOTs either when I solo or when it's versus a pure damage boss encounter where I've got little else to do. Exp groups I pull, spot heal, buff, slow, debuff. The MOBs die far too quickly to even get a DD off. If I get aggro, I stand there and get hit. I'm a Shaman, I can take a few hits and not panic.<br />

This game's easy enough as it is without having the devs hand you everything on a nice silver platter. Figure out another way to make yourself useful or re-roll as a damage class if you wanna do that in an exp group situation, and do us all a favor.<br />

I'm not sure how this requires us to have more skill.  As it is now, in many experience groups, I just slow and buff.  If our tank is a warrior, then dots are useless to use.  I have to wait until 50%-60% to cast, or else I get aggro/summoned every tick until the dot wears off.  And forget stacking dots.  The warrior will never get aggro back if I do that.  <br />

This is either a problem with warrior taunt, or with dots.  It doesn't matter to me which side of the problem is fixed, but one side certainly does.  <br />

<br />
DoTs are one of MANY things you can do in a group, raid, or solo situation.  Yeah, they're not as useful in a fast killing xp group, but they're great when soloing and have their use on certain raid type encounters.  You can say, &quot;BUT I feel useless on majorly mitigating or immune boss mobs and I can't contribute significantly!!!&quot;  Just wait till you see how significant all your melee feel when you're fighting mobs with 2k AEs that fire every 10 seconds and are unresistable...  The non-rangers just love being limited to bows/throwing weapons! ;)  The point being that you're not ALWAYS going to be able to make a big contribution on every single encounter.  Nor are you going to be able to use the same spell lines on every mob.<br />
<br />
Use that noggin of yers and find another way to contribute if you can't use PR DoTs, you have multiple avenues open to you.  <br />
<br />
With all that said, I DO think Ultor and Saryn need some tweaking, but I certainly don't think they need to be made into single target versions of our rain spells as some suggest (i.e. 3 tick duration mega damage spells)</div></div><hr />

This brings up a intresting point. Alot of people are of the mentality that the warrior is the tanka nd thats that , the pally and SK are there for back up DPS. While i solidly support this on a raid enviroment , in a XP group its another world. Most of my XP groups i look for a SK or pally to tank for me . Why you might ask ?  Aggro control. A pally or a SK have amazing instant aggro control. No they might not take a beating 100% as well as warrior , but its very rare that a warrior uses his defensive disc as soon as it pops anyway heh. I think thats where the difference of opinions are so varied , cause in my world , the pally/sk cure any aggro problems that you all ( warrior tanker ) might experience. Is this a broken warrior ? I dont feel it is , i think its giving a SK and pally a role to fufill and im happy for them. Why does it not affect me that they have instant aggro control ? Cause of this ... In a raid situation a warrior is the only person you are going to go with when a mob is swinging for 2k a pop unslowed. Def Disc &gt; SK/Pally insta taunt. If pally and SK do have this ability then correct me and ill chang emy opinion , but to my knowledge they do not have it. <br />
<br />
So to sum up the melee, SK and pally have a role that ( imortant) they DID NOT have before, no longer do you think of that &quot;gimp&quot; pally or SK or settle for them , you greet them with open arms. The warrior has his role to , eahc of the 3 are situational roles and have a strength in a area that the other doesnt. I feel its balanced and helps all be needed.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you people that cant DoT till 50% should try looking for a SK or pally to tank for a while and see if that works out ebtter for you ?<br />

Um, yeah.  I think they have a pretty good understanding of why DoTs gain so much aggro.  You, on the other hand, are completely clueless.    Please do yourself a favor and next time you go for the &quot;arrogant know-it-all&quot; flame strategy, try and make sure you have even one tiny clue what the hell you are talking about.  There is no shame in being wrong, but the particular blend of arrogance and ignorance you have displayed here just makes you look like a complete tool.<br />
<br />

Theres these things called poison counters.  Tash has em too...ironically (thank god), the malo line doesnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">The addition of two spells that are a great boon to shamans in my opinion, and they come at levels 56 and 60.  <br />
1) AoE poison rain spells 2) Torpor<br />
Torpor now exists in a lower form for shamans aka stoicism, however there aren't any effective AoE poison rain spells until you hit 56 and then again at 63.  Fixing dots would be pretty cool (I'm 60 now, and haven't found much use for them), but better still for those up and coming shamans would be to introduce more AoE spells on down to the youngins.  That way if they have extra manna after slowing and debuffing, they can let loose on the mob!  Tweak these spells out, and unleash the fury.  Just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">I dont know for sure,but i think damage plays a role , obviously its the poision counters that get inital aggro but ..<br />
<br />
well let me give a real example.<br />
<br />
I used to  Solo NG in Seb , i used to pull with slow and let puppy get aggro then  epic then BoN. Now , it would get to about 65 or so % and the epic , which has no inital aggro , would consistently pull the mob from puppy and on to me. I did no nukes i did nothing but sit there and let puppy chew down the mob , but once the curse started ticking with stronger damage , it brought me more aggro.<br />
<br />
This is why i dont really get excited when we talk about shortening the duration by increasing the damage per tick, i beleive it will screw up the aggro balance i have right now and i like the aggro i balanced just how it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Thats true Litgruv, actually I hadnt thought about how screwy the epic aggro is.  You can almost always tell when the epic is at the last few ticks :)<br />
<br />
Perhaps theres a parent aggro problem that, in turn, multiplies the poison dot aggro (because of the poison counters).  DoT's seem to just have too much aggro associated with the amount of damage that they do.  I have personally watched a druid friend of mine in NToV dot a mob a bit too much (all of I think 3 dots...).  The MT was either slowed or died, forget exactly, however he tanked the rest of the fight.  I dont know how many divine lights he was hit with, but NOBODY, not even the clerics spamming heals, could taunt it off.<br />
<br />
Sorry about the random first hand experience thrown in.<br />
<br />
Also Litgruv, your example doesnt make much sense though.  With puppy, BoN, and epic going on a mob it should be well down past 65 by the time the epic is wearing off no?  When Im down there the mobs dont last the entire length of BoN sometimes, let along the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">I agree with the line of the thread, disease dots are great atm, they do gradual damage over time. Poison dots, bane gets resisted a lot(even after malosinia on raids), I can easily get away with casting bane without getting aggro, but for its dps, its aggro is a little high, and needs to be tuned down a bit. I have 235 in evocation and cast torrent of poison fizzleless, pretty nice but usually a resist or so( even at 65), not sure whats it like with crits maxxed. I am curious.<br />
<br />
Basically yeah aggro on bane of nife especially should be toned down a bit, blood of saryn I imagine is ok.</div></div><hr />

No, I don't two box. No, I'm not in an &quot;uber guild&quot;. I guess either of those things would get me a completely different version of Blood or Bane?<br />
<br />
You don't need a BoC (or other proc-taunt weapon) wielding Warrior to take mobs off you if you use a Poison-based DOT. It's a really circumstantial situation, so I'm not going to bother arguing it beyond that.<br />
<br />
It's a pretty universally-accepted theory that damage does effect the amount of aggro attached to someone. It's definitely not the only factor (certain undamaging spells are huge aggro, among those are blinds, slows, charms, etc etc) but it's definitely a factor. If you're going to increase the amount of damage Blood does per tick, I don't think it's gonna take a rocket scientist to figure out what the result's going to be.<br />
<br />
For example, next time you're in an exp group with the classic tank/healer setup, experiment with the aggro you get. I think you'll find that the mob will flip back onto you after the tank pulls it off each time a tick of damage (every ~6 seconds) goes by. If you increase the amount of damage during this tick, you're also going to ramp up the amount the mob hates you. Think of it like you're hitting the mob for 320 every 6 seconds; it's quite a bit. The problem isn't that you're doing roughly 53 DPS while Blood's on the mob, the problem is that you're doing such a large amount &quot;suddenly&quot; to it each passing tick.<br />
<br />
Granted, there is likely a modifier to the amount of hate you're accruing simply because it's a Poison-based DOT, but the damage is a big part of it.<br />
<br />
I really don't think increasing the damage done per tick is the answer to reducing the aggro on our DOTs. Honestly, I don't see that they're in such a dire need of aggro reduction anyways.</div></div><hr />

- I duo with a dual EB wielding warrior. After slow, if I chose to poison DoT, (insert any yardtrash in PoP) turns on me for a good while until a few EB procs go in.<br />
<br />
It's a really circumstantial situation, so I'm not going to bother arguing it beyond that.<br />
- XP groups and boss mobs are circumstantial situation right?<br />
<br />
It's a pretty universally-accepted theory that damage does effect the amount of aggro attached to someone. <br />
- Yeah, that's why rangers and wizards outdamage even the next best line of DPS classes by a margin of 2 to 1 easy and have ZERO aggro.<br />
<br />
For example, next time you're in an exp group with the classic tank/healer setup, experiment with the aggro you get. I think you'll find that the mob will flip back onto you after the tank pulls it off each time a tick of damage (every ~6 seconds) goes by. <br />
- My experience is simple: mob is on me until warrior gets it off. No tick ping pong garbage. If I slow and DoT, I tank mob at least half of it's life expectancy.<br />
<br />
If you increase the amount of damage during this tick, you're also going to ramp up the amount the mob hates you. Think of it like you're hitting the mob for 320 every 6 seconds; it's quite a bit. <br />
- Yeah, I guess my uber 2.3kish damage is sooooo much that a mob can't handle it. Oh wait, nm, wizard just crit nuked for 6.5k! I do 320 damage in a tick, and the warrior using a good 2H does double of that. Hell a wizard in theory does 6.5k damage in ONE tick. Ooops, there go your aggro theories flying out of the window.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't that you're doing roughly 53 DPS while Blood's on the mob, the problem is that you're doing such a large amount &quot;suddenly&quot; to it each passing tick.<br />
- Care to explain then why a wizard who just critical nuked for 6k+ has no aggro problems? Or a ranger who did a sequence of six 2k hits with arrow? DoT damage has ZERO impact on aggro. If it did, I couldn't maintain Pox of Bertoxxulous and Breath of Ultor vitam eternam on a mob. Yet I can, and I don't have any aggro problems. Same time, if I use only one single poison DoT and after 4th or 5th cast, boss mob summons me. All this time tank has dual EB weapons.<br />
<br />
Granted, there is likely a modifier to the amount of hate you're accruing simply because it's a Poison-based DOT, but the damage is a big part of it.<br />
- Big part? Hell no. Casting a few Blood of Saryrns gets me killed fast, while maintaing Pox/Ultor, dingos, spear DoT and nuking a mob the same time does nothing to my aggro.<br />
<br />
 Honestly, I don't see that they're in such a dire need of aggro reduction anyways.<br />
- If you don't beleive me, cast 5 Bane/Ancient or Blood of Saryrn on any boss mobs. Maybe 6 ... Tell me if you live. Then look around at rangers, wizards and ask yourself: why did I just get killed for 30ish DPS when the wizard is running around with 200 DPS?<br />
<br />
How many classes can't use their most efficient ways of dealing damage in raid and/or XP situations? ONE: shamans. Our most efficient source of damage is reduced to a soloing tool. Wonder what would happen if Strike of Solusek would get wizards repeatedly killed. Will they complain? Hell yeah.<br />

<br />
i have to agree. I only use dots when soloing because in exp groups, it's not useful to cast them til the mob is half dead, then my dot wont even take half effect anyway. just a waste of my mana<br />
<br />
sure, you CAN cast a dots after your tank has maintained enough aggro.<br />
but by the time they have enough aggro ((especially a warr)) its not even worth it to dot it.<br />
<br />
Even if there WASNT the huge aggro, i doubt i would dot. hmm, one bane over time that probably will take half or 3/4 affect at most or a few spears of torment which i can just cast quick and feel that i'm actually doing something?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">I am going to have to disagree with you all and say our DOTs are NOT broken.<br />
They do great damage, the poison dots are satisfactory duration, the resists are fine when they properly debuffed, gotta realize there are some mobs which are simply much more innately resistant to PR/DR spells than others. I do agree the cast time is a tad slow. it wouldnt hurt to cut 2 seconds off all our dots cast times.<br />
<br />
Now what i think you want to say is that AGRO is busted.<br />
This is 100% true, agro has been broken for a very long time, not just on our dots but on many aspects of the game<br />
<br />
On a boss fight you think its correct a wizard can do 50,000 damage on a mob and never get summoned?<br />
<br />
Do you think its correct a charmed enc pet can do 800 dps on any mob soloing and never get agro?<br />
<br />
Do you think its correct a rogue can backstab crits for thousands of points endlessly for hours and never pull hate?<br />
<br />
Do you think its correct a ranger can plink arrows at a mob infinitely doing absolutely ridiculous damage and yet stay unharmed?<br />
<br />
Do you think its correct for a shaman to cast 2 PR dots on ANY mob at ANY health and go from bottom of the hate list to the very top, even with a high gearred high AA War/Pal/SK using all their taunt spells/weapons?<br />
<br />
Do you think its correct that a shaman/enc creates twice as much hate on a failed slow than on a succesful one?<br />
<br />
No of course it isnt.<br />
<br />
These are all examples why the agro system itself is horribly out of whack ATM. SOE has posted that they are very aware of this bug with agro and from what i heard the changes are already on test.<br />
<br />
Once agro is fixed you will find that our dots are no longer &quot;broken&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong way to look at it. The fixes they are doing are to ranged combat. Not specific spells. They will end up being even more out of whack when it's all said and done.<br />
<br />
Excluding agro though, the dps of DOT's is way to low for the way the game is geared though. Even if I didn't get agro off ebolt It's still only 50/50 that full damage will occur. Id rather cast a rain, which isn't the way it should be.</div></div><hr />

are you kidding?<br />
If i stacked bane (214 per tick) ancient scourge of nife(254 per tick) and blood of saryrn (320 per tick)<br />
im doing 788 damage every 6 seconds<br />
which gives me 131.33 dps. adding in the 2 DD components  150 on bane and 177 on ancient that brings us up to 136 dps. Now if you are using  a foci you can increase that even higher.<br />
<br />
136 dps is just fine .<br />
The reality is we cant cast those 3 dots at once on a boss becuase its an automatic death sentance to any shaman who uses it. Any decently equipped melee can do the same DPS but without drawing any taunt.<br />
Thats why agro is broken and thats why its being looked at.<br />
Wait til the agro fixes go in and you will see a signifigant change .<br />
It will be for the better</div></div><hr />

I do just great with my DoTs , im stacking them in XP groups, im using them to yank aggro from a caster getting hit for 700's+. I use it as aggro control in many cases which is a big reason i dont support this view , as i stated.<br />
<br />
This is a good agurment for why dots need to be fixed.  If you are using dots to pull aggro from casters, you have made the mob unmezable, and if you root it, it will start summoning, because you have damaged it.  Maybe you are depending on the dot to be resisted?  If our primary source of damage is so resistable that it is a dependable way to Crowd controll, I think we have issues with dots.<br />
<br />
I think the following would fix dots just fine:<br />
<br />
-Keep the damage the same, decrease the amount of tics.<br />
<br />
-Add donals bp component to dot, preventing a recast too soon.  The goal is to ensure that the dot runs its course before the mob is dead, not to increase our dps.<br />
<br />
-Adjust aggro to be in scale with other dps types from other classes.  (just going to have to play this by ear until we see what happens with the suspected aggro changes)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actualy it was BoN that was wearing off around the 50-60 % mark and that was when the epic DoT would start getting big pulses and wouldpull the aggro off. <br />

At the time i didnt have SC , so i dont know if that is something your using , plus i didnt stack anything else , it was just slow/epic/BoN/sit and watch TV, nice and relaxed which is why i liked it.

<br />
Good point. That is very true. To be clear though im only using them situationaly like that. If its a summoning mob i can usualy hit up slow a few times and will pull off whoever , ofcourse if there is a enchanter in the group im not going to be using DoTs to gain aggro. Works well on a none summoning mob , you pull the add off and root it. Not only have you gained the aggro , but as its rooted its rotting. Again , its all situational and its about adapting to the moment.<br />
<br />
My point was that while the aggro might not be convienent at times , it has its uses if you adapt to it.</div></div><hr />

I did some calculations..  If our dots were balanced to  that of wizard nukes pre kunark.. or so our blood of saryn would cost us, 512 mana and do a total of 2769 damage, at a rate of 395 damage a tick.  <br />
<br />
And Breath of ulthor if it were to be like pox.. at 1.8 min = 18 ticks. it would be doin 189.22 damage a tick. alot better then 131 for 26 ticks.<br />
<br />
This seems more realistic for a dot.. kinda.  you gotta remember tho wizards specialize in evocation we specialize in alteration so we will still be paying more for our dots then they do for thier nukes.<br />
<br />
still making poison dots lets say 4 ticks and disease dots 8 ticks?  That would actaully put the dots more in inline with what they should be doin. Pop dots anyways.  Btw i dont know if this is just me thinking this.. but These dot changes should go for ALL pop dots for every class.</div></div><hr />

- Yeah, that's why rangers and wizards outdamage even the next best line of DPS classes by a margin of 2 to 1 easy and have ZERO aggro.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
While i cannot speak a lot for rangers when it comes to archery aggro their melee aggro is insane. I played a cleric to 51 and i was runnign away from having a ranger in my grp all the time?<br />
<br />
Why? Because doing far less dmg than a rogue and than the monk they qwere constantly drawing insane aggro by just meleeing. Then since they got sheet ac and hp their hp woudl melt away i coudl hardly land a heal when they were at 20% life and barely able to save them. No this was not one ranger. this was many rangers until i decided to say. U want ranger u lose cleric. Sad but had to do it.<br />
<br />
As for wizards. Dude no offense man but play one. Wizards get owned. Every time they nuke they pray to god cause if mob is pissed badly they only wearign robes and they can go down faster than they can get healed.<br />
While poison aggro is big and i agree it's no bigger than a similar dmg nuke. Let the melees do some damage THEN land it. If u poison dot at the beginning of fight or a wizard lands a huge nuke at the begining of the fight then of course the effects are quite the same.<br />
<br />
The enchanters need to tash early but we do not need to poison dot early.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">As for wizards. Dude no offense man but play one. Wizards get owned. Every time they nuke they pray to god cause if mob is pissed badly they only wearign robes and they can go down faster than they can get healed.<br />
<br />
- Our wizards don't get summoned. Hell, the whole time during our last VT clearing the only person that was summoned was a druid because MT died on enrage (thx AFK). The only encounters our wizards die from aggro is on Emperor encounter, and frankly because they don't care, it's beyond trivial and they go nuke frenzy. Want to explain why our wizards don't get summoned by Rallos Zek? They do the vast majority of the damage to it. Or can you explain why Ventani tanking is such an efficient tactic with many elemental bosses, yet it relies mainly on wizard and ranger DPS? No you can't, because the whole aggro system is F.U.B.A.R.<br />
<br />
While poison aggro is big and i agree it's no bigger than a similar dmg nuke. <br />
- Bullpoop. It's much bigger.<br />
<br />
Let the melees do some damage THEN land it. If u poison dot at the beginning of fight or a wizard lands a huge nuke at the begining of the fight then of course the effects are quite the same.<br />
- Yah, I started DoTing Aten Ha Ra at around 90% life. 6 or 7 Blood of Saryrn later I was summoned. Same time wizards are nuke happy and draw 0 aggro.<br />
<br />
Poison DoT aggro is broken. Elvis is dead. Accept it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Personally I'm fairly happy with the damage/time factor on our dots, although I'm probably as far from a damage dealing type of shaman as you can get, necros on the other hand get a harsh deal here though, they are supposed to be the equivilent of wizards, but with dots instead, yet in exp groups unless mobs are living more than 50 seconds, they are simply better off chaining neurotoxin.<br />
<br />
And yeah, pre 51 rangers do tend to have a harsh time with agro if they are not careful, but once they hit 51, if they have agro and are not meant to, they quite frankly deserve the beating so they learn there spell book's contents.<br />
<br />
Wizzy nukes do definately generate less hate than poison dots (Watch a heavily AA'd wizzy with Strike of Soluslek), although they also have hate reducers to help keep that damage output up over time which amplifies the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">This brings up a intresting point. Alot of people are of the mentality that the warrior is the tanka nd thats that , the pally and SK are there for back up DPS. While i solidly support this on a raid enviroment , in a XP group its another world. Most of my XP groups i look for a SK or pally to tank for me .  <br />
<br />
I love when we can find an SK to tank.  Paladins are usually very good also.  The problem is when we have a Warrior tanking.  <br />
<br />
My point of view is coming from the &quot;low end&quot; game.  My guild has people from level 60 to the high 40s that we group with.  It is a smaller guild and we are somewhat limited in the classes we have.  We have lots of Warriors, 1 Paladin and 1 SK.  We don't have the luxury of a large pool of tanks to choose from. <br />
<br />
Picking up players outside of the guild is an option that we would like to have, however, there just aren't that many choices of people /lfg.  There are usually plenty of druids, warriors and wizards to pick up, but many other classes are hard to find.  Almost everyone I run into is either mid to high 60s or 40s and lower.  There aren't many people that stick around the 50s for any time at all.  I assume it is because our server is older, and people are either perpetual low level players or want to get to 65 asap, so they can group with their friends.   <br />
<br />
Apparently many of you don't know what you're doing if you can't find anything to do in an xp group besides slow and DoT. <br />
<br />
I use my poison nukes whenever I can, spot heal, root, buff and do all the other things that shaman do.  Rains usually can't be used, unless you are in an outside PoP zone or something.  DoTs can't be applied on most mobs until well after their window of effectiveness.   <br />
<br />
There are always things that you CAN do.  The question is whether you are able to do them efficiently enough to make a difference in the group.  Personally, I hate not making a real difference in a group.  I know that my guildmates don't care that much if a person isn't able to pull their own weight all the time, but I hate to feel that I'm a charity case.  <br />
<br />
The fixes they are doing are to ranged combat. Not specific spells.  <br />
<br />
I'm curious how they are going to go about this.  If they add aggro to all ranged attacks, across the board, then our DoTs could potentially have more aggro added to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Zorlac: I debated whether or not to even bother responding to your posts, as I couldn't think of much to say that wasn't a personal attack. I'm not sure if you're even playing the same version of EQ as the rest of us.<br />
<br />
Rogues and Wizzies don't get damage aggro? That's cool, you should let them know that so they can just stop bothering to manage their aggro with evade and concussion. The Wizzies and Rogues in your guild are likely just rather good at dealing with the aggro they generate and thus aren't summoned very often. Wizzies (and int casters) get an AA called Spell Casting Subtlety which reduces aggro generated from spell casts.<br />
<br />
Ranger DPS - at least the DPS accrued from Archery - is currently broken (has been since release) in terms of the amount of aggro it generates, which is next to nil. It's sort of flawed logic to compare something Verant's admitted is completely broken to our DOT aggro.<br />
<br />
Our last Tallon fight I did 22k+ damage without drawing any aggro at all. I just sat there and chained Blood, Bane, and Spear the entire time after the debuffs landed. Granted that's a bit different of a fight, but had I gotten aggro over the others, I woulda been fried. I wasn't. It's not a massive amount of damage, but then again I'm not primarily a damage class like Wizzies are.</div></div><hr />

blood bane and spear? That will get you aggro on tallon.  You must be hiding ina corner between dots or something cause that will get your ass aggro on tallon..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">Didn't get aggro at all, and I was chaining Spear between DOT refreshes. I do the same thing every time we kill him, haven't ever gotten aggro on him. Malos, Malosinia, Crip, Blood, Bane, Spear until Blood wears off, redo Blood, redo Bane; rinse repeat until he's dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">Our dots cause uber agro at any stage. blood of saryrn our most efficent dot does 2240 pts over 42 seconds. a wizard nuke does 5k all at once and they can continue to do that for an entire fight from from start to finish with little to no agro.<br />
I cast 3 BoS during RZ and i will get summoned and killed. Knowing this i know not to even bother casting a dot thus basically making an entire line of  spells completely and utterly worthless<br />
<br />
Its not even wizards that are fubared, (i dont want to use them as an example becuase i dont want this to be construed as a class envy post), its the agro system itself. <br />
<br />
Another example on how agro is broken, i can chain cast rains for an entire fight, critting for thousands and draw 0 agro. <br />
<br />
Agro system is extremely dated and is being revamped to properly balance the game.<br />
Whether its a succesful revamp or not remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />

You don't happen to use a charmed pet for the fight, do you ?</div></div><hr />
