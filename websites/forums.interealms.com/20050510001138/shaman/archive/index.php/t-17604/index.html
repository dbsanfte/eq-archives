<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, I am truly shameless, and in the interest of learning how to do things right, I am willing to spill my guts here.<br />
<br />
made a shammy, geared him up with things that the little bugger has no business wearing (bout 100k on the bastard), and leveled him solo to a quick 25.  Now I am lost.  I DO NOT want to be one of those annoying twinkers who has no clue how to play their class.  however, (believe it or not, I am actually saying this) I currently AM one of those annoying twinkers who has no idea how to play their class.  I like the shaman, and the entire idea of the shaman, but I still am not sure what it is that I do.<br />
<br />
I read the whole medicine cabinet, and I get what to wear, and how to pull (something I already learned from my druid), but I don't really know what it is to be a shammy.<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, I am not completely clueless.  I know how groups work.  I know how to spot heal, protect my chanter, and all that jazz.  Hell, I was a great druid, and I know how to do everything he does.  Problem is, a great druid makes a !@#$ of a shaman.  So I am admitting my impotence in the hopes that you all can help me.<br />
<br />
If you could give me advice on what to do (starting at level 25.  I read some posts on how people hunt in their 50's and I don't think it is all pertinent to me just yet) I would greatly appreciate it.  I hear that we can solo things WAY out of our level range, yet I don't know what spells to use to really do that.  I don't know how to really function in a group well, and I really don't want to trial and error my way to total group wipeout with a bunch of unfortunate toons that didn't realize they invited shaman_numbskull_1 into their otherwise flawless group.<br />
<br />
I understand I am asking for alot of info here, but I really think others might benefit from it also.  And if there are already guides to help poor ignorant souls such as my self, then I would love you forever if you could direct me to them.  Thanks for dealing (and hopefully helping eliviate) my ignorance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ah man, your is a tough tough question to answer. Your role in a group, solo, and raiding are all completely circumstatial. However, generaly at level 25, if you expect to solo, best bet is to PULL WITH SLOW. A slowed mob will do crap damage to you, enabeling you (with the 100k in gear) to solo red's pretty easily. Do not worry about root-rotting just yet. Pull with slow, let the mob hit you, then start casting your dots. All shaman dots stack, every one of them, even the upgrades to previous dots. For instance, tainted breath will stack with all other poison spells. I'd say stay in Kunarc for solo exp at level 25..or perhaps old world like rathe mnts (cyclopse's) or the karana's (aviaks). <br />
<br />
Basicly this is how it should go<br />
Make sure you have enough mana/hp to kill said mob w/o medding then<br />
Slow him, let the first round of melee go off, then cast all the dots you can stack on him. Then start poking or bashing him. Reaply dot's as needed for quicker effect. Canni down, regen up (you do have fungi, right? :) ) and repeat. I still use this tactic in non-PoP zone's at level 58.<br />
<br />
Now..once you get 34, you get dogdog, who is, and always will be, your best friend, and your best DOT :) Learn how to pet kite, believe me, you'll love it. I was solo'ing red HG's in rathe mnts at level 34 w/o kei, and with crappy gear, when i got Dogdog. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
In groups, your role will pretty much always be melee buffer, mob debuffer, slower, and spot healer. If one of those slots are filled up, or you are able to regen enough mana to justify it's use, dot and rain the mobs to assist in DPS. Never, ever, ever let mana rot as a shaman. If the puller is a wimp, pull 2-3 mobs at once and ghetto CC the mobs (ala LDoN). *more about shaman ghetto CC in a moment*<br />
<br />
In a raid, well, that will come later, but basicly you're only ONE of the above mentioned roles, you're either slower, healer, or damage dealer (everyone will buff tho).<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghetto CC for a shaman. Our slow spells are very, very high agro, especialy if resisted. If you, or your group puller, brings 2 or more mobs, target an undamaged mob, and slow it. He will run to you like you just manaburned his arse, that's where you back away from the group a safe distance, and root him. You can sick dogdog on him, but chances are he wont stay alive for long. I am able to ghetto CC up to 3 mobs at a time ebfore i start breaking a swet :P<br />
<br />
This isnt a complete guide to shamaning (new word woot), as you will find your role will change witht he circumstances. Shamen increase the efficiency and speed of a group substantialy, which is basicly the overlying role one can assume. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and for gear, once you hit, say, 51+, HP &gt; AC &gt; WIS. :)<br />
<br />
If any of the 'higher up' shamen disagree with me, please post so. What is stated above is my opinion, which will be shared by some, and not by others, but so far this opinion has worked for me. I love being a shaman (much more than my 59 monk /mourn), because I'm never sitting on my ass doing nothing (ala cleric waiting for CH time), I can solo, and i easily find groups. All around fun. ;0)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At that level you can still tank, you can be main healer, and you can be crowd control (root).  Pretty much whatever is needed in a group.  You should be buffing Spirit of ox and regen at least on the tanks.  If you can afford the mana do it on everyone.  Your role in a group is really to fill the gaps.  If you dont have an enchanter then you do the crowd control.  No cleric then you are the healer.  Bunch of robe wearers then you are the tank. You can make anything work.<br />
<br />
Slow (walking sleep) isnt too useful at that level.  If things are dying quickly and there isnt much downtime I wouldnt bother much with it.  If you get in a group and it is taking awhile to kill things then the slow 35% might be worht the 60 mana or you could just use drowsy 25% for 20 mana.  You can add damage with nukes or dots to speed up the kill rate.  But always keep some mana in reserve and things go bad to spot heal.<br />
<br />
You should keep the regen spell up on yourself at all times and cannibalize whenever you have the spare time.  A shaman with hps should never be low mana once he/she gets thier first Canni spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Soloing as a shaman will be different than as a druid.  We stack dots and tank the mobs.  At that level when you start getting low health root the mob and back off and heal. Refresh dots as needed.<br />
<br />
As you grow, slow will become more and more important.  You will get your pet.   A useful little pup. Our strength is in our durability and our ability to get mana from hps and of course Slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Playing a shaman is pretty simple.  First you debuff mobs, then apply heals where needed.  If no heals are needed, nuke and dot your little heart out.  Keep regen on yourself at all times and use cannibalize all the time.  Keeping your health around 90% and cannibalizing whenever it gets higher than that works fine.  Just don't let yourself sit at full health, otherwise you're not getting maximum mana regen.<br />
<br />
Other than that, there's nothing major to know about playing a shaman.  It is just little nuances that you pick up along the way, and tehcniques that you master.  If you already played a high level character (you said you had a druid, which is a priest and really pretty similar to a shaman), then you shouldn't have any trouble at all picking it up.  Knowing general concepts about gameplay is more important than being a complete master of a class.  I've boxed every class there is and done a decent job of it, even though my shaman is the only high level character I've ever had.  This is because I have (or at least I like to believe I do) a massive knowledge of game mechanics and such.<br />
<br />
If you really want to improve your skills as a shaman, do this:  Group.  Soloing is easy, because the only person you have to worry about is yourself.  There is really no manual dexterity involved, like there is with a kiting class.  It is just knowing what spells to cast and what to do when stuff goes wrong.  In a group, though, you have to be able to respond to the actions of your groupmates.  There is a nearly infinite number of combinations for groups and they all function differently, even if the differences are subtle.  The more you group, the more tricks you'll learn for keeping your group alive and running smoothly.  Experience is everything.  A lot of people will tell you to avoid the kunark cycle (LOIO -&gt; FM -&gt; OT -&gt; DL -&gt; KC) but I don't really buy that.  The low to mid levels are really more about teaching new players how the game works.  If you already know this, then there's no reason not to level through these boring levels as quickly as possible.  A nice dungeon romp every now and then is definately good for you, but you shouldn't feel that just because you aren't in a dungeon, you aren't really playing EQ.<br />
<br />
Basically, I'm pretty sure that things will turn out just fine.  If you are aware enough of your own performance to come here and make this post, then obviously you aren't an idiot who automatically believes that just because his group isn't wiping, he's doing a good job.  If you are that self-analytical, then you will undoubtably grow up to be a good shaman.  Try and ask yourself questions along the way, like: &quot;Why did that go wrong?  Is there a way for us to tackle this situation that we haven't thought of, given the tools that I have?  Is there a more efficient way to do this?&quot;  Basically, just try a variety of things and make observations whenever you can, and try to group whenever possible.  Don't be in too big of a rush, but don't feel guilty for wanting to shoot through the lower levels.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just went through those levels with my SK and my friends lowbie shaman. I found slows to be neglible for the mana cost. Mind you we were in full groups. Times have changed since many of the old crusty shamans were 20's, the groups I was with were in armor and weapons that I would have only dreamed of 2 years ago on my 50's toons. Nowdays, nicely equipped players(not necessarily twinks) are pulling fast in the 20-30's. You won't have the mana to slow every mob, and to be honest the mobs will be dying so fast, the the efficiency of the early level slows will be nearly nill.<br />
<br />
At those levels you'll mostly be asked to heal, buff stats a bit and regen a damage taker or two. Take this time to enjoy melee, get you a big 2handed weapon and a nice couple other weapons if you wish. Maybe a cheap haste item and whack away. With the high damage weapons available cheap you can do as much with a big stick at sucking 1/8 your mana for 80 pt nukes when your melee groupies are hitting for 100 a pop with bazaar bought gear.<br />
<br />
At these levels just heal, keep your spell skills up and enjoy melee a bit if you don't need to be medding. This is a good time to start learning to root park if you wish, and the extra aggro you get attempting to root park will be good for not being one of those fast track 50 shamans with 80 defense skill.<br />
<br />
Trust me, if you stick with the shaman, you'll see the groups and damage output of the mobs change in your high 40's or so. That is when you become a real shaman with the tools that make you more than a druid without ports. Slows will become more important, canni will become an option, you'll have dog dog and some dot's that really make a mobs hps sink when needed.<br />
<br />
You seem knowledgeable so I don't assume you'll take my advice without common sense. Melee to have fun, tank a bit to keep up defense, but don't make shamans look bad by being lom/oom, unable to heal a party member while meleeing. I just saying enjoy melee while its a fun contribution, but at those early levels your one and only job is to keep folks alive. Only later on will your slows be the important part of your job.<br />
<br />
the usual IMHO disclaimer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kenton seems pretty dead on with my experiences starting a shaman myself. (almost 40 now)<br />
<br />
Just to add though, don't neglect your conjuration at all. You'll need to have it near 100 if you want to stand a chance of summoning a pet. I didn't do this and it was not uncommon for me to go through 3 FULL mana bars to get a pet out with low conjuration skill.<br />
<br />
I also agree that with most decent groups you'll find, casting slows is nearly worthless. Mobs just drop far too fast. You're better off healing. While that's true, in a situation with multiple pulls where the adds are rooted or mezzed, I'll usually slow those if I have the mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Key things for a shaman:  Buffing, Mana Regen, Debuffing, Healing.<br />
<br />
In the 20's it's way sucky to solo as a shaman you are at the single worst point in your career, this is the lowest point in your power curve, get a group and level to 34 where you get a pet and a load more buffs (regen, hp buff etc).<br />
<br />
When you group before 34:  Keep Regen up on yourself and melees.  Buff stats for skill ups for the others.  Cannibilise to keep up your mana regen, never ever be above 80% life, never cannibilise below 40% (unless your the healer and your group has downtime and lots of bandages, 3-5 people bandaging you is amazing).  If at all possible own a fungi and wear it, you can canni non stop for awesome mana regen.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 34 you get a pet, a better regen and a hit point buff.  It all changes.  Aggro kiting is suddenly doable and fun.  Tanking in the face is doable and fun.  You pet is great.  <br />
<br />
When you hit 39 buy beg borrow or steal Cannibilise2 spell - all the bits are dropable except for 1, you can MQ it, and the spell is tradable - it makes such a hugh difference to your mana regen rate.  <br />
<br />
Sometime in your 30's do the Epic quest up to the stage of getting the Black Fur Boots (right click, instant cast SoW).  it's dead easy to do, your druid can kill the black dire and you can loot it being the only tricky part.  <br />
<br />
When you hit 45 buy a Jaundiced Bone Bracer:  At this point you are freeking awesome compared to any class out there.  You should have a fungi and a JBB and Sow boots.  <br />
Pull mobs with slow, stick some dots on them, stick the pet on them, nuke them with the JBB in the face or root.  <br />
<br />
This will take you all the way to 60th with this set of tools;  getting the epic for a mana free dot if you have friends would be great.  beyond 58 or so the JBB starts to tail off as the tool, and you rely more on dots.  <br />
<br />
At 60th with Torpor and Malo you are a god compared to everone else at 60th.  This is the point to sell the fungi tunic and get something else on the chest slot (Vindi, Ornate, Tae Ew, Crypt Robbers).  <br />
<br />
When to go for AA's or 65th is a toss up, you've played highleve and have your own Point of View.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At your level, you will probably be main healer more often than not.  Priorities are Heal, buff, debuff, damage. As you grow and depending on group makeup these will change.  In all levels, your need to do damage will be somewhat less as a shaman than it was for a druid. This will always be an &quot;as mana permits&quot; area but as you get older mana will be less and less a problem. For now, don't worry if you never have a chance to dot or nuke.<br />
<br />
Can you canni dance?  Learn how.  It's not very useful yet but it will be.<br />
<br />
Buff yourself first then then all others.  When your buff wears off, reapply to everyone.  <br />
<br />
Regen is only useful if you are taking damage.  I know all the secondary melee types want it also but at your level it is more mana efficient to spot heal with light healing than to waste a big chunk of mana on regenning a player that stays full health most of the time. It will get easier in higher levels to keep regen on everyone but at your level it's a significant portion of your mana to cast and should not be passed around needlessly.<br />
<br />
If you need aggro -- eg. for parking adds -- your level 14 dismepower is the cheapest aggro inducer we get. I still use it at 62 for off tanking adds.<br />
<br />
P.S. Welcome to the sucky levels.  Heals are old, buffs are weak, debuffs even weaker, nukes are laughable and dot are too slow.  Stick with it and get to 34 before you make a decision to ditch the shaman.  These are the levels that grind out the weak and weed out the unworthy.  It gets better but you have to perceiver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The key is to assess what your group consists of and where you are.  <br />
<br />
Then you figure out what you need to do to make the group operate more efficiently.  <br />
<br />
It may be healing, nuking, pulling, whatever.  You figure it out.  That's a big part of the fun.  <br />
<br />
24 is a nice level due to Envenomed Breath.  From 29 to 34 you essentially heal as well as a cleric, but you have no DPS.  At 34 you get a dog and things really pick up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Some quick recommendations:<br />
1.  Train your 2hb and get a Staff of Living Sand and a Blight, Hammer of the Scourge.  These are cheap and they both proc dots.  SoLS procs at level 20, and Blight procs at 30.  Blight procs scourge, a spell you won't get for FOUR more levels. /edited btw, once one of these weapons procs, switch it out with the other.<br />
<br />
2.  Obviously, you have well equiped, so pull with Slow, DoT and tank/melee.  Don't neglect your melee skills.<br />
<br />
3.  At 34 you get your dog and continue to do the same stuff.  I still tank at level 61 in nadox all the time.  It's no big deal.  Tank a little and then back off.  Root if you have to.<br />
<br />
4.  Get a Soulstripper by the time you are level 40.  It is invaluable.<br />
<br />
5.  Lastly, you will not be the quickest soloer out there, BUT, you will be able to take our mobs other classes wouldn't consider.  And, it's nice to be wanted in groups.  My 56 druid never once got invited to a group other than my guild.  My shaman gets asked all the time by strangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So your at 25 .. ok solo to 60 and then just get BoT groups .. Im sure no one will notice.  Actually dump your gear and use only 10k of it .. no FT either.  If you want to learn you need to do the can dance for 200 clicks to get to FoM!!<br />
<br />
All kidding a side it doesn't sound like playing the low end game is that important to ya so just PL yourself and get to 50 .. then start working on technique.  with 100k worth of gear your gonna fly through your lvls ... get a jbb at 45 and your set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks guys for all the helpful tips (and if you have more, I certainly would still love to hear them!)  In answer to a question posed, yes I have a fungi.  I also already have a JBB, and some other rediculous gear.  I unfortunately didn't know that 2hb was the way to go (stupid druid, got too use to 1handers) and have, as a result, caped out my 1hp and 1hb.  I will start working on the 2hb immediately.<br />
<br />
As for my conj skill, I routinely practice all my casting skills each time I reach a new spell level.  It (along with all my skills) is maxed.<br />
<br />
I got a horsey already, so I am chain-canni-casting, though I have walked into a dungeon or two since I got canni and practiced my canni-dancing.  This is the one skill that I actually knew about before i made the shammy hehe.<br />
<br />
So now I have a much better idea of my role in the group dynamic, but I am still curious, are there any particular skills i should learn how to do?  I am working on puling agro and root parking da mob, but is there anything else?<br />
<br />
As a druid I had to learn kiting, quad kiting, med kiting, root/rot, and all that jazz (and then threw it all away when I realized I like grouping ALOT more than I like solo).  Are there any skills like this that, as a shammy I need to know how to do?<br />
<br />
thanks guys, i really appreciate all the help thus far.  you guys rock!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well put, Jinheim.<br />
<br />
I think the fact that you're willing to learn and that you don't think you automatically know everything by virtue of playing some other class to high levels indicates that you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
Shaman get a lot of spells and can fill a lot of roles.  I would also recommend grouping up and learning how to best use your wide variety of abilities to contribute to group success.<br />
<br />
Slowing is always our primary role in a group - but we can contribute in so many other little ways to keeping things running smoothly.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't usually cast damage dealing spells when grouped unless I'm floating in mana or the situation calls for all out damage dealing - usually I'm busy hasting (if no chanter), spot healing to keep cleric mana high, and doing all kinds of other little things.  I find that usually most other group members deal damage more efficiently and I can contribute more effectively in other ways.<br />
<br />
Once you start getting pets, hastes, and are along a little in level so that buffing and such are a little more mana-efficient things should come easy to you.<br />

Buffing People Into Submission Shaman of Xev</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My experience playing a shaman seems to be a little different than many.  I never grouped until I was about level 36.  And after that I hardly soloed.  I’ve never owned a JBB.  At 62 I don’t have my epic, or even my SoW boots from the epic quest.  And most of the time I had little better than K-Mart quality gear.  But I still managed to reach my 60s and I had a lot of fun doing it.<br />
<br />
I created my kitty shaman when Luclin first came out.  I played him to about 15th level or so and then shelved him for several months while I played my ranger and druid to 51st level.  So I don’t remember much of his early days.  When I started playing him again I hunted bugs in North Karana and then moved to gorge hounds in East Karana.  From there I killed Netherbians in Netherbian Lair and when they started turning light blue I killed Greyhoppers and Stonegrabbers in Marus Seru.  After experience started coming too slowly there I returned to my old druid hunting grounds and killed Ulthorks in Eastern Wastes.  I was still hunting there when I started grouping with a friend and my solo days came, more or less, to an end.<br />
<br />
My method for soloing remained basically the same throughout all my levels.  I would find a safe spot where nothing wondered or spawned, buff myself up, med or canni my manna back and head out for a victim.  I’d double check for adds and then slow or DoT the mob.  I usually used slow unless it was a long pull and I was afraid slow might wear off and I figured the Dot would do some damage on the run back to my safe spot.  Once I got to my safe spot I’d wait for the mob to catch up, god I love SoW, and root it.  Then I would slow it if I hadn’t already and pile on my DoTs.  If rood still held I’d med and wait for it to break.  I never had to wait long.  Then I’d beat it about the head and shoulders while the DoTs did their work.  <br />
<br />
Your first slow may not be overly useful in a full group, but it makes a huge difference when soloing.  I remember being amazed at how much slower the mobs hit me.  And once you get your pet the fights will go even faster.  Be sure to give your new puppy his fangs before using him in combat.  A couple of rusty daggers will do, allowing him to duel wield.  I always had my puppy guard my camp and positioned myself so that he would bit the mob’s butt when the mob attacked me.  That way the mob couldn’t dodge any of his attacks.  Puppy can also distract the mob while you back up and heal yourself, but don’t let him tank very long.   The poor pup just isn’t up to it yet.<br />
<br />
This is the best time to work on offence, defense and to practice your spell skills.  Offence isn’t all that important later on, but defense is.  As others have already told you, slowing a mob tends to tick it off and it often wants to express its displeasure in up close and painful ways.  With a high defense and good armor we can take a fair amount of hits before we have to worry.  Well, that’s true until you start fighting in PoP or going on major raids where the mobs start hitting a lot harder.  And I can’t stress enough the importance of practicing your spell skills.  It can be boring, but at least you don’t need to cast on a mob.  Just pick a low manna spell for each school of magic and cast it over and over and over again until you max out your skills.  But since you played a druid I’d guess you’re already familiar with how that works.  <br />
<br />
Once I started grouping everything changed.  I became much more like the druid I used to play.  I went from up front tanking to sitting in the back buffing and slowing.  At first buffing can be a pain because there are so many different buffs to keep up.  And of course they drop at the worst times, like right after a bad pull when you have little or no manna left.  But unlike my druid I never just sat and sat, waiting for my manna to come back.  I was always doing something.  If I wasn’t at full manna, which I rarely ever was, I was canni dancing during every spare moment.  When a mob was pulled I slowed it.  If I had enough manna I would also cast a direct damage spell or a DoT, depending on how long the fights lasted.  <br />
<br />
As you gain levels your job will became easier.  You’ll get group spells so you don’t have to cast on everyone separately and at 49th level you’ll get Harnessing of Spirit that’s three buffs in one.  And as you get better canni spells you can regenerate your manna quicker.  I just recently earned enough AAs to buy canni five and between it and Torpor my life as a shaman has become infinitely easier and a lot more fun.  The only time I run low on manna now is just after a really bad pull.  <br />
<br />
There are a lot of tools you can buy to make life easier.  If you can afford a JBB then by all means buy one.  I watched a friend solo his shaman with one and it really does make a difference.  I think I’d still be willing to camp for one to wear, if just because I’ve wanted one for so very long.  If you find yourself grouping in outdoor zones I would highly recommend buying a mount.  I spent 10k on a little green lizard, Pokey, and I’ve never regretted it.  It makes a huge difference in manna regen and being able to sit without inviting every mob around you to attack can come in very handy.  I would also recommend buying KEI once you hit 45.  You don’t have to have it, but it make life much easier.  If you can get any kind of manna regen at your level it can’t hurt.  One of the big things about KEI is that it lasts so long.  But if you can get clarity then it will certainly be a help for however long it lasts.  <br />
<br />
How you play your shaman is not set in stone.  We each have our strengths and weaknesses, depending on our experiences as we leveled.  I spent the vast majority of grouping time with a very capable ranger who rooted adds, a necromancer who stunned adds or a bard who mezed adds.  Thus my crowd control skills leave much to be desired.   However, I’m very good at what I do.  I keep everyone buffed, I slow everything that attacks us as quickly as possible and I make sure I ALWAYS have more than enough manna to deal with the unexpected.  I’m also good at keeping my head during bad pulls.  I make sure everything is slowed and I heal where needed.  If I can’t keep adds rooted I’ll let them beat on me and keep myself healed until someone has the chance to deal with them.  <br />
<br />
If you pay attention to what’s going on around you and play your character to the beast of your ability I’m sure you’ll make a great shaman.  It’s the lazy shaman or those who just don’t give a damn about their other group members that tend to give us a bad name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Prior to level 45ish melee melee melee. Or don't melee but still take the hits for you pet. Having 200 defense is NICE. Pull with slow. Let pet get agro. Step back and dot, then step in and take the beating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You won't truly experience the power of a shaman until about level 40 or 45. At lower levels the slows aren't powerful enough and don't last long enough. When mobs start living longer than 30 seconds and your slow breaks 50% you'll start to really notice the difference. In your 50s you will become truly powerful. Until then you're mostly a wannabe cleric with some nice DoTs and cannabalize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As a druid I had to learn kiting, quad kiting, med kiting, root/rot, and all that jazz (and then threw it all away when I realized I like grouping ALOT more than I like solo). Are there any skills like this that, as a shammy I need to know how to do?<br />
<br />
Most of these things are based around soloing. Shaman have 3 key soloing methods:<br />
1) IN TEH FACE. Debuff mob, You tank, throw dots, dog eats away at em from behind. Keep yourself healed.<br />
2) Root/Rot. Really, this is only for PoP tier 2+ stuff where it hits so hard it becomes inefficient to keep yourself healed.<br />
3) Kiting. Quite effective when you get your new pet. Throw dots and low level cripple to hold aggro, run around whilst dots do their job and pet nibbles at its heals. Not so viable at higher levels esp. when mobs summon :)<br />
<br />
My overwhelming preference is for the first method, particularly as you have the gear for it and at your level its very important to keep your defense skill up. That'd probably be my no. 1 tip - don't outlevel your defense too fast.<br />
<br />
For grouping, the hardest thing to learn as a shaman is what to do when the **** hits the fan. Problem is you have so many options its not always obvious what is best. Your top 3 options are usually:<br />
a) root park some adds out the way<br />
b) slow<br />
c) heal<br />
<br />
Sometimes I think that a slow just won't be enough to save someone and a quick heal is needed. But then you're soon back at square one again, so this only works if someone else iin the group is gonna save the day. E.g. Emergency heal on the chanter, save them from low health aggro, chanter lives and thus mezzes everything.<br />
<br />
Its something that comes with experience more than anything else. Root parking is a key ability of shaman for a few reasons:<br />
1) You can get aggro and thus pull the mob out from the group. Slow, cripple and poison dots are all massive aggro.<br />
2) You can take the hits better than a druid or wizard whilst trying to channel that root through<br />
3) At high levels, the VP AA is an awesome rootparking tool as it can knock mobs right out of melee range, and is also a fast cast. <br />
4) Ornate legs have clicky root, so its always ready :)<br />
<br />
The other key thing to learn is how to manage your aggro vs the tank. At low levels this isn't a big deal, but when you start going on raids sometimes you have to land slow on incoming and take the beats (and maybe die), other times mobs are quite resistant and its important you survive in case slow fails - so you have to time the slow so you don't steal aggro, but still get it landing asap. Again, this is just a case of experience - of the mobs, of the tanks, and of your own ability to take the hits.<br />
<br />
I learnt timing slow mainly in Kael on Vindi's guards. In the low 50s with average gear I went down pretty fast if I got aggro, and they were quite hard to slow at that level. Obviously at 65 its a different story, but the lessons learnt there are invaluable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ok, I have taken the advice of those posted above, and think I have figured out a few things so far.  I figured I'd post them to both help those who were in a similar predicament, and to figure out if I am way off, and need to re-evaluate what I am doing.  Remember, I still have alot to learn as my experience so far is only up to level 29.  Also, alot of this might be rediculously obvious, but I am brand new to the class, and I figured others who are brand new might not know it.  Anyway, if I miss anything, please let me know, as I am still hungry to learn everything i can.<br />
<br />
<br />
At around 25, my slow pretty much sucks, and in a group that is killing quickly, It just seems like a waste of mana to put casting slow as a MUST.  not to say that there aren't circumstances (i.e. someone pulled a red con that is just not dropping fast enough, or the group is getting low on health and mana and we got another add before having time to med, so slow just to keep things a bit safer), but in general, it seems only really useful as a means of pulling agro (which lately I have had to do alot.  Not many low level tanks where I am at).  <br />
<br />
DD spells are useless unless I have extra mana.  my dps comes mainly from melee and dots.<br />
<br />
Buffing the tanks is my main mana suck, and learning to time my buffs (and keep enough mana around when buffs fall) is a must.  Putting them on yourself first is a good way to time your buffs if you are taking some hits.  But if your tank is keeping agro well, and you barely ever get touched, it is hard to justify wasting a ton of mana on buffing an whole other player (i.e. you) just to make timing a little easier.  Try to learn the length buffs last, and how to refresh them before they wear.<br />
<br />
If my health is above 85%, i am getting lazy.  If my mana is above 70%, I am getting lazy.  If my mana runs dry and I have a decent amount of hit points left, I better have had a heart attack or turned suddenly catatonic.  If my mana is dry and my health is too low canni, either the whole group is in a rather @!#%ty state of affairs, or I am doing something terribly wrong.<br />
<br />
Watch the health bars like a hawk.  usually when your needed for that spot heal is right when you have 30 other things to do.  If your getting busy, chances are, everyone else is too.  This is when your heals are most needed.<br />
<br />
LEARN TO ROOT PARK.  I can not tell you how many times I have had to do this, even at level 25.  Hell, especially at level 25.  At these levels, there are tons of people who haven't been playing their class very long, and this includes your puller.  <br />
<br />
Casting the lower level resist debuffs to help your fellow casters is a waste of mana if no one is getting resisted in the first place.  Learn the zone your are in as soon as you get there, and try to figure out if the resist rate warrants such spells.  Eventually, I am sure you will always be casting your lvl version of malo, but in the lower levels it is quite often over kill.<br />
<br />
Agility buffs blow my left nut.  Unless your fighting a dispelling mob, there is little to no point casting this crap during rotation as it is just wasting mana.<br />
<br />
Charisma buffs actually have a place in the buffing rotation -- chanters (and maybe bards.  Haven't grouped with enough to know if this actually helps)<br />
<br />
Stack your dots!!!  I know this is obvious, but alot of times people think their lower level dots aren't worth the mana.  But really, at level 25, every dot added helps.  If for nothing else, then to curb the regen.<br />
<br />
Buy a training weapon.  recently (I am an idiot) I found out that 2hb was the way to go (despite my maxing out 1hb and piercings).  I got 2 great 2hbs that had procs that worked at my level (per a previous poster's advice) and found that training the damn weapons was killing me.  So i did this...  I went to the bazaar, bought the 2hb with the absolute lowest attack rate (regardless of stats and damage) and used it to train the skill up.  Simply pick a mob that cons dark blue, dot him down to 40% while swinging your training weapon, and then chill around that hp range as long as you can.  If you are training a weapon from scratch this won't be hard, as your damage won't be more than their regen.  Then when your health gets kinda low, dot them to submission, heal up, and do it again.  When you get better, just solo them from 100% down to death.  I honestly feel it is worth it to waste some time and solo mobs untill all your weapon stats are full.  You never know what your going to get later in the game, so might as well be ready for it.<br />
<br />
anyway that's it so far.  let me know if I am wrong on anything, or missing anything.  Or if there is some tip i will use later on in life, that you could tell me rather than me having to learn it the hard way :D <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don’t feel you are wrong on your assessment, but keep in mind that right and wrong do not necessarily apply to everything we do.  Many things are situational and many things are preference based, as in some shaman swear by them and other shaman swear at them.  Direct damage spells vs. DoTs is a good example.  You’ll find many discussions on this board as to which are best to use in different situations.  In my opinion, when soloing DoTs are usually best because they usually have time to run their full course.  But in a fast paced group I prefer using direct damage spells when I have the manna to use for damage.  The mobs are dropping so fast a DoT is going to do very little damage before the mob falls over dead.  Thus the direct damage spell actually does more damage.  But as I said, that’s my opinion and I’m sure other shaman handle things differently.<br />
<br />
I think its great that you are trying to learn all you can about playing your new class.  But after a certain point I think you’ll find that the best teacher is experience.  And I think you’ll also find that you never stop learning.  There are so many different factors that can change how we handle ourselves, from the makeup of our group to the zone we’re fighting in, that every day is a potential learning experience.  But then, that’s half the fun.</div></div><hr />
