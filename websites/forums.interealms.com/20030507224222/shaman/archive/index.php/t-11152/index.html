<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey, to all you shamans looking for an out-of-the-way.. never camped but still completly safe exp spot.. keep reading :)<br />
<br />
i went to check out the &quot;new grobb&quot; that has been revamped for loy, and outside, looking out from grobb zone tunnel, to the right there are 2 tents with a frog under each, straight ahead is 1 frog, and to the far left there is another frog under a tent with a merchant.. now i havent hunted here a lot, about 4 hours yesterday.. <br />
<br />
the frogs have around 8k or so hp.. takes me 2 bane's, 1 pox, 2 epic's and alpha dog with 2 fists of ixlabat to kill one.. and at the end of killing im at 90m and full hp.. all you do is pull with malosini, because they have high resists, then i bring it back near zone and sick pet on it, slow, bane, pox, root, epic, cann cann and torpor, to regain mana, ect.. pet usually needs a torpor every 2 fights or 3.. frogs go down very fast, pulling and killing constantly i could only barely keep 3 of the 4 spawns clear.<br />
<br />
they were indifferent to me, had no faction hit, some frogs enrage at the end, some dont, none cast.. they hit for 156 max..<br />
malosini helps a lot because without it i got a lot of resists on slow, root, and dots even at 60.. pet could tank it dang well and i bet the 61 pet would make it a whole lot faster.  <br />
<br />
repop time on them is like.. 8 minutes? 10minutes? i didnt time it but its surprisingly fast, dark blue at 60 and dark blue to a 61 warrior friend i called over to check it out.<br />
<br />
exp at 60 is 1% normal exp per kill.. every once in a while i get 2% for 1 kill though so i guess its something like 1.2% xp.<br />
<br />
try it out guys, great spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Also fun for us trolls who are pissed about losing are home land.<br />
<br />
Grrrrrr.... die froggy die!<br />
<br />
Any idea if these are dblue at 61+?<br />
<br />
Umpaa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they are dark blue at lvl61 for my warrior friend that i brought once but i didnt feel like telling anybody else because i didnt want it to be flooded by people on my server.   its never ever camped.. oh and to get there take the grobb stone on evil section of pok then go south east in innothule and you will hit there.<br />
<br />
by the way, my iksar friend said he was KOS to the frogs, but i was indifferent.. im not sure about other evil races.. im a barbarian btw.<br />
<br />
the frogs did assist when i pulled at 60 but there are 2 frogs that can be single pulled.. the 2 that are under huts right next to eachother come together but with pet tanking one and me tanking the other i can easily hold one off by using root and kill both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey Aridor, what is the mssg one gets when puppy procs the blade of walnan or fist of ixilblat?  When I had the lvl 55 dogdog I got the &quot;pet will is too low&quot; for blade of walnan which I dont get with lvl 61 pet so he must be procing it.  Just havent seen the mssgs yet like the GHL &quot;stun&quot; mssg or the velium &quot;stuck by velium shards&quot;.  I messed around with filters without luck ( once I confirm a weapon is procing I usually filter it out).<br />
<br />
Crash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And do you lose faction :)<br />
<br />
I want to keep it for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">with the release of LoY all has changed here.<br />
<br />
the guards now hit for 350s or so, there are more of them so harder to pull too, i dont hunt here anymore. <br />
<br />
Jaeden, before the release of LoY (which was when i posted this), the guards gave no faction hit.<br />
<br />
and Crash, i have given my lvl61 pet both the blade of walnan and fist of ixlabat, the fist proced for my lvl55 pet, while the blade wouldnt.<br />
<br />
the msg when the fist procs is &quot;Target is seared by flames.&quot;, im not quite sure what the message is on the blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Aridor.  Havent tried the fists yet.  Just blades.  Wish I had known fists would have worked on 55 pet.  Gave up after blade of walnan didnt proc on 55 pet.<br />
<br />
Crash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blade of Walnan (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28595)'s proc is called Wrath of Wind (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3038) , the proc message is as follows:<br />
<br />
Cast by other: Someone summons wind.<br />
Cast on you: You are slashed by flying debris.<br />
Cast on other: Someone is slashed by flying debris.<br />
<br />
If your 61 pet procs it, you will see the &quot;Someone is slashed by flying debris&quot; message.</div></div><hr />
