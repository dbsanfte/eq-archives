<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sithereand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Looking for a place to hunt with my 52 Ranger &amp; 40 Chanter duo.<br />
<br />
I've currently been doing JP griffs but the exp seems just so slow and fear kiting is a terrible waste for the chanter (no point in slowing mobs that don't hit you anyway)<br />
<br />
What I'm really looking for is something along the lines of static spawns, or a quick and dirty way of PL'ing the chanter a lot quicker than 250 griffs per level with the ranger getting approx 3-5%<br />
<br />
Any help greatly appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You should be able to single pull (pull from the max distance possible) and then have the chanter tash/slow the elemental, while you beat on it.  You should have no problems with the first 6 spawns; and you might even be able to take on the crusader/warrior pair down past the first flight of stairs (something I could not do solo).  If you try the pair, remember that the chanter has a small, componentless rune spell line, that buffs str and debuffs agi  (remember the Polished Granite Tomahawk?  it proc'd the first spell in the line); the crusader hits harder than the warriors.</div></div><hr />
