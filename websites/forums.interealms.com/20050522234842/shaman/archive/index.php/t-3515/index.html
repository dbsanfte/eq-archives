<br />
You can start now, with help from your friends and do all the parts up to the Tear part actually :), just don't turn in tear until you are ready for it (level 51+)...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&lt;= Still doesn't have his boots :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would definately try to get your Black fur boots if I were you asap, I thank Tunare everyday that I have my nice old clicky sow boots, never have to worry about sow goin out at a bad time when Im outdoors. And yes I, a troll said thank tunare) old habits die hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well im still a way off from 51  ( 44)  . im just going to follow the quest on this site and get them that way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i think it's that when you can gather a force to kill black dire for sow boot. then it's good time to start doing the first parts.<br />
<br />
sow boot is very useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Came into a second account. Have created a Troll worshipping Innothule. Am going to try and get his Epic sub-10 if I can. May have to pay for Tear MQ, but will laugh all the way thru the factioning if I can do it.<br />
<br />
44 is a GREAT time to start your Epic. You can group in CoM Stables for pages and get the item that floor spawns up front of mini-temple.<br />
<br />
You can continue to whack the guy in RM and doing your water portion shouldn't be that hard.<br />
<br />
BD is not that hard. Figure 1 group of lower 50's. I know I smoked him with my 60 Monk on 3-4 different occasions. (Best healer I had was a 52 Cleric, otherwise Shamans.)<br />
<br />
GET THEE CLICKY BOOTS YOUNG SHAMAN !</div></div><hr />

Do killer sharks See invis? and if you die, and miss the NPC's, will that mess your faction up?  Thats the one part of te quest i think would be amazingly easy to jack up like that.</div></div><hr />

I got mine the other night with a 46 Warrior, 45 Cleric, 51 Rogue, 51 Druid, and me 52 Shaman.  Malosi landed no prob, followed by a slow and incapacitate which made Black Dire a little puppy dog.  Warrior took about 60% loss of life before I could get him slowed (He hits fast and hard, hitting the War around 150 doubles) but once I got him slowed, regrowth kept up with the pitiful damage BD was putting out at that point, and cleric never healed the War just to keep the warrior on his toes, hehe.  Clear all yard trash that you can, and FYI, harmonying the wolves and BD will not keep BD from assisting his buddies. We found this out the hard way, as I remember someone saying you could pull his guards and BD would not assist.  At 52 with me being the puller of the guards, he did aggro when I pulled one of his buddies and it pathed over BD.  We had no warrior at that point, and an unslowed BD will make your life miserable very fast.  The cleric reported that BD was a white con, so that puts BD at lvl 45.  Have to get him slowed though or life will be bad for all.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

My understanding is they dont see &quot; Invis to animals&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The sharks don't see invis to animals.  I went at did that part around 39, and kept shivering when I saw a yellow con shark swim over my head knowing what would happen if invis dropped  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree that 44 is a great level to start the epic. You can easily kill the two fools in RM (Tabien and Glaron). If you're careful, the test of patience should be no problem. Just keep invis to animals up and check to see if there are any mobs around when you refresh it, if possible. Black Dire isn't too bad. I went into MM with a 60 warrior and a 57 ranger. BD wasn't up, so we went and killed the advisor to make him spawn (which worked -- woot). Having the level 60 was nice b/c he could single pull BD. I didn't have any problems slowing BD though. I will say, the boots are nice. I no longer mem sow unless someone asks me for it or if I'm grouped outdoors. FYI -- I did the epic to the part where I received the Shield of Falsehood at 44. The parts from Black Dire up to the reception of the Spear of Fate were done at level 52. Good luck to you! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tensor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I had my shield at 29 :P But didn't get my boots til 44 b/c I had always heard that Black Dire was a tough mofro. Turns out he was gimp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Back to the guys other question..if you foul it up underwater...can you go back and do it? I've read tales of woe here of faction being too high or low. I did the parts up to thw underwater...and accidently detroyed the arrow while waiting.. then the last spirit never came, but I heard a spirit repeating Abe's lines...think it was maybe bugged?<br />
<br />
Kinda worried about trying it again...should it be okay? Hitting 54 in a few days and I have all the COM papers and the books from the guy in COM... Still have to do MM..can I do MM out of order and get the pelt? or does it all have to be done step by step like in the guide?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I managed to foul up the underwater part and had to redo it, when I killed the spirit by not remapping the attack key :eek:  I had to run back to Freeport then back to Erud's Crossing to do the patience part again (ugh, twice), but successfully completed the second time around.  I am now up to collecting the 6 pages and all has gone fine, doing it in order all the way.  You should be just fine, as long as you don't get a negative Truespirit faction hit.  BTW, I didn't receive a negative faction hit for skewering the spirit. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks:) I'll go run through the beginning again tonight? Do I need to restart with Capt. Pegleg in OOT? Or is there an easier way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the drunk shaman in nfp sewers, all you have to say is 'you can but booze' and he sobers, as when you left off. I am terrified to do the underwater part on my own at 40, but afterward, the RM part sounds like cakewalk.</div></div><hr />
