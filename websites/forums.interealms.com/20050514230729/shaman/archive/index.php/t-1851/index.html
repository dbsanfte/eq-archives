<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Vah Shir, We have no religious system. I just realised last night how screwed we are and how screwed we are gonna be. When Planes of Power comes out we are gonna get nothing. Unless Verant admits their mistake and builds us a religious system. <br />
<br />
My thinking is that they made us agnostic because it was the lazy way to go for them. How the heck can a Shaman be agnostic?<br />
<br />
We don't get access to any imbued items.<br />
<br />
OK my rant is over.<br />
<br />
Anyone think this going to hurt the Vah Shir in the long run?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Who knows, let's wait and see what is going to be released. Maybe they'll have some special quest for cats to choose a religion. I've gotten my cat to lv42 without religious items, I'm not going to wipe it just for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For years and years, NO ONE wanted a religion...every spoiler site out there told you to go agnostic.  &quot;Religion only gets you in trouble&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
Shaman got the 'shaft' because they were forced to pick a religion.  Now that decent religous items are coming into the game, there are a bunch of agnostic characters that are going to be in the same boat as a VS shaman.  So don't sweat it...you probably won't be any worse off than most of the chars on a server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman could easily be agnostic.  As tribal spiritists, we are the gateway to the spirit world for our tribes.  That doesn't mean we have to worship a god.<br />
<br />
If you have read the Belgariad by David Eddings, remember the Moridrim - they have all the trappings of a shaman (although they function more like a Mage) and they do not follow any god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">..and this is a game and has nothing to do with a perception of a book (although quite a good book).<br />

So someone made a pu$$y and thinks that they are screwed for life now.  Oh well, choices choices choices.  My advice, ride it out.  Ya never know all the phat lewts you will never see could be agnostic pnly!<br />
<br />
Look at the bright side, you can use a JBB ;p</div></div><hr />

I still would like some items to make up for not getting imbued items though.<br />
<br />
it's all about balance. Kitties are nothing special so we should not have to take a penalty of missing out on items. Now if we had some kind of uber ability then I would understand.</div></div><hr />

no exp penalty is nice.  no faction problems is nice.  Starting on the moon is nice.  <br />

<br />
no faction problems? I must be missing something. We basically have the same faction problems as a Barbie (or any other good race in the game). A Barbie can go where ever we go and is KOS where we are KOS. If I don't have a faction problem then why do I get the &quot;we don't serve Vahl Shir here&quot; line. Hmmmmm<br />
<br />
Oh and let me see safefall at skill 50 and sneak at skill 50. Oh big deal there. You can really do a lot with that. Shamans get invis. Why the heck do I care about a 50 skill sneak.<br />
<br />
Ok we get no Xp penalty. I'll give you that one as one advantage. Oh wait, but we eat twice the amount of food as everyone else. <br />

Come on guys. You're trying to fluff up the cats as something we are not.<br />

========================<br />
<br />
Vah Shir can now choose their patron diety using the<br />
/chooseL33tDiety command<br />
<br />
Valid arguments are<br />
<br />
Fluffy the Dark Lord of Catnip<br />
<br />
Worshippers of this diety strongly believe in the medicinal properties of the herb of the same name, and imbibe it to help them summon visions from their patron diety.<br />
<br />
Ed the Food Giver<br />
<br />
Worshippers of this diety believe that their patron will deliver unto them untold amounts of food at specified intervals, provided they yowl and caper around the aforementioned diety to remind him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you, please drive through.<br />

<br />
Hmm.  I would love to have the ability to sneak.  I like to work on tradeskills, and I can't count the number of times that sneak would allow me to buy from a merchant that conned dubious, or get better prices from one that was apprehensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I have sneak what is the big advantage of good faction? :)<br />
<br />
Seriously though I am really hoping they allow us to create cultural items with trade skills. I can see why Half-Elves can not, because they truely do not belong to any one culture buy come on Kittys have Culture! It's not our damn fault a bunch of crack head heretics blew our city to the moon :(<br />
<br />
And yes, I have thought long and hard about PoP and the potential for tons of diety based quests. I really do think were going to get the bone on that one just by looking at the recent Cultural armor and pottery recipies(Vah Shir is the only race other than Half Elves not to get cultural armor and Vah Shir shaman are the only ones not to get a port to home point pottery item). Personally I think the developers were very lazy by not allowing us to choose a God.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
really...dont start bitching about the next expansion at least until it comes out.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, sounds pretty good to me.  Even better, since you are not KoS you can walk in, sneak buy/sell and walk out.  Gee, you are right, that sneak skill is AWFUL. /sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Sorry, but you may want to consider the application of the skill before you knock it.  Racial sneak is GREAT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Look!<br />
<br />
All the Shaman races have one small advantage over the other. All the Shaman races get a god. We don't get a god therefore we are missing out on a lot of stuff. It is that simple. And this is not just about PoP. It's about the game right now as it stands. Like so far we are not going to get the pot to port us to our home city. All the other shamans do. <br />
<br />
We have no huge advantage over any other race. There is no reason for us to have such a huge penalty. The true fact is Verant was to lazy to build us a religion. It was so easy for them to just make us agnostic. Now we are screwed because of their laziness.<br />
<br />
They need to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">And why didnt anyone say anything prior when they knew that VS would be agnostic even before release???  You wanted a port to home city is what this comes down to.  it has nothing to do with game mechanics or storyline.  Nothing to do with VI being lazy and not building a religion. And certainly nothing to do with racial benefits.<br />
<br />
If you think you are screwed reroll and stop complaining about it.  You made a choice knowing the facts and now you regret it.  Look at all the barbs that would want to have the snare necklacke but have to rely on a proc spear from VP!!  ya it sucks but you dont see barbs freaking out over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, as many people in this thread are pointing out...a *lot* of shamans are unable to use a *lot* of shaman items.  Perhaps now we can combine the 'VS can't use deity gear' and the 'Iksar can't use the JBB' and 'Ogres can't use [a whole bunch of crap]' threads into one big petition and try to get VI to balance it all out.    &lt;--- (I don't want this! )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Deal with it. <br />
<br />
Cats have no central god because they were removed from the world in which the gods operated. They found that they could focus and channel the spirits of the moon and the energy that lies within all things.  So they belive in themselves and the spirits that are all around them.<br />
<br />
Sounds pretty shamanistic to me.<br />
<br />
And If you think sneak is useless then you are going to be a very very one dimensional shaman. You need to learn to use all of your skills and advantages. Sneak is one of the most powerful pulling tools in the game. Second only to feign. Shame almost noone knows how to use it.  And with sneak and Invis you can go and do things that many others cannot. Much like a thief.<br />
<br />
Try to think about some of the things you can do with your abilities as a cat rather than what everyone else can do.<br />

<br />
You are right ALL the races have advantages and disadvantages. But they ALL still have a GOD and stuff to go with that GOD. We don't.<br />
<br />
I said my piece. No reason to keep this thread going in circles. It's not like Verant is going to come here and read it. Then say, &quot;hey that guys is right&quot;.<br />
<br />
oh well.</div></div><hr />

Why do you blame anyone but yourself for intentionally starting an agnostic character?  As for what the Tribunal means to me, let's see.  I wear none of their items.  I did wear the earrings for a while, until I realised how much better electrum-bs is.  I can make a pottery gate tool to a city which I don't wish to return to.  Wow, huge advantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm, I've been puller for my group on several occasions because I was the best choice.  This is certainly not always the case, but there definately are times...<br />
<br />
Why should I wait until the melees finish off a mob before one of them runs off to get another?  It's much more fun to get another and have it parked and waiting to be killed.  It's less downtime for the group, and more experience for me.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes level difference or the ability to pull with a low aggro spell such as cancel magic makes me a better choice for puller.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the Tribunal is clouding my mind, but I fail to see the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If I am pulling my group has problems eh?<br />
<br />
Okay.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe you know very little about the class that you are professing is screwed up and must be changed. Maybe just maybe the race is agnostic for a reason beyond your narrow grasp of game mechanics.  <br />
<br />
Just because I have been playing since beta, does not mean I know everything about the game. There are a ton of things that I learn new every day. But that is the whole point. I actually learn new things, not have the same experiance over and over day in and day out  every day of my life until I die.<br />
Having a god has disadvantages as well as some advatages.  One of the cat's advantages are while you do not have an affinity for any other races beliefs, you also do not have enimity with them either.  In other words while every other race in the game may be Kill on sight you can work with that faction and improve it easier...<br />
<br />
I don't even know why I bother. A two line post would have saved me a few minutes and gotten the same point across.<br />

Yeah, I remember doing a research and every spoiler site said &quot;go agnostic, religions will only serve to bring you trouble&quot;<br />
And shaman get the shaft for having to pick religion.<br />
<br />
Now everyone wants to be either: 1.  Tunare (rangers mostly)  2. Sol Ro (nice ring) 3. Inny(snare thingy)  and perhaps Tribunal a distant fourth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I must have it good then. Cause I never have to pull in a group. We always have a good pulling class present. Besides if you are pulling you are not building up mana. From what I have seen the lack of mana is what leads to group down time.<br />
<br />
You must have a huge mana pool to be able to pull, park, heal, and buff with little group down time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The size of my mana pool has nothing to do with it, but yes I can do all of that with zero downtime.  It's not bragging, it's just that thing that shamans do.  Enchanters make great pullers as well, btw.  My assumptions of course are that we're talking about a dungeon xp group, and that the players have some measure of skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Obviously, Verant didn't know how to deal with the problem, either, which is why our race is completely eliminated in EQ2. :(</div></div><hr />

Actually, it's in the right pillar. But that's besides the point this thread was discussing Vah Shir not how many cookies you have gotten for doing ub3r l33t things on your server.<br />
<br />
Back on topic, personally I would just like to ge a fair shake at trade skill items like every other race is getting. Do the items have to be imbued to match a God? No, hell verant with a little imaginatio could make them imbued by the spirits of Luclin. The same spirits that Vah Shir Shaman worked with and found when they lost contact with the Norrath Gods/Spirits.<br />
<br />
I like doing trade skills call me crazy but I actually do enjoy making items I would wear and use. What is the harm in Verant putting in Vah Shir craftable armor or weapons like the other races are getting? And please dont bring up the crappy song and dance about balance. My race has some nice advantages and some distinct disadvantages.<br />
<br />
As for knowing I was going to be Agnostic when I made my Vah Shir. Yes, I did know it and chose it gladly to be different than the 234324324 cookie cutter Barbarian Shaman on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Oh.<br />
<br />
We are experienced for our level but not as experienced about the game as your are. I'm only level 31. Maybe when I am a higher level I will come across groups where I will be the puller, buffer, slower, and healer. Man I hope I have the mana for it.<br />
<br />
Also don't forget the new trend that is happening around a lot of servers. It's called lack of clerics. Druids and Shamans are becoming the main healers in many groups. I don't think I will be pulling much if this trend keeps up.<br />
<br />
What a way to high jack my own thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hmm.<br />
<br />
(checks web board address.Yep still shaman Crucible)<br />
<br />
Actually I have a 160ish wisdom at the moment.  I had it up to 210 but that was too damn much mana.<br />
<br />
Up to level 54 I had no greater than 121 wisdom (Unless some chanter Buffed me with something good.)<br />
<br />
Pull with slow. run back to group root. Epic dot, Cannib twice, go pull another. Sometimes I dance to get back more mana sometimes not. <br />
<br />
I have been pulling and even tanking through my entire 3 year shaman career. (Except at 45 when I quit snoww for a while because people forced me to be buff and heal bitch)<br />
<br />
I don't do much meele damage but I can sure take a beating. When I am regening 42 HP a tick  and a critter is 75% slowed I can sometimes make a better tank than a low level warrior or Ranger in Maidens and Umbral.<br />
<br />
I would call sitting in a group and Medding torture. I am a shaman not a stinking Druid. I stand in the middle of battle and whip the warriors into a frenzy, I call down plauges and poisens from the natural and unnatural to destroy the foe from withen.<br />
<br />
I curse and distract enemys so that my warrior bretheren can dispatch them with speed and valor. Then I go roaming the land as transparent as a spirit and as fast as a wolf, to call another creature to its death. <br />
<br />
I am heyokah, also an Oracle, I forsee the future and control the past, I call spirits to aid and destroy. <br />
<br />
I am a shaman. :p<br />

You came here posting about needing a diety.  People respond to you, with the knowledge greater than your 31 levels, that dieties really aren't all they are cracked up to be.  They respond to you with suggestions for how your racial ability can be VERY powerful.  Seredith responds and tells you that when iksar were introduced, they did not get any consideration until much later than their release (see Hate armor introduction) and later got some nice items.<br />
<br />
If you did not want debate and advice, why did you post?  People here will always present different opinions on how to play your shaman.   It's always valuable to see a different perspective and understand how your class can be played in different ways.  Discounting something as &quot;wrong&quot; because you have never done it, is very narrow-minded indeed as you have just said.  But then again, you did it yourself.  <br />
<br />
You are certainly intitled to believe that you need a diety, but I agree with the rest.  It's largely overrated.  There's really no reason to flame over this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back before AA experience, I used to start groups in Chardok all the time to help the rest of my sub 60 guildmates level.  Generally I would be the only healer.  I would pull, debuff, dot, root and run off and get more while the first mob died.  Cleric and enchanter welcome, but not needed.  I'm still the puller if I want to be, the only healer if that's the way it turns out and can substitute for enchanter or even tank in an exp group (not melee, but tank).<br />
<br />
You are on the cusp of the best times of being a shaman, where you are growing into your full potential and seeing all the things that EVERY shaman can do.  You were rude to Snoww, who is an exemplary shaman who constantly plays &quot;beyond&quot; her class, she was just trying to open your eyes to the possibilities.<br />
<br />
Don't spend so much energy wishing for things you don't have, each race has advantages and disadvantages.  I'm a barbarian who would love the Inny snare necklace or an Iksar's innate regen.  I think surefall would be nifty (hate falling damage while running like a maniac through DL) and sneak would be near godly.  I have a potter friend who is going to make me a spirit stone and I'm pretty happy about that. <br />
<br />
Would I like every benefit available to every shaman race, well sure!  But, I made my choice a long time ago that I wanted a barbarian shaman and I know that I could reroll at any time if I really really wanted to.  I choose to accept what I have and let go of the wanting of things that I cannot have.<br />
<br />
Each race has positives and negatives, it's the beauty of diversity. It would be really really boring if we were all barbs or all trolls or all kitties.</div></div><hr />

It's ok for everyone else to come on here and cry about the shaman class or races but I can't? I will admit I should of been more structured in listing the pros and cons of all the shaman races. And with all those pros and cons they still have an entire part of the game I won't see. <br />

<br />
<br />
If you're gonna come here and cry about your shaman race, don't expect people to have much sympathy. It's how anyone gets treated that comes here whining about race, doesn't mean anyone is picking on you. Check out some of the Iksar/JBB threads if you don't believe me :). <br />
<br />
I think most people here would agree that a Troll makes the best shaman with Iksar or Ogre in second place. Most would also agree that any shaman who knows their class isn't going to be worried about what race they are. They all have advantages and disadvantages but none are crippling or overpowered.</div></div><hr />

Hence, the same thing happened when Kunark was released and Velious. Iksars were left out of alot of stuff and slowly we've been brought in with access to good items/gear, etc. etc. etc. I think Vah 'Shir will be done the same way. I wouldn't worry until EQ itself is 100% completed, which will probably be never. Its an ever changing world.<br />
I really don't get why we're even discussing an expansion that hasn't even been released yet (PoP). <br />
They have yet to finish Laglin ! <br />
<br />
I think being agnostic for the next expansion presents many options. How about a quest that will allow Vah 'Shir to pledge their loyalty to a specific deity ? Therefore they would have access to all the deity based items/gear/armor/tradeskill, etc...available to that class/race/deity. I really don't think Vah 'Shir are screwed I just think they are in their &quot;infant&quot; stages as a developing race/class. As were Iksars. So my advice would be sit tight, I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunities for all you Kitties out there. <br />

I didn't care about gods are any special magic items that I can get later on in life. I was still fairly new to the game so I didn't have a clue about all the whiz-bang Shaman only magic items. The reason why I stuck with a VarShir shaman was that I was 1 of 2 shaman in the newbie area for more then a month. As I met other people while visiting down on the planet, they would say that they never met a Var Shir shaman. I'm glad that I kept playing my shaman.

I'm proud to be Agnostic. Please repeat after me: Religion is not the issue here.<br />

Have any of you ever really compared a spiritstone to a faithstone? If you did, you would notice that cleric FAITHstones are flagged with a diety. You would also notice that SPIRITstones are NOT flagged with a diety. Coincidence? Not at all.<br />

Do Vah Shir Shamans have a right to a Spirit Stone? Yes, as much as any other shaman does.<br />

I love it when people start running out of things to say, so they have to break out the 'cookie cutter barbarian' take. It works every time, too. Someone calls barbarian shamans cookie cutter, and every barbarian shaman who reads it, whether he be the humblest of level 5 newbies or the uberest of the uber such as Jenamdar, the nameless no-post lurker or the 2000+ and counting Gloriana, feels utter self-loathing for having played a barbarian rather than something less cookie cutter.<br />

Vah shir being agnostic is nothing bad, sure ya miss out on some things, but as others said, your not missing much compared to some of us (what do Ogres get other than nice spiritstone? Barbarians just get a crappy spiritstone...but its good for checking if vox is up! woot! own! and poor CT trolls, do you think they would keep CT if they could restart as inny?

If you're pulling with your shaman your group has problems.  <br />
<br />
Actually this is only true if you're letting a Paladin who has both a Map and a Plan do the pulling. Now, if the Paladin only had a Map but no Plan, it is quite all right for them to pull but be forewarned that it's still dangerous, just not as 'ohmygod we're FUBARed who the hell let him pull?' as both the Map and the Plan. If the Paladin only has a Plan and no Map, you should feel relieved because chances are they'll get lost no matter how many things they pull and end up dead in a wall on the opposite end of the zone. Especially a male Paladin. Males, through some flaw of genetics, have an innate inability to ask for directions. The Map only complicates things because this adds to the false surety that we know where we're going. This usually results in somewhere between 30-98% of the zone trailing behind the Paladin with pitchforks and torches as he comes careeing towards his group with his, &quot;hey guys, check it out, flawless single pull!'' and a smile. Paladins don't always know how to use the Camera Angles, I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
That said, some of the best Non-Monk pullers I've seen were Shaman. I remember being level 53 and in Akheva with a 60 Monk, a 60 Shaman and a 60Mage. Despite the fact we were getting pounded the Shaman kept us alive, did the pulling, kept everything slowed and never seemed to run OoM. Same in DNec. Same in Kael, he'd bring two or three MoBs already slowed. I've seen an Enchanter pull in Skyshrine. A Magician pull in Fear. A Wizard pull in The Deep. *ANY* class can pull. The only type of class that can't pull is one played by someone who is inept in the finer points of their class. There are already too many of those.<br />
<br />
As for feeling you're screwed for being Agnostic ... then I have to agree with those who said 'reroll'. Unless the EQ Invasion team came to your city I highly doubt someone held a gun to your head and said, &quot;You're making an Agnostic Vah Shir Shaman, biznatch!&quot;<br />
<br />
It sounds to me that you're not enjoying your character because of the lack of a God and Cultural armor. Here's something you may not have realized: everyone has at least one gripe for their Race/Class/Deity or lack thereof combination. Half-Elf Paladin here ... you know, the cultureless bastards who can't smith cultural armor, despite the fact we come from TWO different cultures and can wear their armor? Great, we can wear it but we can't make it. Despite the fact our Gods would dictate whether we follow human or Elven traditions. Am I complaining? No. I really don't care. Cultural armor is nice, but I can find better eventually. AC isn't the be-all-end-all for me and 30hps and mana don't really justify it enough for me. Tunare Paladins get a Nature's Defender, which is essentially an easy little mini-epic while all I have is the PITA Fiery Defender. (Yay friends giving me a Narandi's when I was two turn-ins away from my epic! :p ) And ... so what? That's what they get for being Tunare worshipping Paladins. Gnome Paladins have Clockwork Armor, which gives them Invis, Stackable haste and STR Buffs and other cool tinkering toys. Damn them! I want clockwork armor! I want a nature's Defender! Great, then I'll crossbreed a Gnome with a High-Elf, sell the video of this on eBay to make money to buy a few level 60 Characters then have an ugly midget with rechargable tinkered clickyarmor and an easy epic!<br />
<br />
Not all Shaman are the same. Look at Iksar and Troll and Ogre and Barbarian and as much as you're biased against your own decision, even the Vah Shir.<br />
<br />
Not all Paladins are the same. Half-elves, Smidges, High-Elves, Humans and even those freaking little pustules, the Gnomes, all have some very different attributes, advantages, etc...<br />
<br />
If you dislike your lack of a God so much, then delete your Cat and make a Troll or a Barbarian or an Iksar or whatever floats your boat. <br />
<br />
The bottom line remains, if you don't like it, change it. You can petition verrant all you want, but after the Druid showing we know what that does. You can email them out the wazoo but nothing will happen. They're not going to change a diety system. And for all you know, there may end up being Agnostic only items in PoP or the ability for Agnostics to pick a God the way you can respecialize in the Temple of Ro.<br />
<br />
If you *like* playing your Cat, then do so. Nobody gets *everything* in this game. If they did there would be nothing at all to differentiate one person from the next. If you don't like the flavor, get another flavor. If you're digging it, go with the groove.<br />
<br />
Simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I haven't bothered to get a spiritstone for my shaman.  It's just not been worth my time.  Then again the EF gate is the worst one.  I'd like to see kitty shamans get a Spiritstone.  <br />
<br />
One one hand I know exactly why Vashir shamans didn't get a spiritstone with the others.  <br />
1) No existing code for it (hello gate potion code) so it wasn't trivial for the dev team.<br />
2) From immersive roleplaying PoV, nobody could port up to the moon at that time and no plans were in place to make it so.  It took a while for that corporate culture to be uprooted and now that we have droods and wizards porting and kiting all over the dam moon we should have gate potions to up there and a dam spiritstone for the kitties!  <br />
<br />
As for all the other stuff, religion still doesn't matter.  You'll be a good or a lousy shaman based on how you play, not what you picked at char selection screen.  Personally I never even glanced at the religion point when making Land, I wasn't sure what my god even was until 35 levels later!<br />
<br />
And for those who like to sling the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; term around, hey there n00bz!  Us old timers made our characters back when there were three choices for shaman.  Ogre, Troll, and Barbarian.  It really sucked having lousy faction at that time, and the game was new.  Thus many of us picked Barbarian, the one choice that did NOT look like ass.  I still can hardly stomach the sight of old ogre models, and even the new troll models make me gag.  Iksar were reasonable in their appearance.  At least they didn't look DELIBERATELY malformed.  Kitties are the best looking shaman race alongside barbarian that has come out yet!  You guys should be loving life!  <br />
<br />
If you wanna sum up the racial stuff let's do it by number and usefulness of abilities since stats and racial items are are meaningless at end game.<br />
<br />
Ogre: 1) Infravision, 2) immune to frontal stun, 3) Slam<br />
Troll: 1) Ultravision, 2) Regeneration, 3) Slam<br />
Barbarian: 1) Slam, 2) Good faction aligned<br />
Iksar: 1) Infravision, 2) Regeneration, 3) Forage<br />
Vah Shir: 1)Infravision, 2) Safe Fall, 3) Sneak, 4) Good faction aligned <br />
<br />
All shaman races get at least three special skills or abilities except for one.  <br />
<br />
Funny how it's always the other races who are whining tho.  How does that work?  Oh and this thread is the shaman race that gets the MOST special abilities combined with the LEAST exp penalty? <br />
<br />
I'd kill lots and lots of kitties for sneak.  I use sneak skill on my monk ALL the time for just about everything.  I can even single pull without FD using sneak and something to throw.</div></div><hr />

In whole, there are about 20 pieces of the shaman armor on the entire server, and that includes the 7 I am wearing.  The 2 ogre smiths tell me that its similar for thier stuff.<br />
Its not a concern for VI because its not concern for the population of the playerbase.<br />
Rallos jewelry imbued is not good for shaman, neither is Inoruuk.  Neither is CT.  Yes, tribunal jewelry is good, until you get some money to buy better.<br />
ok, so cultural jewelry isnt the reason, but but but...<br />
<br />
Yes, sure you would love to change your religon.  So would about 50 level 60 barbarian warriors who worship rallos or are agnostic and cant wear my tribunal plate that kicks kael armors butt.  Again, I would say the number of people with problems BIGGER than a vah shir agnostic is FAR higher than you want to admit.<br />
You miss out on a snare necklace, so does everyone else.   <br />
You miss out on newbie jewelry, so do ogre / shaman / lizards.<br />
You miss out on HP/Mana/AC cultural smithing.  Well, so do iksar (thiers sucks) and so does about every other shaman on the server because they cant afford it until they can get better from no drop stuff.<br />
<br />
Let me make my point clear.  The agnostic issue is bigger than just for Vah Shir.  The established player base is probably 50 per cent agnostic, because religtion didnt mean anything until imbued jewelry, and only recently have they put in stuff that REALLY makes a difference.<br />
Yes, its a problem, but they certainly arnt going to change it because of Vah Shir, and Vah Shir certainly arnt at the recieving end of the nerf bat because of it.  (like hell your factiosn are the same as barbarian, you can buy anywhere you arnt kos)</div></div><hr />

I would call sitting in a group and Medding torture. I am a shaman not a stinking Druid. I stand in the middle of battle and whip the warriors into a frenzy, I call down plauges and poisens from the natural and unnatural to destroy the foe from withen.<br />
<br />
I curse and distract enemys so that my warrior bretheren can dispatch them with speed and valor. Then I go roaming the land as transparent as a spirit and as fast as a wolf, to call another creature to its death. <br />
<br />
I am heyokah, also an Oracle, I forsee the future and control the past, I call spirits to aid and destroy. <br />
<br />
I am a shaman. :p<br />

To original poster:<br />
1) Sell current gear and buy wisdom gear.<br />
2) Xfer gear to druid you really NEED to make.<br />
3) Return to shaman in 6 months RL when you realize the horrid mistake you made -- by then I'm sure the vah shir will have a spirit stone.<br />
<br />
Best of luck,<br />

When in fights with a mob over level 64, you'll have a 25% chance of sitting down and licking yer butthole uncontrollably until the mob dies or all yer guildies start pelting you with toilet paper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Just checked for completeness sake. I rolled up an Vah Shir Shaman today, and there it stands. Even before entering the game.<br />

No nerf, no changes, no hidden information.<br />
<br />
Deity - Agnostic<br />
<br />
So please dont expect tears of sympathy from me if you happen to realize after 31 levels &quot;Ups, I think im agnostic, damn you Verant&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am a level 60 Barbarian Shaman and I have zero, 0, nada Tribunal only items. That means I have my first Symbol in the bank (go, hammer, go). You are grossly extaggerating the importance of a deity. Its a case of &quot;They have but I dont, I dont need but want now&quot; envy, worthy of the most whining druid (disclaimer:not all druids are whiners).<br />
<br />
Think before making a character, and (regarding your Shaman never pull comment) continue thinking after you made a character. Else, please dont be sad if nobody takes you serious, its no animosity against cats or general hatred, its just your reasoning makes ones head hurt.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

That item, and the probability that it will have a progressive improvement later on, smokes ANY other race-only item that the other races can quest for (except maybe the troll snare necklace, but them's the breaks eh?).</div></div><hr />
