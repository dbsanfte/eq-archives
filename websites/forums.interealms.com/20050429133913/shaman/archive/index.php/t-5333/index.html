<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unzip the files into a folder that you can call whatever you want so long as it is contained inside the &quot;uifiles&quot; folder of your EQ directory.<br />
<br />
Load EQ with the new UI turned on and type:<br />
<br />
/loadskin (name of folder where you installed it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty much what Sam said.  This is how I like to do it, I give you run down step by step because not sure how much you know about computers.<br />
<br />
1. Click on the file and select save, save file to desktop. <br />
<br />
2. Now select the start button, then select the searcbutton, then select  for files and folders, now type uifiles and click  search(note: make sure you are search in the drive with EQ installed on it, most likely your C drive)<br />
<br />
3. Now click on the folder uifiles, you will now see one folder that says default.<br />
<br />
4. From here right click on your default folder and select copy, paste the copy right next to it and rename that folder to a name you will recognize (i.e. red, blue, cat, etc..) will say GREEN for example.<br />
<br />
5. Ok now go back to desktop where you will see the UI you downloading in ZIP Icon. Now UNzipped the files you downloaded in that very file you renamed. (you will need to download unzip software if you dont have already)<br />
<br />
6. Log on EQ and now type /loadskin GREEN and Bammo! you now have your new skin.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What they say is correct but you don't need to copy over the UI files from the default directory anymore. ANY files that are not in the folder with the UI mods will be read from the default folder.<br />
<br />
So if you have a mod only for the player window for example(1 file) that's all that needs to be in the new folder.<br />
<br />
VI did this so there would be less confusion and crashing when they patch and change an UI file. <br />
<br />
Most times it won't affect your mods but if it does just delete or move the mod folder and the default UI will load. If that becomes the case you will have to either wait for the mod to be upgraded or remove the same named file that was patched from the mod folder. Of course that may break the mod if it's a full mod.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Very good one to remember here - use &quot;/loadskin (name) 1&quot;.  The &quot;1&quot; switch will keep all your current window positions, fading settings, etc.</div></div><hr />
