<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fenriswulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings, finally hit 34th after a long long time of soloing without a pet.  It's good now at the moment, and I am definately looking forward to the new spells.<br />
<br />
Question I am asking is what mobs can I farm and also exp off that will give me enough cash for a Jaundiced Bone Bracer at 45th level.  They cost anywhere from 24-28k on Vallon Zek server.<br />
<br />
The mobs I'd like to hunt also need to give enough exp so I can keep going up in levels and attain 45th.  Giants in RM?  Ice Giants in Iceclad?  Acrylia ore?  Other mobs that might drop goodies that people pay a lot for?<br />
<br />
Let me know!  I am interested to hear from other players.<br />
<br />
Fenriswulf/Stormwulf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">rm giants are good pp despite what a lot of people say, and probably great exp at 34.<br />
kinda doubt you can solo them at 34 though..maybe get a higher level melee partner and try it. I really don't know how hard they are then, but it might be worth a try.<br />
Solusek A is nice, loot all the finestell etc , it adds up. You will get exp there too, not bad exp..but not the best you could get at 34 , either..<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Crystal Caverns perhaps? I can't remember what level I started there, you may be a little low. The orcs drop velium bricks and weapons (weaps great for dogdog or sell to vendors), then when you can handle it kill the geos down the bottom. When you can kill em all before repop you should be making about 1k an hour - but you will need quite a few more levels for that. Still, its not bad money to share with some friends, and the xp is nice being a dungeon zone.<br />
<br />
Check the hunting grounds forum for your level range, sure to be lots of ideas there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find that farming items that you can sell to high level folks who really don't care is the way to go.  On that note, I say hit up your local Splitpaw Lair just off of SK, and farm Gnoll Hide Lariotts and Dagger of Droppings.  Sell the daggers for 10pp each in the bazaar, and the GHL for 20-50pp each.  I personally pay upto 40pp per Lariott I find in the bazaar.  I'm a high level shaman, who drops pp on silly pet weapons.<br />
Good luck man. Way to plan ahead!<br />
Splitpaw is good exp at 34 too, and you can occasionally find high level shamans in there farming Lariotts too.  I met a couple really cool newbies in there myself buffing them.</div></div><hr />
