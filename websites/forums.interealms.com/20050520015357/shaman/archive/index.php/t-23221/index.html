<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone had a chance to try this out yet?  Hate the thought of wasting AA's on it...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It does the same thing it did before.  The description was changed to reflect that it regens health ( like it did before and like both the other priests get) and not endurance ( like it said it did)<br />
<br />
It has marginal uses.  THe cleric thats part of my regular goup has it and will pop the ward if we get a few adds, but other than that its not worth much.  Its great for powerleveling though.  Combine that with a level 39 chlror and you've got a soloing machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why would I spend AA to upgrade an ability that is garbage?<br />
<br />
I refunded mine and won't get it until after I get the rest of the GoD AA and if OoW are any good, won't get it until the rest of the OoW ones are done.</div></div><hr />
