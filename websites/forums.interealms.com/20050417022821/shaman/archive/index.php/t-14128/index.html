<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sshasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read through this site countless times.  I've tried dulak, chardok, scarlet desert, the grey, seb, velks . . . and am pulling my hair out.  The exp is horrible.  Its so slow.  Taking anywhere from 3 - 5kills per 1% . . am I just doing something wrong. <br />
<br />
I run normally 2050hps unbuffed, with almost 1k ac.  I set up dogdog, alpha him up, pull slow, dot, and tank usually using my JBB.  This is my normal fighting scenario.  1 fight away from my epic so that should be comin soon.  But any other suggestions or tips on where to go.  Its depressing me to the point where its hard to log in cause I just can't get exp anymore.  Grouping is almost a chore as most pick up groups scare the begebus out of me.  So I tend to just solo and group with guildies when applicable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoJ zoneout has worked very well for me at 54 and now 55.  You may have to deal with trains and adds but you should be able to do that with a little bit of fancy rootwork.  About a percent every 2 kills.  Make sure you take out Sralm first.  Keep resist magic on you and dogdog, cause most mobs are casters.  Oh and one last thing, make sure you have your sow boots or some junk buff up in 1st buff slot, cause some casters dispell.  Mobs don't have much HP, 2 ebolts and dogdog will take them down, with the Sentries of Justice and Sralm taking more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just went though 55 and most of 56 and quite frankly I can tell you straight to get over your fear of pick up groups.  I hate them also, but if you want at least .5% per kill in those levels you can do it in a courtyard group in PoD.<br />
<br />
Also, you should try your best to get back into the habit of grouping before the new xp system is set up.  From what it looks like you will be getting even less xp solo than you do now, and twice that if you group.<br />
<br />
/shrug  I do know how you feel, I would rather solo simply because of time constraints, but big VI is making that harder and harder to do.  <br />
<br />
Just try to put up with the headache of grouping a bit and you will see the xp rise.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah, solo exp is only being nerfed in PoP zones, not everywhere else.  Personally, I finished out 55 in Maiden's Eye on Gorangas.  Hunters make for a little bit of fun if you're interested in challenging yourself.  Once you hit 56, it's time for Katta guards.  Great solo exp there, and you'll probably be able to pull non-stop once you get the rhythm down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Liley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am 55 also, and I usually use Dulak when solo.  Experience is certainly not as nice as it once was but you have a chance of gems, and even a rare captain spawning =).<br />
<br />
However, for a change of pace, I sometimes use Maiden's Eye and do the Umbrous Toilers ~ you just have to position yourself way up on the zone wall to avoid adds.  They have less HP's than the gorangas from my exp, you have no trains going to DSP, and you have a chance to get the quest piece for the Shield of Bane Warding quest if so desired =).  It is a good sellable item even if you do not intend to use.<br />
<br />
GL on 55!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Impact</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Buckle up, 56 has been much worse then 55 for me.  I want 57 so bad for my group sta/agi and already want 58 for my big heal.  I mostly group in PoN or if I am lucky, PoD courtyard group.   Good luck, 50's have been a bumpy road for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sshasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">welp I've been soloing / grouping in PoD.  Soloing Rats / Goos when needed gets me about 1% every other kill usually.  Also got into a Courtyard group . . . was about 2-3kills per 1%, but just horribly boring.  I don't remember these levels being so rough on my necro heh...grr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grab yourself a kei and run over to Howling Stones.  I absolutely love this zone.  Couple of tips before you zone in.<br />
<br />
1.  Make sure you have root, superior heal, your pet spell, and gate up in your spell slots.<br />
2.  Before you enter HS make sure you are invis.<br />
3.  Upon zone in you will be underneath an overhang.  There will be 2 entrance mobs in the area.  Quickly root the mobs, back away, heal yourself if you have to, and summon pet.  Zone in will always be tricky solo but once you get familiar with zoning in you will get yourself a routine.<br />
4.  The entrance mobs are on a 20 minute timer.  So keep this in mind as you pull Pyres.  <br />
5.  Get a map of the zone<br />
<br />
As a level 58 Iksar Shaman I get 1 percent regular exp every 4 or 5 mobs.  I get 1 percent AA exp per kill at 58.  Nice zone for AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">tried an old fav as i was soooooosick of HHK<br />
