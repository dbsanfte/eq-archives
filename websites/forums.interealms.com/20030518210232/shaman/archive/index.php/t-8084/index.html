<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dazma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya,<br />
<br />
1st post here, sorry if im repeating what has already been mentioned searched and turned up nothing.<br />
<br />
Just wandering what sort of force is needed ?<br />
<br />
could a 58 monk 55 Sham do this duo ??<br />
<br />
monk is on 71% haste approx 1050AC buffed<br />
Sham no Epic (duh!) no JBB ikky BP regen<br />
<br />
or would i be better off grabing another 1 or 2 to ensure the kill ?<br />
<br />
<br />
thanx for any input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say add a Tank in there and you'd be good. The Black Dire hits failry hard and fast. It's been so long since I killed him, I don't remember if you can slow.<br />
<br />
You and a Tank could duo, but not sure about a monk. Might just be a good idea to get a full group for the heck of it.<br />
<br />
I did the Dire when I was in my 40s and had like 3 groups of 40ish people to take him out. I have since been in on 2 more kills. Once with 4 people and once with full group. Both were post 50 groups with cleric and warrior and they were easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dire is slowable, just make sure he is slowed before you engage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">as long as the monk pulls to entrace of MM he is an extremely easy kill. Summon pet if u want for jokes but dont worry to much. I did this quest at lv 52 with a 55 monk so u can easily with a 57 monk. Just land slow on mean dogdog and cripple him and just watch ur hp still shouldnt be much of a problem. your own dogdog with monk are more then enough to kill dire</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seconds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did it today with a 61 sk, 57 cleric botted (didnt have to use) and myself 40 shaman.  SK cleared the way there... single pulled BD, after 3 malisements my 3rd one finally landed and then slapped togors on after that.  SK was down to about 40% after tapping, and he has approx 4.5k hp so you do the math, the mob was slowed about 66% thru the fight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dazma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OMG 4500hp + slowable thats the kind of info I was looking for, sounds easily doable.<br />
<br />
Will have aego + Focus put on the monky + KEI on me and should be a breeze.<br />
<br />
all being well will try and eat the HT, FD, heal monk then /q out relog and kill the beastie <br />
<br />
Thanx for the info =) all being well advisor will be up when I get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hiho,<br />
<br />
just make sure to have his MR debuffed before you slow.<br />
<br />

Beat the snor out of the entire zone while waiting for the advisor to pop, beat the snot out of the advisor, jumped down to kill Black Dire, was overkill. Fairly nice exp, though.<br />
<br />
Advisor / BD are on a 4 hour spawn. Want to make buddies in your guild? Have them all work on thier truespirit factions, and farm this guy's furry butt. The boots are inventory-clickable by everyone. It's kinda sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So what you're saying is that anyone can hail the Lesser Spirit that starts the epic and do the quest as if they were a shaman?  I had always assumed that either the Spirit only popped if a shaman killed the mob, or only a shaman would get the quest dialogue when they hailed him. This sounds way too cool to not try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yub easily doable with just you 2. I did it at 57 with a 57 monk partner, done it with just me and another shaman (60 and 53) and again with another shaman (60 and 49). Slow him and its pretty easy. Just make sure your pet takes the HT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;The boots are inventory-clickable by everyone. It's kinda sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Please be joking. I know others can get the boots - there's a post in Alla about a wizard who did it for the boots, found out they were not shaman wearable, and fed them to his pet.<br />
<br />
If SoE finds out about this, they'll make it wearable/click only,  like the jbb, and that ruins my playstyle... I don't want to /wear/ the blasted things, only click them.</div></div><hr />

The boots are inventory-clickable by everyone. It's kinda sick. <br />
Last I heard of another class trying this it didn't work. They're only activatable by Shaman.<br />
<br />
On the other note...did the Dire for my wifes Shammy a while back. Had a 60 Ogre warrior and his 56 Cleric bot. I didn't even have to slow. HOWEVER...I don't think the Dire has only 4500 hp's. Closer to 10+k'ish IIRC. I've been there 3 or 4 times now and he doesn't go down as quickly as a Sea Fury (that also has about 4.5k hp's).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Seconds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah im my post I was referring to the amount of hps that the SK had that I was working with, not the mob.  Shoulda cleared that up for ya =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lemyoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Did this the other night as 53 shammy with a 57 monk along for the ride.  <br />
<br />
Cleared everything we came across going up to the advisor, took his robe, jumped off the bridge and headed over to the dire.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't say it was easy, only because we started the battle with me at about 40 percent manna because stupid me made a pet that the dire aggroed while it was killing one of the regular wolfs -- pet took the HT though, so that was actually a good thing.<br />
<br />
Either way, I was able to slow and cripple him (1 or 2 resists on slow I think) and he went down.  Think the monk had about half health left and still had his mend in his pocket.  Probably would have been easier if I was FM to start and could have tossed an ebolt or two on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I keeled Black Dire when I was 51. Slowed him without much difficulty -- got one resist maybe. I had a 57 warrior and a 56 Ranger. It took them no time to kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can kill the Black Dire solo if you want, although I would guess that it's considered an exploit.<br />
<br />
I stood right next to a Shaman in my old guild and watched him do it, he didn't even get hit once, he was 49 at the time.<br />
<br />
I won't post the method here, but it's pretty easy to figure out if you take a look at the area the Black Dire is in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yep, that method is considered a pathing exploit.  Then again, when was the last time you saw a GM in game?<br />
<br />
Do so at your peril.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>t0ad5</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">just last night what we did was kill the wolfs at the spawn point, kill the advisor, and the quest wolf spawned with nothing else around him.. easy to single pull him when he's solo eh?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Did Black Dire last nite with me (58 shammy) and 57 mage.  Piece of cake.  I slowed BD first time with no MR debuffing; cripple and malosini landed too no problem; resisted Bane of Nife a couple times.  After slowing and crippling, the few times he hit me (AC 975) was for only about 60.  Basically, the only signficant damage output he had was the initial harm touch eaten by the mage pet.<br />
<br />
He went down in less than a minute.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt be surprised if a 58 shaman could solo him.  The main issue would be my low damage output compared to the mage helping me, and BD resisting my dots.<br />
<br />
When I agroed him and tried to pull him to the zoneline, he didn't follow me all the way and stopped in the middle somewhere.  Must have outran him too fast.  So pause a bit if you try to pull him to zone.  But he did stay put where he stopped following me, and we just fought him there.<br />
<br />
BD was not up when I got there, so I cleared the 4 Blood Wolves at his spawn point then went after Advisor.  It took about 20 minutes to get the Advisor, by which time the Blood Wolves had all respawned.  But BD could be single pulled toward zoneline with slow, so didnt really matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I actually did this part of the Quest at lvl 46.  had a 51 monk, 51 pally(both guildies) and a 50 War(I helped him just prior to killing the Black dire kill the gypsies for an item he wanted) (heheh can you tell I was the youngster here?).  Any ways once we killed the advisor  the rest of the party went to the Zl and I didnt even talk to the Black Dire.  I was up on a ledge cast Scourge on the Black Dire (which was resisted btw) which agroed him and his 4 guards (the guards were green to me and had not realized that they had agroed until later).  I gated to the Zl (where I had bound myself before we went in.  Sat for a few minutes while we waited and next thing I know I have his 4 guards on me and I'm dead within 3 sec.  Here is where the bindig at teh Zl is useful.  Once I had collected my things I proceeded to join in the fray  of killing the Black Dire (his buddies were dead by the time I looted my corpse thanks to my friends) and once he was dead Ilooted his pelt and got rezzed by the pally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nianque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">did this last night as a 43 shammy with a 50 mage. Only buffs we had were the ones I cast. (ie no c3, no ageo, etc..)<br />
<br />
mage sicced his pet on the dire and gated to the zone. When the dire and his buddies got the th mage zoned. the blood wolves went back but the Dire stayed by the zone. This left the dire all alone. <br />
<br />
Mage came back in and we both resummoned, buffed and medded up.  Mage outfitted both pets with swords, plate armor, and elemental binders(for resists). I cast every combat buff and magic resist on every one (2 players 2 pets) as well as regen, and the pets got haste.<br />
<br />
When we were ready we sent in the pets (mage used earth pet) malaise the I slowed and dotted, mage nuked, and i healed his pet (my doggy hit first and got wiped out in the first few seconds) we both went oom and the mage pet died but the dire was already running so i canni'ed up and finished him off with my 250 dmg DD. <br />
<br />
Lots of resists even with malaisement, and mages fire spells only did half damage. We had 2 green adds which i rooted and rotted. The last nuke agroed 2 more greens but we were oom so i just grabbed the hide and we zoned. Finished with both of us at 80% hp and 0 mana. <br />
<br />
Took a while but all in all not that hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zaral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I killed him yesterday with my main (65 Necro) and me (52 Shaman). I cleared the pit and killed the Advisor, necro pet did it all solo without help. Then I single pulled the Black Dire with Saryrns Kiss and let necro pet attack. My shaman slowed him with first try and without any debuffing before. Pet finished him with about 3 bubbs of health left.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Soloed easily at 60.  I tanked for pet while pet did almost all the damage.  Just torpored myself when needed, which wasnt really all that often.  I got Aego before heading to MM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">iirc I did it with 2 monks both 55.  Was easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I just soloed him today at 56 with alpha enabled dog. Was a long fight and after 2 ebolt resists I gave up on that and just sat back and healed dogdog. No clarity nor kei either.<br />
<br />
I was very nervous about doing this but luckily it got off to a good start. Malosi landed and I ran to puppy where he immediately aggroed and ate the HT and turgurs stuck on the first cast. From there it was just canni and heal. It seemed like forever to take away that first bub of hp from BD and I didn't start relaxing until he was down to 1/2 hp and I was still 60mana.<br />
<br />
Btw, don't try soloing at 55, you'll aggro the light blue pups which for some reason are insanely resistant and still have a lot of hp. I was really amazed how hard those were to kill. At 56 BD can be single pulled and it helps to have celerity :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Did it with a 55 sk, 54 monk, and my 54 Necro.  Just fear kited without problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I did this the other night with my friend (lvl 59 Shaman) and me (lvl 40 shaman). The lvl 59 pulled, then we sicked both pets on the Dire, 59 shaman was getting his slow and DoT's resisted. So he just started hitting the Dire with the JBB. I (lvl 40) just kept healing the pets/canni/and Barb Spirt hammering the Dire. I had KEI at the time. No real worries and the fight seemed to last for about 3 to 4 minutes. Looted the pelt and went to EJ, now I am a proud owner of Black fur boots :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well, here was my strategy the two times I've killed him... luckily there was never anyone in the zone, so I was able to pull him to the zoneline for safety.<br />
<br />
Ranger pulled with ensnare, pulled him to the zone.  Necro slapped a couple dots on him, but he resisted some of them or else the fight would have been much shorter.  Ranger fought with my necro's pet a bit until he was low health, backed him off while my necro healed him a bit and tapped Dire to death.<br />
<br />
I had to zone the first time I tried it, and my necro ended up zoning with low hp and got dropped in the middle of Lfay with no buffs... and by the time I got him back and buffed almost ten minutes later, Dire was still sitting ensnared at the zone, with only about ten-fifteen percent health regenerated.  So, you could always pull him to the zone snared (so he won't move if not aggroed), then zone out while you let dots rot him... just make sure you make it back in before he dies or snare breaks.  His regen is very slow, and it's a way to do it without needing a melee/cleric.<br />
<br />
The second time I just had my necro FD-rot him since it was a lot easier than using melees.  It felt cheap, but it was very easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Another tactic I have personally used when level 45 was to pull him to the zone (aggroing everything so be careful no one else is around) then zone out.<br />
<br />
Everyone goes back to spawn point except Dire, who will just stand around for a while on the ramp looking lost.<br />
<br />
Now you can prep up and kill him whenever you want.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">When I did this part, I just pulled him to the zone with my ranger (60 at the time, non-uber), epic slowed him then switched to a dps weapon and tanked him down.  Then camped out, logged on shaman who was parked at the zone and looted the pelt.  Was alot easier than I expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Goratha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The easiest thing that i did was logged on my 55 ranger, and pulled Dire to zone. Zoned out to lose aggro, and zoned back in. Dire will be at the zone. Had a druid there to heal me and just proceded to kill him with a lvl 55 ranger with epic and a lvl 58 druid.. Thats all folks very easy kill. Be sure to have your shammy camped in zone to loot pelt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I did this totally solo at 56.  I had jbb.  I even went in and killed advisor to make dire spawn solo.  Invis up go in kill advisor gate out to zone in.  Then go back and get dire wolf run to zone, wait on dire to get to zone and then zone.  Zone back in, buff up pet, slow dire, sick pet, heal pet and jbb.  Very easy I would say, and at the time my gear was the suck.  Bloodstained tunic just to give and idea.  Good luck on dire.</div></div><hr />
