<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello i just bought an augment (ldon) in EC. (glowing ore of rapid tought)  ...the spell haste IV.<br />
<br />
and i got the ldon helm (incorporal helm of the specter) who got : type 1/2/3  wich can accept the augment.<br />
<br />
slots 1 and 2 are used with 6wis and 6 MR augment and the 3rd  slot (type 3 is free).<br />
when i try to insert the augment , it s telling me &quot; are you sure you wish to insert your augment, but when i push the button ' nothing happen.<br />
<br />
and  i can t get rid of the small window telling me &quot;'are you sure you wish to insert your augment&quot;..i must zone, camp, or change the &quot;UI&quot; .<br />
<br />
And i tried also to use the normal UI and it doesn t work as well.<br />
<br />
i petitioned  2 days ago (july 23rd) but no response yet :confused: <br />
<br />
what the heck happen with the petition now?<br />
<br />
some told me it is a pain now. last time i petitioned was last year, and it didn t take long before they replied..........................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">delete your... I think it's EQUI_ConfirmationDialog.xml from your uifiles\default and let it repatch, then either delete or rename the one in your custom UI so that it uses the newly downloaded default one.<br />
Oh, and make sure you patch after deleting that file :)<br />
That SHOULD take care of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had the same problem shamy60.  All i had to do was swap to the default UI and it worked.  Someone in my guild said to do what Tigran said, so if the default UI doesnt work for you, I would try that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thx, i will try that,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This happened to me too, the confirm box didn't have a yes or no button, and this was with the default UI. I was trying to remove the balance aug from tipt from my old Incorporeal BP. I had to back up to get out of the confirmation box, and when I went to get my stuff back, the container had eaten both my aug and my BP. SoE basically said &quot; sucks for you.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, I had to switch to default UI to remove an aug, then switch back after. <br />
<br />
If you use /loadskin default 1 and then /loadskin [yourui] 1, it keeps your window sizes and positions on switch.</div></div><hr />
