<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As soon as you read level 9, the quest journal will tell you to go see such and such about becoming a shaman. The quest alone is enuf exp to get you to level 10 wich is when you officially become a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lugon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't worry about messing up.  When it comes to the point to choose cleric, druid, or shaman the guy will present you with three choices at once which clearly state I wish to do so and so I want to be a cleric, I want to be this so I want to be a druid, and I want to be really cool so I choose Shaman.  Just pick the right button and you will be fine.  As for myself I had a hard time choosing cleric or shaman and sat there for almost 5 hours with the three choices while reading everything I could find on both such as spell lists, skills, etc.  In the end after playing over 65 levels in EQ1 as a Shaman I decided to stick with a good thing even though the role and spell set seems to have changed so much.<br />
