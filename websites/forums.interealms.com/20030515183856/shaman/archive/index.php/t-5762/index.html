<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhaiman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I'm not too concerned with where to hunt at 54, more with which is the best tactic and most efficient way to kill.<br />
<br />
I'm an Iksar so no JBB for me, nothing special about my gear.<br />
<br />
Currently I am root/rotting. Plague &amp; Ebolt, rinse &amp; repeat. This seems to take about 1.5-2m per dark blue (based on cavemen in Scarket Desert) provided I can canni whilst they rot.<br />
<br />
Other things I was contemplating....(don't get me wrong I know these aren't earth-shattering new idea, just not the way I've done things recently)<br />
<br />
Kiting with dog - Now that the moving DoT penalty is gone (unless that was just a rumour) dotting and keeping aggro with dog snapping at their heels. The upside to this is the additional dog damage (whats that about 1k dpm?) but less canni'ing (although as I have Fungal I regen on the move just fine).<br />
<br />
Tanking for dog - I've got AC covered (god bless you iksar racial bonus) but my melee output is low due to current weapon ( jade chok prod) and I think it may be inefficient with amount of mana I'd use healing myself.<br />
<br />
My other question is how do tactics change at 55? Does the new pet make a significant difference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just combine 2 of the 3 methods. Slow apply Dot's and then tank for dogdog. You can always let dog tank for little bit while you canni back the mana used. <br />
<br />
Root &amp; rot at this lvl is just too boring and imo not that effiecient with the amount of hps that mobs have depending on the expansion you are hunting in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If the things you are fighting really aren't all that tough, you might want to also try having your pet tank. At Level 34 this wouldn't work (hence the impression that everyone gets that our pet can't tank), but give your current pet HP/AC, Regrowth, and drop Turgur's on the MOB, and it's probable that the pet can tank the entire fight, or at least most of it. Just keep the MOB rooted and you can med, so it's like the root/rotting you're currently doing only you're getting that additional pet damage. And leave /pet taunt on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The new pet at 55 is more durable, taunts better, hits slightly harder and more frequently.  In a straight up fight, he'll get dropped fast on an unslowed mob, or when fighting 2 mobs at a time.  On slowed, controlled single pulls, your pet usually tanks very well for you allowing you to med, or deal death from a distance.  Give your pet the right tools by tossing at least 2 buffs on it (speed, regen), but I also like to toss on a HoS for improved avg damage and seemingly better taunts.<br />
<br />
Typical fight scenario for me is<br />
1) pull with slow<br />
2) root near my pet<br />
3) epic<br />
4) pet attack<br />
5) additional dots/debuffs as required (IE: Bane/pox on non-pr/dr mobs)<br />
6) jbb (in your case, additional dots and med, or just melee) and melee till mob around 30-50% depending on mob durability and pull rate.<br />
7) root, back off, med/regen/can let wonderdog and lingering dots toast the mob.<br />
8) go back to 1.<br />
<br />
It eventually gets so routine that the adjustments become natural and you can pull before the current mob is even dead, or park another one dotted and slowed till wondermutt is done feasting.   Epic is great for mana free damage while the mob is parked and awaiting destruction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get an iceworm fang.  Then your melee will be more efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You are not kidding about that icewurm fang! I read this the other day and went out and bought one in the bazaar (traded a fishbone earring for it actually and it's been worth every penny). The thing procs like mad when you're sped up and people on a raid today were amazed at how fast I was going (since I normally use slower 2HB) and how much damage I was adding. I don't have a JBB yet, or the epic spear, but I like to think of this icewurm fang as my &quot;mini-epic.&quot; (grin)  - Warmag of MM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The REIF is indeed great. I just paid 7K for one on Povar in the Bazaar. I have no idea if I got hosed or not, but it doesn't matter. My piercing skill was only 91 (2hb maxed at 200) and in just over 2 hours at level 52 killing seafuries to work on skill, I raised my piercing to 139, plus it procs 4-6 times a fight for 81DD with HoS and Rage on. Get this weapon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Considering how much damage the thing does compared to my old hammer of rage with nearly 200 in 2hb skill &amp; the level 51+ bonus damage on 2hb, I'd say 7K is still a good price (I would have saved up to 10K for one of these if I couldn't get a group to go to Kael with me to get it that is).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In 54 myself now and trying a variety of things. One thing you may consider is switching to the new cold nuke if you were before just using e-bolt and a disease dot on some mobs. I found that on really tough mobs that are not soloable with e-bolt and a disease dot + pet + yourself tanking, if you root + nuke and then let the mob chase you with pet biting it until pet taunts off, then nuke again until it re-aggros you and repeat, the kinds of mobs you can take down might surprise you (mana permitting of course). - Warmag of MM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zhaiman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've switched to the tanking with pet from root/rot and I must say that even without a nice melee weapon the improvement in efficiency is noticeable.<br />
<br />
I am definitely considering the REIF as a weapon upgrade but its slightly out of my pricerange currently. I'm hoping that once all the even better weapons in PoP come out I can pick one up on the cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well this is sacriledge I'm sure but with Dot nerf removed, Kiting is a viable option now.  On mobs I know I'm going to have a little trouble with or just want to Kite around for fun like my Bard does, I'll;<br />
<br />
Pull with Malosi or insideous decay<br />
<br />
Root, Poison dot, disease dot and kite him in little circles once root breaks. sometimes if root doesnt want to break, fine!  or you can coerce it into breaking with a JBB blast etc.  when fade message pops up, get out of cast range, stop, reroot, reapply and kite some more.  Once mob is down to a &quot;doable&quot; level you can kill the old way or continue kiting.<br />
<br />
This makes it fun for me to kill higher con Blue mobs that don't summon that usually would take far too much mana to be efficient.  If you want to have Fido 1.0 chase the mob around and nip at him, fights go even faster.<br />
<br />
p.s. Horse helps too, models off of course.<br />
<br />
just another option when you absolutely, positively, get the urge to kill a non-summoning mob ( without Torpor ) that you really should leave alone, says your guildmates.  Not for everyone because you can't chain canni, but with horse, KEI or crack, makes for a nice change of pace.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think DogDog is highly under appreciated or abused.  I personally buff my pet to full.  I give him every buff I give myself with the only exception being Charisma.  Casting HoS first then stacking Str and Dex ontop helps his damage output noticabley.  I heard a rumor from a beastlord friend of mine a few weeks ago that VI broke pets damage tables in a patch, and this is to our advantage.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong:  Shammy and BL pets have damage based on a H2H chart.  Since they broke them, if you give them weapons non h2h based, it moves the pet into a different (much better) damage table.  He won't hit for a larger max, but he'll sure as hell hit for max more often, and just hit more often all together.  Because of this, I've been on a trend of twinking my pet.  I buy up tons of little weapons under 100pp that have interesting procs, just to give them to my dog.  With the pet fully buffed and duel wielding, he can tank most dark blues with just a Turgur's. <br />
<br />
My personal tactic is:<br />
Pull with slow<br />
Send in the Pet<br />
Dot if mob is beefy<br />
Canadance till FM or Dog is 40%hp, which ever comes first<br />
Finish off mob tanking, which lets pet regen for next fight<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: With the Bazaar wrecking havoc on the economy you can make your pet do cool things for cheap with proc weapons.  Mix and match to see what works best.  I probably spend about 1k every 2 weeks on pet weapons.  Some would call it a waste of money, I call it making soloing fun.  Here's some other helpful hints.<br />
<br />
Stun:  stun procs are great against caster classes and work well as a cheap snare.  Even against melees, repeated duel procing stun weps will help keep your pet alive longer and easier. On a ton of weapons<br />
<br />
Root:  Tired of casting enstill or immobolize to root/rot?  Pick up a couple Ebony Bladed Long swords and put that pet window to use, with some mana free dogdog crowd control<br />
<br />
Snare: So you messed up and didnt take Innoruk as you diety, no snare necklace for you.  Try giveing your puppy a Serrated Bone Dirk for some engulfing darkness action, Woe works well with it too for the double DoT action.  (My combo of choice in Skyfire)<br />
<br />
DD:  Puppy can crank out alot more damage with HoS stacked with Dex and sporting some cheap Ykesha or Spiritstrike procing weapons.<br />
<br />
Avoid Iron Bound Tome at all costs, nothing worse than your dog dispelling your buffs.<br />
<br />
Have fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not all that great xp at level 54, but here's what I tried on the manticore (the aprox. 4k hitpoint version) in Eastern Wastes. Pull with slow (Tugors), then run up to the parked, buffed pet, stop, turn diagonally and root, nuke 1 or 2 times with the level 54 ice strike (this will _really_ make the mob mad at you), sit and med for a sec until root breaks, then run in a slow, wide circle, seek pet on mob, pet will bite the mob until eventually he does enough damage or taunting to get the mob to stop chasing you. Now nuke again with ice strike, the mob will resume chasing you... keep going in a circle and repeat the nuke each time the pet stops the mob. Takes about 6 ice strikes but it works. Gave me about a tick of blue xp at 54 for one of these (not all the time either... xp seemed sort of random). Anyway it seemed to work. Downside is alot of medding up or canning to do afterwards but upside is pet and you should have full health after this. I wouldn't try this with all mobs, just the really tough ones that have a ton of HP and hit hard like the manticore. - Warmag of MM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Here is another thing you might consider. Go to a newbie zone, like field of bone, and break out your old low level spells and practice different strategies on the easy mobs. I don't have a JBB or my epic yet, but I have been occasionally practicing on newbie mobs with lower level dots and nukes that I think emulate what it will be like once I do get these items. (I also take my druid here to practice up on quadding styles). Root the mobs into little formations, dot them, watch them drop like dominos... yep, that's what I'm going to be doing with Mr. Epic once I get it (if the mobs will let me, that is). If not, it's still fun to perfect technique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ice wurm fang on my server runs 8-10k :(<br />
<br />
i lucked out and got it for 4k through the misfortune of somone else losing 5k on the deal heh.<br />
<br />
ahh well , got it though  =\  actualy im finding one of the most important things around your level is giving doggy some nice weapons that proc with low delay. im not sure if delay really matters , havent botthered to check , but doesnt hurt. put on HoS/Kragg and dex to puppy so it can duel wield better ( this i think matters) and get more procs ( this im positive of) and you will solo ALOT better. right now im making it a habit of hitting Splitpaw. i just walk in and offer money or buffs for them or farm them myselfs. so far all i have had to do is buff a few people and walk out with 4 of them. Velium weapons work well too. Ive actualy been considering making a raid policy ( for myself ) that i go and get weapons for puppy before a raid. possibly droping 50-100 per weapon . i dont know if this is worth it or not , have to see what i can get for that price and need to make the cash to begin with :p<br />
<br />
im sure if i gave him 2 weapons that proced a better proc he would be very useful in the raid . but so far Dual stun is real nice. was helping BIG time in UP yesterday. after ym group left I was almost able to solo the zone line. but alas , i was over powering in the end due to lack of mana. i think if i had meded up full i might have made it , or atleast had epic. Yes , if i had epic i know i could have made it. point being though , i got alot father then ever before thnx to puppies nice stuns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is a great idea. but i just wanted to comment that it might be better to do it with light blues instead of lower level spells and greens. you wanna get used to the mana consumption and beatings you can take per level .<br />
<br />
my 2 cents anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am cheap and havent been buying proc weapons to give to the dog, but I have concluded from log parsing that you get a big boost in dog melee by giving him 2 weapons of any kind, because he starts dual wielding.  The off hand attack is all a bonus above what the dog would otherwise do.  I do not see any difference in average attack between rusty and fine steel, because I think the dog is using his own attack speed and attack level.  The second weapon just opens up the dual wielding.<br />
<br />
Typical results for the 55 pet with a FS dagger and FS sword against Drolvarg Sentries in KC would be 18 dps primary hand (slashing damage) plus 8 dps from off hand (piercing damage), for a total around 26 dps.<br />
<br />
I agree with those above who recommend buffing the dog and letting him tank the slowed mob.  Works fine on dark blue exp mobs.  If you get adds, pull them off with a slow and root park until ready to kill them.  A very fun style of soloing too, IMO.  I have a JBB, and find that the dog stays ahead of me in agro even while chain casting the JBB throughout the fight.  The logs show I have outdamaged the dog that way, but he still seems to keep agro using taunt and proximity.  Ebolt will give me the agro though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Merdenoms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm a lvl 54 Shaman on Tarew Marr.  No Epic, no Fungi, no JBB, no nothing.  Here's my typical senerio while soloing.  <br />
<br />
Before the very first pull I cast Bih`li, Levitate and Regrowth on myself.  I cast Regrowth and Alacrity on my pet (that's it, no HoS, Str or Dex).<br />
<br />
I suggest you find a zone that you are pretty familiar with.  Park your pet somewhere free of adds (if possible).<br />
<br />
1) Pull with Turgur's Insects.<br />
2) Run a good distance past pet but still within casting range and wait for mob to come.  This is where levitate comes into play when I sometimes solo in OOT and run over the water past my pet parked on the shoreline.  Can be done w/o Levitate, just run along the shoreline.<br />
3) Sick pet when mob reaches it.  Your pet should gain aggro cause all you've done is slowed it.<br />
4) optional - Cast a disease based DoT since the fight my take about a minute or two.  You can also cannibalize a bit if you desire.  You can now sit since pet will be owning it (they're tougher than people think).<br />
5) Root mob at about 40%<br />
6) Toss a DD on it if Mana permits.<br />
7) DoT and Root should break before mob is dead.  But by the time root breaks mob should be atleast 20%.  You may now Melee it to death along side pet.<br />
<br />
You will notice very little downtime if any at all.  If you wanna toss some melee buffs on your pet feel free.  I just choose not to cause i wanna get right into the pulls after the little buffs I toss before the fight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nice thread this one :) Here's my current setup for soloing at 55:<br />
<br />
Go to JP and fight the gnolls in the North. My favoured spot is just down the pit, back to the wall. There's one spawn immediately infront of you in the tunnel before it opens into the large room. He won't aggro when you drop in though, just back off and get ready.<br />
<br />
Self-buffs: Just about everything<br />
Pet buffs: HoS, Str and dex from JB gear, alacrity<br />
<br />
Pull with slow, set pet on it. Cast plague (normally get aggro at this stage, but that's no problem) and then EBolt (sometimes need to try a few times to channel it). After they have landed I root and let pet tank. I then sit back and med and canni. If root breaks or pet is getting beaten up badly I then tank for the pet until the mob starts to run. With JBB I'd tank and channel JBB nukes I think, but at the moment I prefer to regain the mana as pet is fairly effective. If needed I sometimes add regrowth on the pet.<br />
<br />
When the mob runs it will just path into the rear wall and can't move any further. It keeps trying to run - so its like a free snare! At this point I either resume medding and canni, or go pull another, while the pet chews it up.<br />
<br />
I normally find the DoTs fade just before the mob dies (with ext aff 3), unless I was tanking it too. It can take a while for dog dog to finish it off without DoTs, so when that happens I melee too. Oh for a JBB!<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
Most mobs are warriors, but there are some shaman, necro, and cleric types. I melee them with my howling harpoon for extra stuns - will try some gnoll hide lariats on pet next!<br />
<br />
Aggro radius is very low so single pulls are normally easy. Most I got was one add from a pop while pulling back, plus one add when the tunnel mob popped. I slowed and double-dotted the adds, and then rooted them out the way. With KEI they were easy to handle. Risk of bigger trains is practically zero at this spot.<br />
<br />
Xp was just over 1 blue bub an hour at 55 (100% xp - 0% aa).<br />
<br />
My gear is far from uber. Using a spine chill spear, only items of note are iksar regen bp and coldain military bracer (helps a lot). I try to get a KEI before starting too. JBB and REIF would make this a lot easier I think.</div></div><hr />
