<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, just wondering if it would be possible to solo in PoN (or another Tier 1 Plane) at 54 with my current gear (KEI/Virtue of course) If not solo, how about with a 53 Beastlord, 55 Druid, or 53 Cleric (wife's characters) I just dinged 54 in Skyfire soloing everything but chromo's (took out a Guardian of Filia too :) ) Any suggestions? I'm kinda tired of LDoN grinding /sigh 150 more points for Anathema....<br />
Thanks in advance, Lizwrath</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know about solo, but I'd say probibly with the druid you could duo fine. Last night I was in PoN doing spiders, tree's and blood ravens with a 57 necro, we were kiting with him keeping the aggro and me casting dots and nuking, worked great.</div></div><hr />

Solo....forget it. Near even con mobs that hit really hard (in the 300s). At least not until 55, when you get new pet and bane of nife. Duo....doable but a bit difficult. I recently duod there with mage (both 57 at the time), pets tanked, it was pretty easy, and great xp (probably a little more than 1% a kill).</div></div><hr />
