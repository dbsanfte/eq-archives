<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Broke down and bought malos tonight even though I'm only 58 or will be tomorrow. Got a deal at 50k and it just seemd a waste to buy malo/topor then replace them in 5 levels when exp is amazing in pov. Going to simply level to 65 like crazy. I've only been back 2 1/2 weeks ( quit game a long long time ago)  and will have gone 8 levels tomorrow and was going to stop at 60 and do aa, but at this point whats 5 more levels?<br />
<br />
Anybody think I've made a mistake? Also I've heard quisience is really rare so would buying torpor be worthwhile?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You didn't make a mistake.  And I would wait to buy Quiesence.  Runes drop by the truck load in Elemental Planes.  Depending how many guild on Cazic are in Elemental Planes you could very easily see Qui up for sale by time you hit 60.   Qui is going to be MUCH more common than Torpor ever will.  Especially considering many guilds probably will be turning extra runes in to shaman spells since we are the only class that doesn't have some really ****ty level 65 spells.  All ours are good.   Other classes have some really crap spells for 65, you think our spectrals are bad, be glad they are spectrals and not runes.   Sucks turning in Runes to cleric/wizard/paladin vendors and getting pacification or root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dont know if this applies to you or not, but its a good post and some food for thought, search for the post by BlargX a little ways in on some reasons for not leveling to 65 quickly, its entitled 'Aaah the power of levels'.  May want to read the rest of the posts as well.<br />
