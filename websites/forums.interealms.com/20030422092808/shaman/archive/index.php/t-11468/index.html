<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I say I'm new because I inherited Atomm when he was 55.  He was completely naked and I've had to equip him myself.  Quite a feat since my main was at the time a 51 Paladin.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm trying to better understand the AC/HP vs Wis in gear.  I don't solo with Atomm ever, but I do 2box with Derek a lot.  I do group with Atomm a lot, but I don't seem to be too low on mana with KEI as long as I'm not the only buffer/slower for the entire RAID.<br />
<br />
I've got about 2K now in the bank and I've slowly been upgrading my armor.  I was hoping perhaps some of you veteran shamans could enlighten me on the current pros/cons of AC/HP vs WIS and suggest some newer items I should be searching out.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The current thinking is:<br />
hp &gt; AC &gt; mana &gt; wis<br />
<br />
You have to understand that for a shaman, hp and mana are essentially interchangeable - mana converts to hp via healing, hp converts to mana via cannibalise. So, hp are better than mana because 0hp = dead, 0mana = canni some mana - mobs take away your hp, so AC protects your hp - you dont need to protect your mana<br />
<br />
Your wisdom (and your +mana items) defines the size of your total mana pool (think of it like a swimming pool), but your efficiency is not defined by how big the pool is, but by how fast you can re-fill it. Having a huge swimming pool is useless if you have to refill it with a teaspoon! i.e. having massive wisdom is useless if you have to med for 15 minutes when you are OOM! The thing is how fast you can regen mana, which, because of canni, is determined by both your total hp, and your rate of hp regeneration.<br />
<br />
OK, thus endeth the lesson.<br />
<br />
So, work on your hp &amp; AC- lose the jasper rings, get either 65hp 6ac or Shadel Bandit / Circled Toe Bone. Once you hit 60 lose the fungi - Torpor is better hp regen than fungi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you very much for the information.<br />
<br />
Is there any kind of numeric system that is generally accepted to determine what items are generally better?<br />
<br />
For instance, I have both Sarnack Battle Shield and a Shield of Bane Warding.  My gut instinct is that 20 wis &gt; 5 STR, 5 STA, 25 HPS and 10 SVM, but some guildlines would be helpful.  I'll invest in the AC rings as soon as they drop back to 350-500pp on my server.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For us, 1 STA equals 3 hp at level 60.<br />
<br />
Warriors tend to believe 1 AC = 10 hp. I equate that to about 1 Wis also.<br />
<br />
So 1 Wis = 1 AC = 10hp = 3 Sta, for purposes of our mana pool.<br />
<br />
In the 20s and 30s, you get 10hp to 4 mana.<br />
In the 40s, this improves to about 10hp giving 5 mana.<br />
It finally tops out to 10hp giving 5.5 mana with Can III and IV.<br />
The Cannibalization AA is also provides about 5.5 mana for each 10 hp.</div></div><hr />
