<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Coryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I've been retired for a while now, and I know I'm not coming back.   I have a copy of torpor that'll never get used sitting on a shammy twink.  Knowing how rare it is, letting it sit unused would make me ill.   All my guildmates have it -- hell, I bought several copies specifically for em.<br />
<br />
So, here's what we're gonna do.   A shammy that ordinarily would have a hard time getting a copy of this fine spell is going to get it.<br />
<br />
Post here if you're a 60 shammy (sorry, no sub 60s unless all the 60s have it) and do not have torpor.  Mention how long you've been 60, and talk about efforts you've made to get it if indeed you've had a hard time trying.  Doesn't have to be long, by any means.<br />
<br />
I'll pick one person who needs it in a few days.<br />
<br />
Good luck to all.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Also have spirit quickening, cann 4, frenzied spirit, form of the great bear, talisman of the cat, voice of the berserker, focus of spirit, regrowth of dar khura, and talisman of epuration.  Some common, some not so common, but I'll try and give em out if people need em.</div></div><hr />

Sharine is going to help me camp spells when the time comes, so if you happen to still have the spell left, maybe you can let her hold onto it ^_^ Anyways take care and gl to the future<br />

Seriously, its nice to see that kindness still exists in this world, virtual or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll just post here in case no one else on Fennin needs it. I'm currently really low in level (41) so really I'm very very last on the list.  <br />
<br />
But hey if no one else wants it I would love to have it, as my guild will be needing me high in levels soon and I plan to get there in a few months or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cheer! Nice move Coryn. On Brell and lucky enough to have Torpor, but just wanted to say that your a class act. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am also a non 60 shm but a Crucible oldie and also been trying to level like mad as I have found a great home on a new server with some old friends (they tried to get me to come over forever).  I have been playing since release and up till recenlty have still been wearing totemic and other lowbie gear :)<br />
<br />
Again I am near last in line but I probably will never see this spell otherwise.</div></div><hr />

I have been farming the hell out of rockhopper hides and selling them in hopes of someday being able to buy Torpor. I am about half way there by the current Bazaar standards.  Rockhoppers make me ill by seeing them now. :(<br />
<br />
I have a tiny bit of built up karma with Coryn. I CRed you for free in Seb once from Disco2 with my rogue, Gooda. Will karma prevail?  :)<br />
<br />
At any rate, good to see you around Coryn, and kudos on the very kind gesture. Take care.</div></div><hr />

Heh, I only wished I hadn't spent 35kpp on it before you sent me that tell last night bro :/<br />

Happy retirement my friend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Loke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gresgoth from Defenders of Ak`Anon pointed this out to me, he knows ive been looking hard for torpor and I have been spending most non-raid eq situations trying to get a RH group going. <br />
<br />
I am a 60th Shaman, I have 2 AA points hehe, I have been saving up for spells but Malo is about 50k these days and a lot of my efforts have gone towards other spells leaving no finances for Torpor. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bravo, very classy.<br />
<br />
I'm not 60 yet, but I'll add myself to the list in the off chance that all of the deserving level 60 Shaman out there already have it.<br />
<br />
I am currently 56.5 and grinding towards 60. I enjoy being a Shaman, especially the ability to either group or solo when the mood suits me. My play time is extremely limited, and I am usually only able to log on and play for a few hours at a time.<br />
<br />
Although I know for certain that I will reach 60, I am not in a guild, and I do not think that I will ever get Malo and Torpor. I would admit that the slim chance of getting these two &quot;class-defining&quot; spells is the one thing that is slowing my progress. It's sort of depressing to grind grind grind knowing that when you finally get to 60 the 2 spells you NEED will be out of your grasp. Verant really needs to look at the drop rates on these spells.<br />
<br />
I don't expect to receive this awesome gift, but would like to say that your willingness to do something like this speaks volumes about you. I salute you.</div></div><hr />

Its a very good feeling yet at the same time sad because there is not much you can do to repay the favor. And seeing good friends leave is never fun either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'll add another good story into the mix. I had my first shaman, level 53, hacked and remade as level 1. Lost everything. This happened to a bunch of my friends at the time :/<br />
<br />
One of the first people in my guild at the time (LSD) to step up and help was Coryn. I know he probably long forgot about it, but he gave me 2 floops (Kunark was still pretty fresh, way before SoV or SoL) and an offer to help camp gear if I needed it. I never took him up on the second half of the offer, but just that it was made meant alot.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd have probably quit long ago if not for the kindness of a few folks, Coyrn being one of the them.<br />
<br />
Fennin is the worse for him leaving. :(</div></div><hr />

I have been 60 for 5 months and have almost 3 AA points.   Have been on numerous OS juggs/reets raids and have never seen in drop.  I have also killed guardian wurms in SF and killed the the general and the cliff golem in OT and still have had no luck.  I am not in an UBER guild and the likelyhood of me ever seeing enough money to afford either Torpors or Malo is very remote.  I and my entire guild would be forever greatful if you would bestow this gift on me.<br />

<br />
I have a 60 shaman that is badly in need of Torpor. I've been 60 for a few weeks and I'm only 8 AA short of Mass Cannibalization. I've been camping the Emporer in OS every day for the last three weeks. Seems to be an abundance of Wizard drops, but no Shaman drops yet. My guild is very small. So small, I'm the only level 60 AND the only player with epic. I also noticed that you have Voice of the Berzerker. I don't have that yet either, but not sure if I really need it. It seems to have very limited uses.<br />
<br />
Enough of my rambling. If this gift should be bestowed upon me, I would be eternally grateful. If not, my wholehearted congratulations to the recipient. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Since it seems all the level 60 Shaman just registered to get the free Torpor, I'd say give it to Hrothgar with his 1381 posts.<br />
<br />
He's not 60, but he has contributed more to these boards and the Shaman community here than all of these 1-post Oracles (in fact more that ALL of us) put together.<br />
<br />
That's my .02</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wow! Considering how many people I see online yelling for Torpor, I'm surprised this list isn't a lot longer.

Thanks again and good luck in your future, Non-EQ, endeavors.</div></div><hr />

It is harder  for a Shaman in a Uber guild to get torpor, here is a list of what drops torpor<br />
<br />
Faydedar (Timorous Deep)<br />

<br />
How Often do you hear A Uber guild leader scream, &quot;TOLAPUMJ IS UP!  get to OS!!!&quot; or see guilds  verbally abusing each other over those camp spots...<br />
<br />
Infact a shaman in a smaller guild has almost double if not triple the chance of getting torpor same for Malo compared to a larger guild consumed in zones like ToV, Ssra, and Vex Thal.<br />
<br />
Just my 0.02</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I would have to disagree. The uber guilds have uber people. They have such awesome equipment that their exp groups tend to turn into rare hunts. I've seen many of these types xping in areas that smaller guilds consider raid zones.<br />
<br />
There are also many levels of small guild. The average level in my guild is 45 and a 'high end' guild raid takes place in Maiden's Eye. It's for this reason, I get together a few friends and camp Emporer Chottal. He's the only one on that list than can easily be taken down with one group. Unfortunately, I have yet to get any of my spells from him. Pure caster spells seem to be the most common.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You forget these uber shaman already have thier spells from killing those mobs you listed when kunark was new over and over if they really needed it they could kill those mobs over and over and over and over and prolly get all of those before any other guild...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Very decent think of you to do Coryn.<br />
<br />
I am a lvl 60 shaman. I have been since april 4th 2002 and have since gotten up to 21 AA points.<br />
<br />
I play from Europe (Denmark) so going on raids to mobs that have a chance to drop torpor is not something i have a lot of chances to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Coryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well, I reached a decision -- Kytra gets the spell.<br />
<br />
Been doing /who all 60 shaman on and off for two weeks, and she's on so much, it's scary.  And she spends a lot of time in seb, I assume doing RH/emp.<br />
<br />
Anyways, grats and GL to the rest of the fennin crew getting the spell.  ROA seems to have copies for sale fairly often from their VP excursions.<br />
<br />
Wish I had copies for all of you =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Thank you so much! I can't even put into words how happy I am. You are Uber in more ways than one. :)<br />
<br />
As for the extent of my gaming, this is the only entertainment I can afford. $12.95/month gets me a whole lot of time away from the TV. :p<br />
<br />
I will still be camping the Emp for awhile, until I get my other missing spells. So, in return for the kindness you have showed, if any rare shaman spells should drop, that I don't need, I will donate them to the posters on this board.<br />
<br />
Thanks again! :D</div></div><hr />
