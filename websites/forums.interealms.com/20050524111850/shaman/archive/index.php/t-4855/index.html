Congrats us!  We are now going to have the worst DD spells of any caster in game, and we're heading down the list quickly on our DoTs!  With a little less work, in a couple of expansions our class is going to really suck by comparison!  Gratz us!<br />

<br />
Face it.  VI has decided that we no longer need upgrades that will help us with soloing.  While it is true that a lvl60 sham with epic and Topor can kill many things that other classes cannot kill before that point we are like every other class.  <br />
<br />
We need an upgrade.  You know that PoP will propably up the MoBs in terms of HPs and the damage they can do.  If we dont get upgrades in PoP it may mean that we cannot solo there.  Not that that bothers me so much but other classes going to the old world and getting mad exp with thier new spells while I got the same stuff I had when Kunark came out is wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fine.  Dont give us new DD spells but give us some new DoTs at least.  Something, anything.<br />
<br />
I dont want another group charisma spell.  Or group Scale of wolf either.  Hell,  you might as well delete these spells entirely.  Never used em, never will.  <br />
<br />
And how many GD sight spells are we gonna get.  I mean damn.  Outside of Spirit Sight for barbs and Ultravision for everyone else (Acumen included) what more do you really need.  It is nice to bounch through a hotsile zone with the view jumping spell whatever it's called but thats it.  <br />

<br />
you claim we can't solo or do something other classes can do. remember that guy who &quot;soloed&quot; sebilite protector with aego and kei? well i'm betting the guys in the 'top 10 magelo' posts could do it purely solo these days. protector doubles for 450 and has 20k hp...who the heck can even get close to solo'ing that?<br />
<br />
oracles on this board claim to get about 4ish blue axp points per hour in fungus grove.....guess what?!?!?! this is in line with what other classes get!<br />
<br />
no use in groups? get a grip....shamans are so own in groups. i always feel extremely comfortable with a shaman in my group (on main), because i know the power of slow, extra heals, decent buffs and the very fast mana regen of an oracle.<br />
<br />
our dots are tied for first place with necromancers....pox is 2.1k dmg, bane is 1650, and scourge of nife is 1950. yeah they get resisted but hopefully it'll get fixed. they still work just fine on most xp mobs and even some boss mobs. nife is actually a seriously killer damage dealer, lasting only 42 seconds + casting time.<br />
<br />
you complain about no upgrades since kunark....well check this out, the classes that have been laying pretty low since kunark are excactly the ones that are balanced. i play a rogue and we haven't gotten much since kunark either, but you don't hear us asking for much on the safehouse. the problem is that EVERYBODY (except a few classes) want a bone, a small upgrade, a reasonable upgrade, a dd upgrade, a dot upgrade, an overall damage upgrade, etc.<br />
<br />
this is the wrong attitude. verant has given shamans huge upgrades through axp abilities, there is no need for a new ice nuke. yeah it &quot;would be nice&quot;, but is it needed to risk putting other classes out of balance? every time something changes, even on that cursed test server, all classes complain. they compare it to their own spells and say - ****, we need that too - and then start with their doomsday speech about how we're all going down the drain.<br />
<br />
WRONG ATTITUDE. you need to settle with what you got because you are balanced pretty well already. i'd be fine with verant fixing a few things like new axp abilities (needed for all classes btw), fixing bugs and generally dustings existing things off. maybe a few extra spells to help evening out the gap between 59 and 60, stuff like that. but a new nuke....who cares. JBB is so imbalanced already and makes nukes totally obsolete.<br />

at least someone else has a clue.  if you think the shaman class is getting so shafted go play something else.  if you want to nuke play a wizard.  i mean i never mem nukes.  not soloing, grouping, raiding whatever.  if i really feel like doing some direct damage i right click my JBB (ohh yeah mana free damage why use mana to nuke anyways) or melee. <br />
<br />
its just kinda silly how people what Everything.  we are still a super powerfull class.  i really dont think giving an echanter a new way to get aggro (since thats all there nukes do) is really out balancing.  and till i see a cleric doing real damage with this new &quot;super&quot; buff, which is nto even going live yet, i wont believe it.<br />
<br />
i ask again, if you think the shaman class is getting so shafted go play an echanter and nuke for 775 or a cleric and do some &quot;uber&quot; melee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Shaman are pretty balanced. Can solo, group and raid and contribute in various ways. Have one awesome ability (slow) even if it's not unique.<br />
<br />
On the downside:<br />
<br />
The class seems stagnant. Other classes are changing and shaman are not moving. <br />
<br />
Some stacking issues. Shaman number &gt; 2 on a raid doesn't look too enticing. Luckily we get a lesser version of a druid upgrade to help us along.<br />
<br />
Way too many stat buffs, way too little effect. Especially since the ultimate buff is a proc on a weapon most uber-melee will try to own. Having things like group Cha buff is just embarassing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think some were trying to have a little fun with this thread.   The last few, gotten a wee too serious, so I guess I will too.<br />
<br />
I just refuse to believe our class is so perfect and balanced, since the last couple expansions, and having all the other classes have so many issues .  Since when has Verant done something perfect for that long?  Never... until they change/patch things several times.  <br />
<br />
Maybe we are perfect.   But Kireiina hit on the head: &quot;The class seems stagnant.&quot;   Shamans needs &quot;pep.&quot;  A little boost in the adreniline department.   If you like how it is now, then more power to ya, but telling people &quot;Go play another class&quot; is a cop out, so screw you.</div></div><hr />

I love playing a shaman and I thought the Luclin spells were pretty decent. As far as groups are concerned, every time I join a group the members all gasp in awe at how efficient I make that group. Most common tells I get while in an xp group? &quot;OMG! I Lub Joo!&quot; &lt;-- Melee love me. :p<br />
<br />
By the way, 4 blues of axp an hour in FG? That's weak. My routine xp group consists of a 60 Monk, 58 Rogue and myself. We tear through shrooms so fast, I can get a full AA point in the amount of time it takes for KEI to wear off (the 3 hour variety).</div></div><hr />

All request I read will only hep one or 2 shaman with their particular play style to solo and will not help or improve the Shaman class.<br />
<br />
Since a few weeks, each time an other class get an upgrade, I read thread of shaman complaining about that upgrade beeing not fair or whining about their little trouble (/cry my dot was resisted, gimme MB !!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I disagree totally - what I see is a group of people who are fed up to the back teeth with everyone pointing out how perfectly balanced they are so they can **** coz they will never get anything new and fun. <br />
<br />
I love my shaman - there isnt a single other class I would rather play - does that mean I cannot ever ask for something new?  The game gets static, same **** different zone.  The only thing that makes it interesting is new abilities once in a while that allows you to change tactics and try things in different way.  We got shafted in Luclin - yeah, canni5 will be great when I finally get it, but what did we get that was new? Rabid Bear! - would be great if it wasnt 5 mins every 2 hours - that is just stupid.  Enchanters get Dire Charm, Wizzies get Manaburn, SK's and Pallies get Horsies, Clerics now get some pretty good melee upgrades (albeit on test), and we get a 5 min enhancement to melee every 2 hours.<br />
<br />
All I, and by the looks of it a few others, want is something new to play with.  If you dont want it then dont frikking buy it/train it/cast it/use it, but they have just as much right to ask for it as you do to say you dont want it.</div></div><hr />

Completely agree with you here...  We're a well balanced class that has lots of bells and whistles.  If we get anything to make us better, I think it should be possibly forage and maybe some kind of spook the undead ability (we DO talk to the dead after all, don't we?).  <br />

also: for those people who are simultaneously complaining that shaman don't stack on raids -and- that they don't want a 2/3k heal, WAKE THE @#$! UP. big instant heals are EXACTLY what we (and clerics!) need the other priest classes to have on raids. they make it so that more shaman at a time can be useful, AND so that you don't need 10-15% of a raid to consist entirely of clerics. and before you complain that 10 second cast time makes it worthless... go talk to a cleric and see how they work with a heal that takes 10 seconds to cast and only rarely heals more than 3k. you'll learn something.</div></div><hr />

Sorry dude, you just don't see the big picture.  Maybe it's the extra-low ogre intelligence.  Maybe you're in love with a JBB.  Maybe you spend all your time in FG.  But whatever it is . . . you're just dead  wrong!   <br />
<br />
In a full group i simply run out of ways to contribute unless I pull.  Dots have no time to work, if there's a cleric i have no healing to do.  If there's a chanter I have little to no CC to do.  So what am I left with?  Slows?  ****, you don't need a shaman for that, chanters do it just fine and speed up mana regen for the cleric in the process!  What do I do?  Buff?  You don't need shaman buffs to do exp groups!  <br />
The ONLY thing that would be any use in this situation is to contribute damage thru a nuke.  <br />
And here's the point where some idiot brings up Torrent as our &quot;contribution nuke.&quot;  Aside from the fact that it doesn't work well in over half the zones, it's easily resisted, and fizzles like a bitch, it's stupid hard to use properly!  <br />
<br />
I'm sorry but you oracles who don't think we need a damage upgrade need to pull your heads out of Jabober's ass and wake the **** up!  Shamans are the lowest DPS class in the game, even under clerics and enchanters who have an indisputable place in any group even were this not so.  <br />
<br />
This quote really cracks me up:<br />
 our dots are tied for first place with necromancers....pox is 2.1k dmg, bane is 1650 <br />
Necromancers LAUGH at our pathetic dots!!  Pox is GLACIAL in its DPS, taking 2 full minutes to do that damage! That's only 17.5 DPS folks, absolutely pathetic!  And that's if it's not resisted as happens much of the time.  <br />
<br />
Necromancers have mostly LURE dots that are almost never resisted!   They don't use the ones they share with shamans (Ebolt, plague) because they just plain suck compared to the array of death they have at their fingertips!  In addition to a kick ass pet, an array of nukes that are almost all better than our best one, and a lifetap series culminating in a hitpoint swing SIGNIFICANTLY better than we can even attempt to ice strike for!  <br />
<br />
The day you compare Shaman DPS to Necro DPS is the day you lose the argument and are sent to the woodshed for your whipping.  Maybe next time you'll do your homework!  <br />
<br />
Gawd if I hear one more shaman pride post in response to VALID ISSUES I'm gonna puke.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't mean landing a slow and sitting untill it's dead.. That means keeping the mob under the effect of MALO/MALOSINI/TUGUR or INCIDIOUS DECAY/PLAGUE OF INSECT all the time. And sometimes for 30+ minutes<br />
<br />
Debuffing adds :<br />
I m happy when there is 2 other shaman with me when the puller say &quot;inc 3&quot;. And yes, sometimes 3 is a good pull in ssra when you reach the 3rd floor.<br />
Also during those long fight, mob usually repop and need to be killed again. <br />
<br />
healing clerics :<br />
Torpor in a group of clerics eating rods owns. Yeah, it's not a glorious job, but I m freaking happy when cursed dies, my group of cleric is fm and we notice we forgot to get KEI before fight.<br />
<br />
doting mobs :<br />
long fight = dots<br />
do you job and add 30k dmg easy. It's not that bad<br />
<br />
RGC'ing people :<br />
With all those mob cursing on Luclin, RGC'ing MT or rampage ppl is not trivial !<br />
<br />
and if you don't like doing that, beg one of the chanter for haste and go melee a bit !<br />
<br />
Now, with the maybe futur 2k heal, if you are not busy doing all those things, you still can contribute to the victory by healing the MT.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what chanter you been grouping with, slow = aggro. Tash = aggro. What do you call an enchanter with double high aggro? DED!<br />
<br />
If the tank in the group goes afk, who is gonna tank the mob to finish it off? The Chanter? I don't think so. Best let the Cleric do it! LOL<br />
<br />
Shaman might not have that much melee output, but we can take a hit pretty well. What happens to a druid that tries to solo a summoning mob? *SQUISH* While Shaman are taking hits from even gods.<br />
<br />
Your argument, as well as mine is completely dependant on group make up. If you think you are useless in the group you are in, go find another. Me personally, I have allied myself with several people for grouping<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Chanter<br />
Shaman<br />
Druid/Wizzy<br />
Open<br />
<br />
You should hear them whine when I'm not around! They actually bitch me out and don't do harder things! The open slot is great for rotating guildies for items or XP too!<br />
<br />
If you have a problem with your shaman, chances are there is SOMETHING you can do about. We are them best all around character in the game. We might not XP the Fastest, but who cares! Ask a wizzy how much he enjoyed quadding raptors!</div></div><hr />

I find that in most exp groups BoN lasts just about perfect. Your groups are so badass you are killing exp mobs in less than 40 seconds? And dont give me the resists line, because unless you are hunting vamps all day long, or mobs in the deep, BoN seems to stick FINE on most exp mobs, especially after malo.</div></div><hr />

Wake up folks -- stop bragging about soloing gimpy old Western Wastes dragons that drop ****e loot. The reason Verant doesn't care that we solo these dragons is because the risk-reward is perfect: high risk, low exp, low-level loot.<br />
<br />
Our dots *are* pathetic. They're highly resisted (DD component sucks!). They might stack well in theory, but in practice stacking more than one poison = death by aggro (assuming you can even stick 'em consistently). <br />
<br />
Get over our old circus tricks... Soloing gimp &quot;dragons&quot; from old content isn't gonna carry us through the next expansion. All those little brag tricks do is decrease the likelihood that we'll stay on the power curve with each expansion's release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Just FYI - the damage update was minor, the important change to that Enchanter DD spell was the removal of the Stun component.<br />
<br />
Why is that important you ask?   Because Stun is mega aggro.  Even if the mob is immune to it, it will still turn on the enchanter and squish him.  So enchanters couldn't even NUKE during raids.  Now they can.   I think it's nice for them. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Kalamani:<br />
when you have as much experience grouping as I do, you might begin to see my point.  The group you listed is absolutely pathetic for DPS in comparison to the groups I usually make.  <br />
I am forced to keep from adding a chanter or a cleric and do both jobs MYSELF if I want to be a useful member of the group.  That way the warrior/sk/pally and three other &quot;dmg melees&quot; (rogue, ranger, monk) can deliver the asswhoopings.  Yes the exp is insane.  Yes mobs die in less than 15-20 seconds.  Yes dots are absolutely pointless.  Yes i am STILL bored cause frankly melees today dont need much healing and CC is laughably easy in most zones.  <br />
<br />
If I'm in a group with a chanter and a cleric and it's not some total asskicking zone like CT or Ssra, i'm a study in redundancy.  <br />
<br />
As to what chanters can accomplish . . . I think you've just been playing with some sucky ones.  Talented ones can CC an inc train of 7 to 8 mobs without breaking a sweat.  How?  It's simple.  AE stun, AE mez, single mezzes, slow them all, seive some mana, med, and maintain mezzes while the group rips thru each mob.  It's not hard at all.  If AE mez is resisted?  AE stun again stupid.  Then redo it.  The sheer VOLUME of gimpy enchanters out there is mind boggling, but at the top end (where I reside), there is plenty of talent among the chanters.  <br />
<br />
What was depressing to me was last night in CT . . . guildies doing a planks group.  Five men in group.  No shaman.  Ranger as MA, chanter, cleric, two rogues.  I show up LFG . . . they say thanks but we can manage fine without a shaman, don't wanna slow down exp.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>mogug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Both sides are correct!<br />
<br />
First I LOVE my Shaman!  Mogug ROCKS, I do things that constantly amaze my groups. I can go places and do things and expect to have a reasonable chance of getting out alive.<br />
<br />
Second WE NEED HELP!  I say it again I DON&quot;T WANT TO BE A 2ND RATE HEALER! a 1200 point heal is not something I want. Torpor is our big heal leave it alone.<br />
<br />
Drop rates for Torpor need to be looked at as well as a number of our 60 Spells. And before you say &quot;Well work your ass off&quot; I have been a shaman on Vallon since the day it opened and I have YET to see torpor drop or Pox or Avatar. I have helped kill MANY dragons and been in Sebelis for months so there is a issue with the drop rate.<br />
<br />
Resists .... Resists....Resists!   Our Dots are resisted WAY to much, and in a solo situation if it takes 3 tries to get BoN to land that usually means your heading for the zone. Losing 1300 mana to get a single dot landed is insane. using malo helps alot but then your still losing the mana for malo and still not getting a gauranteed stick of your dot.<br />
<br />
I play on Vallon ... and let me tell you there are a good number of people there with resists in the range that even with malosini BoN will not land nor will Pox after insidious decay.  Nothing is more frustrating then facing an opponent that is totally immune to your spells.  /gu Target MALOED!.... resist BoN repeat etc<br />
<br />
As far as DD goes, PFFT I don't care. give me a curse that drops a players attack 400+ and make it as hard to resist as a lifetap.   make it so I can have at least a CHANCE against a player with 200 resists. don't give me a 10 second 1200 point heal, odds are I am not channeling through 10 seconds of getting beat on anyway.  give us a 50% slow that works on EVERYTHING! make it 900 mana I don't care make it so I can't do anything else while I am chanting the slow on this mob I don't care but make it so we can slow every mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
PVP oriented view <br />
<br />
On a PvP server the most over powered thing in the game is the wizard manaburn. even if that wizard is OOM he has just removed ANY player from the fight.  We get NOTHING close to that ... NOTHING!!!!  DO I want something like that? NO! but what I do want is to know when I malo someone that I haven't wasted 350 mana so that they can continue to resist my spells with perfect immunity.  What good is an irresistable debuff when your main dmg dot is easily resisted with 80 PR? So player 1 gets 180 PR and you malo they still have 120 PR ... your dot is now worthless.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess my point is don't just give us another heal give us something that is very useful high end in both PvE and PvP situations! we are ok as we stand but we are quickly falling behind the curve in MANY situations and we need to be looked at to bring us back inline with the other classes.  <br />

Damn, what kind of callous guild is that?  My guild is pretty much &quot;anyone welcome&quot; unless it's a very rare circumstance where a particular class is needed.  <br />

You guys just don't know it yet.  PoP will suck for shaman.  Why?  Because VI feels the need to increase other classes but have to stop the upgrades somewhere.  You'll get a fancy new heal not because they wanted to give you an upgrade but because they wanted to take pressure off of Clerics.  After that you'll be the ones without the chair when the music stops.<br />
<br />
And if you think about it, why should they really?  Why should Verant upgrade the shaman class?  You've been well balanced since Kunark.  While the mobs and the game change, they will keep shaman the same.  <br />
<br />
While they make changes to other classes, they increase their power to the point that they no longer need shaman as Landragoran suggests.  The other classes don't need shaman now as it is.  Get a few AA exp points combined with high end weapons and BAM instant killing machine.  <br />
<br />
Clerics are the most two-boxed class currently, with shaman moving up fast.  Why?  Because shaman at the high end are dropping fast.  Look how long it took them to make any real changes to clerics. and then apply that time to any really changes that will be needed for shaman.<br />
<br />
And yes, I became so disgusted with the high end game and what I see as the future for shaman that, after 340 days played since May '99, I stop playing my shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Shamans may be fine now but what about in PoP?<br />
<br />
What happens when we get no upgrades save more cha buffs and a new vision spell? Or a lv 34 poison spell that does 500 damage. Or group north ;)<br />
<br />
Do I think the shaman class is a broken class? Nope.<br />
<br />
Do I think we are the closest to being a properly implemented class? You bet.<br />
<br />
But I want something new dammit.  I am not just paying for new content and new gear.  I want some new spells.  Just because VI can't balance the classes doesn't mean we should be hamstrung for it.  <br />
<br />
VI consistanly gives us 5hitty upgrades to spells we don't ever use and I'm supossed to be ok with that?<br />
<br />
It's not about the chanters getting a better DD.  I don't think that anyone here has a problem with that.  It's that we dont get improvements to our class that are relavent to the shaman class.<br />
<br />
I am a 53 sham and I don't want a 75%CH.  Give it to the druids for all I care but give us something on the offensive side of the game.  Something different.  Something better than what we have.  <br />

Ancient spells don't cut it.  If VI thinks we are the most balanced class they should come out and say it.  Otherwise it looks like they are dicking us around.</div></div><hr />

If you want track, forage, and the ability to port then you played the wrong class.<br />
<br />
If you want good DD spells, then you played the wrong class.<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to cast the rez line of spells, then you played the wrong class.<br />
<br />
If you want the best pet in the game, then you played the wrong class.<br />
<br />
If you think clerics will outmelee a shaman, EVER, you failed Math class.<br />
<br />
If you want your game altering abilities/spells to be as common as rusty weapons, you played the wrong class.<br />
<br />
If you want the ability to actually tank in exp grinding groups, reduce a mob's DPS, make them hit like girls with broken nails, give them Herpes, magically conjure acidic spittle inside their blood, freeze their skin, and have your rabid pet dog tear a chunk out of their arse, all while impaling them with a 10 foot spear, then you played the right class.<br />
<br />
I am NOW playing the right class.<br />
<br />
I do, however, agree with the resists dispute.  Spells, in general, are FAR too often resisted.  They cost mana, which is hard to get back.  How often does a melee's ATTACK get resisted?  How much mana does it cost?  Resists on spells are something that every class is having problems with though.</div></div><hr />

Yes, there may be a short fall in healing 55-60 without torpor.. Yes, there isn't much made of alchemy as there should be with relation to uses for quests.. Yes if slowed, a druid can tank alot of the mobs we can..<br />

Hell, look on other class boards.  The consensus seems to be we're one of, if not THE most overpowered class in the game.  Sure some of their assumptions are invalid, but not all.  <br />
<br />
We can do many things, and we can do them well.  <br />
<br />
I know people get a kick out of bellyaching and downplaying our power, but really, we're not so bad off.  <br />
<br />
We debuff well, we heal well, we buff well, we solo well, we regen hp/mana well.  Hell, I saw planks was brought up, well an enchanter, mage and I did that camp for the longest time, keeping up nicely with the spawns and having a blast.<br />
<br />
Folks I'm not saying we're overpowered (we're not) but I think it's just pure folly to say we're dead as a class and totally useless, etc.<br />
<br />
I realize these little problems are based off of fear of the new changes and worry, but please, calm yourselves.  The sky is not falling.  We could indeed use a little upgrade or two, but the hyperbolizing's making you sound like a bunch of druids and clerics.  =P</div></div><hr />

hmm... wouldn't another chanter or cleric, too?<br />
<br />
yes, other classes share all of our abilities... this is part of the exercise of proper group makeup, and means that everyone (except perhaps melees) is sometimes redundant in a group.<br />
<br />
we will never fit perfectly into every single group-of-5, adding significant power or speed. we are far from the only class with this problem. true, there are lots of classes that don't, too. would it be nice if every class had the potential to do great DPS when they weren't doing anything else? well, yeah. but several other classes don't and won't, and this is fine: it just means that sometimes we will have to solo instead of joining a group that already has our grouping duties covered. at least we CAN solo effectively, as we've been proving for years.</div></div><hr />

reapply bane - 425 (2600 mana so far)<br />

you haven't healed or had to reapply your regrowth because it went off half way through the fight or had to root an add and get it slowed as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Canabull, that's all fine and dandy if all you want to do is exp groups in seb.  At the high end, (Seru, Emp, VT)  none of that applies.<br />
<br />
That's one of the basic problems.  Once you get out of the exp grind, once your guild gets past the AoW range everything changes for a shaman.  Melee/Casters start getting even more DPS and the next thing you know, mobs die before your Slow or DoT's has a chance to really take effect.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons I started a shaman was because I COULD do damage, I could slow, I could heal, I could do it all.  Then, at a certain level the game changed but shaman have been left alone.<br />
<br />
When you get into the high end, groups can get exp faster WITHOUT a shaman.  And by the time you reach this level you're so fricken sick of doing exp that you want to get it done as fast as you can.  That's where the shaman get left behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Attrition may be boring, but the mob will die before you run out of hp/mana... assuming you have the hp/ac to take the hits.  <br />
<br />
AAxp speeding up torpor makes this even easier... that 6 second cast time originally can make things awful dicey.  <br />
<br />
Oh and I've noticed that my necro twink on test seems to have dots resisted less since they tweaked resistances... have any other test server people noticed this?  <br />

I think Necro's should have the worst (not sure if they do or not), with shamans right behind them at second worst. <br />
<br />
I'll agree with the argument that shaman dots are resisted way too much. Those spells are mana hogs and watching that much mana get pissed away for nothing time and again is very painful. I'd take the druid swarm dots over shaman dots any time, even though they are theoretically lower and slower damage. No DD component and hardly ever resisted? Wouldn't that be nice...<br />

Do we need our Dots resists looked at...  YES<br />

Do we REALLY need a better heal.. NO<br />

Does Topor/Malo/POX need to drop more. Hell yes.<br />
<br />
In short the shaman class is fine BUT we do need some tweaking.  Not much mind you but we do.<br />
<br />
As for PvP,  listen to what  Mogug tells you. Malo lands(-67 in pvp fyi) , Dots are still resisted(can land epic but 9 secs will get you killed quick ). I can malo up a storm but as it stands now with the advent of AA points, Melee will stomp you in the ground. Manaburn and Lifeburn hurt but thats fine I can deal. <br />
<br />
  The 66% cap on spells needs to be removed.  BoN does   1087 in 42secs in pvp. If it lands (big if, trust me) that melee with primals will hit you for 4+k in that that time.  You now have taking 4k+ hps in damage(dead shaman)  and they have taking 1kish with 3k more hps to lose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is where I think VI will focus it's improvements on Shamans.<br />
<br />
Ask yourself which of the following 4 encounter types Shaman are strong/weak at:<br />
<br />
1) soloability <br />
2) exp group (2-6 players, trivial mobs) <br />
3) non-exp group (2-6 players, non-trivial mobs) <br />
4) raids (multiple groups)</div></div><hr />

<br />
All I want is:<br />
- Lesser resist rates on DoTs.<br />
- 750ish DD possibly getting back Nife's Lament.<br />
- Some big heal (maybe coming) or NT clone.<br />
<br />
DD will make Critical Nuke AA skill worth. (good for raid stacking)<br />
Bigger heals will make healin AA worth. (good for raid stacking)<br />
DoT resist rates are just retarded design flaw.<br />
<br />
Those small changes will smooth out the corners of a nearly balanced class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Except for low level spells shaman have recieved no new nukes since kunark, no new debuffs since kunark (poi being the only exception and that's not any upgrade to our duty, only a way around of making mobs totaly unslowable  vs having to let us 75% slow them with tugurs) no new heals since kunark, no new dots since kunark, no new pet since kunark.<br />
<br />
So the original king of dots, one of the original pet classes, and the original healer classes has recieved no upgrades in any of it's core abilities since kunark.  That's all fine and dandy, we were fora while quite well balanced.  <br />
<br />
Yes we could and can solo BIG mobs, but we could never solo well for xp, basicly we had bragging rights but never have had very functional solo for progression purpose.  With Luclin and the advent of AA skills essentially any class in the game can solo for XP.  Now as it is most melee can solo as well if not in most cases better for xp than a shaman can solo for xp, yes we will always be able to kill mobs for bragging rights, but it's increasingly harder and harder just to get a duo going for xp.<br />
<br />
I love my shaman dearly but i find it very hard not to be frustrated when a good hardcore shaman is becomming increasingly unnecesary for anything.  Heck one single Bracer of the Hive from VT shrinks an entire raid better than SEVERAL shaman, AND that bracer can shrink anyone in an outdoor zone as well as indoors.  Primal weapons nullified the need for what was one of our only unique spell lines when the endgame of velious was reached.  Shaman, the first to get regeneration spells of any sort were left in the dust when druids got group regens more than a full expansion before us.<br />
<br />
Heals over time were introduced with Torpor and CE, torpor paying for it's mana efficiency with a melee slow and snare, making it group only, compared with CE which for 100 mana more was without penalties.  Yet now paladins heal as effectivly as shaman, heals over time that are less efficient yet can be used in any group and group heals that are extreamly effective when used properly.<br />
<br />
Shaman were slightly overpowerd in kunark just right in velious but now in luclin we are rapidly loosing steam.  The problem is people just dont see it yet.  What people see are thigns such as a shaman soloing lodizal (a very very long and tedious event which 95% of the time results in shaman death as oposed to turtle death) or a shaman soloing a dragon in WW (with no ae and pathetic melee) and say &quot;they must be wicked powerful&quot;  A cleric + any melee can duo lodizal just as easier and with less risk than a shaman can duo him, but it does not make people think that there is balance there.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately i must be in agreement with Forty in that i'm dreading what becomes of the shaman class with PoP.  All other classes have recieved major upgrades of some sort since kunark, wether it be new spell lines, new things to help assist in their roll etc, shaman has recieved none.  Where i dont necessarily think that shaman needed anything much new, it would certainly have been nice to at least have been recognized with &quot;something&quot;<br />
<br />
Our ancient spells are quite a joke if someone brings up the fact that &quot;we get a new ancient dot so we have got an upgrade since kunark&quot;  Comming from a guild that has defeated the Ring of Vulak i can certainly tell you that it's not fun, its' long, tedious and everyone walks away with a headache afterwords.  Getting peopel there to do it even when NTOV is clear is like pulling teeth.  Untill VI recognizes that the Ring is NOT worth it and places ancient spells as rare drops on OTHER ubermobs elsewhere in the game, ancient spells should not even be considered part of anyone's spell repitoir.<br />
<br />
For all that i've said i dont want to give a false impression, i love my shaman dearly and wouldnt give it up for the world.  But for the love of god, someone at VI , in the words of Dr Evil &quot;throw me a frikin' bone here&quot;  we DO irreguardless of the perception need &quot;something&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">When you are in a group with five melees, essentially being an &quot;AE melee group&quot; killing multiple mobs at the same time so fast where a slow isn't needed, or JBB doesn't even finish casting the first shot, something's not right.   <br />
<br />
Sure, it's steady xp, and can be a hard thing to complain about.   It also breaks the stereotyping of group make-ups.   But, when you can't even do half the things you normally do in a group (like slows, other debuffs, some damage), and only have to toss out heals here and there, because the paladin is doing group heals from time to time, it is frustrating.  And to top it off, you only need to buff group stam/focus every 63-100 minutes.<br />
<br />
In the melee dept., armor and weaponry has significantly evolved over time, to a level out-of-control, in my opinion.  <br />
      <br />
These days, it seems &quot;lazy xp&quot; is the way to go.  Whether it be AE melee or caster groups.    AE casting in FG is such an epidemic on my server, a sign should be posted saying: &quot;AE only: 1 group at a time only, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm just fortuanate to be able to group with guildfolk most of the time when needed.<br />
<br />
I pay money for expansions not just for new mobs and zones, but for CONTENT for MY class.   Which is a shaman.   I don't care if we are already &quot;balanced&quot; (in whoever's opinion that would be).<br />
I expect new, innovative spells for shamans, not like most of the crap in SoL.   It's time they put us in a more specific role, rather than a generalist one.</div></div><hr />

Even Sks will be able to haste their pets better than we do  ... our stat buffs decrease in worth with every piece droppable uber gear being on the market channel, our DD sucks, our Dots are nice, but hardly from being exceptional (stacking, resists), on raids we have one shm making mgb, the rest can be happy if he is asked for RH or Acumen. Our pet and its pathing sucks so bad, that i can only laught. <br />
<br />
I dont give a dead fly about, what other ppl can solo or not. Shaman are getting the shaft, nothing new since kunark expansion and i see other classes pimped, that werent unbalanced after kunark at all. <br />
<br />
All u folks that are happy to solo sebilis protector go on and be happy with it. I want something new and intersting what gets me on the lvl of attention to VI again, doesnt have to be UBER, but some increases would be nice and not unbalanced at all. <br />
<br />
If things were not OK as they were before velious and sol came out, how do u explain the unbalanced adds VI made. Pet classes got significantly better, enchanter got assloads of increases (lesser mana, no resists, DC ... even NEW stuff like a pet that make a mage look like a tard), wizards with unresistable spells (giant, dragonbane, MB ... ) ... <br />
Do u really think that those classes were unbalanced before luclin THAT much. <br />
<br />
The fact that one class can solo stuff and the others dont doesnt mean ****, because shaman have the luck to have slow as defensive and some aggressive things as well ... including the mana machine, that we need on raid, cause we get our ass handed as soon as he touches the floor when we sit. <br />
<br />
STOP making a class better than it is, just because they can solo stuff .... wage the things ppl got during the last time and see the fact that shaman have not seen anything lately .... its time for a bone, i dont want to res, no manaburn and no dualwield doubleattack .... just a bone to the, that VI at least knows that there are shaman out there who feel bad about things coming up lately. <br />
<br />
I see all those wizards quadding gorangas in ME, mobs that still beat the **** out of me and i need long time to kill those because they got so much HPs, wizards QUAD those all day without any problem, Necros solo them without even getting into sweat, enchanter clean KAEL with a lvl 39 cleric aside, druids rock up and down in Chardok ... and those are the classes u have to compare to us .... all got major increases and still get, time for a bone i d say .. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Good point about the maxed out stats with armour. However as most melee will end up with a primal weapon for proccing Primal Avatar (+100 to stats and atk).. buffing only serves to increase hit points and to provide enough dex to proc... or if the mobs start casting debuffs.<br />
<br />
However it is something that takes ages to aquire. Primal weapons are now easy to aquire, the limiting factor is the race for ST key dropping mobs on Tunare.<br />
<br />
Stat buffs have always been a dead end because there is no relative sliding scale for them.. once you hit 255 that's it.. so in the high end game - currently it's only HP that you'll never hit a cap (AC and mana are rumoured to have a soft cap - but that's no big deal as our AC doesn't stack with aego).<br />
<br />
Bards get a song that with go beyond the haste cap but I bet that still is not over 100% (I assume this is a 8bit too).<br />

Might be time to work on the monk, retire the shaman for a while.  Monks at least are relevant in end game play.  Plus it's nice to not have to screw with mana and those highly resistable DoTs.   That resist rate really does need to be looked at, it's friggen insane :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">I was in a group of friends. We were in south wing.<br />
<br />
Level 60 Cleric<br />
Level 57 Wizard<br />
Level 58 Thief (With Ragebringer)<br />
Level 59 Chanter (My Second computer)<br />
Level 60 shaman (My main box)<br />
<br />
Not the best combo but serviceable. I had out the poisen wind censer. And would pull 2-6 mobs at once depending on Mob density and how much damage I took on initial slows. (please note I was planning on pulling that many. I would pull one out with slow then pull next out while ignoring first. Normally while the thief was killing the previous pull.<br />
<br />
Once I got back to the group I would Stun lock with the chanter. (ToT when up) Then Back up and toss a torrent or two (Got Spell casting fury 2 last night, And had one 900 900 540 540 wave) while the Wizard either Rains or PBAE's  depending on mobs and whim.<br />
<br />
We mowed through the place.  Could pull all the named upon pop. Including the boss of the wing. (Bastard droppped a kylong bracer)<br />
<br />
As an experiment. I did pull 15 at once. We wiped 10 of them before My enchanter ran out of mana and we wiped out. (Should have Evvaced but we don;t run away well)<br />
<br />
I logged on my Thief (Level 60 retired Human thief) And Got the bodies back to the entrance. Ressed up and headed back in knowing 15 was too many. (Damn wizard said well pull ten, we can do ten)<br />
<br />
I decided to do another experiment since my thief was camped out behind the door to north wing. (Perfectly safe area)<br />
<br />
I logged Snoww and got on the thief and wanted to see how That make up would do. Chanter can slow Right?<br />
<br />
Well it out and out sucked. For the thief to do damage means She has to be there Swinging. So stuff dies faster, but pulls are slower. And to be honest stuff was not dying much faster. We were taking much more damage because while the chanter is trying to slow, she cannot stun lock. Also a chanters Slow flat out sucks. 5% less. Twice as long to cast, and If you slow at the beginning of a fight it will wear off at the end when you pull like we do. (Que up 5-6 to be mauled or AE em down)<br />
<br />
The cleric spent a crap load more mana keeping the thieves up Because no regen. Focus wore off a bit after that and We were all down 400+ hp (Big deal many will say it is an xp group) Pull 6 in south wing and you will change that tune if you are in gear like ours. <br />
<br />
The point of this is By using some off the wall tactics, and some of the shamans odder skills The first group had a much better (and safer, and Funner) gain of xp than when I swapped the shaman for a thief.<br />
<br />
Now of course people will disagree with me. Of course people will scream that my experiances mean nothing. But I tell you this. If you are not having fun with your shaman. If you are not a valued part of ANY group make up. If you think your shaman is useless, then guess what according to me you are completely and utterly full of ****. It is YOUR fault that your game is not as much fun. It is your bitching, moaning, and whinging that are ruining your grouping experiances.<br />
<br />
So suck it up and Make a thief/monk twink _1000202894. I am sure you will all be happier. <br />
<br />
Yes we need some upgrades. Part of the progression of the game is to gain more power. But to say that the class amny of you have been playing for 3+ years sucks is just foolish. Power waxes, and wanes. In some cases we are more powerfula nd fun than ever before. In other cases the game has passed us by. I hope Verant can indentify each of those and make them balance somehow. If they can't then I will deal with it as I can.<br />

This could be almost as fun as the bardic group shadow step.<br />
<br />
Seriously though - Verant hasn't been really innovative and useful with a spell line since clarity.  Everything is just a rehash of other spells or a pathetic waste of a spell slot.  Sometimes they have multiple spells rolled into one, but very little is NEW.  How about a casting time or mana or fizzle rate increase debuff for knocking off CH/AE now and then?<br />
<br />
What exists and is useful is being slowly removed as mobs become more uber - no stun, no slow, no mez, no snare, no root, higher resists (no damage).  It's a lot like the game is going back to level 1 where you didn't have much that was useful except melee.<br />

I don't have Torpor, Malo, Pox or a JBB. All the camping in the world has netted me Squat. Maybe I am unlucky or maybe its just a cruel joke, but many hours have been wasted in pursuit of these little gems.<br />
<br />
Telling me that I should get the AA because it will make me usefull again is Bogus. I work hard to level up. I work hard to get the levels to reduce resists and be able to hunt the big game. Everyone says Levels make the difference. Having to split my Exp between AA and Exp is hard since playtime is limited.<br />
<br />
Every expansion that comes out gives great upgrades to everyone. We got Group Charisma. Our DoTs are falling lower and lower on the list as other classes are getting upgraded. Our DDs just plain suck. Cann 5 sounds like a great thing to have but It will be a long time before I ever see it.<br />
<br />
Rabid bear.....Ohhhh, /drool. I can't wait to sink hard earned AA points into rabid bear so I can Melee 2 minutes every 2 hours and actually hit something. <br />
<br />
Even Beastlords get a Clarity type spell (Albiet a high level is required). My Pet only buff? So glad I got that, Now I can make my pet 20% faster and increase AC by, what, 20? I would rather spend more mana and buff properly.<br />
<br />
We are told that Buffs and Debuffs are out Bread and Butter. Yet Enchanters get the Best Haste and only a Slow 5% less. Druids get better Resist spells (IMO considered a buff), but hey, we get 17 different vision spells.<br />
<br />
All in all, each class is getting stronger and stronger while the Shaman class has remained the same. This does not mean we are Balanced, it means no one has done anything to enhance us. Each time another class gets something added to make them stronger, we appear weaker.<br />
<br />
All we are asking for is something to keep us in line with the other classes.<br />

I don't know that we need any more DD's, but I'm not sold on how great shaman damage is either.  Any class can KS me practically -- my spells all take a long time to cast and a long time to work.  If I get interrupted, forget it.  Clearing many mobs -- for instance the mobs around the great saprophyte in Echo Caverns -- takes a while, for instance, during which most anyone can come in and KS me.  If I don't kill adds and surrounding mobs, my spells get interrupted, my dog gets killed, I don't get a second chance at slowing main mobs if slow fails the first time due to interrupts, etc.  My monk has had no problem outdamaging my 60 torpor/canni 5 shaman since his mid 50's, and he doesn't even have an epic, tranq staff, whistling fists, cloak of flames, etc.  My shaman can do great things, but so can other classes, too.<br />

I guess I wouldn't mind if I wasn't the easiest guy to KS on the planet.<br />
<br />
It is certainly true that some other classes have gotten drastic upgrades, too -- dire charm and the druid's improved charm abilities are really pretty damn nice.  Pally Slay Undead 3 is unbelievably great.  Now THAT's upgrading.  I really can't agree that we got anything remotely comparable.  <br />
<br />
So, do we need anything comparable?  Did some other classes need something super duper good compared to what we got?  We don't need anything THAT good, really.  And some other classes had been falling pretty far behind.  Not that many people really liked playing wizards until recently, for instance, because even if they did like playing them, they got more groups playing some other classes.  Now wizards are incredibly uber, and guilds really need them.  Verant may have made them TOO good at this point, but that's another topic.<br />
<br />
As to our AA abilities, aside from canni 5 and MGB(which is extremely situational), I don't find them compelling at all.  I mean I REALLY find them a total bore and completely trivial.  Now that we have new ones that let us add hitpoints, I perked up a bit on them.  But frankly, I really don't care if I ever get any of the other ones at all.  <br />
<br />
Compare that to my monk -- he's got tons of good ones.  Or to my friend's pally who is going for SU3.  Or to manaburn, area taunt, etc.  <br />
<br />
That doesn't mean we NEED something as overpoweringly great as a lot of that stuff is, but it's kind of silly for people to think shamans are out of line when some of them feel a bit bored with what's been happening for shamans in the last couple expansions.  We finally got our ridiculous group buffs to become somewhat more useable group buffs that don't really do anything different?  Good Golly, that's great.  Hmm...primal cudgel makes primal essence easier to cast?  Swell...avatar overwrites it anyway.  Many more mobs around that can't be slowed?  Er...swell.<br />
<br />
I can't say I'm optimistic about anything that's been happening for shamans at all, and I can't say I expect us to get much better.  I do think we're frozen in time at this point -- except for the new heal spell.  It's not overwhelming or anything, but at least it gives us more to do that's stackable and useful.  We are a healing class, after all.  I spend most raids bored off my ass because there's little around that drops for my class, and when it's something with Flowing Thought on it, I feel guilty looting it instead of a class that needs mana more than shamans do(all casters pretty much), so I have little to look forward to as far as loot goes.  And quite often either my slows or DOTS don't work, or both, or it makes little sense to be dotting, and torpor only works inside groups so my heals are pretty damn trivial....  It's great to be part of everybody else being able to do more stuff, but I don't feel like if there's more than a shaman or two already there, that there's a crying need for more.  Compare that to my monk or any melee -- the more the merrier!  And action every kill, and many more items to look forward to and hope for(Luclin is full of monk stuff).  <br />
<br />
I guess the new heals will help quite a bit.  That looks like the only thing Verant is interested in giving us -- I think they panicked once they saw shamans soloing dragons and determined never to give us significant damage upgrades again.   Well, with the way they're drastically upgrading many of the other classes, I guess a new heal was the only way for them to go.  It's not too bad, all in all.<br />
<br />
Can't exactly say it's compelling or exciting...won't make any difference grouping or soloing either, once you have torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Landragoran -- my monk is more attractive to me than my shaman now, too, unfortunately.  He's incredibly easy to play, which lessens the stress and the &quot;work&quot; aspect of playing enormously, the game is stuffed crazy full of loot for him, I like his AA potential far more than my shaman's, he stacks infinitely better in groups or on raids, and for him &quot;action&quot; is more about running around and killing stuff than clicking canni 4 and torpor until the opportunity comes around to click canni 5.<br />
<br />
I miss the shaman when I play only the monk, and vice-versa, which is actually kind of cool.<br />
<br />
But I think EQ is essentially set up around melee classes.  They get most of the loot and most of the action, and stack extremely well.  I see a lot fewer of them quit than I see shamans quit.  Shamans quit like mad.  <br />
<br />
I think the only way I can still play really is by playing both my characters at once.  It adds a heck of a lot more variety, both in what I do and where I can do it.  You do that too, right, so you have that kind of option as well.  I have a number of friends who do that as well and I think it's what has kept us in the game.<br />
<br />
I'm decently respected as a shaman on my server, and have very good reason to believe I could get in any guild I wanted to(am in one of the top 2 right now), but I still find Cazic Thule hard to get into.  I actually get more invites to CT from people outside my guild than inside it.  There are definitely still plenty of people who would rather have clerics than shamans around, and plenty of them with cleric bots (and more coming every day)because they're so much easier to bot than we are, so healer spots are often sealed up tight.<br />
<br />
So screw it, I make my own groups with friends, some of whom play multiple characters at a time too.<br />
<br />
I think that's where the fun and value of the game for me lies at this point.  I've considered retiring my shaman many times, and he's more or less effectively retired at the moment.  He comes to life when friends are around, though, and when there's something new to explore with his monk bot friend.</div></div><hr />
