<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a general alert that there are bodies, at least on Innoruuk that were rezzable before the server patch that are no longer rezzable after the patch.<br />
<br />
Here's how it worked.<br />
<br />
If you had a rezzable body that you didn't get a chance to rez, prior to the patch, and you logged, you may not be able to rez that body after the patch even though you may not have been logged in.<br />
<br />
I played my necro last night and near 9pm PDT he died.  I then used my 60 ranger to pull the body to the zone in to await a more opportune time for a rez.<br />
<br />
Two hours later I logged in and /con the body and it indicated the body had 2 hours and 34 minutes left on the rez timer.  It was around 11pm so I decided to camp out.<br />
<br />
The next morning I entered the game and noted that my body was no longer in the same place I had left it the night before.<br />
<br />
I then /petitioned and subsequently was disconnected.  A couple hours later I logged back on and /petitioned again. Shortly after this I was disconnected again.<br />
<br />
I then waited till about 7:10pm this evening and /petitioned again.  This time the guide came on and told me the body was in such and such a place.  That place turned out to be the spot where the body had died the night before.  Very strange as I had the body pulled to zone in, had logged, had come back 2 hours later, and /con'd it again after not finding a cleric to rez it.<br />
<br />
This miffed me so I ran down invis with my ranger and pulled the body to zone in again.  When I first grabbed it pull it to the zone in this evening I noted the rez timer had expired.  I also noted the amount of time the body had before it decayed.<br />
<br />
That timer said 6 days 6 hours and 41 minutes, approximately.<br />
<br />
I then decided to con one body near this body and noted it had the exact same corpse decay timer.  At this time I logged and switched to my 38 monk because I knew he'd be where there were bodies that were there before the patch.  I ran and /con'd the other bodies in the area and found 2 more with approximately the same corpse decay timer.<br />
<br />
After this I asked aldrin (someone in the zone near me) go and /con the same bodies and he noted they had the same exact corpse decay timer.  I then went into Karnors and con'd several other bodies and they had the same corpse decay timer.<br />
<br />
I then /petitioned again asking that the gm come on and address this.  I gave the guide that answered several names he could check.<br />
<br />
Basically what I think happened is that when the brought the servers down any body that was rezzable became unrezzable due to them doing something to the corpse rez and corpse decay timers.  The corpse decay timer was also about 18 hours into the decay.<br />
<br />
With the servers down and the time the char died it would be impossible for the body to have aged 18 hours at 7pm tonight.  It has to mean that they had the corpse rez timers running while they were doing the patch.  If the corpse rez timer had expired then the corpse decay timer had to be going too.<br />
<br />
The first guide I spoke with was condescending and unhelpful.  He didn't investigate, didn't ask questions and made me feel like I was trying to take advantage of the system when I reported my body missing.<br />
<br />
I have played EQ for 3 years and I have 8 chars that are 52+ and 3 of those are level 60.  I would hardly care about a rez but I don't like being treated in the manner he did and I dislike seriously his unwillingness to actually investigate.<br />
<br />
If anyone thinks they have a body that should have been rezzable prior to the patch and found out after the patch that it was not rezzable /petition in game and get your GMs to address the issue.  If we all get them to take note of this then they'll have to at least admit something is wrong and fix it or in the least grant you your full exp back.<br />
<br />
FYI, during the times I logged I /camp desk.  This takes me all the way to the desktop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shoopow</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too had a problem. I logged with a corpse in Dawnshroud that i dragged to NL zoneline.  Next day i logged back on and it was not there.  Finally had a bard locate it and it was at the ME zone??  Go figure. To top it off it showed me laying there with brown hair and i have blonde hair hehe.  At least it was still rezzable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamas</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It happens. Used to be that anytime a zone crashed or the server came down, unrezzed bodies lost all exp. They could be rezzed, but no exp recovered. <br />
<br />
As for the hair color thing, I would assume that is the default color for that face, and it reverts to that, same as how corpses revert to looking stripped after a server shutdown.<br />
<br />
Shortly before patch shutdown I died fighting Gorenaire at the DL tunnel mouth. When I logged back in the body was buried in the hillside a short distance away. After dragging my body back to the tunnel, and getting a rez, I reappeared not over my body (I was looting when rez was cast), but on the hillside where the body had been before being moved. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borzak</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">usually after a patch you corpse appears naked and you wind up where you died, regarless of where you or someone else drug you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe that reminded me.. one time when Ashezen died and we got back to his body, all his armor (was mostly chain at the time) looked like plate on his corpse. It was pretty nifty. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elessar Elfstone</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has this happened to anyone else or just you? Cause if it's just your case, there's no need to say its a game-wide problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elrynia</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the heads up on this.  I have had some corpse issues as well, glad to see I am not the only one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've had 2 guildmates that have had their character files corrupted in such a way that they're completely unable to logon.  It always happens right after a death, and then every time they try to log the char back on, they get disconnected immediately.  <br />
<br />
The GM finially had to make a complete copy of the character in another slot on the person's character select screen.  For a while when the GM was still working on it, the guy had 2 epic cleric's both completely geared the same way.  One of them had completely reset factions though.  They finially got it straighted out and he got his factions back, but did loose some xps from the death and whatnot.  <br />
<br />
Another guy in the guild that it's happened to is still having the GMs work on it.  It's been quite timeconsuming for them to fix....<br />
<br />
Not sure what the deal is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elrynia</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same exact thing here.  We have a guildie who can no longer log his main on.  We are still waiting for a resolution as well.  We have heard rumor that some in similar situations were told to delete the character, which I am hoping is an urban legend.<br />
<br />
Don't anyone delete their character though!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not irrelevant.  Several ppl saw this and I was out a rez due to it.<br />
<br />
Not all corpses are supposed to go to the same corpse decay timer.  It would mean some would last longer and others would decay sooner and that is relevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After days of petitions I managed to get in touch with Devyon the GM on Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
His response is that while off-line the corpse rez timer still tics and thus my corpse expired.  *cough* *cough*.  A GM that doesn't have a clue.<br />
<br />
Essentially, at this point I felt that he was pushing off my request and didn't investigate and wouldn't investigate.  I felt his customer service was sorely lacking.  I asked to take the issue up with someone at a higher level and he then:<br />
<br />
He the proceeded to remove my necro's surname.  I've had run ins with him in the past where there are players in the game that were pointed out to him to be obvious violations of the naming policy, such as the name Tolstoy and he justified leaving them in the game because of the time they'd been in the game and the fact that they were not &quot;major&quot; infractions.  Taking it up the chain of command in Verant yieled the same response.  That name was allowed because it was not a &quot;major&quot; violation of the policy.<br />
<br />
He didn't comment on all the corpses having the same decay timer.<br />
<br />
He wouldn't investigate.  He gave me incorrect inforamtion.  When called on it, not in a disrespectful way, he retributed by removing my last name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a follow-up on the closure of this issue.<br />
<br />
I wrote an e-mail to J. Smedley and also sent an e-mail to the haha &quot;server gm&quot;.<br />
<br />
At about 11:30pm tonight I checked my e-mail and found that the lead gm had responded.  He appologized and he returned my experience and my last name of my necro.<br />
<br />
All I can say is wow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doucebrise</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the same problem, on karana. I died from a LD just before the patch... I don't know why, because I was about full HP and the rock was just feared and in its last bubble, but this is not the problem....<br />
<br />
When I log back a few hours after the patch, I found my corpse naked. A cleric was here too, he rezz me (2h20 on rez timer) and .. no xp back :( . Maybe a corpse bug, so I log and I come back, re-rezzed, no xp. I petition, the only response given by a guide : &quot;sometime experience won't come back&quot;.</div></div><hr />
