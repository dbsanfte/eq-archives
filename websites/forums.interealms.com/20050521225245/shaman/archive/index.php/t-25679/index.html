<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Swiftkique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well my guild just recently got Sol Ro Tower flaged, i know its not a very good place, but i was wondering if anyone knew how to kill xuzl from what i havce read there is a special way you can do it and 1 group it so was wondering if anyone knew that info and  any other info on sol ro would be much apreciated we are small guild of like 20 but have a 11k unbuffed war that can tank for us so dont have to worry about tank. thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pull out his 1.2k hitting guards solo with  a FD puller and kill ASAP, run in, whack him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i know its not a very good place . . . <br />
Why would you think Sol Ro isnt a very good place? I love that zone. I think its a total blast, and I still go there quite a bit, even though I dont need any loot. I think its one of the better zones in PoP, honestly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good to hear that Sol Ro is someone's favorite zone.  I was all excited and got quite a few guildies to get the Sol Ro shortcut access, but have yet to get anyone to regularly explore SolRo, including myself.<br />
<br />
Could you elaborate a little on some of the more worthy places to explore in Sol Ro?  Places that could be done solo with a 65 shammy (5.6k HP), or duo with a 10k buffed 67 Warrior (near 300 AAs), or with a guildie group of 65s.... Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Soloing:  The main issue with Sol Ro that makes soloing difficult, Psi, is the fact that Sol Ro mobs had the biggest agro radius I've ever seen.  In most cases, you can't even get into casting range before they will agro on you.  And mob placement means that from the zone in, it's virtually impossible to get single pulls outside of the roamer.  To get anywhere in Sol ro, you have to be able to handle 2 mobs at a time, which are slowable but unrootable.<br />
<br />
Soloing in Sol Ro is hard, but not impossible...but it takes gear.<br />
<br />
Duoing:  see above.<br />
<br />
Grouping:  A group of 65's would best be served on the upper levels, where the ornate drops more frequently.  As far as I know, there are no named spawns anywhere in Sol Ro outside of the 5 minis, the nameds along the paths to those minis put there as part of the effort to reach the mini, and Solusek Ro himself.  Another option is to click up to one of the mini areas and work your way towards a mini.  This requires a very good puller, because in many instances you can bring a huge train.  Ornate drop rates are even higher, and some nameds on the way to a mini can drop loot (but not all), but be mindful that all nameds in the mini areas would be quite a handful for a group of 65s.  They're pretty tough.<br />
<br />
Above all, just have fun exploring.  Sol Ro Tower is one of my favorite zones, probably because it IS quite challenging.  The unique aspects of the mobs make this one of the more interesting places to xp, and you will certainly be kept on your toes.  ;<br />
<br />
And as a reminder, remember to tell your groupmates, THERE IS NO ZONE OUT IN SOL RO.  Gate or port are your only options, unless you kill Sol Ro himself and use his zone-out to zone into PoFire. ;)<br />
<br />
Making sure all your melees have a gate potion as an emergency backup would be wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Main issue of killing Xuzl is not Xuzl himself but his 4 swords which guard him. They hit for over 1k, very fast until slowed. We used to FD pull them, which took some time even for skilled FD puller because of their resist rate (for snare pull) and because of the layout of the room.<br />
Once you killed the sword Xuzl himself is a joke.<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Last 2 times I've gone slumming and killed xuzl, we usually had 8 folks.<br />
<br />
Make your tank target one of the first 2 swords, and have either a rooting class, or a mezzer root/mez park the add sword, while everyone kills first sword. After first one dies, grab second fromt he rooter/chanter and kill  it.<br />
Second set of swords in the back, although it's not practical, it works, just run past Xuzl and grab the 2 backs words. Xuzl is leashed to his platform, so dotn worry about him following his pets back to you guys. same procedure for killing second set of swords as first set.<br />
<br />
Then fight xuzl on his platform. hits about 1k i think, no ae's, just text spams with &quot;xuzl's pet has been slain by xuzl's pet&quot; alot. Tons of HP, but he's fun to kill. Good luck. doesn't rampage afaik, just rage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Swiftkique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">THANK YOU to all of you we just took out xuzl and got ornate bp mold and the lance there was 14 of us ad no deaths some minor setbacks on the way i was playing my bard and got pulling down to were untill i got to the room i had no more than 1 inc at a time and chaining so that i hadone there ready to kill right when they finished. the setback was that my group got evaced when we got to were we were about to engage on the first try was a accident by one of the druids but wasnt a big deal gave me a chance to work on pulling again but we evaced everyone and restarted raid and got to him had to  do some messing around cause were not sure if we could pull him or not but figured out he was tethered but no deaths on the whole raid that werent caused by going the wrong way when trying to MU lol but was a fun raid and thanks for all the info ( and is the sig to the req now) thnxagain we going to go try te bird guy next week so if you guys have any info on him that would help alot thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sol Ro tower have named,too.    Named mobs random spawn on the area between fire pot(after click up) and mini room.     <br />
<br />
Glaremos at Arlyxir 's area is also &quot;fun&quot; mob to kill, required good crowd control or enough ppls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mob agro range in SRT is 200.  Exactly spell range. So if you have an extended range item, you can pull with a spell.  If you don't have a focus, then you can't.  Happy hunting :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yup yup <br />
<br />
Druzzil's Distance is teh win here.  Get yourself a Earring of Coalesced Mana (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71178) or the like and away you go...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Swiftkique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can anyoone poset some tactics and number needed to take out some of the tower minis this would help alot we got like 20 people got a 14k buffed tank and like 3 clerics and 3 dru then more dps stuff are there any other raids that drop reasonably good stuff that are either slightly harder or easier than Xuzl or just any fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Really, at this point, the Sol Ro Minis dont require TOO much strat. Its all about pulling though, to get there. The roads to the minis are long, and filled with many nasty little pulls. A REALLY good puller or 2 is much more important than a 14K MA. <br />
<br />
But you dont need much in the way of specific tactics. Just go for it, and have a blast. 20 people shouldnt be a problem, I have done most of them with 1 group, and this was before OoW. For strat, heres what you do:<br />
<br />
Pull, kill, pull, kill, rez the bard, pull, kill, pull, kill. <br />
<br />
There ya go!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thats how high end guilds who encounter raid mobs first play. Everyone else bottom feeds from their strats because <br />
<br />
a) Its easier <br />
b) It involves less wiping<br />
<br />
It would be ignorant to pass up that information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Learning encounters and beating them without borrowed strats is how good players play EQ.Heh, isn't it pretty silly to propose that good players never learn anything from anyone else's experience?   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Suppose someone wants to be good at chess, football, guitar, or the stock market.  Would you tell them, &quot;Rely completely on your own experience, never learn anything from anyone else.  That's what people who are good at it do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suppose someone wants to be good at military arts, a profession, or human relationships.  Would you tell them, &quot;Rely completely on your own experience, never learn anything from anyone else.  That's what people who are good at it do.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't intend this as a major criticism, but if you feel that it's best to develop one's own strategies and not borrow from others, why do you read this message board?  The purpose of most areas the board (with the exception of The Grey) is to discuss strategies and ideas about how to play the Shaman class.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Experience is the best teacher, but a smart student will consider all advice from all teachers. advice that is both good and bad.<br />
<br />
the experience part comes in when you &quot;go through the motions&quot; you never know exactly how to do something until you are doing it yourself. you can understand how to do something, and then you can know how to do something, sometimes these are the same, sometimes they are very different.<br />
<br />
when reading strategies for mobs you won't see for another year or more, you'll get advice, both good and bad, and you'll try them, coupled with a few of your own ideas, to get what works for you.<br />
<br />
there is no fallacy in learning from another person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have more respect for folks who do their research than I have for folks who don't.  <br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with preparation and homework, which are often pretty good indicators of a smart player.  <br />
<br />
But I understand that for some not knowing anything about an encounter makes it more &quot;pure&quot; and more fun for them.  Fair enough, but I wouldn't read more into it than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Swiftkique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Aye we got a few good pullers I am one on my bard i guess i ok my guild likes when i do it so i guess im good. but i just figure if i get strat. from you guys we could do things better or if you not into giving strat. could you just tell me what a good raid mob is that you think we could take and ill try it. and thank you to all of you for all the help you have given me i would never have known how to get to or kill Xuzl and hope you guys can help with any raids our guild does in the future. thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Competetive chess players learn all the methods that came before as a matter of opposition research, in order to counter them.  Please observe that the &quot;informational&quot; posts above weren't presenting data on the encounters (maps, spawns, AEs, max melee hits, etc).  What people were posting are called spoilers.  Applying canned strategies in order to beat an encounter that you never have to learn doesn't advance anything, it just collects loot that someone else earned.<br />
<br />
Perhaps my post should have been more openly directed at those people instead of the thread in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Theres still a HUGE difference between reading some &quot;strat&quot; in a spoiler and actually executing it with a raid, though. Take the pre-EP RZ event. How many guilds actually beat this the first few times they tried it, even with a TON of information on strategies out there. <br />
<br />
While I am semi-against move-by-move spoilers, I fully support strategic insight on any encounter or quest. For one thing, it saves a LOT of people a LOT of time, and potential discouragment. <br />
<br />
All in all, I think there are very few multi-group encounters that DON'T require a good deal &quot;hands on&quot; practice, no matter how many spoilers there are.</div></div><hr />
