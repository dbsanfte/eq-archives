<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you really want such 1-dimensional goals?  I could probably hit your HP/AC goals for level 60 by swapping out most of my focus / regen items.  But I think I'd be a much less efficient shaman if I swapped out my fungi/ods/amulet of insight/jbb for stuff with more AC/HP on it.<br />
<br />
Also, for the most part I've focussed my gear on AC/HP where I don't have focus/regen gear, but I'm still well above 2500 mana.  That goal may be a tad low.  I don't think 2500 HP unbuffed is all that easy to achieve.<br />
<br />
Anyone who's done any kind of raiding at all should be able to put together equal or better gear than I have, since I bought just about everything I have in the bazaar or got it doing xp-grinds or on very small pre-60th raids.<br />
<br />
If you really wanted a set of minimums, I'd have gone with:<br />
<br />
AC 950<br />
HP 2000<br />
MANA 2500<br />
<br />
but with the caveat that if you're at the minimums on one or two of them you really should be well above on others or be able to explain what other stuff you have which compensates.  My personal stats are:<br />
<br />
AC 954<br />
HP 1893<br />
MANA 3025<br />
<br />
Well below the HP goal and well above the mana goal, but I'm giving up a lot of stats in order to have:<br />
<br />
15 points of regen, mana pres 3, extended enhancement, and clicky damage.  Trade out fungi tunic for tae ew, ODS for matchless dragon shoulders or IGS, and amulet of insight for tracking wolf collar or something and my efficiency probably drops by 10-20%, but I can now come much closer to meeting the AC/HP goals.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, just my 2 cp.</div></div><hr />
