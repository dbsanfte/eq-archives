<br />
Thursday Jun 23rd Update<br />
<br />
- New Augmentation Window is in. For those with custom UI's, you will need to update your EQ_Container.xml file in order to use the augment sealer.<br />
<br />
- You no longer need a specific slot solvent to delete an augment. Any of the 3 will work and you delete your augment by selecting which augment to delete from the list. In the future there will only be one solvent to delete augments.<br />
<br />
- Augments also no show in the item display window which solvent is needed to remove them without destroying them. You will be able to remove your augment safely using the new window. These items should become available shortly. You will be able to remove your augment safely using the new window.<br />
<br />
- NPC debuff slots have been increased to 50. This mainly effects raid NPC's.<br />
<br />
- Players will now &quot;Pre-pay&quot; for benefits. When benefits are activated, the player will immediately be charged for those benefits from their Favor pool. After that, the player will be charged every 10 minutes for the next 10 minutes of benefit. If benefits are deactivated before the timer is depleted, no refund is given for the time remaining.<br />
<br />
- Players now have the ability to activate/deactivate the tribute benefits they've selected (as a whole) whenever they like using a button on the Tribute Benefit Window. However, every time the player activates his benefits, he will be &quot;Pre-pay&quot; (see above). The ability to change selected benefits (downgrade) away from the Tribute Master has been removed.<br />
<br />
- When visiting a Tribute Master, the player's benefits will deactivate. Players may re-organize their selected Benefit loadout, but will not be able to &quot;preview&quot; the benefits (seeing the effect on their character when the benefit is selected). Benefit descriptions should give the player a good indication of what the Benefit will do when activated.<br />
<br />
- The EQ Label that shows the Tribute Benefit Timer will now show green when benefits are active, grey when they are not.<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
 Monday Jun 28th Update<br />
<br />
- Zoning pets are in. Persistent pet data includes: Items, Spell Effects, hit points, mana, name, height, and mana cost to summon them. All PC summoned pets should zone with you in all instances except for when you die. Pets will also follow the same rules as no rent items if you log with a pet.<br />
<br />
- Tainted Axe of Hatred will now summon stacks of 20.<br />
<br />
- Various AA's fixed. Please continue to bug any an all related bugs.<br />

Advanced Suspended Minion AA - allows you to zone (repeatedly) with a suspended pet (requires Suspended Minion 2).<br />

- might even make Pet Affinity worthwhile.<br />

Not really out of the blue. Mages (and I assume Necros, but I don't read their boards) have been asking for zoning pets for years. Halfheartedly for the first few years, then very vociferously right around the release of Luclin, then it mostly died off in favor off other more pressing issues.</div></div><hr />

e.g. Fighting near a zone out. My pet is fighting a mob. He is almost dead, so I decide to zone. Will he zone with me so I can heal him and zone back to finish the mob? Or will this be like summon companion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I believe the code for pet zoning had already existed in some degree, as beastlord pets zoned with their owner when Luclin was first released. I believe the outrage from the other pet classes had their warder turned into a pet similar in design to other classes' pets (i.e. no longer zoning, summoned via spell, not ability). <br />
<br />
Back then, I think that if you zone while pet is in combat, you'd lose the pet. I think it had to be free from agro to zone with you. Also, the pet lasted for only 10 hours or so before it went away on its own. If these are inaccurate, I'm sorry. I'm trying to remember playing my beastlord to level 25 way back then. :)<br />
<br />
I can understand the pet dying if you are zoning and it is agroed. But if it is held in a combat situation, maybe not. I do hope, however, that the pet timer is done away with if they are reviving this old code.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I think BST pets were considered buffs when they were introduced.  This caused problems in their code since they could be dispelled and other problems because they were considered both buffs and pets and so they were turned into true pets and bst lost the ability to zone with them.  The bst pet buff line that raised the base level of the warder was then changed to just summon a warder of the appropriate level for the spell instead of being a buff on a buff :-) The proc buffs were kept ;-)    I can imagine the developers pulling their hair out when bugs hit trying to debug a buff with multiple buffs on it :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Why is this tribute change considered a nerf?  It looks great to me.  Maybe I don't understand it.<br />
<br />
As I understand it:<br />
<br />
Previously, you paid for tribute benefits in 10 minute blocs.  The only choice you had away from the tribute master was to reduce your benefit or turn it off.  Once it was reduced/turned off you could never turn it back on until going back to the TM.<br />
<br />
Now, you can suspend tribute benefits and restart them at the same level without going back to the TM.  Sure, you pay for the rest of the current tribute bloc without receiving any benefits, but if you're taking an extended break or running to PoK to sell stuff or whatever, you can turn off the benefits and save the tribute points.  OK, we lose the ability to reduce the benefit... but who does that anyway?  Either you can afford it or not, and if you can afford it, you want the max benefit.<br />
<br />
Someone correct me if the way I understand tribute is wrong.  I will be MUCH more likely to take advantage of tribute using this system... heck, you can get the extra mana regen one and turn it on ONLY when you really need the mana regen boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Cuetzpali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Looks good and I don't mean to complain, but I'm thinking we're going to have even more LAG in zones like PoK or the bazaar, when there are a couple hundred pets running amok looking for their lost owners!  LOL, there isn't a /hidepets command that I'm not aware of is there?<br />
Sounds nice though, will be nice to be able to summon and buff up pets in the downtime before a raid/group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The Tribute thing is the way it has to be.<br />
<br />
I found it pretty obvious that if they didn't do it this way abuse would be immediate and widespread.<br />
<br />
Every 9 minutes, you turn your Tribute off so you don't get charged.  Then turn it right back on.  Viola - Tribute you never have to pay for.<br />
<br />
Pre-pay Tribute is the only way they could possibly have made this work so we could turn it off and on as we wished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Glad to see the pet thing. Any idea if this will work or will it only apply to suspended pets?<br />
I like the tribute changes too.  I blew through 13,000 tribute points while PLing my monk because I forgot to turn it off or just didn't feel like going back to halas.  It'll be nice to do it from whereever I am, like just before a raid or adventure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From a Dev stand point you need to learn programming limitations. The pet out currently will zone on test not the AA suspended pet. The cache from what the character is hold in AAs is not carried over when you zone.<br />
<br />
I asked (a while back) for an advanced Suspended Minion AA to let our spell-based pet zone when suspended. <br />
<br />
We now have (on test) the ability for our spell-based pet to zone without requiring an AA for it, and not requiring suspension.<br />
<br />
Even better, wouldn't you agree - even if it requires un-suspending to zone with a pet?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I am totally baffled why someone would think that zoning with a suspended pet would be subject to any programming limitations.<br />
<br />
Whoever this is, you do realize that they have to remember what armor you're wearing, don't you?  When I am close to encumbered, I get a &quot;you are no longer encumbered&quot; message from zoning... this is because the +STR on my armor is not taken into account until after the system gives it to me.  And let's not mention the faction bugs they used to have when they'd let NPCs con you before applying your faction modifiers when zoning.<br />
<br />
Carrying the suspended pet along is just one more thing to carry with you... a complex thing, perhaps, but certainly not more complex than a bunch of bags full of items, a full set of armor, and 15 buffs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the pet-zoning thing is a welcome change.  I hope it makes it to the live servers without becoming a 30-point AA ability.</div></div><hr />

However there was/is some sort of bug if your pet falls below a certain amount of HP. It had to do with buffs and items, and you would lose the ability to control him.

<br />
Since I had time to kill, I went to the mage boards to see what they had to say. <br />
<br />
Try suspending MS pet then unsuspending it, it'll change model, I assume this will work in almost an identical way.<br />
<br />
http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=15299&amp;start=0<br />
<br />
That is the closest I could come to any answer about that. Most of their discussion seemed to focus on the pet suspension/zoning issue (tried to skim it for what I sought, so didn't pay it close attention to this other issue). Anyway, they are up to 8 pages of discussion on it and I didn't have THAT much time!<br />
<br />
And as for the &quot;companion&quot; vs &quot;pet&quot; issue, that could also exclude beastlords too, as they have warders, right? Personally, I'm guessing that they'll lump them all together as &quot;pets&quot;. But, knowing SoE, I wouldn't bet my house on it, as anything could be possible.</div></div><hr />

The limitation in the code would be whose fault exactly?<br />
<br />
As for pets zoning I am really not sure what their problem was as a pet is likely currently a non-saved part of the character file. If it isn't they have some more serious design issues ;)<br />
<br />
Making a pet suspended or not with buff or not zone is simply changing the structure of the player file to save pet data. Moving it from non-saved to a saved position.<br />
<br />
The only problem with that is if the playerfiles are binary rather than ascii files you may need to run a converter on the pfiles (which could be fairly time consuming).<br />
<br />
But if the pet is saved as part of your character then zoning becomes a non-issue because the same as you will zone with your gear, aa, horse, even your surname, etc your pet would be a part of you.<br />
<br />
The simple fact that horses zone and are already admitted to being part of the character model (and that horse can be seperated from the player via bugs and even killed) means that the basics of what I described have been there a very long time.<br />
<br />
Not a real tough job to add a few more memory slots to hold spell numbers and durations, item numbers a worn position, and a check for suspended off, 1, or 2.</div></div><hr />

Just to clarify a bit . . . some of EQ's codebase is 8 years old.  Do you really think that they could have possibly forseen everything 8 years ago?<br />
<br />
EQ's designers were good . . . not god.  (Ok, some of them thought they were god, only to be proven wrong)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In city of heroes, you make an extra copy of your character on the test server to test things out (as in, you transfer the character yourself, as opposed to wait for a guide/gm to do it). It always struck me as funny when the EQ designers ask you to test something (like they did with the recent regen changes). People go and test with their level 7, and its all &quot;hey, big thumbs up&quot;. Then they wonder why its crap on live servers for level 65's.</div></div><hr />

I believe they just just patched limiting spells by pet level.<br />

EQ's designers were good . . . not god. (Ok, some of them thought they were god, only to be proven wrong)Already starting the propoganda/defense routine for SOE?  Come on.  The code for zoning pets, suspended minion and such has all been worked on very recently (zoning BST pets anybody) in relative terms.<br />
<br />
Strictly speaking, as a programmer, it's all there in the data and code.  What they choose to do with it is entirely up to them and their skills.</div></div><hr />

Well Kilher, I don't know Sudedor and have never played with him.  However, I must add that your post is uncalled for and makes you sound like a real dweeb (nicest word I could come up with that would get by the filter).  Please, let's try not to flame each other just for the hell of it.<br />

Do pets have buff slot limitations?  If so, I don't believe you can click buffs off pets. so what happens when your pet gets buffed with a ton of useless stuff and you didnt' haste him yet... hehe.</div></div><hr />

Actually the basis of what EQ is was written in 1990 by Diku.<br />
More specifically Circle which was written a few years later.<br />
You must not remember the law suits aimed at EQ regarding this.<br />
While Sony won the fight the fact remains the bare basics came from these codebases written for text based MUDs.<br />
<br />
And yes as a programmer the code has to be flexible and when its not you write more code ;)<br />
<br />
The only excuse for poor programming is poor programmers.<br />
<br />
Seriously if they didnt allow for expansion they have absolutely nobody to blame but themselves.<br />
<br />
I wonder how many other Diku derivitative coders are about to understand just how trivial some of these changes should be if the code wasnt done poorly and if it was done poorly shoot you FIX it.<br />
<br />
Not going to cut them any slack especially since as you pointed out they have have had 8 years to fix it ;)</div></div><hr />

NO!!  <br />
<br />
From the DIKU site, and you can check there : Sworn statement (http://www.dikumud.com/Everquest/Sworn.aspx) <br />
<br />
<br />
SWORN STATEMENT <br />
As programmer on the server side of EverQuest on we hereby declare, that: <br />
<br />
EverQuest was not based on DIKU MUD Source code, nor is there any DIKU MUD Source Code in EverQuest. <br />
EverQuest is not a derivative of DIKU MUD. <br />
The EverQuest Source Code was built from the ground up. <br />
EverQuest has not, in whole or in part infringed on any copyrighted DIKU MUD material. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I hereby declare that the above is the full truth, <br />
<br />
Mr. Brad McQuaid <br />
Mr. Steve Clover <br />
Mr. Roger Uzun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">The truth is not always what the law (government) says it is.....<br />
<br />
I can re-write enough of the Diku code that it isnt Diku anymore and not bound by their legal agreement that doesn't mean that my code and code ideas are not founded on such.<br />
<br />
Diku was written in C and EQ is a version of C++ (if I remember correctly)  so yes it would have to be completely rewritten and therfore legal.<br />
<br />
Legally yes they are different I stated as much.<br />
They use the same parts, the same technology, but are legally different.<br />
<br />
I could convert Diku to say php and it would not legally be bound by the Diku license because I had to completely re-write it.<br />
<br />
And if you read that it is a statement made Everquest to Diku for legal purposes.<br />
<br />
And whether it is based or not the fact remains to change the code it is still a simple switch from an unsaved to saved memory position in the playerfile. That isnt exactly all that difficult.<br />
<br />
I will leave you with this.... Several members of the Everquest staff said they had experience with online RPGs. How do you suppose they got that experience when all that really existed was text based MUDs?<br />
They played and programmed on such ;)<br />
http://www.kanga.nu/archives/MUD-Dev-L/2002Q4/msg00710.php<br />
I can't confirm the verasity of that link though ;)<br />

<br />
Funny but Brad mentions MUDs VERY frequently and including in old newsgroups was a MUD programmer ;)<br />
<br />
This is a very common thing in muds. Let me describe a &quot;Lady Vox&quot; I put in a mud once: it was a vampire that resided in a closed room with a locked door. The instant you walked in, it slammed and locked the door behind you, blinded you, summoned helpers to take you out, and attacked with a full arsenal of magic spells.  <br />
<br />
Argue all you want the only possible way that would be even somewhat difficult is poor programming design in which they have had 8 years to remedy. No sorry I wont have any mercy for them.</div></div><hr />
