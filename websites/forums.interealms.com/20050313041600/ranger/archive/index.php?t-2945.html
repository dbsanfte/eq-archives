So , i've decided to step up and become the new MT for next vindi raid ... i should get about 4.7khp with this gear and raidbuffed. any suggestions to add onto my gear would be helpful, this is the best stuff I can come up with on short notice I beleive .. some things like eyepatch will take a few days to finish, also a pair of BoB's will make my guild groan so that'll take a bit of time as well. Suggestions rock btw =)<br />

also .. fungi or Goldleaf bp ... which should I use? =D</div></div><hr />

Defiance, LSoEE, or some such to swap out in main<br />
<br />
To answer the other question, for MA I would think GL bp would be better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elured</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should think the vastly higher AC of the Golden Leaf would outweigh the regen of the fungi.  While having both fungi and Regrowth on would be impressive (31 standing regen, hoowah), that would work out to only about 620 to 930 hit points over the course of a normal Vindi fight (assuming you can actually survive tanking him with a fungi).<br />
<br />
With a fungi as opposed to GLBP, I'm sure there will be a quite noticeable increase in Vindi's overall damage to you.  I'd go with the Golden Leaf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Acturian</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont need ac, bagged VS claw earring (actually on my monk :D )<br />
<br />
ac is for chumps .. im happy with what i've got atm<br />
<br />
i'll prolly get my Natural Durability to 10% as well as Combat Stability and Combat Agility to 10% as well .... I like to be a tank more then I like to dish damage. I cant get AM until level59 and I just cant make that push =P AA is alot more fun cause it rises hella fast ... like playing my monk O_o <br />
<br />
and yeah I can survive vindi, i survived velk for about 40secs with 2 ch's and i was in ATK mode , no real AC buffs ... so we'll see I guess. With luck i'll have ND CS or CA 1 by then . we'll see, we'll see.<br />

As most warriors dont tank Vindi well, and as a 60 ranger posted here a while back how he &quot;survived&quot; stepping in to help tank Vindi for about 40 seconds (with a guild that if I recall does it a lot) before dying, to hear a 57 ranger say he is going to tank Vindi, and then discuss whether or not a fungi would be better for the regen....im sorry....but that gives me the giggles too.<br />

<br />
Well he did say he's trying to help his clerics do a heal rotation properly, he said he'll get 4700hp buffed...well it's doable and it would show his clerics how to properly maintain a heal rotation the best imo.<br />
<br />
Only problem I see is keeping aggro... and cleric reliability but I suppose that's the whole point of the ranger tanking isn't it? :p</div></div><hr />

i think if i lay into him with weeds/flame lick and earthcall going off like a madman aggro shouldn't be too tough. I know most vindi tanks are approaching 6k hp or past it, but when they get CH'd they have 1/2 life or more left. that's 3k hp sitting there. only 1.3 or so in my situation, but it's still quite a bit ... i'll be the first tank up , and our mt will be ready to take over if(when) i die. if i make it to 1/2 way on him before a cleric goes oopsies i'll be happy ... i'm also considering dying to have them do a tank swap for heals. stuff like this is hard to learn unless you're actually doing it ... and short of not giving the MT any buffs (he'd then have less hp then me buffed) , how else can I show em sometimes they dont have a 2000hp buffer. <br />
if/when i get the hp's up to where i need them i'll post back here. wth luck i will hit 5000hp buffed before i try this, at worst it'll be 4400 or so. expect a log when I return to eq =)</div></div><hr />

you forget 1 aspect...<br />
your clerics are gonna burn their mana very very fast to keep you alive, so if your raid doesnt have some nifty damage power its gonna be nasty.</div></div><hr />

Spend some time with no one else attacking (30-60 secs) to get aggro. You do not have the mitigation or avoidance of a level 60 ranger, much less that of a level 60 warrior. Do not expect to live through this and you won't be disappointed. While I agree rangers can tank in most situations, high end Kael mobs are not the place, IMHO.</div></div><hr />

you have very nice hp/sta profile for your lvl, but it will be very hard...<br />
main factor is the cleric's lag for CH chain and the mages' chain modrodding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
37 mana regen standing. w/ specializion this will be cake with a 4 cleric CH chain ... (i'd do three but i dont trust them very much yet ! =P they cant keep a 6.4k tank alive they cant keep me alive if it's 3.)<br />
<br />
we have MR2 ... but exactly ( 0 ) necros atm, lol, we need some methinks. we have our melee's hold modrods and put them on the ground for the clerics, as well as a ground supply. also have about 4 pallies for LH rotation.<br />
<br />
I know I wontbe able to do it successfully, and Gimpicator really isnt a &quot;highend&quot; kael mob .. if i said i was gonna tank doze i would help someone would tell me i have balls, but am good as dead. (i did it for .. oh, 5 seconds at 55 ....... son of a B*tch killed me right when he died with a riposite (some fool rooted him , he kept warping around and was kicking our asses)<br />
<br />
and i asked about the fungi because having the regen is similar to adding 600or so HP onto your character ...... <br />
<br />
I need to change the belt. Warders, any suggestions for outside of ToV items ? like 15ish AC w/ hp maybe... chain softcap being at 1100 or so , i dont really need to worry about AC. i'll be doing ND CS or CA soon ....<br />
<br />
And thanks Feeldary. I concentrate on STA/HP on all my gear in the first place, then go for resists, then dex, then purdy other things like ac.<br />
<br />
and as to 1000pt Riposites ... he dont hit THAT hard :D <br />
<br />
I understand the risks, but honestly, who cares really? w/ specializion, Modrod2, bardsong, 4 clerics, warriors taking rampage damage and enough druids/shamans/paladins to scratch more then your back with, I should be able to do this quite easily.<br />
<br />
add FoS + CoE+ SoN+ Grp. Aego + C3 + MOTP on my stats, as well as some symbols from shammies (we've got a few shammies with all their spells cept the ancient, so we are good)<br />
<br />
like I said, expect a log soon ...... i'll prolly sell my monk's rbg and get this stuff<br />
<br />
and to nifty damage power ... how's .. 5 lvl60 epic rogues .. me .. couple high 50's wizzies, 4 or 5 highend tanks , a few more rogues ... a ranger or two ... yeah we get melee covered =P <br />
<br />

(and I hate to say it, but we NEED NECROS AND MAGES =P .. never thought you'd see that huh =P )</div></div><hr />

I have no doubt whatsoever that many 60 rangers in major guilds could tank Vindi if need be. The fact that they don't is simply due to it not being the most efficient mechanism for dealing with him. But doable? Absolutely.<br />
<br />
As to whether Acturian can pull this off at 57, we'll see. But I wouldn't count a ranger out quite yet.<br />

Where would you draw the line for AC gear here? Cash really isnt an issue as I have my monk toy to sell , and i may sell my tolans bp soon so i donno =P may keep going in seb until i get a sibby cloak ... <br />

<br />
Definitely the GL over the Fungal.  15 points of regen a tick will be completely negated by the CH chain, whereas the HP of the GL will gain in effectiveness with CH.<br />
<br />
You shouldn't have any problems tanking him and living once your clerics settle down and get over the fact they are healing a ranger.... would probably start off the fight with Weaponshield to make sure they have their timing down, debuffs land, etc.  That gives them 20 seconds of adjustments before the heals need to start counting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was the warrior L60, if so was he under defensive? That alone makes a big difference in how much dmg taken per second.<br />
<br />
We try to space out our CHs so it does land at 50% while under defensive; after defensive runs out, they'll get CHed at 30-40% HP remaining, just enough margin for errors due to lag/mistakes. One thing you should also consider, switching MT is a pain and when you do die, there's no guarantee that you won't lose valuable melee (rangers/monks/rogues) while the clerics find the next MT to heal.<br />
<br />
Good luck, I think you'll have a much easier time had you try this at L60.</div></div><hr />

sure it would be alot easier by 60, but then the clerics would have found another way to go about it.<br />
<br />
it's also a long ass haul to 60 and i wont see it for *months* ...<br />

lag got most of the people w/o aggro managment killed on a velk raid .. that was fun<br />

&lt;---- only melee left standing except for a feigned monk =P<br />

now he *hurts* when you dont have many buffs up. yeow =P Vindi didnt hit that hard , i remember geting aggro in between a tankswap. either was dumb luck, or ..<br />

Tanking Vindi as a ranger and not even 60th level is right up there with wizard tanking.  Sure, with enough clerics throwing CH's fast enough it will work.  Will it work BETTER than most alternatives?  No.<br />
<br />
Get any 60th hybrid to tank if you're having trouble with aggro control.  Doing it at 57th you'll just set your guild up for dissapointment, and maybe they won't let hybrids tank in the future, which does a disservice to all hybrids.<br />

<br />
Exactly how will this teach your clerics to get a CH rotation down?  Failure, means wasted time, wasted time is bad, so they have insentive?  I'd rather just have your 60th warrior step up and tank Vindi.  Sure it may get sloppy, but at least his HPs, AC, and Defensive Skill will allow for slop.<br />
<br />
At 57 you won't be able to &quot;taunt&quot; vindi.  I don't even know if 60th Rangers can taunt 61+ mobs.  I think only Plate tanks can use their taunt skill for such mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Its a gamble, but he pulls it off, it could act as a huge confidence builder for his core clerics and their ability to hold the rotation in line, which helps keep them from panicking if something out of the ordinary comes up.  After all, they were able to keep a 57th ranger alive as MT again Vindi...<br />
<br />
It doesn't take much sometimes to lower morale, making something you should be able to do that much harder, even if the reason for the past failures was unrelated.  Sounds like a good effort to swing it the other direction.</div></div><hr />

I mean hell we did doze with 3 clerics , only 1 epic'd and only 2 were 60. that was months ago. we also had a little over 40 people there .. this is exactly what I am trying to do, if they see &quot;hey, they killed vindi? I missed it?&quot; they are gonna want to be there for our next attempt. I am willing to get my butt handed to me on a silver platter to help us raise our abilites. we can do it, and if I die, we've got enough warriors to tank =P <br />
