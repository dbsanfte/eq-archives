<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've died because I canni5'd myself literally to death (Jinheim has been slain by Jinheim!) twice.  Once I was drunk, once I was lagged.<br />
<br />
I have died because I picked a bad moment to canni5 (just as an add is coming, just as root breaks, etc...) quite a few times, but since I've started getting my HP past the 3k unbuffed range it doesn't happen as often as it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Braag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Many moons ago, I canni'd down really far and then took agro from a passing train (in Dawnshroud if I remember correctly).  I made it to the zone with something like 50 hp to spare.  I don't canni down that far any more. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I killed myself once due to the HP updating bug (my screen said I had 2400hp, I pressed the button and died). <br />
<br />
I also indirectly killed myself once by misclicking once during a trial of execution and suddenly losing 2k hp while I only had about 2400hp.  Needless to say, the mobs suddenly found me very interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I picked No on the poll, I have never directly canni'd myself to death. I do remember once, long time ago in Sol B, with my cleric and warrior friends. We were in the bar, I canni'd to get mana, my cleric friend was supposed to heal me, he was too slow. We got a pop, it jumped me and killed me. I my have had less than 10hp, he was going to heal me fully, then the pop ruined that plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">First time I ever hit the Cann V hotkey...I had no idea it did 1924 damage...lesson learned...dropped like a bag full of Stonegrabbers...   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As sad as this is...I killed myself with cannI.  Way back in the day I was hunting in LoIO and my group got trained at the sarnak fort.  I was frantically trying to keep the melee alive and I got whacked a couple times and managed to channel thru it and kill myself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not directly but have used Can 5 then gotten low health agro and beat to death fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tilanali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sigh, yeah, sittin there with canni 1, learing the canni dance. I was paying so much attention to my mana bar and gettin' into the rhythm of stand-canni-sit-tic-stand-canni-sit-tic-stand.... next thing I know, my best friend in guild is asking why I have a corpse in the Nexxus...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lethis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Luckily for me, I have always been cautious with canni. Too much playing of a necro will do that to you.  :)</div></div><hr />

*Always* check HP before I cast Canni.  Heck, I still always check that cursor is in the text window before I type 'a'  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">More than I care to admit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">cannied myself to death for the first time the other night in PoN! was like ***? he he laughed so hard. cant wait for canni v death!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You aint a shaman if you aint cannied to death. It's the Crucible Rite of Passage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Cant say I have had that displeasure yet. mind you I dont have Cann V yet either.<br />
<br />
I have died due to low aggro from canning too far a few times.  The most recent one was in NToV after wiping to an unexpected few adds while fighting eashen of the sky.  When I got ressed I canned myself to get manna for a regen, unfortunatly a few drake hatchlings spawned and guess who they ran right after....<br />
<br />
I fully expect to die a few times once i get Cann V</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lol, I avoided my first can5icide last night by ducking out of it. Hit can5 at 70%, then realizing that fighting LtK stripped my buff window.  Interesting to find out that ducking out does keep you disc active.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">all you people that said no .. are total liars!!<br />
<br />
i hope you can respect yourself in the morning</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I was going off on my guild the other day, while we were preping for a raid that wasn't moving as fast as I wanted it to.  I was doing quite well spitting venom and getting my point accross, when all of a sudden &quot;colal was slain by colal&quot;  It kinda took the teeth out of my bite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">haha my guild friend cani5'd naked thinking he looted his corpse before $  it was late tho  (i died once to c5 due to the hp update bug grrr) <br />
<br />
<br />
its a rush to cani5 and see what limits you can push</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've only died once to canni, and thats recently when the hp wasn't updating correctly.  Looked, had 3K+ at the time, hit canni5 and dropped like a rock.  Was right after a rez after I had looted.<br />
<br />
I'm exceptionally cautious about when I canni, so far I'm still the only one out of all our shaman who hasn't died from it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Only died once from canni during my first Fear break in.<br />
<br />
So the crowd zones in, all invised - sure enough there is a see invis (scareling?) mob waiting for the shaman at zonein - dead shaman.<br />
<br />
Tell from cleric &quot;OK rez incoming. Whatever you do, do NOT sit down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rez inc. Hm that sucks cannot sit and 0 mana, but wait, shaman has Canni V, - &quot;LOADING - PLEASE WAIT&quot;. Fortunately most of guild didn't see that or thought it was only one death :). Lesson learned, do not canni after rez with less then 1924 HPs naked  :o After that i took a few weeks and focussed on more HPs ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Low health aggro from too much Canni, several times, First time about 10 minutes after I got Canni1 :)<br />
<br />
Directly - no. I had enough warnings from others before I got Canni5 myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gruel Dorfbeater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've definitely canni five'd myself.. more then once too... canni five is hotkeyed and since i'm a hotkey junkie... well its only a matter of time before i react without looking and put my fingers in the wrong place!!<br />
<br />
and oh btw... I've got 3 different canni 5 hotkeys and sometimes forget what page I'm on too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've can5'd to death a couple times... mainly long VT nights and stuff.  Back before I joined my guild I was grabbing some faction during a ring war and Can4'd myself to death because of some &quot;adult entertainment&quot; that that was on TV... I look over and I was at my bind point.  I did it again about 10 minutes after that.  Now I stick to committing cannicide via can5, takes less time.  (oh yeah, can5 pseudo FD's are fun... hard with troll regen, but fun.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Interestingly enough, I've never actually canned myself to death.<br />
<br />
Came close, ONCE.  A regular can, and I panicked and ducked out of it because I realized I hadn't checked my hp.  Thank God, because it would have killeded me dead.<br />
<br />
I'm not cocky though, because I know it's out there.. lurking.. waiting for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'd never done it until Canni5 came along.  Then I did it a few times before getting better hp gear.  <br />
<br />
I think the poll should be directed at either:<br />
1) Only those with Canni5 or<br />
2) Only those without Canni5<br />
<br />
Would be a more interesting statistical comparison IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have canni 5'd to death twice, both times intentional.<br />
<br />
Before the VP change the easiest way to exit VP was to kill yourself inside and outside of the dungeon, loot your corpse, and get rezzed out. I used canni 5 to kill myself those 2 times, cause it was fastest.<br />
<br />
Other than that... no deaths by canni. yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Last night my hp bar showed 2200 hp and when I hit cann5 .. dead.  I thought they fixed this crap? &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Umgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I've canV'd to death just to make people laugh.  It's amazing how much it can lighten the mood of a raid after a wipe.<br />
I've also done it a few times on accident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">first and only time at 59.. saw I had just under enough hp for another so I figured I'd regen enough by the time canny was done casting.. and I was wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">*nods at Landragoran*<br />
<br />
54 and no canny deaths, I think the question is about Cann 5 too, drunk I can manage 74 hps -)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Fattyshammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Fighting TZ we were dying in droves and I decided to end my misery quick and finish myself off with cann. Unfortunately he took a liking to me and killed me during cast. Worst part is that when I hit my bind it kept casting! Died twice in record time  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I've only died directly to canni once that I can remember.  Was with canni 5 and I was in tranquil skilling bind wound. (I'm one of those obsessive people who wants every skill maxed someday.)  I'd been skilling there for a while.  I'd bw up to 50%, quies to just over 1924 hps, then canni 5 so I could bw again since it was teh fastest way to keep my hps low for bind wound.  So, I do my normal thing, just over 2100 hps, click off quies, hit canni 5.  Boom, staring at my corpse.  I was kinda upset because until then I'd been so proud of being able to say that I'd never canni'd myself to death. :)<br />
<br />
Indirectly I've died to canni 5 more times than I can count.  Need mana bad, hit canni 5, 1.5 bubbles of health left......  Getting mana back during downtime, canni 5, mob pop.....  Just get rezzed and trying to get mana back fast to rebuff and get the group going again....canni down to under 100 hps (my gear sucks and I have just over 2k hps unbuffed), mob in the camp or that just got pulls decides he likes me a bit too much.... etc.  I've probably died a few times to lower canni's as well but canni 5 is just so much more dramatic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>cynwydd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">i have canni'd myself to death at least once (directly) with each so far except canni V. <br />
i expect to feel just as spectacularly foolish when i finally get myself with canni V as i did with the rest.<br />
<br />
(oh? i'm fm? i should stop hitting the button now, huh? *splat*)<br />
 :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: ok, just a few hours after posting this, i went and killed myself with canni V for the first time. &quot;hey, that wasn't the right button!&quot;<br />
my husband shared it with my guild before i'd even finished zoning.<br />
it cheered me up after a CR from hell tho... love those people kiting in the graveyards.</div></div><hr />

Cannicide.  You have done it, admit it!<br />
<br />
I laughed harder than my friends did.  In fact I made it the guild motd for my guild!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Other than the recent HP updating bugs that caused CannV after rez to kill you, no I've never killed myself with any form of canni.  I have however FD'd with it... used to do that all the time with cann3/4.  fun stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">In the 4+ yrs of playing my shaman I've cann killed myself about 5 times. 2 times from cann v.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Matdowns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I cannied myself to uncosciousness once.  It wasn't actually my fault.  I was a using canni 1 at the time, and I waited for my hp to jump up just high enough to use canni.  Well it dropped just before I could duck out of casting canni.  I guess it was a bug with hp not updating.  Scared me ****less, but I lived.<br />
