<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have anyone seen them drop?<br />
Are they tradable?<br />
Is it the legs with the best hp for shaman?<br />
What do they look like? (Guessing red plate).<br />
What do they cost? (if ever sold :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">u listening to the voices in yer head again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Initially they were NO DROP, but I believe they changed it recently so they're now tradeable.<br />
<br />
I have never seen them for sale, and wouldn't expect to anytime soon- they're too good for too many classes.  :)<br />
<br />
If you're looking for something similar AC wise, you might want to try for the Western Wastes dragon leg series (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=dragonleg) - prices are finally starting to fall a little on them.  I got lucky and snagged a pair of the Heavy (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4450) leggings right after the silver chitin handwrap upgrade (traded a level 60 bard who had just upgraded to velious quest leggings for the new handwraps straight up- a great deal, I thought.)  Another alternative is the barbed ringmail leggings (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6306), you get +7 sta and good AC with them, and they're becoming more widely traded, too.<br />
<br />
I think the barbed rubi are the best tradeable HP shaman legs (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/listitem.html?sort=Armour+Class&amp;invslot=Legs&amp;cfilter=9&amp;statfilter=hp) - and you need to get as uber as ancient wurm/wyvern hide (+10/15 sta, +50 hp) to even approach them if you're looking for lootable stuff.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
