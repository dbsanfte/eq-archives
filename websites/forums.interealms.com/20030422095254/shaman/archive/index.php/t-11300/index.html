<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off.  I love my horsey and couldn't live without it.  However, with the release of LoY and the new dinosaur mounts, I was thinking of trading it in.  How do you get the guy in Bazaar to buy back your horse?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, first you find teh appropriate stable hand. ;) Hailing them should reveal which one will take your bridle, as different ones take the different types. Then you turn it in, and you will recieve a bag of platinum. That is what you sell to a vendor. Try to push your cha as high as possible, at least over 125 and have decent faction, you will want to get as much as possible back. <br />

 Edit: These are not the same stablehands you buy from, I think they are across the stable closer to the far wall</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have the cheapest horse - what kind of a hit will i take by selling it back?  any ideas? <br />
<br />
also wondering if anyone has confirmed you get the same benefits as the horses give by being on the dinos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>boogaloo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the lizzy horses are a bit slower then horses because they jump around instead of walking, it gets a bit annoying i hear.  also you cant see the lizzys head, so thats pretty cool, i think on the 8k horse u can sell it back for like 5k not sure if thats exactly it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taldur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had the 9k horse, got 6780 back for him, and bought a lizzy for 8600, he is so HUGE and awsome, and the head is not in the way at all.  <br />
<br />
They are not, however, for travel, unless u get the gaint drum,  they have an over exagerated jumpy-gallop, kind og annoying, but look MUCH cooler than horses, same no sit agro, med while casting deal as horses, just look 1000x better</div></div><hr />
