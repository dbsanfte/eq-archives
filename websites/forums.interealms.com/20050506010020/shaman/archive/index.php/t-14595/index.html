<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the launch of EverQuest one of my greatest passions with the game as well as one of my greatest disaapointments has been with the history and lore that surrounds the world of Norrath. It is a passion because of it's creativity and it's detail, it's a disappointment in how hard some of it is to find. I was hoping that someone might know of any out of game websites or some in game resourses (such as the books you can get in the Plane of Knowledge) that explain the major histories. I know of a few areEverquest Compendium (&quot;http://www.eqcaster.com/pages/compendium.htm&quot;), 1st Fist of light - The Codex of War (&quot;http://www.1stfistoflight.com/~fol/public_html/codex/&quot;), and First Almanac of EverQuest (&quot;http://www.geocities.com/silentredemption/EQalmanac.htm&quot;).<br />
<br />
Of particular interest is any lore concerning the opening of the Plane of Sky (Veeshan's plane), the events after the re-discovery of Kunark as well as the Combines influence on Kunarks history, the lore and history of Luclin, and events that created the books found in Norrath and Luclin and mortals being granted access to the Planes of Power. Also of interest is the opening of the Plane of Hate and relating to that, what happened much later in Befallen. What ever happened to the Realm of Heros? Does it still exist? I know that some history was created and left to rot by Sony as ideas are tried and ultimately fail. <br />
<br />
Oh one other thing, does anyone know if Sokokar exist somewhere in the game as mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, no<br />
<br />
  The ideas are always there, just look at what they did to Veskar. They must of seen that it was crap at that stage or that it couldn't run with the specified machines in the market.<br />
<br />
Watch the next step after PoP will probably be the Realm of Heroes. An possibly the end of EQ as EQ2 states that the gods are now dead. Thanks to those people raiding them....Anyway we still have a long way to go as they haven't placed Veeshan yet. Keep your hopes up and I'm sure that it will be put in one day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One of the best sources I've found for lore is the EQ RPG books. They still don't have nearly as much as I'd like, but enough to make them interesting reads. Especially some of the stuff like that back stories on each of the epics. I know ours has a fair ammount of infomation in game, but a lot of the epic quests are not as detailed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever watched the EQ intro movie? They will never put Veeshan in the game because Veeshan is 1/4 the size of the entire planet of Norrath. You could put Veeshan in as an expansion...<br />
<br />
ZONING, PLEASE WAIT...You have entered Veeshan's left pinky toenail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">err that not the intro movie i saw.  Do you have a link plz to that one??<br />
<br />
Wish i could find the RPG books in a shop here in the UK; getting em sent from states can almost double the price.</div></div><hr />
