Also, I read that if you get killed, your corpse shows up in a graveyard somewhere?  Where is that?  <br />
<br />
Thanks....</div></div><hr />

Maybe if you wanted to do some Fear kiting, you could probably do it in PoD.  But the mobs hit hard, so I would think you'd have too much downtime to get any really good XP if you stand toe-to-toe with the mobs.<br />
<br />
Some of the rats hit for up to 280 and they like to DoT.<br />
<br />
And most of the graveyards seem to be at the zone-in for each zone.</div></div><hr />

If I were you I'd stick to Velks, or Seb for exp.  The planes monsters hit alot harder then anyone expected, and its not the greatest exp in the world.</div></div><hr />

What IS the lowest level plane, or the plane with the lowest mobs? I sometimes hunt with a 54 chanter, 52 warrior and 46 druid, anywhere we might live?  Lol.</div></div><hr />

Those mobs hit HARD. Youre best bet would be to find a couple more to group with. However, exp for those under 60 is unbelievably good. I think that they purposely give bonuses to lower levels, because I was making over a blue per hour at 55 in plane of disease. Dont expect to be able to tank though. I couldnt even take ripostes from many of the mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's also a lot of prisoners and guards in the earlier parts of PoJ that are light blue to me at 61, so they should be good xp for you.  There doesn't seem to be a faction hit on any of it so don't worry.<br />
<br />
I don't think there's anything in PoI or PoN you want to mess with.</div></div><hr />
