<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apache Soulhealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I finally decided to do it.  I hate tis type of thread but  am really stumped.  I am lvl 57 with JBB, horse, epic, around 2.5 k hp self-buffed and looking for a place to solo.<br />
<br />
My preference is to group with friends in PoP zones (mainly PoD and PoN); however, my RL schedule makes it difficult for me to be online for longer than an hour or two during the week and only late at night/morning on the weekends when most of my friends are asleep.  When given the opportunity to solo or group I will almost always group.<br />
<br />
I am lookng for a good zone that is close to a PoP book, gives decent exp and loot is a bonus but not required.  Faction means little to me since most all faction can be fixed or worked around.<br />
<br />
I am a barbarian shaman on Tunare.<br />
<br />
I think that about covers any questions anyone might have.  Any advise would be appreciated.  My goal is to get to 60 as fast as I can, and maybe pick-up a spells here or there.  Any zones that are soloable that drop research compnents or some of our rarer spells is a bonus.<br />
<br />
Also, if you know of any tactics that work well in the zone you propose, feel free to post that as well.  I typically:<br />
<br />
1.  Get pet<br />
2.  Give rusty to pet<br />
3. Buff self and pet (HoS, Sta, Regen, Agi for me...clicky Str for pet)<br />
4. Pull with slow<br />
5. Root<br />
6. Send dog, if not already engaged<br />
7. Epic<br />
8. BoN if tough mob<br />
9. Canni / Regen / Stoic<br />
10. JBB at about 40% until dead maybe melee a bit if root breaks and mob beating up dog dog real bad<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">PoD is my new solo spot, though I usually rely on having Aego first before doing it. I'll also get KEI though it's not really needed. Though with it I'll usually finish the battle with 60% mana which is really good when you hear how much is needed to take a rat down there, lol.<br />
<br />
When you zone into PoD hug the right wall, pass the lake and when you come to the beach you'll see a rock. I always stay behind that rock. No roamers there and there are rats who walk up and down the beach to the left and there are roaming mobs to the right. Watch out for quad kiters there though. You'll usually see them there and if not, a Necro fear kiting. (which is more comforting than quaders imo)<br />
<br />
Get scooby up, give him a HP buff. You can cast celerity too if you want but you'll be using him mainly as a root spell. <br />
<br />
Go out and pull your mob with Malosini. When you get back to the rock sick your pet on it at the same time you're casting slow. No slow = quick dead pooch. As soon as slow sticks root, back off, summon horse/lizzy, back pet off. Epic dot, Plague, BoN. Keep re-applying DoTs and root as needed. Don't let Scooby tank too long. I usually pull him off when he gets to 2 bubs of health and then cast Stoicism on him.<br />
<br />
To take down a rat I usually cast two epic dots, one plague, (sometimes two though the second is casted with 25-30% health to go on the mob) and about 4 BoN. <br />
<br />
With Lizzy and the time that it takes to take down the mob it's no wonder I'm at 60% mana at the end of the battle. I wouldn't want to do this without a mount. <br />
<br />
XP wise, I haven't tested 100% XP yet. With full 100% in AA I was making 2-3% per kill. With 50/50 I was making 1% in each or 1% in XP and 2% in AA, depending on the mobs.<br />
<br />
Goos don't give as much as Rats but are noticeably easier.<br />
<br />
Good luck!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PoD/PoN/PoI mobs have too many HP's to solo effeciently<br />
<br />
Im kinda in the same spot you are. I work/play weird hours. Tough to get a group at 4am cst. <br />
Personally Ive been hunting Dulak Harbor refinery area and luggald caves.<br />
I can honestly take down 5-10 mobs in the time it takes to setup and kill one PoD/PoN mob.<br />
I get over a yellow aa exp per hour or so. It's probably not the greatest spot, but i manage to pull in near 1k plat in a KEI session with 3-7 Iksar blood (refinery) <br />
The tunnels have a potential of a good drop if you camp the named, but no plat drops.<br />
As a 56 shaman I am able to camp the backroom of luggald caves without many problems but the exp isn't as good because mobs have more HP's, thus taking longer to kill.<br />
If you can stand the boredom, the ships drop great plat and the mobs dont have many HP's.<br />
<br />
But the boredom of this zone will soon creep in.. and you'll be looking (like I am) for a new place to hunt.<br />
<br />
Torg mines looks pretty easy.  Nadox looks to be for 60+ soloing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Apache Soulhealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Update:  Been soloing the last couple of days at the giant fort in GD and the Expedition Guards in the caves near there.  Spot is ok, not great exp, decent loot, easy access, low danger.  I went afk last night for over an hour and did not die.  Will give LoY a look, I have found soloing in PoP zones (other than PoJ) to be more difficult than it is worth.  I try to group instead and groups hate it when you go afk for an hour......unless they are friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Zone tunnels in Chardok, can single pull at 56.<br />
<br />
As far as soloing in Nadox, I tried that for Fecund Luggald Flesh I believe it was. Pet got too close to the wall and suddenly I had four more Luggalds, yet no Luggalds were even close.<br />
<br />
Agro is weird in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">still getting a yellow every 2 hours in jaggedpine. thats a yellow of reg exp. I kill none stop with horse and JBB.</div></div><hr />
