<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Elven Warrior Rizz was hiking along the brush and tree lined trails through the Greater Faydark Forest when he was surrounded by a war band of Orc Pawns.<br />
<br />
With reflexes built of battle the warrior drew an arrow from his quiver, knocked it to his bow, and sent it hurtling along its deadly path where it........ <br />
<br />
[Boogahz]<br />
...slammed into a tree. The orc pawns began laughing so hard that it drew the attention of their Master....The dreaded Crushbone himself. As he stood in front of the Mighty warrior, he said.....<br />
<br />
[Bagfra]<br />
&quot;you have ruined your own garden.... I will not have you ruin mine!! Now take your arrow out of my tree before I chase you around!!&quot; Rizz was stunned for a sec, before he was able to.... <br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
Bring the king a shrubbery. The king was very pleased by this shrubbery, and was about to let Rizz go on his way. However, at that moment...<br />
<br />
[Wulfran]<br />
Zelfani appeared, and thinking that her little warrior love was in danger, snared the pawns and started to octa-kite (she can do 8 at at atime cuz she r0x0r) them. This drew forth the wrath of Crushbone and he... <br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
Said, &quot;Rizz!&quot; However, he had forgotten that he was not a god, and that consequently he could not death touch Rizz. Embarrassed, he started to slink away towards his castle when he heard... <br />
<br />
[Bagfra]<br />
(ermm I know my english isn't the best, but I've been watching this fine story come to a stop, and I haven't wrote anything on it since Naonya... actually due to the fact, that I haven't got a clue about what she means.. I will know continue the story, pretending Rizz wasn't yelling at Zelfani, which we all know he would never do, but in stead saying &quot;thank you once again Zelf.. can you stay here while I go and change my underwear!!&quot; )<br />
<br />
Rizz sneaked off, embarresed off his smelling clothes, embarresed to see anyone in the eye. <br />
The next day the fearless warrior came passed the dorf city.. Rizz had never seen a dorf before and wasn't sure if he should attack the one slumbering under a tree, or hail it. Rizz decided to...<br />
<br />
[Aliera]<br />
Scream &quot;OOOGILY BOOGILY&quot; at the top of his lungs.. attracting the unwanted attention of ..... <br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
Another dwarf who happened to be standing by. The dwarf said, &quot;Hello, my name is Ooogily Boogily III. You just shouted my name, and I was wondering what you want with me.&quot; Rizz was astounded, and he said to the dwarf...<br />
<br />
[Branndine]<br />
&quot;ummm I'm lookin' fer some fine looking troll lady, who goes by the name of Tabatha. It's been said she has some amazingly rare potions that....&quot; <br />
<br />
[Moebeus]<br />
&quot;can help with my problem. :( My little soldier just isn't standing at attention like he used to. But I heard the side effects are...&quot; <br />
<br />
[Waran]<br />
... hallucinations that cause you to think you see places like &quot;London&quot;, and &quot;France&quot;. Not only that, but you have this weird sensation to stare directly at mobs' underpants.<br />
<br />
Rizz pondered the matters at hand and decided the pros outweighed the cons and hiked to Innothule Swamp to seek out this strange and mysterious troll lady.<br />
<br />
Ooogily Boogily III said to him, &quot;the Troll you are looking for is Tabatha Soren, and she does not accept plat as a form of payment. To fully repay the debt of the potions you must give her something [special]... <br />
<br />
[Drolgin]<br />
&quot;Something Special?&quot; Rizz said. &quot;What could that be?&quot;<br />
Ooogily did not respond, just stood there.<br />
&quot;What sort of Special Something must I give her?&quot;<br />
Still no answer.<br />
&quot;What special?&quot; Rizz said in a tired voice.<br />
Oogily Boogily the Third beamed a smile at him, and said &quot;Cannot open file froglokmeat3.txt&quot;.<br />
<br />
Pondering this, Rizz went out looking for the strange Cannotopenfilefroglokmeat3.txt. His first stop was...<br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
the Kelethin ranger's guild. It was widely known that Maesyn Trueshot, the elder ranger of the guild, had an incredible knowledge of where to find things. Rizz approached Maesyn, and said to him, &quot;O elder ranger, where can I find a cannotopenfilefroglokmeat3.txt? I need it for a potion!&quot; To which Maesyn responded...<br />
<br />
[Wulfran]<br />
&quot;what is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rizz was somewhat perplexed but answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;what is your Quest?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again Rizz was taken aback but he answered &quot;to find a cannotopenfilefroglokmeat3.txt&quot;<br />
<br />
Maesyn then asked Rizz &quot;what is your favorite color?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rizz responded &quot;Blue. No...gre-&quot;<br />
<br />
His answer was cut off as Maesyn pulled a hidden lever and Rizz plummeted to... <br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
Toxxulia. Rizz landed with a loud thud on the ground of the impossibly dark forest, and lay there, stunned. When he came to, he kicked himself for letting himself fall into Maesyn's trap. Suddenly, he saw a familiar face through the gloom. As the face drew closer, he recognized the face and body of... <br />
<br />
[Utee]<br />
Wait a minute.. <br />
<br />
that wasnt a dark forest he landed in...<br />
<br />
It was a Dark Elf he landed ON!<br />
<br />
The Old Dark Elf laid in a crumpled heap... <br />
<br />
[Venomblood]<br />
Rizz sprang up, aghast and torn between a desire to help the old man, and a desire to kick a Dark Elf. Upon realizing that the old man was unconcious, he came to a third conclusion and quickly lifted the man's wallet. Running into the trees, he openned the wallet to find.....<br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
An Amarin Airlines (tm) Frequent Flier card! He quickly ran to the nearest druid ring, and used the card to buy a flight to Butcherblock. He intended, of course, to ask Maesyn why the heck he had ended up in Toxxulia. However, during the flight, something went wrong, and instead of landing in Butcherblock, he landed in... <br />
<br />
[Akdov]<br />
Veeshan Peaks! It seems that a rogue god was summoning people to this hot and deadly place and binding them to this place. A confused wizard, Jlove, next to Rizz said, &quot;What are we doing here?&quot; to which Rizz, realizing where they were and what peril they were in, responded &quot;OH .... <br />
<br />
[Falino]<br />
I think I will petition and get this taken care of. But ironically the guide who summoned him to the zone was the only guide online at the time and told him... <br />
<br />
[Burien]<br />
&quot;REMEMBER ME??? im the newbie who asked you for a sarnack battleshield and 2 lams when i was lvl 4 and u just laughed at me and walked away with your lmao friends and laughed and jeered, i know u were&quot;, well now mister big and tuff guy, ive saved all my money from mowin lawns all summer and bought this gm acount on ebay, and yer ....... <br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
Just about to be leaving this zone!&quot; The guide suddenly teleported Rizz out of the Temple of Veeshan, just as Jlove was trampled to pieces by Telkorenar (sorry Jlove :p ). When he finally landed, he looked around and saw the familiar sights of...<br />
<br />
[Wulfran]<br />
West Freeport. Rizz started to panic, knowing the Sir Lucan and the militia were none to fond of his little eflin self, but then he remembered! He can summon Zelfani to help him escape!<br />
<br />
But just as out stalwart hero was about summon his lovely rescuer, a dark elf by the Hollis Tnoops popped in front of him and said... <br />
<br />
[Knarlz]<br />
&quot;All you base are belong to us&quot;<br />
<br />
Rizz was aghast, and /petition to get him base back.<br />
<br />
Eight hours later he got a /tell &quot;helloo GM Nerfmaster here and <br />
<br />
[Hammerstalker]<br />
I am sorry but I can do nothing for your stolen base, but I understand that Wulfran is conspiring to steal your Mojo as well !!<br />
<br />
Rizz was panic stricken and grabbed his mojo and ran off to seek the advice of...<br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
the Heartwood Master. Having lost his trust in Maesyn after the Tox incident, he decided that the druid guild leader was the next best thing. When he got to the Master, he said, &quot;O Heartwood Master, can you help me? All my base are belong to them and someone is after my mojo!&quot; The Heartwood Master looked at him and said...<br />
<br />
[Abash]<br />
Well my son...as far as your base are belonging to them..I would like to pass along an ancient secret..passed down to me from my ancestors...I hope it can help you as much as it has helped me throughout my long lifetime....<br />
<br />
Finders keepers losers weepers..<br />
<br />
Now, as far as that mojo problem..I heard that if you shake your groove thing hard enough you can.. <br />
<br />
[Atokal]<br />
Transport yourself to where your Nemesis Wulfran is now at rest, and thus steal his Mojo. However, If you fail the results will be catastrophic. Not only will Wulfran get your Mojo but you will grow... <br />
<br />
[Venomblood]<br />
a foot. No, not in height, a third foot. <br />
<br />
Rizz thought about it for a second and then said to himself &quot;Hmm, just shake my groove thing and I'll be at Wulfran. Fail, and I grow a foot. Wulf wants my mojo, I've lost my base, what else have I got to lose.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Rizz courageously shook his groove thing, which required him to use his magical &quot;Groove Shaker of Greater Faydark&quot; and suddenly .........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zelfani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rizz found himself looking at the biggest set of hairy legs he had ever seen.. a god awful sound was filling the air as the form in front of him was .. was.. singing??

<br />
Rizz was puzzled both by the barbarians singing but also Wulfran's repugnant odor. One other thing struck Rizz as odd and that was that Wulfran was cuddling a Teddy Bear and had a....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Soother in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Spinning and singing in a very high pitched voice Wulfran intoned,<br />
&quot;Hello Rizz, are you here to take my MOJO&quot; the barbarian cried. Haha you will soon learn that my MOJO has already been stolen by Atokal the Mighty Cleric.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you seek my Mojo you will find Toke....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lands. All the women of Norrath are under his spell and should you attempt to attack him, the women will bind together and cast a spell turning you into an Inkie. However if you were to approach Atokal the Mighty as a serf you may be able to incur his favor.  <br />
<br />
Wulfran decided this was the best approach so he left to find the Lands of Toke.<br />
<br />
On the way there....</div></div><hr />
