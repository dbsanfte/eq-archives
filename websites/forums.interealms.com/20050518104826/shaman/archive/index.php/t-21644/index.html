<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, Ive only been to Hates Fury twice, but each time Ive gone there I do the head scratch for two reasons.. Reason 1. I solo Nadox all the time..I can usually pull one mob from a pack of two or three without any problem what so ever, but when I go to Fury, I got slammed..Myself and a 63 Shaman, Im 61, and we both got chased out of there like a pair of penniless fat kids in a candy store...Whats up with that....and 2.Hates fury/plane of hate??  is it the same place, I got really really bored between buffing i pok and exploring PoM and went looking for Plane of Hate...Send me some info if you would..Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Plane of Hate requires a wizard to teleport you to. I dont know alot about the lore surrounding LoY but they are Innoruuk worshippers.  Hate's Fury is an apt name for the boat that carries the god of hate's people around on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hate's Fury is a zone for 60+ Groups (it requires a decent tank for any type of well paced clearing).  I think you'll find that the order of difficulty for LoY goes (Easiest to Hardest) Gunthak, Dulak, Nadox, Torigan Mines, Hate's Fury.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The whole LoY thing seems to center around the Hate worshipers.  Inny can be spawned in Nadox.  Just what I have seen.  PoH is a wizzy port and requires a stone as a reagent.<br />
<br />
I don't anything about the agro raidus but when I am there I usually only get one mob per..but I am 65.  It could be level agro..dunno<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I solo the entry room at Hatesfury when I know I will have several short streches (30-40min) to play.  You can camp aginst the wall at interance with little danger.<br />
<br />
I pull the single rat to the right as you enter, then the two pirates on the right ( they come together but you can root the closer one in place while slowing).  On the left, root the pirate near the ladder down and the nearby snake will come.  The last two mobs in the room come single.<br />
<br />
Will occasionally pop a named in this room.<br />
<br />
Beware as there is one roamer that enters the room and wanders close to entry hall.  You need to be prepared to root-debuff it as well.<br />
<br />
That said, I believe you would find it much more rewarding to clear the docks.  Quite safe to pull to the Hatesfury zone line and I don't see much xp difference if any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grammaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hates Fury has some moderately large aggro.  Even at 65 you often get multiples.<br />
<br />
<br />
And Hates Fury != Plane of Hate.<br />
<br />
Plane of Hate is where the god Innoruuk resides.  As mentioned, it requires a Fulligan Soulstone and a wizzy to port to.<br />

Hates Fury is a big boat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HF is the toughest zone in LoY, but the toughest mob is Inny in Nadox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">[QUOTE='Sudedor']Torigan is between Dulak and Nadox in difficulty.  <br />
<br />
Yes, I know that's what SONY says, but I have found the opposite to be true.  Maybe it's due to the confined space, or my playing style, but the tunnels (mines) seemed a bit harder than Nadox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im talking about mob cons.  Very few DB's in Torg for me, but most of Nadox is DB.  (L62)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ahhhhh... I see, sorry for the mix-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The tunnels are only one half of the Torgiran Mines zone. There are rooms and hallways and some caves in the other half, with higher level mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes . . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RoenLuve</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hate's Fury was the first place I experienced at when LoY came out.  It is a nice zone but a bit of a pain to get to unless you know the way and even still it can be.<br />
<br />
I use to partner the place with my 65 Cleric who had decent gear (not uber) and either my 65 Bestlord friend or 60+ Shaman Friend.  It is real easy with cleric because you can pacify the mobs and never get more then one mob at a time.  With slow the mobs are real panzies!  The great thing is they are easy to slow because most have crap MR.  After you land slow anyone can tank the mob even the pet. <br />
<br />
WARNING!  There are a couple of casters that nuke for 1k+!  If they cleric is tanking he can use bash to stun.  Otherwise he will need to have a few stuns memed.  Otherwise I give this place an A+ for ease.<br />
<br />
Fringe bennefits are the entry room serves as a grave yard and some decent gear and plat for your time and difficulty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Torigan is between Dulak and Nadox in difficulty.  <br />
<br />
HF is the toughest zone in LoY, but the toughest mob is Inny in Nadox.<br />
<br />
Actually, Nadox and Togrin are about equal, from my experience. Both have bigger mobs, and smaller mobs. Both have triggered events. Both have fairly cool quests. Both are worth checking out, as they really arent bad &quot;true dungeons&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This has been an interesting post.  I was on an extended EQ hiatus when LoY was released, and only bought it much later for the bank space, maps, etc.  I haven't been to any of these zones - they sound like they might be fun.<br />
<br />
My current 3-box team is a 62 shaman / 63 enchanter / 59 mage.  Decent but not excellent gear - the shaman has the best of it.  What zone makes the most sense - Hate's Fury?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grammaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Not sure if Hate's Fury is the most efficent zone, or whatever, but it should be pretty easy to do at those levels.  And it really is a fun zone.  All one big seagoing ship.  There are certain decks you can gaze at the sea, and the designers made it really feel like you were on a moving boat.<br />
<br />
IMHO it is one of the most atmospheric, and detailed zones to barsh in.  Well worth the look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Loy has got to be one of my favourite expansions even though its probably the expansion with the least amount of content added, and its in the middle of nowhere and the mobs have way too much hp. The spell quests are cool, and it introduced a fair number of new ideas. If charms hadn't been obsoleted with the pop charm and the charms that dropped in loy were much more common it could have been ever better in some ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">TM is actually a higher level zone than Nadox on average.  It seems wierd, but they are pretty close nonetheless.  HF on the other hand, has turned into a waste of pixels.  If a ZI or succor point can't be single pulled, and the hassle for a group to go there isn't worth the effort, people will not go there.<br />
<br />
I know SOE encourages grouping and dungeon crawls, but if it isn't the cutting edge new expansion with ubah lewtz, forget it.  I have been to HF 3 times.  It was OK, but nothing worth the trouble of traveling ever again.  Yet I take alts to Gunthak, Dulak, and Nadox/TM all the time.<br />
<br />
The reason that Sebilis is STILL a great dungeon, is because it is worth the trip to get there.  50-60 spells drop there, class specific armor with free clickies drop there, and you can still make some decent cash in NGE.  Even though alot of people don't like the zone, it is the standard of risk vs. reward that people want in the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah Hatesfury I only visited about twice, used to be a pain in the ass to get there before they made the undead mobs on the bridge not see through regular invis for some odd reason.  The loots and exp in hatesfury are disappointing and there are a few buggy mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">HF sucks<br />
<br />
mobs are all blue at 65 but the exp modifier in the zone isn't as high as you'd expect, and drop rates are suxor<br />
<br />
I spent about 3 weeks there when LoY went live and i never did get the charm off the armsmaster<br />
<br />
getting through nadox to hate's can get a bit ugly if you dont know the way... invis up to the undead then IVU to HF.  at the docks, there are 2 mobs that see through IVU so just haul ass past them</div></div><hr />
