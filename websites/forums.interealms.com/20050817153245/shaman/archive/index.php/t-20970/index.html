<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mathrin Cauthon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, from browsing around the web boards, and reading most all of the posts that come by on this one, it's become pretty apparent that a lot of the higher end shamans are unhappy, both with their spell ability and generally with their grouping desirability.<br />
<br />
I've read through all the suggestions about healing changes and stat buff changes and pet changes..and so on and on.  As I was thinking about ways to improve the class and the things that we are really known for.  An idea kind of tickled the back of my mind, one that was kind of introduced a few expansions ago with LoY.  Curses. <br />
<br />
Yes, I said Curses.  With our new line of ldon curse spells that were introduced, it added a little bit of freshness to our spell lineup.  We are very/used to be very good at debuffing monsters to make raids and  group xp'ing situations better.  Well, if the devs are so stuck on limiting the usefulness of slow, why not add some different style of debuffs into the game besides just slow/cripple.  What I was thinking about was a new type of debuffs called the Curses...just like the ldon curses you get when playing around with traps.  These wouldn't necessarily need be limited to just the shaman class...I was thinking about doing them for shamans clerics and necromancers because all 3 of these kind of need a little boost to what they bring to a group.<br />
<br />
Examples<br />
<br />
    Curse of Feebleness - Shaman - when cast causes your target to lose the abiltiy to either dual wield or either double attack for the length of 30 seconds.   The benefits of this should be quite apparent.  This spell should also be a very high aggro spell. (Stacks with other curses)<br />
<br />
    Curse of Regeneration - Shaman when cast on target causes a 25% chance that any spell the mob casts will be a super regenerations spell (something along the lines of 100 hp tick) on its targets group.  Curse lasts for 1 minute. (Does not stack with clric or nec)<br />
<br />
    Curse of Mistargeting - Cleric - when cast on target causes a 25% chance that any spell the mob casts will be Word of Replenishment (2500 pt group heal) on its targets group or Complete Heal on a single targeton.  Curse lasts for 1 minute. (Does not stack with shm or nec)<br />
<br />
    Curse of Insanity - Necro - when cast on target causes a 25% chance that any spell the mob casts will be Mind Wrack (300 pt group mana) on its targets group.  Curse lasts for 1 minute. (Does not stack with shm or clr)<br />
<br />
Now, why 30 seconds you say on the first shaman one? Well, cutting out the dual wield or double attacking ability on a high end mob could be quite effective, but in a lot of the older content, could completely trivialize long encounters.  The short duration and high aggro would mean the shaman would have to be very careful about when and how often he casts on mobs.<br />
<br />
These spells would all have great uses for the classes listed...and when you have more than one of the classes, you will have to decide whether you want the mob healing your group, mana feeding your group, or insane regenrations on your group.  Perhaps this should be adjusted to affect raids also?<br />
<br />
The Shaman melee debuff should be somewhat difficult to land, but defintiely nothing requiring more than a malo or tash.  The other 3 curses should all be easily landable because there is only a 25% chance that it will happen.  As for fighting against MELEE only mobs, instead of a 25% chance in the cast, it should be changed to a 10% chance of proc'ing.<br />
<br />
So, am I completely insane for coming up with this idea? Would it even be possible to code? Or do you like it and have suggestions or other changes that might even make it better?  Thanks for reading and I hope we can all find a way to make the class we love more useful and enjoyable to everyone that loves to play them.<br />

<br />
I like the idea of using the Curse line for more than DoTs, though I don't particularly care for your examples.<br />
<br />
The Curse line should all be low aggro and should fix our current lack of contribution to a group in Hard LDoN and GoD.  None of your examples in my opinion would do that effectively.<br />
<br />
Here are some I just thought of:<br />
Curse of Mirrors.  When cast on a mob gives the Mirror IV effect to everyone in the group from that mob's spells (AE's included).  Short duration of say 7 ticks, unresistable.  Mirror is only a 20% percentage chance to reflect a spell.<br />
<br />
Curse of the FeebleMind.  Casts that nasty curse that those Luclin mobs do that causes massive fizzling &amp; doubles the casting time of all spells for the recipient.<br />
<br />
Heck, just give us some of the stuff that is already in game for the mobs.  This should save on coding work.<br />
Death Strike (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1068&amp;source=Live) - this would be an awesome burst DPS AA.  One minute refresh - make it cost 10 AA points.<br />
<br />
Curse of the Dead (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3750&amp;source=Live) - make this a SPELL.  Three tick dot that does 2250 and could snare those super fast runners in GoD.<br />
<br />
Curse of the Desert (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4163&amp;source=Live) - This would be another awesome spell.  90 second recast delay &amp; all, though it honestly I think it would have to be modified to a targetted AE instead of being a PBAE.<br />
<br />
Curse of Tunik Tamuik  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5007&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
Heck, just pick and choose a few from this list! (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?searchtext=curse)   Some obviously wouldn't work, but others could EASILY solve our burst DPS problems as well as offer us substantial contributions in terms of debuffing effects (like this one Packmaster's Curse (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4720&amp;source=Live)) or non-traditional damage.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Greetings,<br />
<br />
I love the idea of some new spells/abilities to help bring us into the game as serious players in the high paced content that we play in today.<br />
<br />
Frekkels, I love your ideas.  Some of those would have to be tweaked I think.  Resist adjusts (too many unresistable spells would make the devs/other classes cry, and rightly so) and some of the effects would have to be tinkered with, but by enlarge I think many of them would help a LOT with what we're looking for.  Some fast casting nukes (1 minute refresh...perfect, we can toss it once one each or at least every other mob...can't chain to out nuke wizards, but some nice burst DPS when needed), useful dots, debuffs, and dot/debuff combinations.<br />
<br />
In short, some of those ideas, and some like them, could easily give use some utility in groups again, and make people consider us for high end content.  The game is all about being set up for high speed now.  We need at least one, or a combination of:  <br />
<br />
Burst DPS<br />
Burst Healing<br />
&lt;b&gt;MEANINGFUL&lt;/b&gt;, Quick Debuffing (Significant decrease in mob DPS)<br />
<br />
Without at least one of those, or a combination of them, there's just not much we can do to help a group.<br />
<br />
I'd still like to see balance be raised to 75%, but that's another argument. ;)<br />
<br />
Be Well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am more and more coming to the realization that curses and better buffs is the way to fix shaman issues. Such spells are easier to scale to adjust to all levels of content. More importantly, it would not significantly increase shaman solo capability but still make us more viable for groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">clerics need a boost to what they bring to a group? news to me...<br />
<br />
Clerics think they do....<br />
<br />
<br />
This is becoming a irratation to me for sure, i mean as a shaman i can fully relate to needing or wanting things for your class, but come on. Clerics are the best healers in the game, you cant touch them and in every game or even most books and stories, the cleric is simply a healer, not a damage dealer. <br />
<br />
I can understand healing is boring, but you picked the class, you knew what it was from level 1, you are going to do not much more then heal other people.<br />
<br />
I dont get their discontent other then just bordem, which is not really a excuse for upgrades.  IMHO anyway, feel free to enlighten me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Curse of Feebleness - Shaman - when cast causes your target to lose the abiltiy to either dual wield or either double attack for the length of 30 seconds.

The short duration and high aggro would mean the shaman would have to be very careful about when and how often he casts on mobs.<br />
So basically I am allowed to trivialize anything that is completely unsloweable for a reason - bosses mainly - and it does not help me at all in experience groups or short fights in general? Not only does that not fix any of our issues, it creatues huge problems of it's own.<br />
<br />
The miscast curses are a nice idea, but I am not convinced that they are useful given that casting MOBs are already massively easier then noncasting MOBs.<br />
<br />
Litgruv: Where do you see clerics saying they need more group utility? I have seen clerics demand invisibility a lot and I have seen a lot of requests for soloing capabilities. I have seen next to noone wanting to be more useful in groups or raids, especially not at level 65+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think that if people are actually concerned about the new adjustments Shaman need having the ability to trivialize old content, there is a way to avoid this BEYOND No Drop in high zones for certain spells.<br />
<br />
If we want some kind of upgrade that is &quot;limited&quot; to being used ONLY in the content where we feel we have become useless, make it similar to how some spells are coded to only be cast in certain circumstance (appropriate for the specific situation). Some already existing spells can only be cast at night. Some spells can only be cast on undead. Some spells can only be cast outdoors or indoors. Obviously the coding to limit a spell to a certain circumstance is already in the game. Do this same thing for the upgrades we seek.<br />
<br />
While any realistic shaman will easily concede that our class is fine in all but later tiers of PoP, high risk LDoNs, and aspects of GoD content, it's apparent there needs to be an addition/upgrade/enhancement made to the class to aid us where we fall short but not allow that addition/upgrade/enhancment to alter that already acceptable level of power than a shaman has in other content.<br />
<br />
Now, while it's possible that the shaman who claim to not have access to some content will most likely be annoyed by their not &quot;using&quot; these new spells or abilities because they don't enter the content in the first place, it should not actually impede them since they are not IN the zones where the severe decrease in power is felt anyway. They would remain fine in the content they currently access. Should the access they have to such content change, they will THEN make use of the spells/abilities where they would be needed...at the appropriate time.<br />
<br />
I think it is reasonable to consider a &quot;bane/boon weapon coded&quot; line of spells that are truly SITUATIONAL (read: appropriate for the situations of higher tier PoP and GoD). Bane spells would denote detrimental spells. Boon spells would denote beneficial spells.<br />
<br />
Bane/Boon of the Elements, Bane/Boon of Time, Bane/Boon of Discord spells could be a way to give us what we DO need while not having it affect the class in places were we don't need it. These could be situation specific buffs like +avoidance, +strikethrough, +shielding ideas that have been tossed around for these specific areas. Such buff enhancements weren't really &quot;needed&quot; to make us group attractive in previous zones. Perhaps +pet ehnancements for the enchanter charmed.  ;) Maybe they could be % spell casting enhancements (I'm thinking along the lines of cast time reduction) that would improve our own as well as other casters detrimental spells (damage and debuffs) based on the fact that fights in these specific zones are shorter than in others.<br />
<br />
Since spells like Spirit of the Wolf can be coded to only be cast in &quot;outdoor&quot; zones these &quot;zone specific banes&quot; could be coded in a similar way. Bane/Boon of Discord spells could not be cast in any other zones than Gates of Discord zones. Even if they were limited to the instanced zones (trials)...SOMETHING would be better than nothing.<br />
<br />
I would also think that coding such &quot;Boon&quot; type spells for zone specific requirements, even &quot;expansion&quot; specific requirement would allow for all classes to receive healing/buffing upgrades that would fit the circumstances of that particular design of the game while not having the overwhelming effect of trivializing older content VIA SPELL LINES. Obviously, increased power by equipment upgrades is always going to have an effect, but increased healing power for classes like the shaman in particular could potentially be better balanced. <br />
<br />
If we, as a class, were TUNED to &quot;increase&quot; the viability of other classes in a group...just because we had a zone specific Boon Spell that shortened the cast time of detrimental spells, we would already be desired for a group...even without a healing upgrade. Conversely, our own debuff line would be greatly improved in effectiveness in short duration encounters because of the reduced cast time. In effect, that mostly and partially mitigated slow has a beneficial effect because it would land prior to the mob being 1/2 to 3/4 dead. Maybe our backup heals would have a greater effect in such a circumstance...<br />
<br />
If such a &quot;boon spell&quot; would not be a good idea, then healing spells COULD be introduced that were zone (or expansion) specific. Healing for a shaman is specifically a problem in Eplanes, Time, GoD...so then give us an increased healing spell that can ONLY be cast in those areas.<br />
<br />
I agree that our healing is fine when balanced around slow in other areas outside of the ones in question. That is why I do not see a &quot;need&quot; for us to have healing spells that could be cast in those other areas.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts.</div></div><hr />

no.. we're unhappy with the stupidly long posts about &quot;class balancing&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's really stupid that SoE introduces a curse for us, and then has exactly ZERO imagination on how to implement them.  I mean really all they did was give us another DoT which we dont need.<br />
<br />
These are great ideas and they come up time and time again, yet SoE will never implement them!!</div></div><hr />

turn cripple into this :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another cool idea for a new spell in a new expansion maybe is having an infectable dot. Say you cast, this dot on one mob, bring another mob into camp and it gets infected too. Would be annoying for mez, but could lead to a  different use for dots.</div></div><hr />
