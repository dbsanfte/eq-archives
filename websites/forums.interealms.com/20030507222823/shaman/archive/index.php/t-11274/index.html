<br />
I am a level 32 Shaman who has worked for a long while to get all the equipment listed.  I have some PvP gear, but that is a different matter entirely.<br />
<br />
What I was looking for was some hints for what I should be looking to upgrade to.  I have observed that AC/HP/Mana is better for Shamans than wisdom, but have also collected some wisdom items along the way to help me along.<br />

Question:  Is a Jaundiced Bone Breastplate and Legs worth the amount people are asking for it?  I like them a lot, especially for the AC and clickable effects, but what do you all recommend?<br />
<br />
I hope to have enough money by the time I hit 45th to afford a Jaundiced Bone Bracer, but prices for them on my server are about 23-25k usually... Very expensive.<br />
<br />
Also note: My alternate held items are a Testament of Vanear and a Barbarian Spiritist Hammer for 2 hand blunt (got it cheap for only 250pp in the bazaar).<br />

<br />
ignore me if I don't what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
the clickable effects are all lvl 45, or there abouts, so for a while no benefit.<br />
<br />
I don't enough to advise on anything else.<br />
<br />
What I do is go to the bazaar, do a search with all the parameters, check the web for alternatives <br />
gear comprassion (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html)<br />
&amp; buy the best I can.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />
