<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tinlaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for informations on swarmcaller and swarmlord mini ring in Umbral if anyone has ;)<br />
<br />
Thx in advance for any infos, trying to figure how many people i need to tag along ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aeneran Orcreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Without spoiling it too much, we tried this for the first time this weekend.  At least 5 waves in the ring and only the last one and the boss are harder than the previous, seemed like they come faster as well as the ring goes on.   Its a lot of fun though.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tinlaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok i did it this week end with a guild force of 2 groups and i must admit it was a bit overkill (we even had the time to med in between waves).<br />
<br />
Layout was the 2 groups engaged separate spawns while other spawns were kept mezzed.<br />
<br />
4 pop per wave and on 6th wave, swarmlord pop. Hits kinda hard and isn't slowable (so cleric has better to watch the MT).<br />
<br />
Very Funny mini ring, guess it would be a bit pushing the enveloppe with a single group (still, could be doable with ultra high DPS).</div></div><hr />
