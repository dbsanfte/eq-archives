<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently bought an Amulet of Insight which has the focus effect Extended Enhancement III. <br />
<br />
When buffing it was seeming like the effects weren't any longer at all. I did a small test by casting Regrowth on myself. The duration was the same with or without the Amulet (19mins).<br />
<br />
I know the item is being triggered because I get the message &quot;Amulet of Insight sparkles&quot;<br />
<br />
Before I go off the deep end and start with more tests, has anyone tried testing these things? We know Verant doesn't hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info you can provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I tested a CMW with extended affliction3 and got some pretty varied results on the additional damage done.  Not sure if my ghetto dial-up had some part in it, but I would not be surprised if focus effects are not always 100%.<br />
<br />
Is worth testing IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only focus 3 Item I have gotten a hold of so far is a damage 3 item and that one definately works. Ice Strikes for 750-800 are cool. I am curious to hear if anyone has tested some of the other focus effects. Right now I am really looking forward to spell haste and mana preservation and healing 3, anyone know if they are working?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haven't tested it scientifically, but I definately noticed a difference in my mana pool for the same fight with and without an obulus death shroud, so near as I can tell Mana Preservation 3 is working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/gasp<br />
<br />
Naarlina sighting!  ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">haste and mana preservation and healing 3 all work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have spell casting reinforcement, and spell casting reinforcement mastery, it is possible that they are superceding the focus item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have the following items:<br />
<br />
Girdle of Magnificence - Affliction Haste 3<br />
Coldain Military Wristband - Extended Affliction 3<br />
<br />
Affliction Haste 3<br />
<br />
The Girdle has cut down all my Dots casting time. Here are the results with Bane and Pox:<br />
<br />
Pox was 5.0 sec cast time now 3.4 sec cast time<br />
Bane was 5.0 sec cast time now 3.4 sec cast time<br />
<br />
So the differnce looks to be about 5.0 x .32% or 32% not the 33% advertised but hey that looks like a rounding issue.<br />
<br />
Extended Affliction 3 <br />
<br />
Pox unlike Plague is 18 ticks or 1min 48secs<br />
<br />
I have timed at least 12 castings of this and the spell always runs to 2mins 6 secs. So I am getting 3 extra ticks for 333 dmg (3x111)<br />
<br />
According to EQcaster stats should be an extra 20% duration. 18x.20=3.6ticks but looks like they aren't rounding up..rather down to 3 ticks.<br />
<br />
Bane runs 7 ticks or 42secs. After about 8 trials I have gotten  consistant 48sec runs. So an extra 214dmg (1x214)<br />
<br />
So in a fight where I cast both Bane and Pox at least once (Katta Guards) I am doing an extra 547dmg. Not too shabby.<br />
<br />
Where the extended affliction 3 really appears to shine as you can tell is with disease and longer duration dots, which makes sense.<br />
<br />
I also tested Plague and got these results:<br />
<br />
Was 2m 6secs (21 ticks) was getting 2m 30secs (24 ticks) so an extra 220dmg (55x4ticks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tried Extended Affliction 3 from the CMW on myself 3 times and everytime it lasted 9 ticks instead of 7. Nice increase of efficiency of the dots.</div></div><hr />
