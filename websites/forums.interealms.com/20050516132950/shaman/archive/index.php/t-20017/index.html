<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Okuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My 65 rogue friend an I were talking, today, about duoing in the future.  I figure we would make a decent team.  Anyone familiar with such a duo and can give me some insight on how well it works?  What kind of strategies do you use?  I would expect the shaman tanks as to take advantage of the rogue DPS.  Any other info that would be helpful?</div></div><hr />

Root is your friend ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">just use Flash of light at melee range. 12 mana, way too much agggro :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All ya need to do is debuff the mob like you were solo'ing, then root it.  Since root aggro is bsed on who is closer to the mob, just stand closer to the mob than your partner.  Its super ease, assuming you have the hps to tank the mob you are trying to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">cripple is also cheap, useful and has good aggro if they are unrootable or it breaks too easy.  I hadn't tried blind with a rogue, heh, but that sounds like the real ticket :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As recognised above, aggro is key to this and there are a number of solutions.<br />
<br />
a) Use the level 14 version of cripple for low mana, high aggro<br />
<br />
b) Flash of Light. Just make damn sure you both stay in melee range at all times :)<br />
<br />
c) Root and use proximity aggro. <br />
<br />
All depends on where and what you are fighting:<br />
<br />
Mobs hitting too hard/fast for you to tank? Use option a) combined with DoTs and kite the mob whilst rogue + dogdog runs behind hitting the mob's back. Snare item really helps here, and mainly outdoors tactic only.<br />
<br />
Mobs hitting like jesses, reasonable open spaces? Use option b), stick within melee range at all times, and heal as required.<br />
<br />
Fighting indoors and can't afford to mess up with FoL due to massive trains? Getting adds so you need to move around to do CC? Use root, mob will attack whoever stands closer, so get rogue to stay at max melee range whilst you tank IN TEH FACE (tm). If root is breaking too easily, use option a) instead - bit more mana intensive probably, but works fine and you can throw in dots and nukes without worrying about breaking root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A few dots, slow and cripple usually make em plenty mad. If all I do dou with my ranger is slow  he can hold agro with one snare, but I start throwing in bane of nife and pox he starts having to chain cast snare and flamelick to keep the mob from wanting to eat me everytime the dots tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ddog House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've been 2 boxing a Rogue and Shaman for close to a year now, magelos below.<br />

<br />
So far, I have been able to kill effectively in Sol Ro Tower and Fire using the Rogue to tank and DPS, and the Shaman debuffing and healing. I've tried tanking with the Shaman, and while I had zero aggro management issues, it uses an ungodly amount of mana per mob. Take from that what you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No need to use root... do your Malos/Slow combo, and then a quick cripple and then cast Blood of Saryrn... usually plenty of agro to last the entire fight.  Not too much mana either, and you're helping do damage.  Most places I fight that DoT will expire well before the mob dies, so the DoT is pretty pretty efficient.<br />
<br />
I duo a lot with a AM3 ranger, those are the spells I use.  Great combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Been two boxing a rogue up, usually slow + one poison dot is enough to keep aggro with evade. If evade fails a couple times in a row or mana is tight, chain clicking the clinging darkness necklace works wonders too. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have duoed with my rogue. Aggro is held no proble with slow and Blood if you are evading with rogue he will never get aggro. That works up till stuff starts hitting for 600+ then the Shaman doesn't tank as well. Rogues don't make exactly the best tanks either, dual weilding against stuff that ripostes for 650+ is ouchy. DS potions can help. Suffice to say it is quite doable up to certain teirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vannilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can attest to the fact that Arshei tanks just fine in earth :D</div></div><hr />

Hehe yea that was pretty fun :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Minitiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just want to add on my support for Flash of Light, it is insane agro, used it to help plvl my rogues group in PoDisease when their tank kept dying. I'm no uber shammy, but tanking LCY in PoD was pretty good for me at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Slow, blood of thule, and sharkspine melee is plenty to hold agro. If I had ancient scourge, I'd use that instead.<br />
<br />
Basically when duoing with a rogue, it's like soloing only stuff dies faster  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">In the last few weeks I have ended up as Main Tank during LDoNs where the plate classwent LD and we had a rogue who didnt want to MT for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
I can assure you that if you (a) malo(s), (b) slow, then you will get aggro. If you (c) throw a medium DoT such as BoNife, (d) have a reasonable weapon, self and self buffs, you will be able to keep aggro. In fact, you will have to either channel your heals or root the mob to allow you to back off and heal.<br />
<br />
Rest assured, getting aggro and keeping it will not be a problem! Obviously, your sneaky friend will sometimes hit for insane damage backstabs and get aggro, but load another doT and you will get aggro back ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I group mostly, but when I am duoing just my rogue and shaman if they hit too hard, I let the rogue take agro and heal, if they dont hit hard enough, then I root them and let the rogue bs away.  Its a much better group if I add just one real plate tank to the group, preferably a paladin or sk so the shaman and rogue have no worries of agro, ever (well, with a decent sk or pally).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have had my rogue for about 3 years now and I can tell you w/o a doubt they are the worlds worst duo with a shaman.  Please someone prove me wrong and tell me there is a worse one out there, but I cant think of it.... maybe Berz actually but they are too new to tell.<br />
<br />
Point is that you CAN duo with anyone....the fact is rogues arent very good partners for shaman.  Rogues are best in a 3+ person group.  Some points to remember:<br />
<br />
1- Rogues suck at tanking.  They'll have a bit more hp and ac than shaman but the second you have them tanking instead of another class they lose BS and that means they just lost ~30% of their DPS.  You now have yourself a fabulous paper tank.<br />
<br />
2- You want the Rogue to BS so you want the Shaman to tank now... can Shaman tank? Sure I guess but once again you are much better off with any other class tanking and let us do our job.  We aren't built to be tanks.<br />
<br />
There are a dozen different ways that you CAN group up with a rogue.  It just isn't the best idea.  Look through the boards on all the &quot;best duo member&quot; you won't (or shouldnt) find rogue in there.  It's all about min maxing.  If you want to have a pure DPS char have either a Necro, Wiz or Mage... but dont waste your mana you could be dotting with on healing a paper tank.  It's sort of like someone saying &quot;We want our chanter to tank Quarm can we do it?&quot;  Sure you could I guess with enough clerics... it just doesnt make sense that you would.<br />
<br />
The way Rogues are getting hosed right now, dont bother anyway, have them roll up a Paly or BL.  Rogues used to be big dps now they are blown away by bows that deal more damage while attacking from a distance, and casters that never run out of mana.  If I didnt have 3 years into my rogue I'd roll up another class in a heart beat.  As it is I'm giving it lots of thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">never had a problem PLing my beastlord using a guildees shaman using the shaman as the tank in pov/bot groups.  I would usually malos on the pull and slow immediately (he has TA), then I would stick bos and then bane on the mob and sithim there.  Never had to worry about agro the entire time, he always kept it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've found tainted breath to be awesome agro.  I've tried different combos of disempower, tainted breath, cripple, slow and Flagh of light and honestly just chain casting tainted breath between anything else I need to cast works best for me.<br />
<br />
It's fast, insane agro, you can't go oom chaining it =p, and there isn't a refresh other then typical spell refresh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I personally love borrowing my friend's rogue when I feel like two-boxing.  However, I'm a shaman.  The rogue is my bot.  A lot of people prefer to use the shaman as a bot.  That's thier problem, not mine. <br />
<br />
I can do the exact same thing I always do (tank things in teh face) with my shaman, except everything dies twice as fast while I spend 1/3 as much mana.  The biggest adjustment I make between duo and solo is keeping SLTW and FA memmed in the 2 spell slots I usually have BoU and Pox when soloing.  Coincidently the time it takes for Canni IV and backstab to refresh are really similar, so after the mob's slowed and dotted, it works really well to bounce back and forth between chars and canni/stab/canni/stab/etc.<br />
<br />
The biggest mob I've 2 boxed so far is The Insanity Crawler, which unfortunately I had to tank with the (somewhat lesser equipped) (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=770050) rogue because of the mana drain AE.  I'm really wishing he was ToSR flagged so I could farm some ornate patterns.  The mobs there are soloable, but I can't quite do it efficiently enough to make farming them worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Although Cripple, FoL, and Slow are great aggro...we are talking about a 65 Rogues DPS here.  I'm still skeptical about holding aggro w/o adding a poison to that and burning more mana.  Proxy aggro would work I guess tho, didn't really think about that :D<br />

<br />
Don't forget that rogues can evade.<br />
<br />
As I understand it, a successful evade check moves the rogue from the top of the aggro list to 1/2 way down on it.  So in a 2-3 character group, that should usually push the shammie to the top.<br />
<br />
I have seen this in action from time to time when I group with buddies that play a monk and a rogue; I usually end up tanking (unintensionally) if the monk FD's around the same time that the rogue evades.<br />
<br />
Add in slow aggro and a DoT, and you'll have NO problem at all keeping aggro off even a time-geared rogue that knows how to evade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Any rocue worth half his salt will know how to evade other wise by level65 they are dead even with a Warrior or other Tank class.  For duo purposes rogues are not bad at all.  The fill in the high DPS that we can only do with the addition of many Dots.  The key with them is you always have to keep the mobs backside towards them.  Which is not hard when your dropping a SLOW &amp; Poison Dot.  Disease Dot just dont have the agro generation that the Poison ones have.  If your Inny Troll you can use that handy snare neckless as well.  Basicly just treat the rogue as your second dog dog.  Though you have watch them just abit closer as they tend to get pissed if you sacrofice them on bad pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Evade works 66% of the time.<br />
on a successful evade the rogue will move from the top of the list to 1/2 way between 2nd and 3rd (making him number 2)<br />
<br />
evade used to drop you to the bottom of the list, and I mean bottom. on rallos I duo'd with a monk and some wizzy came to pk us at our camp while we had a mob, monk fd's, rogue evades, then we both go gank the wizzy whos getting pounded by the mob we were just fighting...ah I miss unnerfed evade.<br />
<br />
and shaman+rogue should be a sweet duo well into the 50's at some point the shaman will need much better than baz gear to tank anything. but with the right gear and the dps of a rogue I see no reason why a shaman couldnt tank all the way to 65 if you choose your zones right.<br />
<br />
as an example in potactics there are Frenzied initiates in the pit. these are flurrie mobs that often drop Sp's and are PH's for named mobs with real drops. with my shaman I can pull one into a tunnel, disroot/malos/slow/dot up with non root breakers load a new spell set with BoS/BoN/Ebolt, unleash the dogs on him and just dot/tank/root him down in a very very short period of time...the reason for this is because of the wanderer who will be back shortly. with Rogue dps added in it would be pull/malos/slow rogue starts tanking while you dot then step right up the thing would be dead in under 1min is my guess vrs the 2-3 ish it takes me now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">at some point the shaman will need much better than baz gear to tank anything. but with the right gear and the dps of a rogue I see no reason why a shaman couldnt tank all the way to 65 if you choose your zones right.<br />
<br />
Shammies solo just fine all the way to 65 with 'in teh face' tactics; adding a rogue wouldn't change this at all, except that it would go a lot faster.<br />
<br />
&lt;shrug&gt; I am in all bazaar gear, and I can tank most anything that hits for up to 350-ish or so, as long as it doesn't mitigate.  There are lots of zones that give reasonable exp at 65 with mobs below that max hit range.</div></div><hr />
