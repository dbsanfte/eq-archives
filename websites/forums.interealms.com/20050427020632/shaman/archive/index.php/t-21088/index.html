<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I tried Acrylia Caverns, but that's pretty much pointless with 55 dogdog, as he can't really hold his own even with Focus. The loot was decent on the few mobs I killed though.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if there were doable spots to get both exp and decent loot. 2400hp selfbuffed, about 1k AC, 209wis (my gear is pretty gimp).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seb is still OK exp at 60.  Good cash drops.  This is where I spent most of my solo time at 60 because it is easy and I needed the cash.<br />
<br />
Droga is not bad either but the goblins have high hitpoints and take a while to kill.  The good side is that they do not hit near as hard as the mobs in inner AC.  15 plat per mob plus the rare gem and items from the names.<br />
<br />
Where ever you go, if you have Torpor, just torpor tank for the dog.  You could also just slow, dot, dot root and leave the dog out of it.</div></div><hr />
