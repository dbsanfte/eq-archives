Looks good except for the part of not being able to wear the PvP armor you have earned if you drop in rank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks cool, just concerned about mudflation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some good, some bad. Good? Finally a reason.<br />
<br />
Bad? No penalty for dishonorable kills.<br />
<br />
Leveling up outdoors is now shutdown completely and totally.<br />
<br />
Groups are encouraged, roaming gank squads of 5 level 60's cutting down everything level 49 and up.<br />
<br />
Uber peeps and guilds now have even more of an anvantage.<br />
<br />
Rogues have a  huge, huge advantage :) Although, groups will be better exp getters than lone gankers, quicker, and do not have to pass up groups of 2-5.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So let me get this straight.  Five level 60's kill one level 49 and it's an &quot;honorable kill&quot;?<br />
<br />
What-the-fek-ever.<br />
<br />
Reminds me of the post I saw where somebody who apparently was on the test server saw a caster cast a spell while moving. Said poster then wanted casters &quot;nerfed.&quot;<br />
<br />
A follow-up poster pointed out that there are such things as 'insta-cast' spells.  Then this gem.<br />
<br />
&quot;And these are the people testing the software? WTG Blizzard.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ya faern, the &quot;honor&quot; system basically will encourage roaming hordes of level 60's to totally clean out the people trying to get some exp from level 49-60. I cannot imagine Azsahara, plaguelands, etc.<br />
<br />
Rogues will still be good, but they are slow to find targets, and have to pass up small groups, where 5 level 60's wander at will mowing everything down, untill they run into a group of level 60's. People are pretty much cowards too, they will run away from a challenge.<br />
<br />
One of the best ways to get &quot;honor&quot; will be to camp high level windriders, and pick people off one at a time, always a different person, usually high level. Alliance numbers now will really, really be coming into play here, a 1.7 to 1 advantage is huge.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All I can say is....still glad I play on a PVE/carebare/blueby/whatever-you-wish-to-call-it server. At least I won't have to deal with those roaming  honorable-kill-seeking-groups-of-ganker-deathsquads.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you folks on PVP servers. Hope you find a way to avoid the inherant pitfalls of this system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Honorable kill incentive will work both ways though.   It will encourage &quot;gank squads&quot;, but it will also encourage people to actually group up and stop them.  Plus im sure you would get an extremely small and neglible reward for killing a person 11 levels lower with a 5 man group.<br />
<br />
What I think is lacking is a penalty for dying.  You don't have to be the best PvPer to be on top of the charts, just the most active.  Also, I hope the rankings are seperated by class.  There is no use for a paladin or druid in trying to compete on the same ladder as a rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On a good note though valgoth, the pvp servers will have the high ranking badasses. I cannot even imagine how you would do it on a pve server, where every fight is one you agree to if you have the advantage.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds are limited, cannot be in them all the time.<br />
<br />

<br />
sure there is, groups. Groups will be able to farm much more xp then a single rogue, believe me, you want to kill and kill alot, groups are the way to go, and they get exp bonus, don't even have to do damage, just be in group. Here a paladin will shine, absolutely shine, all they have to do is live, which they are awesome at. If anything, they are lucky as hell. last man standing gets more points :)<br />

<br />
Hadn't thought about this.  I agree though, this will suck massively.  It's a good reason to either PL to 60, or stay at lvl 48 where you still die, but they get jack for it.</div></div><hr />

This is pretty much how I'm thinking about it as well.  My first reaction was that the deathsquads at the PL WR will now be there constantly, but there is now some incentive to group up and take them down.<br />
<br />
One other problem -- the &quot;disincentive&quot; to camping a corpse is a reduced bonus.  That isn't much of a disincentive.  People corpse camp *now* for no bonus -- giving them something, anything, to corpse camp will exacerbate it, I think, even if it is a reduced reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On the bright side Serepi, all you have to do as a priest is stay alive, and let the rest of the group kill those focused on you :) You know they are going to go straight to you.<br />
<br />
People hate rogues though too, we inspire a visceral hatred deep in their bellies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe, you should hear it, even in my guild, with a rogue as one of the badass people, when somone sees a rogue in chat, it is always &quot;I hate rogues, im killing them&quot;.<br />
<br />
Too many ganker rogues out there. Besides, being hated on a message board is like being hated by a piece of paper.</div></div><hr />
