I have maxed crits with FOA and my bow crits over 100 fights is 32% I have bought GoF1 and don't notice much differece so not sure how good 2 or 3 will be, I did punishing blade 1 and its pretty cool doing a tripple attack, and since our dps is greater 2hs then duel weilding I think im going to  buy more here. (Claw of vz, and light woods blade-primal claidmore) havent done planer power but I will. Got headshot and its kind of a joke at 2% vs 47 and under greenies<br />
Anyhow plz let me know what is benifical and what is a waste<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cujoy</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*sigh* I'm only disapointed in GoF, I've been using it since day 1 of PooP, and the only downside is it's an ability but the illusion makes you KoS to things cause you're in wolf form. So if I'm just doing simple exp in PoV and pull some skellies anywhere near a frog and I pop GoF, I agro half the friggen zone. Don't know if this is intended but you would think that the time limit and reuse time is enough of a penalty for a ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It works great in NToV however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elmarnieh</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats the downside to it, but on the good side it bugs wolfform so you can be in wolfofrm in zones your normally KOS to it in.  ( Long as you canf ind a place to cast wolfform adhit GoF to bug it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i love that bug, use it often to get the wolf form boost without the kos illusion.  (longer lasting faster sow also)<br />
<br />
but I think they should change the GoF to use a non-kos wolf form, it's a short term combat AA, it shouldn't get the illusion faction mod like the long lasting versions do.</div></div><hr />

Scarecrow illusion had faction modifiers yanked pretty fast when it made things easier for players.  Now our PoP aaxp has a negative effect that prevents it from being used in most of the places that rangers hunt in these days, and verant does jack all about it.</div></div><hr />
