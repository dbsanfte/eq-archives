<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Veser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So has anyone done this recently? Reading through other epic threads is making me believe its not possible anymore.<br />
<br />
I've done everything up through getting the tear from fear. There is an epic shaman that is willing to multi quest the tear for me.<br />
<br />
After the MQ, I need to do the extra faction work. Is there any of the previous steps that I can still do to make up the faction?<br />
<br />
Which ones and how many times?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes. It works. Do the ghiosk part a few times for faction, it seems to be the easiest (save for the 2.5 hour repop time on reavers, but you can go around killing the other reavers/exping until Ghiosk's pops.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Larbonal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It does work, i did it recently for another shaman in my guild, just make sure you have MAX ally faction before turning in the last piece to the wolf in EJ</div></div><hr />
