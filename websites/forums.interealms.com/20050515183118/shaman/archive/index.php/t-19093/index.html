<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, so I'm sitting on the crapper today reading another thread where tons of people are complaining about their class, the game, etc. (what, you mean you guys don't print out Crucible threads and read them on the crapper?), and I had an epiphany.  Heck, I'll even go as far as calling it a prophecy.  <br />
<br />
Why not tie an alternate means of PoP planar progression into LDoN success?<br />
<br />
Think about it... SoE once again locks out all of the tier 2 and 3 zones they opened up.  Everyone who's not properly flagged   starts once again with access to the standard 4 tier 1 zones.  Then they open up some flagging system where you can just LDoN it for access to higher level planes!<br />
<br />
Now, we want this to be a timesink, so let's make a little list here on what the requirements would be, shall we?<br />
<br />
Storms / Valor / Decay  = 50 successful regular LDoN adventures, or 10 successful Hard Adventures<br />
<br />
HoH / BoT / Torment = 100 successful regular LDoN adventures, or 20 successful Hard Adventures<br />
<br />
Tactics = 150 successful regular LDoN adventures, or 30 successful Hard Adventures<br />
<br />
Sol Ro's Tower = 200 successful regular LDoN adventures, or 40 successful Hard Adventures<br />
<br />
And, the kicker... <br />
<br />
Elemental Planes = 75 Hard LDoN adventures, with at least a minimum success rate of 60%.  If you don't have the proper success rate, you much continue to win until your success rate is 60%.  <br />
<br />
Plane of Time = There's no access to Time using LDoN, because that would be dumb.  <br />
<br />
Look!  I solved everyone's PoP problems!  Now you don't need to join some horrible uber guild to get there, all you need is 5 dedicated friends to get into the elemental planes!  <br />
<br />
Is it a timesink?  Sure is!  <br />
<br />
Does it make &quot;story&quot; sense?  Heck no!  <br />
<br />
Would it incite 50 more threads about how people can't find enough LDoN groups, and how much that sucks because &quot;I'm a solo'er and I hate people&quot;?  ABSOLUTELY!<br />
<br />
But c'mon... show me a GOOD reason why it wouldn't work :)  At least it's better than some freakin' charm-slot augment upgrade.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tune in tomorrow on &quot;See How Dumb You Talk&quot; for my ideas on fixing class balance... or as I like to call it &quot;Yhakfiend's report on the Norrathian Communist movement&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why should you be rewarded doubly for doing ldon adventures?<br />
<br />
I think you fail to see the ironic twist in the requirements list.  Think about it really, really hard.  <br />
<br />
But for the sake of humoring your argument... what does it matter?  It's not like PoP or LDoN are going to be the &quot;latest and greatest&quot; after next month, anyway.  Also, it forces customers to buy LDoN for an alternate means of progressing in PoP... which equals more money for the rich guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think I fail to see the ironic twist as well...  Anyway, I wouldn't mind if they did this, since I'm not flagged for higher planes atm (have Valor/Storms/Decay/HoH/Bot/Tactics, as I recall), but then again, I don't do tons of LDoN either, so it'd be a while before I got into anything new. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ironic twist is that it would be very, very, very, very, very, very, very, (heck, one more) VERY impressive for someone w/o elemental planes-type gear and/or general game knowledge to tack down 75 Hard LDoN adventures with a 60% success rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, a couple of days ago I had my 1st attempt at hard LDoN...  We failed the 1st one by about 5 minutes (we were very conservative at the start, since we'd read the horror stories), and beat the second one by 20 mins.  This is with both of the healers 2-boxing as well.  Obviously, I couldn't say for sure based on just 2 adventures, but I think I could get into elementals with that system. ;)<br />
<br />
Note: This is a group I play with ALL the time, so we prety much know what we're all going to do before we do it, which I'm sure helps a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would have to agree with the guy saying it awards you for playing ldon twice. If I really wanted too I coulda racked up 200 wins long before I ever get solro access the regular way (finally two flags away now (RD + MM)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would have to agree with the guy saying it awards you for playing ldon twice.

<br />
Okay, since I have the day off and all the time in the world, let's revise!<br />
<br />
To keep LDoN adventures from being double-rewarded, let's make the flag a purchased object.  Sort of like, the &quot;sneaky key&quot; to planar access.  <br />
<br />
Now, we'd have to split the earned points into 2 pools - regular and hard.  Shouldn't be a problem... it stays the way it is with normal adventure merchant purchases, and we'll just throw in one more merchant in each camp who's selling PoP access.  You'll have to have sufficient points pooled from either regular or hard adventures to &quot;buy&quot; the flag.  Considering they already have a system in place to &quot;score&quot; regular and hard wins and winning percentage, we're already half-way there.  <br />
<br />
So now we stand at:<br />
<br />
Storms / Valor / Decay  = 2550 Normal adventure points OR 1040 Hard adventure points<br />
<br />
HoH / BoT / Torment  = 2550 Normal adventure points OR 1040 Hard adventure points, with the pre-requisite Storms / Valor / Decay flag<br />
<br />
Tactics  = 2550 Normal adventure points OR 1040 Hard adventure points, with the pre-requisite HoH / BoT / Torment flag<br />
<br />
Sol Ro's Tower  = 2550 Normal adventure points OR 1040 Hard adventure points, with the pre-requisite Tactics flag<br />
<br />
And finally... <br />
<br />
Elemental Planes  = 3640 Hard Adventure points, with the winning percentage kept in place, and the pre-requisite Sol Ro's Tower flag<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, since getting to 65 in Tier 1 PoP is a PITA, of course we'll have to take lower-level points-per-victory into consideration for tier 2 flags.  But I'm okay with keeping the Tier 3 and above flags level 65 only.  Heck you could even make this &quot;purchasable flag&quot; an all/all any slot augment with a minimum level of 65.  I say this because if you start at level 50 in LDoN, by the time you earn 5100 normal adventure points you should've leveled quite a bit.  <br />
<br />
Let's keep speculating guys, I want to hear more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally I dont see why everyone wants so much to get into Elementals.  Sure, per mob, they are a bit more xp.  But if you dont have the dps / good tank, it certainly isnt better xp overall.  So, again why is everyone so insistant into getting EP access?  Why aren't there threads about letting everyone into VP, ST, and VT?  Those are restricted zones too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think it's a mistake to have one expansion (LDON) tied to progression in a totally different expansion (PoP).  They already have alternate ways to get into Tactics, CoD, and HoH so why add more ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It would be rather easier to aquire a tactics key through quest and then buy the solro key this way. Maybe if you had to spend 1000-1500k per flag needed for solro then you'd have the price closer. MM, HoH trials, carpin, bert, KoS, Saryn, all the previous flags, and I'm sure I'm missing some more.<br />
<br />
Still I'd have to agree with the previous guy. Doesn't make sense to tie PoP progression to ldon. You want to buy your VT key too? The ammount of time I've spent on emp keys and VT shards for my characters and guildies I could probably be 30+ wins in each camp and then some.</div></div><hr />

Because they are sooo easy to get to. You click you're in pon, you click, you're in pov, you click you're in HOH, you click says you can't and you're like why not I'm right here.. But who runs to vp entrance or sees it daily and tries to click and isn't able to get in and thinks damn why..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>zyzygy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">interesting idea.  a few comments:<br />
<br />
<br />
i think sol ro access should be limited to hard adventure wins only.  it's honestly a very hard flag to get (i mean, u need a WHOLE lot of flags, and it's a really big step from bot/hoh;  elementals is only 1 kill away after solro access in comparison).  i think a success rate requirement should be implemented.  i'd say 60%.<br />
<br />
and i think elemental access should have an increased success rate requirement.  i'd say 80%.  since elemental mobs hit about as hard as ldon hard mobs (for xp mobs less for the most part, but some (pofire picnic table red cons) hit the same), the toon in question should be able to handle similarly difficult mobs with a high success rate.  over 60% in any case</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">First off, not sure why people are so eager to get into the elemental planes.  I know that I'm not... heck, I'm too lazy for that kinda' intensity.  <br />
<br />
Basically, I started the thread out of 1) boredom, and 2) instigation :)<br />
<br />
As far as tying one expansion to another, it's been done many times before with simple quests and what not.  Epic quests, Spirit of Garzikor, Strength of the Elements, HIE mask, even those little PoK quests to turn in crap for exp.  This is different, yes, because of the direction of LDoN and how things are accomplished, but not that far fetched.  <br />
<br />
As far as the flagging progression goes, there are 2 good ideas here.  One would be like Darkpaw said, make the person &quot;Buy&quot; each flag for 1-1.5K in the exact order they need to be flagged in actual PoP flagging... OR... they could just make the LDoN purchasable flags exempt from alternate flagging quests already in-game.  IE, if you want to buy your Sol Ro flag, you must BUY (not quest) the LDoN tier 2, 3, and Tactics flags.  <br />
<br />
As far as buying VT shards, etc.... no, I don't even want to go in that direction.  This was strictly meant to deal with the ongoing outcry for the &quot;enormous injustice&quot; of locking 50% of the PoP expansion to raid-guilds only(*note sarcasm here).  The reasoning is that the people who argue this concept would now be given an alternate pass, other than the simple little quests that have already nearly ruined Tactics on most servers.  All of the horrors of time-sinks and redundancy are still there, as they were for most back-flagging trial-and-error Elemental enabled guilds... just in a different, sinfully disguised way.  <br />
<br />
But let's discuss a little more.  Would any current Ele-enabled people feel uncomfortable about having a group of 6 people who've bested 75 hard LDoN adventures gain access to the elemental planes, strictly on a skill-based argument?  Or better yet, how many people in your guild who are currently Ele-enabled do you think could pull off 75 hard LDoN victories?<br />
<br />
Need... more... input... please...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Nope.  I am not elemental geared, Vex Thall geared or Ssra geared,and Neither are my guildmates.  I could have this done in under a month.  Same goes for most anyone who is 65 and has a few skilled friends.  You overestimate the difficulty of hard adventures.   I spose it would be nice to have some sort of motivation to get on the LDoN hampster wheel night after night, but this in no way approaches the difficulty of the current requirement:  Grummus, Terris, MB, Saryn, VZ, TZ, HoH trials, Mith Marr, Agnaar, RZ.  Not by a long shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I don't think this idea makes any sense.  <br />
<br />
I'm ok with some level of flagging required, but the sheer number is stupid game design in my opinion.  Eliminate 3/4 of them.  <br />
<br />
People can't see shades of gray for some reason on this board.  Just because a very limited number of zones in the past had restricted access doesn't mean that PoP's design is a good design.  <br />
<br />
I think PoP's design of zone access blows, and it's stupid.  I'm Sol Ro enabled now, and I got all the Sol Ro minis done, and I still think the design is stupid and trumpeting that raiding = skill is crap.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just finished building a snowman with the kids, and it looks like I have a few more responses.<br />
<br />
Juventus - I think you may have misunderstood what I meant by &quot;someone w/o elemental planes-type gear and/or general game knowledge&quot;, so I'll try and explain... in reverse order, of course.  <br />
<br />
The single largest complaint I see most ele-enabled people have with opening up the Ele-planes is the inexperience and sheer stupidity of some of the people who would be zoning in.  I've read many posts that compare it to &quot;KC/Velks/BoT all over again&quot;.  By requiring people to complete (with some fair amount of success) a number of Hard LDoN adventures, it almost serves as a test to whether or not they can handle the mobs that await them in the Elemental Planes.  <br />
<br />
Another large complaint (although more aimed at the tank/melee audience) is that people who have sub-par gear would not survive in the Ele-planes.  Granted, you don't have Ele/VT/Ssra gear, but you do have a pretty nice collection of Ornate and other little trinkets that put you just a bit above the average joe.  Combine that with some above-average game knowledge, and I don't doubt at all that you'd be comfortable with the encounters.  <br />
<br />
As far as the difficulty of the flagging encounters, of course there's no comparison.  But essentially, flagging isn't the same today as it was a year ago.  I see morons that I wouldn't trust in a PoV outer cave group being pulled through back-flagging sessions everyday by local uber-guilds who are (still) trying to fill critical roster holes in preperation for Time and/or GoD.  That doesn't necessarily mean these people have the skill or brains to not do dumb **** in the Ele-planes, it just means that they got lucky to ride the coat-tails of someone else's accomplishment.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Karshak_rn - All I'm trying to do is create some imaginary way that Elemental Planes access can be earned by those individuals who aren't capable of being in a raid guild.  Everything is make believe, just an argument for argument's sake.  But from your response, can you honestly say that someone who's skilled enough to complete 75 Hard LDoN missions can't handle the Elemental Planes?  Or is your argument strictly &quot;I did it so you should have to, too&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
Asta Khaan - It's the way the game is... no way for SoE to un-screw you now.  Bottling it up inside won't make things better, just let it go.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gart Egilsson - I can't argue with your opinion about PoP flag progression, but it is the way it is.  Why again does this idea not make any sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't think it's such a bad idea for the Tier 2 Planes, but I wouldn't want to see people getting access to Tier 3/4 by doing adventures.  I would like to see them implement the old PoP flagging system again and let the people who actually know how to play their toons take advantage of the XP hot spots.  EPs should be left to the people who put the time and effort into flagging for it.  Otherwise it will just be another BoT/PoV IMO.<br />
<br />
Spraggon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Adonnisninaste - The only problem with that is Tier 2 planes have already been opened to the public (albeit with the level requirement) to some time.  I doubt they'd go through the trouble of implementing anything like this for something that's already been attended to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You just missed the key reason this would never happen and, oddly enough, why Time won't get true instancing:  There is NO competition for LDoN adventures!<br />
<br />
NO potential for cockblocking!<br />
NO days when &quot;there just ain't nuthin up&quot;!<br />
NO camping!<br />
NO trains!<br />
NO having to force 70 of your closest friends to redo the same mindless ring event over and over and over because your guildy had to have an appendix removed and missed a flag!<br />
<br />
In short, your solution falls far short of the SOE Grief Requirement(tm) and is lacking several magnitudes of pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yhakfiend, my answer was more tongue in cheek about ldon, coupled with a sense of irritation at yet another thread of folks wanting elemental access without doing anything other than grinding to get it. Grinding is part of eq, but there is more to life than taking stuff down in a group.<br />
<br />
I do not believe that the elementals should be opened up to the masses. That is my opinion, and I felt the same before I even considered apping with a guild that was progressing. Throughout all the raids, etc. my viewpoint has not altered.<br />
<br />
I am a viewpoint army of 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I am all for figuring out a way to avoid backflagging yawnfests where loot rots - that just seems a waste for those guilds still working at killing those mobs for loot and flags. It would be nice to have some sort of global flag for a given guild, but that may be taking it too far.  Some guy logging in with a guild tag after a 1 year hiatus and finding himself time flagged doesn't seem fair either.  Ditto on newly tagged people.<br />
<br />
 I just have problems with SoE messing with the reward system of the game on such a fundamental level.  It devalues the work required to obtain the rewards, and in doing so, devalues most everything about the game.  Loot, raiding skill, game knowledge etc all become less valuable.</div></div><hr />
