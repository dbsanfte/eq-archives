I say .. GREAT ! No offence intended but honestly if your not havin fun , Quit . I how WoW is as good for you as you expect it too be . In fact if 50% of the people on EQ quit EQ ... my guild could get more MOBS !!! <br />
I dont mean this too be insulting in any way . I really hope that you guys that are quitin find what you are lookin for .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">To be realistic there is no serious competition to EQ as yet. WoW may become competition if all the hype and reports come true plus Warcraft has been around a long time so has many followers.<br />
<br />
For all its faults EQ isn't doing badly after almost 5 years live and there are many people like myself who while we can propose sensible changes to the game still play it and have done since release.<br />
<br />
I made Pumyr in '99 and while there are problems that I feel need addressing unless something much better comes along I doubt I will quit EQ in favor of another game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think FF can easily be considered serious competition.  It would be a hell of a lot more serious if it actually had any kind of significant advertising/hype buildup too =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Server pop is dying off.  I think the full gear server transfer is what's leading the charge.    There are other servers that don't have the amout  of Drama we have and thus easier to raid.<br />
<br />
You have to Give TR props. ATM they are the best guild (ok I think they are) in EQ.   Then you have My guild which is also tops.  Other guilds will raid later then us and most stuff is dead or dying.  It can be frustrating.<br />
<br />
Guess people need some breathing rooom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes Lineage has millions playing.  Wired  magazine ran an article on the game and the South Korean culture ( Bangs  which are internet cafes, the leader / follower paradigm of Lineage), the cable wiring of Seoul and the fact that video games are TELEVISED in S. Korea.<br />
<br />
FFXI has a slew of people playing (I &quot; heard &quot; 1 million, but can't remember the source) also. <br />
<br />
I doubt EQ is &quot;dying&quot; but certainly it has its quirks. Until Sony releases honest data on the number of new subscribers versus accounts / separate household accounts, it's all speculation.<br />
<br />
(Note I qualified the account statement because of Dark Age of No Content's change in wording.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That report from FFXI was that there were 1 million characters created, not 1 million player accounts.<br />
<br />
Last I heard though, Square was claiming 500,000 active accounts between Japan and the US (400,000 Japan, 100,000 US)... that would make it the number 2 behind Lineage, and EQ number 3.<br />
<br />
Assuming those numbers are true.<br />
<br />
Remember... AOL reported subscribers as number of people taking advantage of the free months/hours + actual paying subscribers.<br />
<br />
Each of these companies probably stretches the truth as far as they can without lying, to say how many accounts they have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Gotta chuckle b/c SOE implemented full-gear char transfers as a money maker.  Secondary result was a get-out-of-jail free card for Stormhammer guilds paying higher fees who want to keep their guild together.<br />
<br />
150 people (low?) in a stormhammer guild all paying $39.95 a month = $5,992 a month or $71,910 a year.<br />
<br />
150 server transfers = $11,250.<br />
<br />
150 people paying flat monthly subscription at $12.95 a month = $1942.5 a month or $23,310 a year.<br />
<br />
So in the first year incl the transfer fee SOE loses $37,350.<br />
Every year after that they lose $48,600.<br />
<br />
Haha that makes me laugh.  Financial genius.</div></div><hr />

I don't think EQ is dieing it has a strong community following, and not many people want to invest time from level 1 again or make new friends on a new game. And EQ is strong in providing content and advancement options. GoD will be lapped up by a certain audience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Both good and bad --<br />
<br />
Good because I have some people to kill when I'm bored(They have no skill to speak of, just some decent gear.<br />
<br />
Bad because when I'm raiding or xping, they train me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The problem is not that EQ is dying, it is simply reaching End of Life. I mean as new players stop comming eventually there will come a time when more people leave then join. You can't play the same game forever, at some point you will get bored. The friendships people make seem to be the only thing keep high level people with everything in game, and eventually, they realize they can do that via IM and save some cash.<br />
<br />
EQ isn't dying, its just old. WoW will have the same problem, so will every other MMORPG. The question is how long with the other games lives be. EQ has done great so far, but all good things can go on forever. Just relax and enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I don't know if it's dying. But it is Old. and BTW that wasn't the topic!!<br />

I've been hearing similar things since I started playing in 2000.  It has been 4 years and the sky hasn't fallen yet.  I'll start to worry when they start closing servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I will say this,<br />
<br />
I don't know about Stormhammer.<br />
<br />
However, last Saturday night I was playing my 46 Rogue and I decided to do a who all for places to group.<br />
<br />
/who all 45 &quot;There are 9 players in Everquest&quot;<br />
/who all 46 &quot;There are 11 players in EverQuest&quot;<br />
/who all 47 &quot;There are 9 players in Everquest&quot;<br />
/who all 48 &quot;There are 8 players in Everquest&quot;<br />
<br />
These numbers are shocking.  Granted it doesn't count the druids who are anon or role, but over 4 levels there were less than 40 players in the game on my server!<br />
<br />
That tells me that people arn't leveling up new characters.<br />
<br />
The newb population is dwindling, and when that happens you can find no groups pre end game.  Thus the game dies for you unless your 65 or have a few boxes to PL with.<br />
<br />
I am finding it harder and harder to get a group with my Rogue.  The only groups I can find are LDoN, and that is just pathetic.<br />
<br />
I really do believe that EQ is on a downword slope, and im not stickin around for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Do a /who all 65 cleric druid, shaman, or any other class.  You will see the people that are keeping EQ alive and will continue to do so for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The point is if theres nobody to group with pre 65 then everything other than your end game ubers is dead.<br />
<br />
Have fun playing the same class forever.<br />
<br />
I won't be doing it.<br />
<br />
I left this game once for over a year and I don't have a problem leaving it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I've been hearing similar things since I started playing in 2000.  It has been 4 years and the sky hasn't fallen yet.  I'll start to worry when they start closing servers.<br />
<br />
<br />
I actually started playing in november 2002, If I recall correctly. When my baby shaman was growing up, I remember the furious fights for Dawnshroud Camps, Echo caverns was chock full of people, Luclin was filled to the brim period. Old world stuff like HHK, even EVERFROST, the newbiest of newbie zones never had less than 20 people there. Now there are 10 in HHK, and 15 in Everfrost. And all 15 of those are level 65 waiting for a LDoN.<br />
<br />
As a relatively new ex-Everquest player I can assure you that the amount of new players is on a severe, severe downward trend. And what a previous poster said is really correct; at some point the new players will be less than players quitting. We just hit that point. I thoroughly believe that graph of everquest population, but this trend is one that hasn't spanned more than a month and a half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">It's not in a downward trend, people don't go to old world xp zones for xp much anymore.  They go to the xp campes like Dawnshroud, Acrylia, Paludal etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Like I said, luclin is vacant. There are no more than a dozen or so of below-clvl65 ldon's going on at any given time. Its hard to be a character that is anything but level 65. Its hostile to newbs, period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The stats at www.luclin.org tell a pretty painful tale.  Few toons under lvl 65.  Probably 2/3's of the ones that are are twinks of bored high level people.  I wish these type of stats were available for all servers, kudos to whoever runs that site.<br />
<br />
The sky may not be falling, but I think it's heading into twilight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">EQ is definitely facing a maturity plateau that will develop into a decline of population soon.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the game's health, there will always be people who retire for personal reasons - money, bored, no time, etc.  These people take their toons with them for the most part.  Hence, decline of established user base.<br />
<br />
Add to this the difficulty of leveling new characters without systematic power-leveling... i.e., no groups available for the average new character.  This equates to a decline of new users.<br />
<br />
With a decline in new blood and a loss of old blood, the population is then depending upon existing players to expand into multiple accounts.  This has happened a fair amount in the past but is fast becomming saturated.  The existing player base that wishes to multi-box has pretty much already aquired these accounts and have created these characters.<br />
<br />
With GoD, you see again a focus on 55+ (SoE's words from yesterday's online chat) and no more focus on the newbs.  This goes to illustrate that SoE recognizes that for this game to survive they will need to keep their high level players happy rather than trying to entice NEW players into the game.<br />
<br />
What this translates to is that the game is developing leaks... Sony recognizes this and are attempting to stick their fingers in the holes to prevent as much loss as possible.  They throw bones to the high end players in the form of uber gear, abilities, and expansions in the hope that this will stem the flow... only time will tell whether it is effective or not.  Regardless, once a fighter is pushed back onto their heels and goes into a defensive posture, the fight is lost.<br />
<br />
EQ IS dieing... how quickly it does so is unknown... but it's matured and the players that made it great are looking to new pastures or have left the gaming community all together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">With rocket leveling these days, even new people don't develop a bond with each other.  Marginal differences in play time translate into level gaps that preclude grouping.<br />
<br />
That's a bit different from what it used to be.  <br />
<br />
That said, watching my 8 year old start to play was an eye-opener.  They have been most effective in introducing the game, and it's clearly better designed at the early levels than it was 5 years ago when I started.</div></div><hr />

That is an interesting site.  I ran a search for characters between 2-45 (I excluded 1's to see if I could get rid of some of the obvious bazaar mules) seen in the last 30 days.  There were 7095, which seems to be a decent amount - of course I have nothing to compare it to.  When I bumped it up to 2-60 I got 10568.   That doesnt' seem like few to me - of course I would have to monitor it to determine if the numbers are declining steadily, which I don't have a lot of inclination to do.<br />
<br />
I think there have always been a lot of twinks, albeit that much earlier in the game they were twinks of people who were frustrated by hell levels and super slow leveling.  So they weren't twinks of bored high level people, they were twinks of bored mid level people.  Of course, there was very little to do at level 60 either, no AA's, so no use for experience - basically if raiding wasn't your thing you quit or made twinks.</div></div><hr />
