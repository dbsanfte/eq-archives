<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My group has been working this place for the last 2 days, and it's treated us pretty well.  2 melee have picked up Rhyolite Tear of Thralldom (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26152) but I'm still waiting on my Fractured Obsidian Band (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26061).<br />
<br />
Was wondering if anyone had any luck getting spells off the named in Barindu.  My group is having a hard time taking them down, but would be nice to get a copy off one of them.  I understand the drops have been exceedingly rare, we talking 1 in 20 killls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they just nerfed spell farming from the trails...named mobs no longer spawn right on entry to the trail...from what the patch said at least.<br />
i have heard that spells can drop in barindu, i can not first hand confurm that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Barindu isn't a trial zone. They were refering to the Sewers and Vxed. Those named will no longer be up upon recieving a mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm...how hard is Barindu compared to say, Ferubi or hard ldon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The main names you will be able to target are wanderers in the CY.  Most of the others I am aware of have some semi-scripted fighting involved or hit way too hard for any standard Gates exp group.<br />
<br />
  Fair chance at Daluda off of a rare wanderer that paths right across the entrance to the Pyramid with Sewers entrance.   Aneuk Overseer or something like that is the name.  And I think that the Kyv wanderer has a chance at Nihil, but am not certain on remembering that properly atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">how hard are these named mobs?(max hit? slowable? hp? ramp/flurry? proc?)<br />
<br />
<br />
can a rog/cham duo beat them?<br />
<br />
how rare are the drops from trash mobs?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
clearly: is it a better way to aquire stuff compared to hard ldon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The named hit for around 1024 I believe.  They are partial slowable, they summon, they rampage and flurry.  I'm not sure on the hitpoints, since I hardly do any damage when fighting these guys (just debuff and heal).  They proc that soul claw proc or whatever it's called.  The good news is they are mezzable, so you can mezz on incoming and debuff the lights out of em.  Make sure you use cripple.  Have your nukers/dotters continue to cast toward end of fight, even when mob is low, cause the warrior mobs proc a rune/mitigation-thingy at the end.<br />
Oh and no on the duo, bring a good group.<br />
<br />
In 4 nights we had 3 of the melee earrings drop, but no caster rings.  In general, the mobs are tougher than Hard LDoN's, but pulling is not an issue in Barindu, 100% singles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Are the comments on Alla's right re: those earrings dropping from regular trash mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep can personally vouch for the Ryholite Tear earring dropping off &quot;trash&quot; mobs.  We got better loot from them than from the named.</div></div><hr />
