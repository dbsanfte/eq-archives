<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just looking for some feedback about when people think a guild has made iot to the point that they are ready for NToV.<br />
<br />
Is there a defining named that once downed, well that's it we can head to NToV now? Or perhaps just a feeling throughout the guild that it's time to try NToV?<br />
<br />
I realize this is a totally subjective question / topic, but I just thought I'd throw it out there for peeps to throw in their 2cps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We rotate NToV on my server.  In order to get in you are required to kill the 3 velious kings to get a shot.<br />
<br />
IF you can kill Aaryonar you can kill anything in NToV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not necessarily, Vyemm is a bit tougher than aary :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>pwredby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">signs that u are ready for NTOV.<br />
<br />
If the following are Trivial to your guild, then you should attemp NTOV:<br />
<br />
1) Hall of Testing (TOV)<br />
2) Derek the Vindicator (KAEL)<br />
3) Velkator the Soceror (VELKS)<br />
4) Lendi, Gozzem, all the west tov named (West TOV)<br />
5) Ikitar the venom (past NTOV door) <br />
6) Eashen of the Sky (past NTov door)<br />
<br />
<br />
Then like the above post saids. If you can do aryoonar (how ever u spell it, we call him ROY). Then you are definately ready. Just train you tanks to off tank them flurry drakes w/o dying and you should be fine. ROY is probably the hardest one out off all the NTOV dragons, besides maybe Vyemm he's a little tricky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you read up on strats, make sure everyone understands the strats, and have a couple of clerics onhand, then any guild can do NToV, honestly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Roy hardest?<br />

/ponders<br />
<br />
Offtank flurries?<br />
<br />
/ponders what suckass pullers you have<br />
<br />
Crazy stuff. Only hard thing about roy is getting the frickin chickens out of the way, and that's more a pain in the ass than actually difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd say Aaryonar is definately the test mob to do NTOV, he's just past ikiatar and eashan.  Good placement, balanced push, and a decent CH chain are needed to take him out.  If you can get him the rest of NToV.  Lady Nev and Vyemm were the other two harder ones.  Worst case, you just get a necro and some epic rez's, I'd say give it a run and see how it goes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my guidl is also thinken takeing that plunge..  so far everyone i talked to says we could handle just about anything in NToV..  <br />

Sont and Aary are very different fights.  Sont is almost like a PoP encounter, kill it as fast as possible before he AEs your raid to death.  People will die while engaging Sont.  Nothing you can do about it.  Aary is completly different.  Out for engaging him 4 times, we did him with no deaths, twice.  <br />
<br />
If you can do Sont routinly, then you shouldnt have a problem w/ Aary.    Aary is just about placement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Aayonar is slowable, therefore you shouldnt have a problem once you get him slowed/keep him slowed.  Its all about positioning.<br />
Vyemm on the other hand is only disease slowable, and with an annoying ae.<br />
<br />
If you can get passed aayonar, go right side in ntov, Lord Fesk, Dagarn, and Lord Kiez are all really easy compared Vyemm.<br />
<br />
The hardest part of ntov is the flurries, gotta have clerics who pay attention and that are on the ball.</div></div><hr />

Been searching online for NToV strategy guides but all my searches end up at different guild websites saying what they took down or what they wiped on. No strategy for NToV found yet. Does anyone have any ideas or a url / website to check. Much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">NToV is really easy with lvl65 players; you are ready for NtoV when :<br />
<br />
1, your guild can easily kill Vindi<br />
2, your guild have constant 20-30+ people online with at lease 3 clerics<br />
3, member's average lvl62+; if no you need 30's members to raid NtoV<br />
<br />
after killed Vindi, just try farm any ToV dragon(West, HoT, Ikitar, Eashen); and try Aary or deeper NtoV name; once you killed them first time, it is lots easier next time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">here is a guide i dug up a while ago, didn't write it myself... just a copy and paste job. Enjoy<br />
<br />
Lenardo's Guide to North Temple of Veeshan <br />
<br />
you've done Hot to death <br />
you've killed west wing dragons, killed vindicator, and its time to dip your fingers into north temple of veeshan for the next step your guild makes <br />
<br />
things you need - good resist gear. <br />
<br />
Instant clickies for your casters and to block the debuff <br />
extended range focus items help ALOT as well. <br />
<br />
Voice of the Serpent, GET THEM FOR YOUR BARDS- that is all-no it is not on allakhazams. ask your bards if they do not know about it, have them find out about it. <br />
<br />
back to the guide: <br />
<br />
first off - how do you get there? <br />
<br />
if you are nonkos, <br />
from the center hub go north thru the door, take an immediate right and hug the right wall, when you are almost to the door infront of you, take a left, line yourself up with the right side of the stairs and go up open door, run down, take a right and up the ramp and you are there, done right you do not aggro anything - being invis helps some but not much. <br />
<br />
bringing the rest of the raid..... nonkos magician with CoH&amp; LOTS of pearls. <br />
<br />
the chickens are on cov faction so if you are nonkos until you start killing things, you are safe up the ramp. <br />
<br />
so your magician is at the top of ramp , but your entire raid is KoS, what do you do? <br />
<br />
first off have all monks necros and SK's feign death and then summon them to the raid, rogues should be invisible -summon them as well, then once you have a group or two set. summon a cleric or two - invisible- group them with the FD/invisible people and kill about 1/3rd of the way down the corridor towards aary - since you will only have to kill 3 chickens(minidrakes) if you kill there. <br />
<br />
the chickens are on a 6 minute respawn timer. remember this. <br />
<br />
ok the rest of the raid is now here, your first target is the 2 drakes at the bottom of aary steps, just bring to raid and kill then move the raid down to where they were - you have ~72 minutes from the first death of the drake til they respawn. <br />
<br />
Eashan of the Sky is your first target, he has 4 guards, the key is,, get him alone, using a bio orb or range item aggro eashan then run up ramp with a tagger fd about 1/3rd down the corridor,,, and then just play tag with him until he is solo, eashan is basically vindicator with an ae. do not let ANYONE drop below 40% hp and you are fine, keep the main tank alive (3-5 sec per heal depending on your warriors ac/hp) keep eashan on main tank and kill. -Eashan cannot be slowed. <br />
<br />
Ikitar - similar to eashan but no AE.. for him run out back towards the hub and he is by the stairs on the east side, just open door then book it for the raid pop stone stance and FD about halfway down the corridor towards eashan area - have a fd monk in aggro range <br />
then between the 2 monks play pop and drop with iki slowly working your way up the ramp until he gets up there solo. warrior tags iki and its vindicator fight again - Ikitar cannot be slowed. <br />
<br />
eashan and iki tend to be the hardest of all the named to do. my old guild had more trouble with eashan than we did with vyemm <br />
<br />
Aaryonar - First thing you need todo is clear eashan's room of the 4 drakes there. they are fairly wimpy. second clear ALL the minidrakes, assign a group to kill them on repop, with cleric and shaman in group. <br />
<br />
third, clerics go about halfway down the ramp in preparation and ALL clerics MUST have an instant click item. aaryonars AE is a mana drain/atk drain but it is bugged in that even if you are not hit with it, it &quot;fake&quot; affects your mana bar, instant clickies fix the bug. <br />
<br />
warrior get fully buffed mr cr/fr and have the MT make a hotkey for the AE. <br />
<br />
the MONK with a 250 range throwing weapon goes up the stairs, once making sure there are no Flurry drakes in aggro range, throws the javelin and immediatley starts backing up. about halfway to the raid, but still out of aggro range of mt Feign(rapid feign makes this part easier) then as he is walking back, GEt up again back up and then feign again, this time ON the warrior when aary gets there - keep your fd button down and keep fding after each ae, hope for no failure messages since the goal is to let his pets go home. this works ~90% of the time in getting aary alone. <br />
<br />
assuming aary is alone, warrior- 3/4 seconds between heals, the warrior alone attacks aary for several second to get good aggro and then the debuffers go in right after an ae. full debuffs and get SLOW on aary, once slowed all but 2 clerics drop out of the rotation and heal as needed. once slowed all melee start attacking aary. all players MUST stay over 40% hp, if you are at that get out of the fight and get healed-making sure aary is NOT on you. this is key for ALL fights, <br />
<br />
if you get to about half hp, GET OUT OF THE FIGHT AND AE - and wait for a heal <br />
<br />
the key to the ENTIRE AAry fight is,... slow aary and prevent the clerics getting hit by the AE. a good pin is ESSENTIAL if the clerics get hit by the AE you WILL lose the fight. <br />
if you get a pet with aary, have an sk or enchanter aggro the pet bring to the bottom of the ramp and kill. <br />
<br />
ok aary is dead, everyone runs to the stairs and do loot. pull aary's pets being careful to make sure there are no flurry drakes in aggro range when doing this. <br />
<br />
once the loot is done, drop into the aary pit - get comfy you will be here for a bit. going west you have vyemm, koi, mir going east you have feshlak dagarn and kriez. <br />
<br />
most people go right first. but before you do that you must clear the path <br />
<br />
there are 7 or 8 Flurry drakes(i forget which) - either NAMED drakes or drakes that their names are capitalized(A blah blah Defender), you have to clear them first. since you are going East you can ignore most of the drakes that come from the west - IF you choose to. the flurry drakes are just about the most difficult spawn in north to fight, you must be on the ball with quick heals cuz, the reason they are called flurry drakes is cuz they FLURRY - ALOT. <br />
pull them into the pit since if you are fighting in the pit you will not -usually- get adds. <br />
<br />
stay in the pit and pull pull pull, in between flurry pulls bring 1-2 normal drakes for dispatching. <br />
<br />
once you kill the flurries and the path to feshlak is clear, pull his pets , since he is rooted, its an easy split, kill them then move the raid to the entrance ot his lair. do the long range debuffs prior to engagement and have the MT start plinking him with arrows - just enough to get him to hate the warrior...send in the shaman for slow. or just send in the warrior and slow then, it doesn't matter all that much.. get slow on feshlak. 3-4 seconds per heal until slowed then ~8-10 after slowed the ae is hard to resist FR/CR based but just follow the stay over 40% hp for allmembers, spreading the clerics paladins druids and shaman out helps alot in this regard. <br />
<br />
ok feshlak is dead, time for dagarn, dagarn is a wurm, his ae's are the same as wurms, FR/CR- clear any drakes in the way, then send in the SK with harmshield - makes the pull a bit easier. SK aggros dagarn, does harmshield then runs for the main tank. monks can do it as well too if they find the right spot to toss a javelin from. but personally i find SK's do it better since they live, dagarn can EAT a monk in 3 seconds, its not pretty. <br />
<br />
CLERICS, in feshlaks lair there is a ledge on the right, the MT sets up on top of the ledge against the wall, ALL clerics/casters get shrunk and hug the ledge - it blocks the ae - again 3-4 seconds per heal until dagarn slowed. then 8-10 seconds. again 40% for all to get out of the fight(drop off the ledge) for heals <br />
<br />
dagarn dead, time to move the entire raid to dagarns spot. then clear to kriez... pull his pets, etc etc and move the raid to the top of his lair. looking down into his lair, there is a little nook on the right just before the floor - ALL clerics that is your spot for being - it blocks the ae - again predebuff from a distance - kriez's ae is a CR based stun with damage. kriez is not slowable. 3-4 seconds between heals, again same noone under 40% hp rule applies. <br />
<br />
Kriez dead, move everyone back up top and start clearing towards the back, moving the raid once you hit the intersection. <br />
<br />
Lord Koi - IS NOT ROOTED- clear to mir (she is straight ahead) then aggro one of koi's pets,,, setup raid just beyond the intersection at the corner, clerics behind the corner to get out of the ae. kill the pet, kill koi he is one of the easier ones - Slowable same basic tactics - <br />
<br />
lady mir -rooted - ae is a silence- all clerics go past her lair and there is a ridge - the ledge blocks the ae - again predebuff then head in - she is slowable. <br />
<br />
time to head to the back, head back to the intersection and take a left clear the path til you are at the ramps go up the right ramp and clear to the corridor heading to jor and nev. <br />
<br />
it is time for the triplets. pull and kill the 2 wurm guardians. <br />
<br />
clerics etc setup at the corner towards the ramp down warrior around the corner towards ramp. <br />
<br />
2 monks and a sk head up towards the triplets, monk 2 and sk stop at the tag spot, then the puller heads into 250 range weapon range of zlexak, throw the javelin and then backup to the designated tag spot, zlex will warp to you, you FD, the tagger immediately tags zlex and books it to the raid-popping voiddance or if SK using harmshield, you get zlex single this way 99% of the time. zlex's at is a 1250pt disease based ae. with slow, making the ifght longer than nec, heals will be 3-4 second until slow lands on zlex then the same tactics apply, keep ae off of clerics and keep everyone over 40% hp. <br />
<br />
repeat the pulling tactic for cek then just pull sev - fights are fairly easy both are slowable and need MR for resist. cek does chaotic weightlessness so its kinda fun. again 3-4 seconds until slowed. <br />
<br />
by now it should be about time for the 2 wanderers to repop, pull the corridor to jor/nev and wait for the wanderer repops then pull jor, <br />
<br />
the pin spot is the other wall where you fought the triplet arund the corner towards nev/jor - again same tactic - need cr for resist- keep clerics out of the ae, and keep everyone over 40%hp <br />
<br />
jor dead, time to head for nev, move everyone into the corridor, and most of the way down to nev, nev's AE is a BITCH to resist - whirl til you hurl. there are nooks on both the left and right. yo will be using the left nooks to get out of the ae - just beyond the corridor is another nook before nev, that is where the clerics go to avoid the ae. the MT must stay in heal range of this spot - do the normal predbuff, the first person will get charmed.. wait til it wears off -mt charges, nev is slowable <br />
<br />
this is probably the longest fight of them all, not due to the difficulty of the encounter but cuz of nevs AE- it is EXTREMELY hard to resist- get a bard in the mt group for resist song . <br />
<br />
for this fight LEAVE the fight and head for a back nook where the healing station is setup at 50% hp due to the fact you will get stunned atleast 1-2 times before making it. <br />
<br />
Lord Vyemm - ae is a knockback - pretty much unresistable/bugged in that even if you resist you get knocked back- so this fight is about position position position. get vyemm mad at someone without getting him into summon mode.. then the mt and clerics position themselves on the left wall iwth the clerics close to the mt and against the flattest wall there they are to be againt the wall then try to move backwards, if they do not move at all they are in a good spot-. 2-3 seconds per heal until slowed - Vyemm is DISEASE based slowable. melee and casters fight from behind vyemm- it is PARAMONT that vyemm faces a wall since the knockback pushes you AWAY from his face - thus if he is facing a wall, you get pushed into the wall. if he turns and you get tossed out - STAY STILL - if nothing aggros you in ~10 seconds, come back to the fight, if you get tossed into the lava, get magician wiht CoH to summon you out. the ae does no damage so unless you take falling damage from being slammed against the wall you don't need to worry about t hat, but again the 40%hp rule applies to all. always fight facing the back of vyemm and try to have a wall behind you incase he turns. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Congratualations, you have done north tov- get farming. i left a bit for you to figure out yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We used the above mentioned guide and found NToV to be very easy, 65's, AA's make it too easy IMO (and we are a casual raiding guild).  We just started about a month or two ago and on 3 trips have killed Aary flawlessly every time and 2-4 other named per trip.  Vyemm we are 1-1 on but were very close to winning the second time (beat him first attempt ever).  Basically a lot of people are bored of it already and we havent ever even killed everything yet.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the end game raiding zones of EQ.  VT is exactly the same, exciting the 1st time, dull the 2nd, mind meltingly dull the 3rd and so on.  Am sure that it is going to be the same once my guild gets into the Elementals too.</div></div><hr />
