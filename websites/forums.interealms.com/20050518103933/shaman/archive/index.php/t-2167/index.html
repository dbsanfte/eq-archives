<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello ....<br />
<br />
Few questions about torpor and how it stacks...<br />
<br />
<br />
It heals 300 hp per tick(a tick is 6 seconds) for 4 ticks (it can sometimes hit a fifth tick for an extra 300 heal). <br />
It snares you (reduces movement speed). <br />
It slows you (reduces attack speed by 35%). <br />
<br />
<br />
I know that the snare component overwrites all movement buffs (AA Run speed enhancement, jboots, sow, SOE, etc), but I have some questions about how the rest of it stacks:<br />
<br />
- how does the haste debuff stack with bard songs, monk epic haste, our own celerity, and speed of the shissar?<br />
<br />
- how does the heal-over-time stack with spells of the same nature like Celestial Healing and Celestial Elixer?<br />
<br />
- if I torpor a tank prior to the tank's aggro on a mob, the next tick of torpor will not place me on the mob's hate list, will it? I'm thinking specifically of naggy here. If I torpor the MT prior to his charge on naggy, the second or third tick of torpor won't suddenly get me banished will it? Ideally, I'd like to be able to Torpor once prior to charge, and again once the first version wears off. I know I will get banished when I cast it the second time, but it will still heal the MT.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help with these questions -- I searched the boards but couldn't find an answer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does not stack with any heal over time.  Which is the higher level one? Well, whatever it is, whichever is on first, Torpor or Celestial whatever goes, can't overwrite.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't torpor a tank right before a fight (a cleric, a caster sure).  Slowed tanks are terribly inefficient.  I like to keep them alive with torpor, but it's not my heal of choice for tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just to be clear; torpor doesn't OVERWRITE anything. After a torp, your tank won't have to ask for a haste again and he won't have to ask for sow again. It's just that during the duration, it is as if he doesn't have sow or haste. When the heal is up, the buffs will still be there.<br />
<br />
It stacks with Nature's Recovery, but that's about it. It'll overwrite Celestial Healing, but in my experience Celestial Elixir overwrites it every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For a Naggy raid, when you're talking level 52 warriors, it may make more sense to have an SK tank. Which is why I'm not too worried about haste -- SKs can hold aggro just fine with all those great dots and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>WhiteandBlack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hi soup:)<br />
The only real problem I see is you don't want to Torpor your MT before the charge because of the snare, thus you will have to Torpor him when he is the lair, and I don't think a &gt;52 character can even get that close.  I recall helping on several Naggy raids, for buffing, and I couldn't even get to the bridge before getting the boot.  You might have better luck Torporing a wizard on the fringe of the lair. /shrug  Either way it should be fun to find out the results:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, first time I was over 52 for a Naggy raid I tried to slow -- got right under the belly and gave it a shot... really a waste of a chance to make a difference. This time I'd like to do something that's worth getting kicked for. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Torpor overwrites celestial healing/cleansing, but not celestial elixir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Torpor has no issues with bard song EXCEPT their travel speed buffs.<br />
<br />
I can't make it stick when Selos Song of Travel or the 2.5 min duration Selos is on.  Not that it comes up too often.</div></div><hr />
