<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thordan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could at least trio the slowable wurms with a war, shm, clr maybe even duo with a war,shm. Back when the very first few guilds were in VP I went in with a pally/war/clr/wiz and we killed the first wurm. This was a long time ago, so if it can be done back then it can be done now easily. On a side note we have cleared VP with 14 people, I think we had like 5 mana burn wizards though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm sure one group can do it, but keep in mind that some wurms split in 2 when killed, and sometimes one can hit for 1500. Too make matters worse, wurms that spawn from other wurms will camp corpses and never despawn. They usually don't see invis though, so you can usually drag corpses away from them. Everything there has 2 minute respawn I believe, so you'd probably only be killing the one wurm over and over, with maybe a raptor pull from time to time.</div></div><hr />

Was just a hoax done by some of the moderators on Graffes for a laugh - got a heck of a lot of people hook, line and sinker :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was under the impression that the only way out of VP was to fight to the zoneout... no gate, TL or evac was possible. If this is so, then how can a group of 6 just &quot;be killing the one wurm over and over&quot;. Wouldnt' they have to fight the way to the exit? Or is there another way out or am I just hopelessly behind the times?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can rez out of vp. Meaning you die in vp, die out of vp, get rezzed in vp, loot, get rezzed out of vp. I wouldn't reccommend VP with 1 group. It can be done, but like was mentioned above, some wurms hit for 1500. Also, some wurms are naggy/vox clones with dispelling AEs and such. 2 groups can farm spells all day long. And VP is THE place to go for shaman spells - the drops are unbelievable.</div></div><hr />

If you don't have 2 clerics in VP:<br />
<br />
Leave real death corpses outside VP (preferrably in the same spot in a city for everyone), then when ready to leave (must be under 3 hours total time in VP) get rez'd out.  If you plan on staying longer than 3 hours you'll need to refresh the corpse before 3 hours by making a new corpse.<br />
<br />
If you have 2 clerics in VP:<br />
<br />
Bind in same location,  when ready to leave, one at a time: Take a real death in VP, take a real death at bind point, get rez'd into VP, loot gear, get rez'd out of VP.  Clerics need to work together to make sure they get rez'd in and out in proper order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is no need for real deaths...  <br />
<br />
You have to have an alt cleric/pally available for this:<br />
<br />
Bind in a city <br />
Die in the pvp arena<br />
Run back to arena<br />
DO NOT LOOT YOUR CORPSE OR PICK UP ANY ITEM<br />
Die in the arena again<br />
LOOT FIRST CORPSE<br />
<br />
Your second corpse is empty but will not decay for 1 week.<br />
<br />
Have alt pally/cleric revive your corpse in the arena when you are ready to leave VP.<br />
<br />
Leave that corpse and you can use it over and over again until decay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, that can be done, but GMs do consider it an exploit. So take care to at least drag them to an out of the way spot if you're going to do it that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rez timer on a non-xp death is 10 minutes.  Yes the corpse stays a week but you can't rez it after 10 mins.<br />
<br />
Very risky way of trying to do it, one LD or some goof up and you could be stuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">VP can easily be done by one group. There is a single group that on Drinal goes in almost daily and kills one named or another in there. <br />
<br />
They are all Manaburn wizards of course.</div></div><hr />
