<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sooda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry, Last noob question of the day from me.. I keep reading messages that talk about the &quot;Alpha&quot; pet or somesuch, What is that?<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When it was first discovered that we could give our pets two weapons and they would dual wield them we figured it was not working as intended and kept it pretty quiet. People refered to this as the Alpha project or Alpha pet when they talked about it. Since it is now fairly well known that we can do this and the people at sony probably know this is possible and know we know and have yet to nerf it you will see shamans talk about it a little more openly now. You will often see a shaman refer to their &quot;Alpha pet&quot; meaning they have given their pet two weapons.<br />
<br />
Ok now be prepared for the rush of parnoid shaman saying SHHHHHHH and move along nothing to see here.....</div></div><hr />
