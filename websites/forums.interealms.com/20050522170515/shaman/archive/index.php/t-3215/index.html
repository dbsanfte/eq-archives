<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is a reasonable belt upgrade from my current Spider Fur? I have about 5-10k to spend.  Looking to get some nice hp in this slot while still keeping high ac in it. (Kind of like Spider Fur ;)) I am a 59 Barbarian, on CoV/Coldain faction if that matters.  Look at magelo for my current ac/hp/mana status. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">artificers ringmail belt, ac 15 wis 5 hp/mana 40,<br />
get 6 blue diamonds and 5k and you probably will get them to say yes.  Dont lowball it off the bat though, otherwise they might just up it out of spite.<br />
<br />
first thing though, make sure you have a barbarian smith who is able to make it on your server =)</div></div><hr />

I'm 0 for 6 now, skill 201, trying bracers and belts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spider fur is pretty good.  Good belts are a raid effort it seems, like the Belt of Dorf Slaying...<br />
<br />
if you know a high level barbarian smith you might be able to work a deal with them for a Artificers Ringmail Belt.  <br />
Its ac15, 5wis, 40hp/mana.<br />
<br />
There is also the Walrus Fang Belt - ac15, hp50.<br />
I have never seen one sold on my server though, so I have no idea how much they are worth.  I know they weigh nothing so are an item monks like.<br />
<br />
Barbed Rubicite Belt from Cazic Thule is an upgrade.  Again, never seen one sold on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bone clasped Girdle, only 6ac but massive hp/mana, unfortunately 20k+<br />

Spider fur is good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">4 AC on Bone Clasped Girdle, but also has 7 sta as well as 75 hitpoints/mana.  It also has the focus effect that extends dot duration.  It will do until I get a Dain belt!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Chitinous Belt, Ac 13, 5 wis, some other stats (sorry for not having them available, but I am at work).  Usually about 3k, actual mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
Widda<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.  I am very happy with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Silvery Belt of Contention has been good to me... AC 10, WIS/INT 5, STA 4, and 21% haste. I wish it had some raw HP/Mana on it but heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, if you're on or want to be on Kromzek faction, Girdle of Reflection is not to bad.  12ac 6wis 35hp.<br />
<br />
It's a nice quest, can be done solo at 55+.  Best part is that you get a nice tour of Tower of Frozen Shadows.  I'd never been past the first floor before I did the quest.</div></div><hr />

I think this drops from a Disciple of Thule in the Throne Room.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure of the rarity, but I haven't seen a belt for sale on my server yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Will try to get a guild group there to camp it, any other good drop or good exp there so I can lure them in? ;)</div></div><hr />

I'm not in the LEAST bit surprised that you are 0/6 at a meager 201 skill.<br />
<br />
All of the &quot;new&quot; cultural armors trivial above 250, with 201 skill your odds of success are 5%, or perhaps a point or two higher. You are wasting HUGE amounts of money (and blue diamonds) in even making the attempts with skill that low.<br />
<br />
I am collecting blue diamonds for when I can finally get skill up (I tried getting into the mid 220s before the skill nerf, but ran out of time :( )...I'm at 209 now, but even with a geerlok hammer, I do not intend on trying my first piece (which will be a BRACER...OMG do those thing rock) until I get my skill up to 220ish. Even with 250 skill and a geerlok, the across-all-servers game wide success rate is just under 50%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exp is CT is unbelievable.  I'm not sure what other loot drops there specifically, but there is a lot of good stuff dropping in CT.<br />
<br />
This is a serious zone, though.  Most of the stuff hits very hard (although it isn't super resistant).  CT is another good example of Verant's obsession with the holy trinity of Warrior/Cleric/Enchanter.  It's not impossible to get by without them (last night we did LTR with a monk as main tank and a bard for mez/mana regen and it worked out fine) but it's harder.</div></div><hr />

easy quest, but thers some druid on Ab who farms chitinous gear&gt;&gt; he sold me a belt for 700p!<br />
<br />
ya caannay beeat that mr spock....</div></div><hr />

Drops off the named Vampire on 1st floor of Vamp Castle in Tenebrous Mts. not a bad belt at all IMO.<br />

Definately agree on the xp.  However, I've done LTR with a bard (59) for crowd control, and me &amp; a monk sat in the maze &amp; killed stuff for some time.  Spiritcallers would kill the dog off with the chain rains, but otherwise, we did fine.  You just have to be aware of whats going on... little mistakes can kill you fast.</div></div><hr />
