<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not the only one who's had an idea along these lines...a spell that increases the cast time of the target.  I've seen it suggested in posts here and there.<br />
<br />
SoE's already come up with it, for some of the curse traps in LDoN increase your casting time.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd like to see a new line of spell slows that increase casting time from 10% (lowest level version, 24) to 60% (highest level version, 63), and an alternate form that's only 50% slow but with a -30 resist penalty (level 64).  I'd also like to see an AE version that hits for 40% slow with a -30 resist penalty (level 58).<br />
<br />
So...what do you think?  Think this would be a useful spell?  Personally, I can see all sorts of uses for it, and I don't even raid.  A spell like this would probably be VERY useful in a raiding environment, given the high probability that the raid target is a caster on top of having procs and AE-style attacks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes it would be useful, because depending on the mob you want them casting more then meleeing. <br />
<br />
Likelyhood of us ever getting something like this? About the same as me winning the powerball drawing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think with this spell I could solo Rak.  Would be kinda overpowering in my opinion.  Especially for PvP if there is a significant resist modifyer to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just my guess but it would never land on a raid mob... just the way SoE thinks.<br />
<br />
Normally pulling mobs I would never mem it.  All mobs melee but not all mobs cast.  Hard LDoN the mobs hit for 990 in between casts.  You pray they spend their whole time casting so you dont take as much damage.  <br />
<br />
I really dont see extending their cast time by 60% doing much to change a fight.  Heh I started to go into numbers but it was just stupid and too much error. <br />
<br />
Personnally I'd never mem the spell but that's because I dont have enough spell slots for what I HAVE to cast already :/<br />
<br />
-Canna4-  Not going to take this down until there is an upgrade to the line<br />
-FA-  Gives each melee a 20% damage increase... would get lynched if I take it down<br />
-Turg-  Cant take it down... not allowed.<br />
-Q-  Goes hand in hand with C5 and topping off melee/ throwing on pets when they pet pull.  Best damn spell shaman get I'm not dropping it.<br />
-Tnargs-  It blows for healing power, but what else are we going to heal with?<br />
-Malos-  Need to Malos on the incoming and slow after one round or the MA gets splatted (unless you are a PoTime equiped person)<br />
-Root-  Went 65 levels w/o memming this hunk of crap and here I am finally using it in Hard Dungeons as CC<br />
-****- I always use my Nuke since Dots draw too much agro.  Dont have Bane yet but will when I get the Ruj pts.  Am I going to take away ANY damage potential I have so that I can slow the nuking of a mob?  AND it's useless on half the mobs because they are straight melee.<br />
<br />
Interresting idea in theory but I dont think it would ever work in practice.</div></div><hr />
