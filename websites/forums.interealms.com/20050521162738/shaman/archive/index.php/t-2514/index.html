<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been thinking about this for a very long time.  While talking to my monk friend last night, I decided to swap out my Lodizal Shell Shield for a Heirophant's Cloak.  I just can't argue with 75 hitpoints.  I'll use the shield on the way to Ssra and for resists (NToV).<br />
<br />
I'm interested to hear thoughts on this as many of you probably are in the same boat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heirocloak &gt; Lodi shield.<br />
<br />
I only use Lodi shield for EB and resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same thing here.  I use Heiro instead of Lodi.  I need the hps to be able to survive my own canni5 unbuffed.  Wish I was uber.  75 hp is a lot of hps, plus the 4 stam which makes it a 91 hp cloak for me.  That's hard to argue with.  More wis/ac just won't do the same thing for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Been wearing mine for months, wouldnt wear a lodi if you gave me one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">your kit is a mix and match affair rather than a discrete heiro &gt; lodi.<br />
<br />
i dropped my Heiro and wolf-callers helm, 10+19 ac and switched in Lodi shield and Fanlinkan hat. so i pick up roughly 6ac, boat load of resists, loosing only 25hps and 25 mana. the stats on the heiro cloak are irrelevant if you can max STA anyway.<br />
<br />
that tormax hat is on my shopping list though.<br />
<br />
Juggle your upgrades, keen an open mind, with the amount of kit out there these days, there isn't any 1 universally agreed upon utimate kit<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've always worn a heiro over lodi myself. <br />
<br />
The AC is trivial. The resists were kinda, sorta useful, but honestly on raids as long as your base resists are around 100, you'd have more than enough with bards around.<br />
<br />
So it comes down to the HPs. More HP = good.<br />
<br />
25 hp is the difference between a Heiro and any +100 hp cloak, it's almost not worth upgrading until I get a Shroud of Veeshan for the focus, or Cloak of the Sky for the +25 hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i just did a test profile on magelo...<br />
<br />
i've got a sphinx hide mantle (the one with lower wis), lodizal shell shield and chitinous belt.  i just might have to change those three items out for a matchless dragonwing mantle, hierophant cloak and walrus fang belt.  i'm working on replacing the split paw hide gloves with coldain - should be this week.<br />
<br />
hp: 1973, ac 971, wis 229<br />
to<br />
hp: 2207, ac 979, wis 216<br />
<br />
i also lose a bit of resists (lodi, mantle), but when you're not doing raids it doesn't matter :).  plus i have blue diamond crap anyway.<br />
<br />
hmmm..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I could get a bit more AC in some other slots I would bag the lodi for a Heiro cloak too.  75 hps +4 sta is a very nice combo.<br />
<br />
I just can't wear it without dropping below 1000ac, which is not something I want to do right atm.  The Lodi shield is also a big portion of my already feeble resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would definitely like some hps on a cloak but I also i am lazy and like having the perma eb item that i'm always wearing. I've got all my chars wearing an eb item now.<br />
<br />
It also helps that i'm over 2200hps unbuffed now with out wearing a hero cloak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
any particular reason you haven't ported up to PoS and traded your old mantle in for a new one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">wearing hiero here too, wouldn't wear lodi if I had it :P<br />
<br />
i've got enough ac, and i really don't need more negative agi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Using Dain cloak instead of Lodi. Spell Haste III is nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am wearing Hierophant's Cloak now too. I bagged my Lodizal Shell Shield since I got the cloak and only use Lodi for resists/EB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lodi sucks!  Lodi rots!  Lodi is worthless!!!!!<br />
<br />
/em mutters &quot;WTB Lodi cheap, anyone selling?&quot;  :)<br />
<br />
/em mutters &quot;WTB IGS cheap, too... ODS is sooooo much better, IGS rots!  IGS sucks!  Anyone got an IGS?&quot;  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think I will keep using the Lodi over a hiero.<br />
<br />
I dropped alot of Wis and resists when I bagged Sprinkler and started using Nev's left eye in primary for the effect.  With C3 I am only at 244 wis and down to each resist in the ~160 range.<br />
<br />
HP are not the end all be all everyone is making them out to be.  I have always strived for a good balance between mana/hp/ac and resists.  Right now I am running 2300hp range unbuffed, with each resist in the 160ish range and about 1250ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Talamay, while you were in the Bahamas working on your tan, VI upgraded some of our PoA quest items.  If you go back to the quest giver and talk to her about upgrading your shoulders, you'll get it back with 12 wis instead of 6.  That's the one I use 90% of the time while switching IGS in when I need some AC or PR/DR.<br />
