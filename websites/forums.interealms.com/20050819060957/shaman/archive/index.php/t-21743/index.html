<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As far as I know the neat Beastlord / Shadowknight ability to single pull using their pet is directly as a result of the fact that a mob will neither proximity aggro nor assist other aggroed mobs if the attacker is a green /con.<br />
<br />
If this is the case, can we not do the same using a lower level than usual pet??<br />
<br />
Consider the additional tools that we can bring to bear at level 65, for example, in a LDoN:<br />
<br />
1. Level 55 spell Spirit of Howler summons level 40 pet = green \con to any mobs in LDoN<br />
2. Use Spirit of Shrew (24 LDoN points?) to make puppy fast enough to not get killed on the way back from aggroing <br />
3. If worried about pet dying on pull and bringing room, cast Q as you send pet to pull - guarnateeing 4 - 8 ticks of 350pt mitigation giving plenty of time for pet to get back to you <br />
4. With suspended Minion2, you could suspend your level 61 pet with buffs and alpharusties while you pull with greenypet - you can then /petgetlost the greeny and recall the good pet<br />
<br />
I see no reason why this will not work, but I had better do some research (damn - gonna have to blow 24 LDoN points!)...I shall report back on how this goes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that sounds viable, its been a very very long time since I played a real pet class though. keep us up to date :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shadowknights have the ability to pull with their pets thanks to a skill of theirs BLs do not have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Problem with BL / Shaman pet pulling is that if the low con pet dies on the way back you get aggro.  <br />
<br />
An SK or necro feigns before sending in the pet to greenie-pull, so if the pet dies aggro doesn't transfer.<br />
<br />
You'll want Pet Hold discipline too, to try this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I understand the SK feign death thing, but i duo a lot with a BL and he is an excellent A1 puller...and he cant FD. I think we should be able to do what BL does, only better...im about to log on and try - ok i dont have spare AA for suspended minion right now, but gonna try anyway...watch this space</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman can pet pull using a lower level pet.  Its not always easy, because mini-dogdog is stupidly fragile, and, as has been noted already, bad things happen if he dies.<br />
<br />
Its more of an art than a science, really, although buffing the poor thing helps quite a bit.  I started using pet pulls for the BiC quest key drop with the horde of stonemites that pop out of the &quot;fake corpse&quot; in Riwwi.  Soloing that got me convinced the technique was at least viable.  I've since used it elsewhere, including Mischief and some of the nastier LDoN rooms (especially in Takish) when we have no crowd control (I do a lot of 3-4 man LDoN runs, so 6 pulls are not prudent with no chanter).  I don't recommend it on LDoN hard ... mini-dogdog isn't quite made of stern enough stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As recenly as yesterday I have seen a non-feign death capable pet caster pull this trick off. As most of you may know, the trick i best done by a FD SK/necro with a lower level pet (the level 49 necro pet is the best choice) and they will single pull most camps like 95% of the time. Yesterday a mage friend of mine was using the pet storage AAs to pocket his &quot;good pet&quot; and was using a lower level (green to me) pet to pull in a LDON hard....he would /pet go away and then pop out the good pet when the mob was in camp. Worked well too, I would bet that the level 55 pet spell, would work ok in a regular LDON (pretty sure it would be green to the mobs in a 65 normal...this is the key to the trick) bu would be a greasy smear on the wall in a hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The problem is that green Mage, BL or Necro pets would COMPLETLY own our green pet the same level. I do know 3 boxers who do LDoNs alone with this method though, although its usually an SK pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heck, I used this trick to single-pull scouts in ME while camping my VT key.  Much easier than trying to handle 3 at once plus whatever roaming trash adds along with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've been using this technique for single-pulling crowded rooms in Droga. I first cast lvl 61 pet, buff, equip, and suspend him. Then I cast lowest level pet and just buff with spirit of shrew. Then I Q him and send him in to attack. As soon as he engages I back him off. With casters sometimes I have to back him off 3-4 times until the mob follows. As soon as I have the mob safely away from his friends I re-engage the low-level pet and start recalling the suspended pet. If low-level pet is still alive with 1 second to go on recall, I poof him.<br />
<br />
I just started doing this so I only have experience doing it in Droga. The key to success seems to be that the pulling pet must be green to the mob and the pet doesn't die during the pull.<br />
<br />
I tried this in the rat room in Forgotten Halls; the pet died immediately and the whole room came after me. That's when I found out where your corpse is dumped  :D . So it seems that if pet dies before mob moves to safe spot, aggro is transferred to you and it's just like a regular pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is the kind of good (nerfable, heh) info I've always come to the Crucible to find.  Good job.</div></div><hr />

I... I don't think he made it =(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I watched a mage do this successfully for a whole adventure. When I tried to duplicate with my own pet it didn't work; finally I know why. I thought the mage said he was using a clicky pet cast item, but I don't know what that would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is the kind of good (nerfable, heh) info I've always come to the Crucible to find.  Good job.<br />
Well I wouldnt worry too much. This has been a common, and well discussed, topic on both the necro and SK boards for years. They have attempted &quot;nerfs&quot; for a while but due to pets being non-aggro now unless commanded to be otherwise, I dont see how they could do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Been doing this for a while, but it does work much better for necros and sk's.  It's a great tool, but in most places where we really need a split, the dog will get evaporated almost instantly.</div></div><hr />

It works, and it works about as well as could have been expected. Basically, as outlined aove, tried this in SolC last night (Damn you, Spiritmaster Heilli, wheres my ring, you barstard son of a goat!).<br />
<br />
I don't have the suspended minion AAs yet, but was duoing with a BL which is more than enough firepower if greendog bought the farm. Just used Spirit of Howler with Shrew, andit worked fine - I found it did help to cast Q on pet and send pet just as Q lands - Q always lasts at least 5 ticks, and it really helps when pet takes the smack.<br />
<br />
I am not suggesting for a second that this technique is going to replace SK or BL pet pulling, but it is nice to know that the technique is viable for situations that would be tricky to single pull any other way, and you dont have a traditional pulling class.<br />
<br />
Sure, its usefulness will be limited to areas where mobs don't hit particularly hard or fast, but for normal LDoNs, I can see this being useful, because pickup grps are rarely the supposedly ideal mix</div></div><hr />
