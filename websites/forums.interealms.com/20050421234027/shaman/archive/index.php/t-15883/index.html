<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, i'm a 50 shaman with pretty nice equipment (upgrading leggings and tunic to Tae Ew at 51, compliments of a friend).  I have a very good friend who is a 52 monk.<br />
<br />
We're in a &quot;family&quot; type guild, but we do go places like Kael Arena, and the like.  <br />
<br />
Both of us now in our 50's and wondering where a good place for us to solo is.  One factor to take into consideration is loot and money drops.  Currently, my friend is working on a smith.  We are trying to get him funded so that he can make Heraldic armor (which sells very well on our server).<br />
<br />
So does anyone have ideas of a place that would give us both good expereince, AND decent cash?<br />
<br />
Thanks for everyone's imput</div></div><hr />

Monk can (if good enough) split to get single pulls and shaman can haste/buff/slow/debuff/heal/etc.  Dog is a little extra damage.  Zone isn't all that hard with that duo.  I've seen Ranger-Mage duos around that level rip sh*t up in there.</div></div><hr />

Im kinda in the same boat .. 53 shaman and 51 monk.  Can pretty much rip through most of The harbor .. <br />
Dulak is doable .. but very hard per kill.  <br />
PoJ might be interesting ... <br />
Seb ... way to far away ( I will wait to turn 65 and go farm there &gt;:(<br />
HS ... if you have an escape potion or a rogue ... wouldn't bother<br />
Chardok .. like seb.<br />
CoM closer than Seb ... but god help ya if you die .. <br />
ME .. like Dulak .. lots of HP for not so much xp .. and the trains happen every hour .. <br />
Kael .. resists suxx ( i seem to resist a lot in Kael)<br />
<br />
Finding a good spot is tough .. but remember as long as you getting someting your progressing ... back when my frist dinged 50 .. we didnt have these nice little % to gear what we were killing ... Just try to have fun and stop dicking around ... just find a spot and kill!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dulak is nice. I started out when my ranger was 53 and my shaman 51 douing there on the dandolak and made really good money and xp. Was getting about 7-8% an hour dou before the xp changes, would be more like 8-10% now probably. Made over 20kpp in like 2 weeks there from gems, runes, words, and cash loot, woulda made more if i had actually sold the weapons instead of letting them rot.( I tend to stay in a place like that until I'm good and done with it, and don't bother selling until I am good and done with it). Poj at your level has crap for loot. Os has decent loot and gems at your level but its gonna be tough dou there. Might wanna try nurga, decent loot and xp there also.</div></div><hr />
