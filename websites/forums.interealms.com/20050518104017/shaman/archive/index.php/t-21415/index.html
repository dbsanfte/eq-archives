<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rybit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently, the EverQuest II website (http://www.everquest2.com/) was updated with new spell information. Some creative ideas are at work. What is interesting is that more than one type of priest can cast resurrection (Legacy of the Eidolon) and that all priests will be able to mitigate damage, a buff castable on a playing character (Ethereal Ward), with the shaman class having ability to buff all members of the group with damage mitigation buff (Umbral Coterie). Effectively, the shaman class has been converted into a combat buffing class with the ability to resurrect members of a party. I suppose that instead of slowing a NPC, the shaman shall now choose two routes: (i) to become a caster of several damage mitigating battle buffs on a combatant, or to become a caster with ability to deal some formidable damage to a non-playing character. The Mystic class may receive ability to deal damage (which I believe is only proper). It remains to be seen how closely the EverQuest II shaman class will follow EverQuest I's shaman class.<br />
<br />
The class is described as to &quot;call upon the ancient spirits of the land, using protective wards and healing to invigorate their comrades. They remove afflictions from their companions and turn the vile magic back upon the enemy.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Mystic class is described as those who &quot;seek a symbiotic connection with the spirits of their ancestors, petitioning them to bestow the power to heal the injured, invigorate the weak, and enhance the capabilities of their allies when on the field of battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Defiler class is described as those who &quot;enslave the spirits of their ancestors, harvesting and corrupting their power to use against enemies. This stolen energy can also be used to heal and boost the capabilities of the defiler's allies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Any shaman will be able to use a Spear, Flail, Hammer, Mace, Staff, Sling, or Thrown Weapon and wear medium Brigandine armor. While the defiler class key knowledge will be in Vehemence, the Mystic key knowledge will be in Fetishisms. Both will share Sphere of Power as their secondary key knowledge. Shamans also have a base knowledge of Talismans and Malisons. The Priest class overall has a key knowledge of Inspirations and Judgments. <br />
<br />
I was a little worried at first when I heard that mitigation buffs would not be exclusive to the shaman class, but this allows the shaman to pick up a different niche. Maybe we might develop some interesting skills. Who knows, the shaman may still be the premere debuffer. Only  time will tell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With EQII you can Alpha Test a brand new game instead of just expansions tho, pretty good upgrade IMO :rolleyes: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wait Spraggon - I thought we on the live servers were the Beta testers not the Alpha testers? Have I got my &quot;Idea to server&quot; sequence mixed up?<br />
<br />
I have to be honest - I'm seeing about the same level of exitement over EQ 2.0 as I am to a  Wham  reunion. Yeah it took us (the consumer) awhile to figure out what they were about - but we don't need to be seeing any more of it and I sure ain't gonna pay for it.<br />
<br />
(Although, I did buy that stupid  Faith  album because an ex G/F liked making whoppee to it. Personally I preferred the Beastie Boys - but she didn't take off her clothes to that.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Damn you Faern!!!<br />
<br />
I can't get bloody young guns out of my head now...<br />
<br />
I'm leaning towards trying a scout, rather than playing a shaman. They seem to offer more than the two routes you can take with shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Once again...why would I want to play EQ 2 and choose 50% of my abilities? With EQ, I get to buff AND debuff.<br />
<br />
 Dead on.  In EQ2 it looks like they split up our abilities and now instead of having 1 class that can be open and useful at many things, you now have 2 classes that are very narrow and limited in what they do.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Im less and less impressed with EQ2. The models completely suck for barbs and dark elves. They made the stupid rats playable, which is the lamest choice of all the NPC races in the game and now they are dismantling the shaman and spliting him into 2 classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had high hopes for EQ2 in the begining, but i no longer do. Good ting there are a ton of games on the horizon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm glad they are making EQ 2 different.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I won't play a Shaman in EQ 2, because it may no longer represent the style of play I desire.  I am not so tied to a name as to dismiss the game because the Shaman in EQ 2 isn't as flexible as the EQ 1 Shaman.<br />
<br />
Either way, I'll probably play EQ 2, though what class, who can say?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This looks very much like the DAOC model where you do one thing and do it well, rather than crappy at alot of things. That will suit some and not others I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it has to be said that if the shaman stayes as it is in eq2, it unlikely anyone would want to play them, most the other preist class can do the same sort of thing but look more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Once again...why would I want to play EQ 2 and choose 50% of my abilities? With EQ, I get to buff AND debuff.<br />
<br />
I don't know - being a generalist has not worked for shamans at the high end of the game now, perhaps doing fewer things well has potential...<br />
<br />
But I am not convinced I will be a shaman in my next life anyway.  If I wanted to be a cleric, I would create a cleric.  And the concept of a defiler leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  What little Roleplay left in me has a hard time getting comfortable going from a character who worked with spirits to one who corrupts them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if you look at all the classes, they mixed up alsort of stuff, defiler sounds like should a necro, druid get wis and agil buffs,  all preist are much more similar than disimilar( which to some degree is good, but i think they went to far) with damge or buff versions. which sounds very boring to me, everyone will just go for the damage types as they are more fun.<br />
<br />
if they do their testing right you will see alot of chnages i think. but then again, when have soe every done that?<br />
<br />
my feeling is that the poeple doing this are just making a game and dont really have a feel for what they are doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">. They made the stupid rats playable, which is the lamest choice of all the NPC races in the game . Good ting there are a ton of games on the horizon.<br />
<br />
I kinda like the idea of evil rats as a playable race.  Better than frogs, anyway.  :p   Anyone else remenber the ratkins in Wizardry?<br />
<br />
They missed the mark when they didn't make otters playable!<br />
<br />
LOL look at the high hopes we had when Horizons was on the horizon - and what it turned out to be... at least EQ has enough of a track record that we still read about it...</div></div><hr />

I'd pay 100 bucks for an EQ where I could be a fairy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Taladorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Seems like a mix of current cleric and necro abilities.

<br />
EQ2 seems to me that they should have named it something different.  I realize that the story evolves off of the destruction of Luclin, but they are taking so many ideas from EQ, WoW, SWG, and DAoC....maybe they should have just started a new lore.  It will definitely set up long time EQ'ers for disappointment giving it the name EQ IMO.  I don't think EQ2 can fill the shoes of the original in any capacity other than graphics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>horaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Here's a bit more information on the classes we've been compiling for easy reference.<br />
<br />
Quick Reference Sheet (http://ebonlore.org/eq2.htm)<br />
<br />
You can also visit Ebonlore.org to see ... lots of preview videos, etc. If you are interested in EQII. If you're not, then why are you reading this thread? ^_^<br />
<br />
Myself, I'm all for a &quot;different&quot; game. Which EQII obviously is. It's not Everquest, and I've been looking for something to fill the gap that quitting EQ left.<br />
<br />
 As for Priests and spells. A lot has changed. All priests now have the ability to resurect in some form or another. We can probably expect a few modifications to the spells, and obviously a healthier list than what's already been announced. Evil Shaman, DO get the ability to buff and DEBUFF. Same with the goodly aligned ones. Don't think you're getting short changed.<br />
 The idea is to make a good and evil version that are &quot;unique&quot;. Which really makes sense if you read much into historical precedences of Shaman. You have the medicine man and the witch doctor basically. Both are pretty much capable of the same or atleast similar things. However, but both have their general tendancies toward on end of the spectrum.<br />
 So, if you're more into the curses, dots, debuffs etc. You'd be a Defiler. If you're more into being a healer, buffer, etc. Then you'd be a Mystic. Either way, doesn't mean you lack the capabilities of the other. Just those abilities are less pronounced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
After seeing what I have I have seen of what they have planned for EQ2 I just have to laugh my frickin *ss off over this one.<br />
<br />
Next to EQ2 EQ is a skinny little girl looking for bread crumbs that are dropping from Jabba the Huts meal.  EQ2 being jabba.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thinks it's too early to judge what the shaman class will become right now. I think Horaxe's view on shamans specializing in the &quot;witch doctor&quot; path and &quot;medicine man&quot; route are exactly what the defiler and mystic are.<br />
<br />
My question is, will we be slowing the mob or will be casting a damage mitigation combat buff on a PC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">from what i understand evil and goood shaman will be really no different. the spells are called different things and different resist but they will be the same.  evil deals in poison nd deseae good will be cold and fire. least that the differnce between good and evil wizards. i think you`ll find the same for shaman.... thats the problem good and evil wont be different. least no in any real sense. hences there really only 12 classes in eq 2. plus the artisan classes which some crap too, everyone will have to make one to fix all the gear, if they made the trades fun that be ok but i not holding my breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">plus the artisan classes which some crap too, everyone will have to make one to fix all the gear, if they made the trades fun that be ok but i not holding my breath.<br />
<br />
Actually, you will be able to be an Artisan with any character.  So you will be able to both adventure and craft.  Both will be seperate (level wise) from each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Seems like a mix of current cleric and necro abilities.

<br />
<br />
<br />
Its confirmed. We are a Necro Cleric Hybrid.  Yay.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually, you will be able to be an Artisan with any character.  So you will be able to both adventure and craft.  Both will be seperate (level wise) from each other.<br />
<br />
yes i noticed they changed that after i posted. though i not sure you can do the higher trades aswell or if you just get the basic skills?<br />
<br />
if you think about it a shaman is very necro like , where as necro plays with the dead, shaman play with the souls , which is a noticeable difference but can cause the same effects. So we are not really as cleric /necro.  Just that we can do things like a necro but in a different way? (if that makes sense?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Since I feel like rambling and commenting on this light/dark path discussion...<br />
<br />
The Q'ero (Peruvian) Shamanic tradition instructs about three paths:<br />
<br />
 Campo Gandero, in the Uhu Pacha, the under (or inner) realm, the left side of the mesa, the path of the Magician;<br />
 Campo Medio in the Kay Pacha, the here/now realm, the center of the mesa, the path of the Shaman (or Healer); and<br />
 Campo Justiciero in the Hanaq Pacha, the above (or outter) realm, the right side of the mesa, the path of the Mystic.<br />
Obviously, Shamanic teachings extol the virtues of the Middle Way, being present in the here and now, as opposed to being too focused on the inner or outer ways.<br />
<br />
That being said, yes, anyone can choose to work for the good of the planet (Pacha Mama) or for more selfish goals - hence the &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; connotations apply for those on any of the paths.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you're interested, my chart of the Q'ero Mesa is at http://morelight.org/mesa/mesa1.gif</div></div><hr />
