<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jlumpkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I camped The second floor for over 3 hours and never saw channeler. Did this quest change or am I looking in wrong place? Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zukiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've done the Channeler a few months ago, and doubt they've changed it since. All ya gotta do is stay in the Shakle room (#2 on eqatlas map) and kill everything you see in that room, and evetually he'll pop. Didn't keep trake as to how long it took to get him to Spawn, but I do remeber it being quite some time. I wouldn't concider him a rare spawn, more just based on luck, so keep at it, and good luck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just camped him, he spawned within 30 mins. Only spawns in one room tho, make sure thats where you are. In fact, i believe the Eq Atlas map (website) shows and labels the room as having him as a spawn. Dont know if i got lucky on spawn time or not tho.</div></div><hr />
