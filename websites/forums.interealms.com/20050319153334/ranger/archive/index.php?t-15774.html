<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vivax</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen three types of endgames:<br />
<br />
EQ1:  ever-larger groups of characters are needed to cope with the endgame mobs.  This quickly causes a tradition of waiting during the organization of a raid as long as the actual raid takes.<br />
<br />
AC2:  ever-increasing character levels and mobs (via patches), and some PvP (depending on server).  There basically is no endgame.<br />
<br />
PvP MMORPG's:  ever-larger groups of characters are needed to have a chance of winning against the opponent's ever-larger groups of characters.  The games I've seen in this category all have caps on character level.<br />
<br />
First, should there be further choices?<br />
<br />
Second, is AC2's &quot;no max level&quot; a desirable end-result?  Or perhaps EQ1's &quot;max level but that max will be raised via expansions&quot; is the best way to keep lower-level characters from falling too terribly far behind?<br />
<br />
Personally, I like the &quot;no max level&quot; concept, but if it's a PvP game, then (being semi-blue), there should be some way to keep extremely-high-level chars from eating a steady diet of newbies.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AC2 has a max level of 50. Maybe you are thinking of AC?<br />
<br />
AC2 will be raising their level cap the same way that Verant does, through subsequent updates at times they think the population is ready for it.<br />
<br />
Of more interest to me would be more encounters like those found in POP - where a max limit on the number participating is made.<br />
<br />
Thus taking Vox at level 52 may require alot of thought and exactly 4 well balanced groups instead of 60 people in a zerg rush.</div></div><hr />
